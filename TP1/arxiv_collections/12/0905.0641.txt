Local hidden variables theories didn't succeed to explain the correlations
revealed by entanglements. It is obvious that the explanation of the
correlations stands in non-local effects, but nobody has ever detected any
carriers that travel with superluminal velocity s.t. they could candidate for
some superluminal connection between distant particles, in order to adjust the
results to the correlations. This text explains that the role of creating the
correlations is played by what is called here the "Negative". This is the part
that was removed from the wave function of the independent particles, in order
to obtain the entanglement. As it is shown here, for du-particle experiments
the Negative consists in du-particle wave-packets. They enter both regions
where the particles are tested, s.t. the Negative "knows" the response given by
one particle, and erases the possibilities of forbidden responses from the
other particle.
