We consider the dynamics of a movable mirror (cantilever) of a cavity coupled
through radiation pressure to the light scattered from ultracold atoms in an
optical lattice. Scattering from different atomic quantum states creates
different quantum states of the scattered light, which can be distinguished by
measurements of the displacement spectrum of the cantilever. We show that for
large pump intensities the steady state displacement of the cantilever shows
bistable behaviour. Due to atomic back-action, the displacement spectrum of the
cantilever is modified and depends on the position of the condensate in the
Brillouin zone. We further analyze the occurrence of splitting of the normal
mode into three modes due to mixing of the mechanical motion with the
fluctuations of the cavity field and the fluctuations of the condensate with
finite atomic two-body interaction. The present system offers a novel scheme to
coherently control ultracold atoms as well as cantilever dynamics.
