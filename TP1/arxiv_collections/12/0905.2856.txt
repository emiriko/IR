We consider a four-dimensional flat-space Friedman universe, which is filled
with two interacting ideal fluids (the coupling of dark energy with dark matter
of special form). The gravitational equations of motion are solved. It is shown
that in some cases there appears a periodic universe with finite-time
cosmological singularities and also the universe becomes static in the remote
future.
