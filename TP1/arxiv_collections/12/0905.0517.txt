The chaos in stellar systems is studied using the theory of dynamical systems
and the Van Kampen stochastic differential equation approach. The exponential
instability (chaos) of spherical N-body gravitating systems, already known
previously, is confirmed. The characteristic timescale of that instability is
estimated confirming the collective relaxation time obtained by means of the
Maupertuis principle.
