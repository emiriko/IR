In order to investigate the universality of magnetic turbulence in space
plasmas we analyze seven time periods in the free solar wind of different
origin, slow or fast, and under different plasma conditions. The orientation of
magnetic field to the flow velocity was always quasi-perpendicular. Unique
combination of three instruments on Cluster spacecraft which operate in
different frequency ranges give us the possibility to resolve spectra up to 300
Hz. We show that spectra measured under different plasma conditions have a
similar shape. Such a quasi-universal spectrum consists of three parts: two
power laws and an exponential domain. At MHD scales, Kolmogorov's law $\sim
k^{-5/3}$ is found. At scales smaller than the ion characteristic scales, a
$k^{-2.8}$ law is observed. At scales $k\rho_e\sim (0.1-1)$, where $\rho_e$ is
the electron gyroradius, the magnetic spectrum follows an exponential law
$\exp(-k^{1/2})$, indicating the onset of dissipation. This is the first
observation of an exponential magnetic spectrum in space plasmas. We show that
among several spatial kinetic plasma scales, the electron Larmor radius plays
the role of a dissipation scale in space plasma turbulence.
