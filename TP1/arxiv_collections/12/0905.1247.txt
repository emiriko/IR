We propose a scheme for preparing and stabilizing the Pfaffian state with
high fidelity in rapidly rotating 2D traps containing a small number of bosons.
The goal is achieved by strongly increasing 3-body loss processes, which
suppress superpositions of three particles while permitting pairing. This
filtering mechanism gives rise to reasonably small losses if the system is
initialized with the right angular momentum. We discuss some methods for tuning
3-body interactions independently of 2-body collisions.
