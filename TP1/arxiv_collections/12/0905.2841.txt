In the present paper we summarize our results on the structure function g_1
and present explicit expressions for the non-singlet and singlet components of
g_1 which can be used at arbitrary x and Q^2. These expressions combine the
well-known DGLAP-results for the anomalous dimensions and coefficient functions
with the total resummation of the leading logarithmic contributions and the
shift of Q^2 -> Q^2 +
  \mu^2, with \mu/\Lambda_{QCD} approx 10 (approx 55) for the non-singlet
(singlet) components of g_1 respectively.
  In contrast to DGLAP, these expressions do not require the introduction of
singular parameterizations for the initial parton densities. We also apply our
results to describe the experimental data in the kinematic regions beyond the
reach of DGLAP.
