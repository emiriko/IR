We show how the excursion set moving barrier model for halo abundances may be
generalized to the local non-Gaussian f_{nl} model. Our estimate assumes that
the distribution of step sizes depends on f_{nl}, but that they are otherwise
uncorrelated. Our analysis is consistent with previous results for the case of
a constant barrier, and highlights some implicit assumptions. It also clarifies
the basis of an approximate analytic solution to the moving barrier problem in
the Gaussian case, and shows how it might be improved.
