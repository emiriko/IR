The two-point angular correlation function is a traditional method used to
search for deviations from expectations of isotropy. In this paper we develop
and explore a statistically descriptive three-point method with the intended
application being the search for deviations from isotropy in the highest energy
cosmic rays. We compare the sensitivity of a two-point method and a
"shape-strength" method for a variety of Monte-Carlo simulated anisotropic
signals. Studies are done with anisotropic source signals diluted by an
isotropic background. Type I and II errors for rejecting the hypothesis of
isotropic cosmic ray arrival directions are evaluated for four different event
sample sizes: 27, 40, 60 and 80 events, consistent with near term data
expectations from the Pierre Auger Observatory. In all cases the ability to
reject the isotropic hypothesis improves with event size and with the fraction
of anisotropic signal. While ~40 event data sets should be sufficient for
reliable identification of anisotropy in cases of rather extreme (highly
anisotropic) data, much larger data sets are suggested for reliable
identification of more subtle anisotropies. The shape-strength method
consistently performs better than the two point method and can be easily
adapted to an arbitrary experimental exposure on the celestial sphere.
