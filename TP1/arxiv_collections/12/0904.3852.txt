We report the results of spectral and temporal variability studies of the
ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) contained within the interacting pair of
galaxies NGC 4485/4490, combining Chandra and XMM-Newton observations. Each of
the four separate observations provide at least modest quality spectra and
light curves for each of the six previously identified ULXs in this system; we
also note the presence of a new transient ULX in the most recent observation.
No short-term variability was observed for any ULX within our sample, but three
out of five sources show correlated flux/spectral changes over longer
timescales, with two others remaining stable in spectrum and luminosity over a
period of at least five years. We model the spectra with simple power-law and
multi-colour disc black body models. Although the data is insufficient to
statistically distinguish models in each epoch, those better modelled (in terms
of their chi^2 fit) by a multi-colour disc black body appear to show a
disc-like correlation between luminosity and temperature, whereas those
modelled by a power-law veer sharply away from such a relationship. The ULXs
with possible correlated flux/spectral changes appear to change spectral form
at ~2 x 10^39 erg s^{-1}, suggestive of a possible change in spectral state at
high luminosities. If this transition is occurring between the very high state
and a super-Eddington ultraluminous state, it indicates that the mass of the
black holes in these ULXs is around 10-15 M_solar.
