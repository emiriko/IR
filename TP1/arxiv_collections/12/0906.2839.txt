The process $ep \to e^{\prime}p^{\prime}\pi^0$ has been measured at $Q^2$ =
6.4 and 7.7 GeV/c$^2$)$^2$ in Jefferson Lab's Hall C. Unpolarized differential
cross sections are reported in the virtual photon-proton center of mass frame
considering the process $\gamma^{\ast}p \to p^{\prime}\pi^0$. Various details
relating to the background subtractions, radiative corrections and systematic
errors are discussed. The usefulness of the data with regard to the measurement
of the electromagnetic properties of the well known $\Delta(1232)$ resonance is
covered in detail. Specifically considered are the electromagnetic and
scalar-magnetic ratios $R_{EM}$ and $R_{SM}$ along with the magnetic transition
form factor $G_M^{\ast}$. It is found that the rapid fall off of the
$\Delta(1232)$ contribution continues into this region of momentum transfer and
that other resonances
