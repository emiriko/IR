The supernova remnant (SNR) RX J1713.7-3946 (also known as G347.3-0.5) is
part of the class of remnants dominated by synchrotron emission in X-rays. It
is also one of the few shell-type SNRs observed at TeV energies allowing to
investigate particle acceleration at SNRs shock.
  Our goal is to compare spatial and spectral properties of the remnant in X-
and gamma-rays to understand the nature of the TeV emission. This requires to
study the remnant at the same spatial scale at both energies. To complement the
non-thermal spectrum of the remnant, we attempt to provide a reliable estimate
for the radio flux density. In radio, we revisited ATCA data and used HI and
mid-infrared observations to disentangle the thermal from the non-thermal
emission. In X-rays, we produced a new mosaic of the remnant and degraded the
spatial resolution of the X-ray data to the resolution of the HESS instrument
to perform spatially resolved spectroscopy at the same spatial scale in X- and
gamma-rays. Radial profiles were obtained to investigate the extension of the
emission at both energies.
  We found that part of the radio emission within the SNR contours is thermal
in nature. Taking this into account, we provide new lower and upper limits for
the integrated synchrotron flux of the remnant at 1.4 GHz of 22 Jy and 26 Jy
respectively. In X-rays, we obtained the first full coverage of RX J1713.7-3946
with XMM-Newton. The spatial variation of the photon index seen at small scale
in X-rays is smeared out at HESS resolution. A non-linear correlation between
the X- and gamma-ray fluxes of the type Fx \propto Fg^2.41 is found.
