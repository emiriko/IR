Occurrence of surface ferromagnetism in inorganic nanoprticles as a universal
property not only explains many of the unusual magnetic features of oxidic thin
films, but also suggests its possible use in creating new materials, as
exemplified by multiferroic BaTiO3 nanoparticles. While the use of Mn-doped ZnO
and such materials in spintronics appears doubtful, it is possible to have
materials exhibiting coexistence of (bulk) superconductivity with (surface)
ferromagnetism.
