We present deep, wide-field, Ks-band (2.14 micron) images towards 87 southern
massive star formation regions traced by methanol maser emission. Using
point-spread function fitting, we generate 2.14 micron point source catalogues
towards each of the regions. For the regions between 10 degrees and 350 degrees
galactic longitude and galactic latitude +/- 1 degree, we match the 2.14 micron
sources with the GLIMPSE point source catalogue to generate a combined 2.14 to
8.0 micron point source catalogue. We provide this data for the astronomical
community to utilise in studies of the stellar content of embedded clusters.
