We present a calculation of the N to $\Delta$ electromagnetic transition
amplitudes using the method of QCD sum rules. A complete set of QCD sum rules
are derived for the entire family of transitions from the baryon octet to
decuplet. They are analyzed in conjunction with the corresponding mass sum
rules using a Monte-Carlo-based analysis procedure. The performance of each of
the sum rules is examined using the criteria of OPE convergence and
ground-state dominance, along with the role of the transitions in intermediate
states. Individual contributions from the u, d and s quarks are isolated and
their implications in the underlying dynamics are explored. Valid sum rules are
identified and their predictions are obtained. The results are compared with
experiment and other calculations.
