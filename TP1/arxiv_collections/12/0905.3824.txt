The magnetic field of the solar corona has a large-scale dipole character,
which maps into the bipolar field in the solar wind. Using standard
representations of the coronal field, we show that high-energy ions can be
trapped stably in these large-scale closed fields. The drift shells that
describe the conservation of the third adiabatic invariant may have complicated
geometries. Particles trapped in these zones would resemble the Van Allen Belts
and could have detectable consequences. We discuss potential sources of trapped
particles.
