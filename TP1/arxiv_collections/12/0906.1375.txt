We calculate simulated images of disks perturbed by embedded small planets.
These 10-50 M_Earth bodies represent the growing cores of giant planets. We
examine scattered light and thermal emission from these disks over a range of
wavelengths, taking into account the wavelength-dependent opacity of dust in
the disk. We also examine the effect of inclination on the observed
perturbations. We find that the perturbations are best observed in the visible
to mid-infrared. Scattered light images reflect shadows produced at the surface
of perturbed disks, while the infrared images follow thermal emission from the
surface of the disk, showing cooled/heated material in the shadowed/brightened
regions. At still longer wavelengths in the sub-millimeter, the perturbation
fades as the disk becomes optically thin and surface features become
overwhelmed by emission closer toward the midplane of the disk. With the
construction of telescopes such as TMT, GMT and ALMA due in the next decade,
there is a real possibility of observing planets forming in disks in the
optical and sub-millimeter. However, having the angular resolution to observe
the features in the mid-infrared will remain a challenge.
