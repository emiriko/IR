We point out the existence of finite charge and spin Hall conductivities of
graphene in the presence of a spin orbit interaction (SOI) and localized
magnetic impurities. The SOI in graphene results in different transverse forces
on the two spin channels yielding the spin Hall current. The magnetic
scatterers act as spin-dependent barriers, and in combination with the SOI
effect lead to a charge imbalance at the boundaries. As indicated here, the
charge and spin Hall effects should be observable in graphene by changing the
chemical potential close to the gap.
