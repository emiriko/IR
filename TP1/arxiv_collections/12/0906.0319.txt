Soliton strings in mode-locked lasers are obtained using a variant of the
nonlinear Schrodinger equation, appropriately modified to model power
(intensity) and energy saturation. This equation goes beyond the well-known
master equation often used to model these systems. It admits mode-locking and
soliton strings in both the constant dispersion and dispersion-managed systems
in the (net) anomalous and normal regimes; the master equation is contained as
a limiting case. Analysis of soliton interactions show that soliton strings can
form when pulses are a certain distance apart relative to their width.
Anti-symmtetric bi-soltion states are also obtained. Initial states mode-lock
to these states under evolution. In the anomalous regime individual soliton
pulses are well approximated by the solutions of the unperturbed nonlinear
Schrodinger equation, while in the normal regime the pulses are much wider and
strongly chirped.
