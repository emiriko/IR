We show that Derksen-Weyman-Zelevinsky's mutations of quivers with potential
yield equivalences of suitable 3-Calabi-Yau triangulated categories. Our
approach is related to that of Iyama-Reiten and Koszul dual to that of
Kontsevich-Soibelman. It improves on previous work by Vitoria. In the appendix,
the first-named author studies pseudo-compact derived categories of certain
pseudo-compact dg algebras.
