We investigate a simple arrangement of coupled harmonic oscillators which
brings out some interesting effects concerning creation of entanglement. It is
well known that if each member in a linear chain of coupled harmonic
oscillators is prepared in a ``classical state'', such as a pure coherent state
or a mixed thermal state, no entanglement is created in the rotating wave
approximation. On the other hand, if one of the oscillators is prepared in a
nonclassical state (pure squeezed state, for instance), entanglement may be
created between members of the chain. In the setup considered here, we found
that a great family of nonclassical (squeezed) states can localize entanglement
in such a way that distant oscillators never become entangled. We present a
detailed study of this particular localization phenomenon. Our results may find
application in future solid state implementations of quantum computers, and we
suggest an electromechanical system consisting of an array of coupled
micromechanical oscillators as a possible implementation.
