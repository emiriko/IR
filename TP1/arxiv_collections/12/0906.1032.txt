Quantum networks based on atomic qubits and scattered photons provide a
promising way to build a large-scale quantum information processor. We review
quantum protocols for generating entanglement and operating gates between two
distant atomic qubits, which can be used for constructing scalable atom--photon
quantum networks. We emphasize the crucial role of collecting light from atomic
qubits for large-scale networking and describe two techniques to enhance light
collection using reflective optics or optical cavities. A brief survey of some
applications for scalable and efficient atom--photon networks is also provided.
