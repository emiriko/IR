We review recent work on the phase behaviour of binary charged sphere
mixtures as a function of particle concentration and composition. Both size
ratios and charge ratios are varied over a wide range. By contrast to hard
spheres the long ranged Coulomb interaction stabilizes the crystal phase at low
particle concentrations and shifts the occurrence of amorphous solids to
particle concentrations considerably larger than the freezing concentration.
Depending on size- and charge ratios we observe upper azeotrope, spindle, lower
azeotrope and eutectic types of phase diagrams, all known well from metal
systems. Most solids are of body centred cubic structure. Occasionally
stoichiometric compounds are formed at large particle concen-trations. For very
low size ratios entropic effects dominate and induce a fluid-fluid phase
separation. As for charged spheres also the charge ratio is decisive for the
type of phase behaviour, future experiments with charge variable silica spheres
are suggested.
