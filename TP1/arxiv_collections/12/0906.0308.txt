Amongst the first physics results of the ATLAS detector at LHC will be an
analysis of Jpsi and Upsilon production. Even at low luminosity ATLAS will
quickly start improving on current quarkonia measurements providing world
leading results with around 10 pb-1 of data. The narrow quarkonia resonances
will also be used as tools for alignment and calibration of the trigger and
tracking systems.
