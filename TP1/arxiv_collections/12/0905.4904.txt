We introduce a fundamental theory for the kinetics of systems of classical
particles. The theory represents a unification of kinetic theory, Brownian
motion and field theory. It is self-consistent and is the dynamic
generalization of the functional theory of static equilibrium fluids. This
gives one a powerful tool for investigating the existence of ergodic-nonergodic
transitions near the liquid-glass transition.
