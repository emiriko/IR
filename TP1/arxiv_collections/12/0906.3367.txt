Peierls gap is analyzed in case of a two-dimensional lattice under the
influence of a magnetic field, in a tight-binding approximation. By using a
non-analytic class of potentials, such as the Kohmoto potential in the Harper
model, splitting effect occurs in the energy bands. In the metal-insulator
transition point, the charge carriers become separated due to their energy,
releasing and expanding the Peierls gap. As a result, the energy bands around
the Fermi level become localized in case of the electrons and delocalized
corresponding to the holes, since their energy become lowered. These facts are
supported by numerical investigations.
