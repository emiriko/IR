Mechanical Properties of Ni-Ti-Nb alloys with these conditions of
cold-drawing, non-vacuum heat treatment and vacuum heat treatment were measured
at low temperature, and Mechanical Properties of Ni47Ti44Nb9 alloys of
restricting recover was compared with the one of alloys of non-restricting
recover, and these rules of the mechanical performance between them was
analyzed. Experiment indicates that, mechanical Properties of vacuum heat
treatment's alloys was more excellent than the other two (non-vacuum heat
treatment and cold-drawing), and the stress curves of alloys of restricting
recover haven't the evident yield band, and the stress of alloys of restricting
recover was higher than the ones of alloys of non-restricting recover, but the
stress of alloys of restricting recover was lower than the ones of alloys of
non-restricting recover.
