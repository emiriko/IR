Photomultiplier tubes and avalanche photodiodes, which are commonly used in
quantum optic experiments, are sometimes referred to as threshold detectors
because, in photon counting mode, they cannot discriminate the number of
photoelectrons initially extracted from the absorber in the detector. We argue
that they can be called threshold detectors on more account than that. We point
out that their their functioning principle relies on two thresholds that are
usually thought unimportant individually in the context of EPR-Bell discussion.
We show how the combined effect of these threshold can lead to a significant
sampling selection bias in the detection of pairs of pulses, resulting in an
apparent violation of Bell inequalities.
