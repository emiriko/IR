An active control method of azo-polymer loaded surface plasmon-polaritons
(SPPs) wave with tightly focused 532nm laser is proposed and demonstrated in
this paper. Theoretical analysis and experimental results are consistent, which
confirm the validity of this method. The optically active control method has
the advantage of simple samples preparation, high spatial resolution and
selectively control of the SPPs wave. This optical control of SPPs wave method
has potential applications in integrated plasmonics.
