We present a straightforward embedding of quantified multimodal logic in
simple type theory and prove its soundness and completeness. Modal operators
are replaced by quantification over a type of possible worlds. We present
simple experiments, using existing higher-order theorem provers, to demonstrate
that the embedding allows automated proofs of statements in these logics, as
well as meta properties of them.
