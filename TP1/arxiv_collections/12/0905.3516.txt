The study of Standard Model (SM) physics is crucial at the LHC for several
reasons. Before any discovery can be claimed a detailed understanding of the
detectors should be reached and benchmark SM processes should be measured. A
precise measurement of the various parameters is needed as a consistency check
of the SM. Moreover, SM processes can be directly sensitive to new physics,
they will allow to test QCD predictions and measure PDFs and are backgrounds
for many new physics channels. In this report, the status of some analysis at
ATLAS and CMS is reported focusing on W and Z inclusive cross sections and on W
and top quark mass measurements. Expected results on early data are also shown.
