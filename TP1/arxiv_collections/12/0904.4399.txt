We compare femtosecond pump-probe experiments in Ni and micromagnetic
modelling based on the Landau-Lifshitz-Bloch equation coupled to a
two-temperature model, revealing a predominant thermal ultrafast
demagnetization mechanism. We show that both spin (femtosecond demagnetization)
and electron-phonon (magnetization recovery) rates in Ni increase as a function
of the laser pump fluence. The slowing down for high fluences arises from the
increased longitudinal relaxation time.
