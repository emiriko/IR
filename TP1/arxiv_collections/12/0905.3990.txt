Conditions for the validity of the quantum adiabatic approximation are
analyzed. For the case of linear Hamiltonians, a simple and general sufficient
condition is derived, which is valid for arbitrary spectra and any kind of time
variation. It is shown that in some cases the found condition is necessary and
sufficient. The adiabatic theorem is generalized for the case of nonlinear
Hamiltonians.
