Monte Carlo methods play an important role in scientific computation,
especially when problems have a vast phase space. In this lecture an
introduction to the Monte Carlo method is given. Concepts such as Markov
chains, detailed balance, critical slowing down, and ergodicity, as well as the
Metropolis algorithm are explained. The Monte Carlo method is illustrated by
numerically studying the critical behavior of the two-dimensional Ising
ferromagnet using finite-size scaling methods. In addition, advanced Monte
Carlo methods are described (e.g., the Wolff cluster algorithm and parallel
tempering Monte Carlo) and illustrated with nontrivial models from the physics
of glassy systems. Finally, we outline an approach to study rare events using a
Monte Carlo sampling with a guiding function.
