Recently reported observations of magnetar glitches and coincident X-ray long
term brightening events establish enough of a data base to indicate that the
brightening events are accompanied by glitches at their outset, and that they
are probably triggered by the same event that triggers the glitch. We suggest,
on the basis of various observational clues, that a) these are caused by energy
releases at depths below 100 meters, and b) the unpinning is due to global
mechanical motion triggered by the energy release, not by heat. Because
mechanical triggering of a glitch requires less energy than a detectable long
term X-ray brightening, the latter does not necessarily accompany every glitch,
but it is predicted, when it does occur, to be heralded by a glitch. Crustal
oscillation associated with the mechanical energy release may cause short ($\ll
10^3$s) flares.
