This article is the continued version of the analytical blowup solutions for
2-dimensional Euler-Poisson equations \cite{Y1}. With extension of the blowup
solutions with radial symmetry for the isothermal Euler-Poisson equations in
$R^{2}$, other special blowup solutions in $R^{2}$ with non-radial symmetry are
constructed by the separation method. We notice that the results are the first
evolutionary solutions with non-radial symmetry for the system.
  Key words: Analytical Solutions, Euler-Poisson Equations, Isothermal, Blowup,
Non-radial Symmetry, Line Source or Sink
