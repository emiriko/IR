Let $\mathcal{I}_{d_1,d_2}$ and $\mathcal{C}_{d_1,d_2}$ be the algebras of
joint invariants and joint covariants of the two binary forms of degrees $d_1$
and $d_2.$ Formulas for computation of the Poincar\'e series
$\mathcal{PI}_{d_1,d_2}(z),$ $ \mathcal{PC}_{d_1,d_2}(z)$ of the algebras is
found. By using these formulas, we have computed the series for $d_1,d_2 \leq
20.$
