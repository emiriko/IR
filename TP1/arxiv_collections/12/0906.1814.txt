KNN is one of the most popular classification methods, but it often fails to
work well with inappropriate choice of distance metric or due to the presence
of numerous class-irrelevant features. Linear feature transformation methods
have been widely applied to extract class-relevant information to improve kNN
classification, which is very limited in many applications. Kernels have been
used to learn powerful non-linear feature transformations, but these methods
fail to scale to large datasets. In this paper, we present a scalable
non-linear feature mapping method based on a deep neural network pretrained
with restricted boltzmann machines for improving kNN classification in a
large-margin framework, which we call DNet-kNN. DNet-kNN can be used for both
classification and for supervised dimensionality reduction. The experimental
results on two benchmark handwritten digit datasets show that DNet-kNN has much
better performance than large-margin kNN using a linear mapping and kNN based
on a deep autoencoder pretrained with retricted boltzmann machines.
