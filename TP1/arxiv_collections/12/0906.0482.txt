A highly polydisperse granular gas is modeled by a continuous distribution of
particle sizes, a, giving rise to a corresponding continuous temperature
profile, T(a), which we compute approximately, generalizing previous results
for binary or multicomponent mixtures. If the system is driven, it evolves
towards a stationary temperature profile, which is discussed for several
driving mechanisms in dependence on the variance of the size distribution. For
a uniform distribution of sizes, the stationary temperature profile is
nonuniform with either hot small particles (constant force driving) or hot
large particles (constant velocity or constant energy driving). Polydispersity
always gives rise to non-Gaussian velocity distributions. Depending on the
driving mechanism the tails can be either overpopulated or underpopulated as
compared to the molecular gas. The deviations are mainly due to small
particles. In the case of free cooling the decay rate depends continuously on
particle size, while all partial temperatures decay according to Haff's law.
The analytical results are supported by event driven simulations for a large,
but discrete number of species.
