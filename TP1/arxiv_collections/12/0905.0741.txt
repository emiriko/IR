Results of 2005-2007 campaign of measurement of the optical turbulence
vertical distribution above Mt. Maidanak are presented. Measurements are
performed with the MASS (Multi-Aperture Scintillation Sensor) device which is
widely used in similar studies during last years at several observatories
across the world. The data analysis shows that median seeing in free atmosphere
(at altitudes above 0.5km) is 0.46 arcsec and median isoplanatic angle is 2.47
arcsec. Given a rather long atmospheric coherence time (about 7 ms when the
seeing is good) such conditions are favorable for adaptive optics and
interferometry in the visible and near-IR.
