We propose an efficient method to compute Lyapunov exponents and Lyapunov
eigenvectors of long-range interacting many-particle systems, whose dynamics is
described by the Vlasov equation. We show that an expansion of a distribution
function using Hermite modes (in momentum variable) and Fourier modes (in
configuration variable) converges fast if an appropriate scaling parameter is
introduced and identified with the inverse of the system temperature. As a
consequence, dynamics and linear stability properties of many-particle states,
both in the close-to and in the far-from equilibrium regimes can be predicted
using a small number of expansion coefficients. As an example of a long-range
interacting system we investigate stability properties of stationary states of
the Hamiltonian mean-field model.
