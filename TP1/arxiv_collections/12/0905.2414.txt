We present a quantitative analysis of the low-temperature, high parallel
field pairing resonance in ultra-thin superconducting Al films with
dimensionless conductance g>>1. In this regime we derive an analytical
expression for the tunneling density-of-states spectrum from which a variety of
normal-state spin parameters can be extracted. We show that by fitting
tunneling data at several supercritical parallel magnetic fields we can
determine all of the relevant parameters that have traditionally been obtained
via fits to tunneling data in the superconducting phase. These include the
spin-orbit scattering rate, the antisymmetric Landau parameter G^0, and the
orbital pair-breaking parameter.
