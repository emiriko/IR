We present a fiber sensor based on an active integrated component which could
be effectively used to measure the longitudinal vibration modes of telescope
mirrors in an interferometric array. We demonstrate the possibility to measure
vibrations with frequencies up to $\simeq 100$ Hz with a precision better than
10 nm.
