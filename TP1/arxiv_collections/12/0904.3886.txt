Ram pressure stripping of galaxies in clusters can yield gas deficient disks.
Previous numerical simulations based on various approaches suggested that,
except for near edge-on disk orientations, the amount of stripping depends very
little on the inclination angle. Following our previous study of face-on
stripping, we extend the set of parameters with the disk tilt angle and explore
in detail the effects of the ram pressure on the interstellar content (ISM) of
tilted galaxies that orbit in various environments of clusters, with compact or
extended distributions of the intra-cluster medium (ICM). We further study how
results of numerical simulations could be estimated analytically. A grid of
numerical simulations with varying parameters is produced using the tree/SPH
code GADGET with a modified method for calculating the ISM-ICM interaction.
These SPH calculations extend the set of existing results obtained from
different codes using various numerical techniques. The simulations confirm the
general trend of less stripping at orientations close to edge-on. The
dependence on the disk tilt angle is more pronounced for compact ICM
distributions, however it almost vanishes for strong ram pressure pulses.
Although various hydrodynamical effects are present in the ISM-ICM interaction,
the main quantitative stripping results appear to be roughly consistent with a
simple scenario of momentum transfer from the encountered ICM. This behavior
can also be found in previous simulations. To reproduce the numerical results
we propose a fitting formula depending on the disk tilt angle and on the column
density of the encountered ICM. Such a dependence is superior to that on the
peak ram pressure used in previous simple estimates.
