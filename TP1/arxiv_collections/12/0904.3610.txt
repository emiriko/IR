The Kolmogorov-Sinai (KS) entropy in turbulent diffusion of magnetic field
lines is analyzed on the basis of a numerical simulation model and theoretical
investigations. In the parameter range of strongly anisotropic magnetic
turbulence the KS entropy is shown to deviate considerably from the earlier
predicted scaling relations [Rev. Mod. Phys. {\bf 64}, 961 (1992)]. In
particular, a slowing down logarithmic behavior versus the so-called Kubo
number $R\gg 1$ ($R = (\delta B / B_0) (\xi_\| / \xi_\bot)$, where $\delta B /
B_0$ is the ratio of the rms magnetic fluctuation field to the magnetic field
strength, and $\xi_\bot$ and $\xi_\|$ are the correlation lengths in respective
dimensions) is found instead of a power-law dependence. These discrepancies are
explained from general principles of Hamiltonian dynamics. We discuss the
implication of Hamiltonian properties in governing the paradigmatic
"percolation" transport, characterized by $R\to\infty$, associating it with the
concept of pseudochaos (random non-chaotic dynamics with zero Lyapunov
exponents). Applications of this study pertain to both fusion and astrophysical
plasma and by mathematical analogy to problems outside the plasma physics.
