We study upward muon flux at neutrino detectors such as Super-Kamiokande
resulting from high-energy neutrinos produced by the dark matter
annihilation/decay at the Galactic center. In particular, we distinguish
showering and non-showering muons as their energy loss processes inside the
detector, and show that this information is useful for discriminating dark
matter models.
