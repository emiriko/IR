In this paper we investigate the use of quantum information to share
classical secrets. While every quantum secret sharing scheme is a quantum error
correcting code, the converse is not true. Motivated by this we sought to find
quantum codes which can be converted to secret sharing schemes. If we are
interested in sharing classical secrets using quantum information, then we show
that a class of pure $[[n,1,d]]_q$ CSS codes can be converted to perfect secret
sharing schemes. These secret sharing schemes are perfect in the sense the
unauthorized parties do not learn anything about the secret. Gottesman had
given conditions to test whether a given subset is an authorized or
unauthorized set; they enable us to determine the access structure of quantum
secret sharing schemes. For the secret sharing schemes proposed in this paper
the access structure can be characterized in terms of minimal codewords of the
classical code underlying the CSS code. This characterization of the access
structure for quantum secret sharing schemes is thought to be new.
