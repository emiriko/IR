Recent measurements of the positron/electron ratio in the cosmic ray (CR)
flux exhibits an apparent anomaly, whereby this ratio increases between 10 and
100 GeV. In contrast, this ratio should decrease according to the standard
scenario, in which CR positrons are secondaries formed by hadronic interactions
between the primary CR protons and the interstellar medium (ISM). The positron
excess is therefore interpreted as evidence for either an annihilation/decay of
weakly interacting massive particles, or for a direct astrophysical source of
pairs. The common feature of all proposed models is that they invoke new
physics or new astrophysical sources. However, this line of argumentation
relies implicitly on the assumption of a relatively homogeneous CR source
distribution. Inhomogeneity of CR sources on a scale of order a kpc, can
naturally explain this anomaly. If the nearest major CR source is about a kpc
away, then low energy electrons (~GeV) can easily reach us. At higher energies
(> 10 GeV), the source electrons cool via synchrotron and inverse-Compton
before reaching the solar vicinity. Pairs formed in the local vicinity through
the proton/ISM interactions can reach the solar system also at high energies,
thus increasing the positron/electron ratio. A natural origin of source
inhomogeneity is the strong concentration of supernovae to the galactic spiral
arms. Assuming supernova remnants (SNRs) as the sole primary source of CRs, and
taking into account their concentration near the galactic spiral arms, we
consistently predict the observed positron fraction between 1 and 100 GeV,
while abiding to different constraints such as the observed electron spectrum
and the CRs cosmogenic age. An ATIC like spectral excess at ~600 GeV can be
explained, in this picture, as the contribution of a few known nearby SNRs.
