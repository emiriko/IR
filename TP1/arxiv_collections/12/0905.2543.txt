The missing fluctuations problem in cosmic microwave background observations
is naturally explained by well-proportioned small universe models. Among the
well-proportioned models, the Poincare dodecahedral space is empirically
favoured. Does gravity favour this space? The residual gravity effect is the
residual acceleration induced by weak limit gravity from multiple topological
images of a massive object on a nearby negligible mass test object. At the
present epoch, the residual gravity effect is about a million times weaker in
three of the well-proportioned spaces than in ill-proportioned spaces. However,
in the Poincare space, the effect is 10,000 times weaker still, i.e. the
Poincare space is about 10^{10} times "better balanced" than ill-proportioned
spaces. Both observations and weak limit dynamics select the Poincare space to
be special.
