Starting from the quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) prediction for the ground-state
energy of a clean two-dimensional one-valley (2D1V) electron gas, we estimate
the energy correction due to scattering sources present in actual devices such
as AlAs quantum wells and GaAs heterostructures. We find that the effect of
uncorrelated disorder, in the lowest (second) order in perturbation theory, is
to enhance the spin susceptibility leading to its eventual divergence. In the
density region where the Born approximation is able to reproduce the
experimental mobility, the prediction for the spin susceptibility yielded by
perturbation theory is in very good agreement with the available experimental
evidence.
