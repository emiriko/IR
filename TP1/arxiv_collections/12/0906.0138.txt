The in-plane thermal conductivity $\kappa$ of electron-doped iron-arsenide
superconductor BaFe$_{1.9}$Ni$_{0.1}$As$_2$ ($T_c$ = 20.3 K) single crystal was
measured down to 70 mK. In zero field, the absence of a residual linear term
$\kappa_0/T$ at $ T \to 0$ is strong evidence for nodeless superconducting gap.
In magnetic field, $\kappa_0/T$ shows a slow field dependence up to $H$ = 14.5
T ($\approx$ 30% $H_{c_2}$). This is consistent with the superconducting gap
structure demonstrated by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy experiments
in BaFe$_{1.85}$Co$_{0.15}$As$_2$ ($T_c$ = 25.5 K), where isotropic
superconducting gaps with similar size on hole and electron pockets were
observed.
