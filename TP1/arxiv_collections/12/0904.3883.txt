A broken symmetry ground state without any magnetic moments has been
calculated by means of local-density-approximation to density functional theory
plus a local exchange term, the so-called LDA+$U$ approach, for
URu$_{2}$Si$_{2}$. The solution is analysed in terms of a multipole tensor
expansion of the itinerant density matrix and is found to be a non-trivial
magnetic multipole. Analysis and further calculations show that this type of
multipole enters naturally in time reversal breaking in presence of large
effective spin-orbit coupling and co-exists with magnetic moments for most
magnetic actinides
