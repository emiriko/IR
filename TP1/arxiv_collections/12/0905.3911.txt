A method for the quantitative assessment of spatio-temporal structuring of
brain activity is presented. This approach is employed in a longitudinal case
study of a child with frontal lobe epilepsy (FLE) and tested against an
age-matched control group. Several correlation measures that are sensitive to
linear and/or non-linear relations in multichannel scalp EEG are combined with
an hierarchical cluster algorithm. Beside a quantitative description of the
overall degree of synchronization the spatial relations are investigated by
means of the cluster characteristics. The chosen information measures not only
demonstrate their suitability in the characterization of the ictal and
interictal phases but they also follow the course of delayed recovery of the
psychiatric symptomatology during successful medication. The results based on
this single case study suggest testing this approach for quantitative control
of therapy in an extended clinical trial.
