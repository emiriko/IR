We monitor the relaxation of internal stresses in a fractal colloidal gel on
cessation of flow and find a weak power law decay, $\sigma_i \sim t^{-\alpha}$
over 5 decades of time where $\alpha \approx 0.07$. The system exhibits
physical aging of the elastic modulus, $G' \sim t^{\beta}$, with $\beta \approx
\alpha$. Imposition of zero stress after waiting time $t_w$ results in strain
recovery as the system relaxes without constraint. Remarkably, recoveries at
different $t_w$ can be shifted to construct a master curve where data are
scaled vertically by $1/\sigma_i(t_w)$ and plotted horizontally as
$(t-t_w)/t_w^{\mu}$ where $\mu\approx 1.25$, indicative of a super-aging
response.
