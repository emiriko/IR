We represent an algorithm allowing one to construct new classes of partially
integrable multidimensional nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs)
starting with the special type of solutions to the (1+1)-dimensional hierarchy
of nonlinear PDEs linearizable by the matrix Hopf-Cole substitution (the
B\"urgers hierarchy).
  We derive examples of four-dimensional nonlinear matrix PDEs together with
they scalar and three-dimensional reductions. Variants of the
Kadomtsev-Petviashvili type and Korteweg-de Vries type equations are
represented among them. Our algorithm is based on the combination of two
Frobenius type reductions and special differential reduction imposed on the
matrix fields of integrable PDEs. It is shown that the derived four-dimensional
nonlinear PDEs admit arbitrary functions of two variables in their solution
spaces which clarifies the integrability degree of these PDEs.
