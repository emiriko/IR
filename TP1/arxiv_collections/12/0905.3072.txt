A modified version of the CKKW matrix element merging algorithm is presented,
suitable for use in an angular-ordered parton shower, using truncated showers
and forced splittings. The algorithm is implemented in the Herwig++ Monte Carlo
event generator for the benchmark process e+e- -> hadrons. Results are
presented at parton and hadron levels, demonstrating a smooth merging between
the matrix elements and parton shower and an improved description of LEP data.
