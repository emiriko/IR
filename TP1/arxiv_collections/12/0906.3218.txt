Electronic correlations in the Fe-pnictide BaFe2As2 are explored within
LDA+DMFT, the combination of density functional theory with dynamical
mean-field theory. While the correlated band structure is substantially
renormalized there is only little transfer of spectral weight. The computed
k-integrated and k-resolved spectral functions are in good agreement with
photoemission spectroscopy (PES) and angular resolved PES experiments. Making
use of a general classification scheme for the strength of electronic
correlations we conclude that BaFe2As2 is a moderately correlated system.
