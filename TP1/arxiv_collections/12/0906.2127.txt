We show that supersymmetric Abelian models that are obtained from
deformations of those with ${\cal N}=2$ supersymmetry also contain metastable
vacua for a wide range of parameters. The deformations we consider are
combinations of masses for charged and singlet fields, a singlet F--term and an
anomalous D--term. We find that, in all cases, the nonsupersymmetric vacua are
parametrically far from the supersymmetric ones and therefore metastable. Using
retrofitting, we show that these metastable vacua may lead to semi--realistic
phenomenology.
