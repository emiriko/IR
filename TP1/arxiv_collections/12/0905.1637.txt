In this work we present our model that dynamically generates resonances from
charmed and light pseudoscalar and vector mesons. The model generates a rich
spectrum of charmed and hidden charm scalar and axial resonances, most of them
which can be associated with observed states. Other states are predicted, in
particular a hidden charm scalar resonance with mass close to the $D\bar D$
threshold. For this resonance we present calculations which show that an
observed enhancement in the $D\bar D$ mass spectrum measured by Belle in
reactions producing $D\bar D J/\psi$ in the final state could be originated by
this predicted state. We also present theoretical calculations on the radiative
decay width of the $\psi(3770)$ into this state. The predicted branching
fractions suggest that this predicted state could be observed by BES with
statistics of one year run in the $\psi(3770)$ peak.
