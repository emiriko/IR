It is widely believed that searching for a light Higgs boson (with a mass
around 120 GeV) in the WH and ZH channels, where H decays into $b\bar{b}$, will
be very challenging at the LHC. These proceedings describe how this channel can
be recovered as a promising search channel at high $p_t$ by using a subjet
analysis procedure.
