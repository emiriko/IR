More and more evidence indicates that "EIT waves" are strongly related to
coronal mass ejections (CMEs). However, it is still not clear how the two
phenomena are related to each other. We investigate a CME event on 1997
September 9, which was well observed by both EUV imaging telescope (EIT) and
the high-cadence MK3 coronagraph at Mauna Loa Solar Observatory, and compare
the spatial relation between the "EIT wave" fronts and the CME leading loops.
It is found that "EIT wave" fronts are co-spatial with the CME leading loops,
and the expanding EUV dimmings are co-spatial with the CME cavity. It is also
found that the CME stopped near the boundary of a coronal hole, a feature
common to observations of "EIT waves". It is suggested that "EIT
waves"/dimmings are the EUV counterparts of the CME leading loop/cavity, based
on which we propose that, as in the case of "EIT waves", CME leading loops are
apparently-moving density enhancements that are generated by successive
stretching (or opening-up) of magnetic loops.
