In one and two component solvents, we calculate the counterion distribution
around a charged rod treating the degree of ionization $\alpha$ as an annealed
variable dependent on its local environment. In the one component case,
$\alpha$ is determined under various conditions without and with salt. In the
two component case, we take into account the preferential solvation of the
counterions and the ionized monomers and the short-range interaction between
the rod and the solvent without salt. It then follows a composition-dependent
mass action law. Mesoscopic variations of the composition and the counterions
are produced around a chraged rod, which sensitively depend on various
parameters of the molecular interactions.
  Furthermore, we predict a first order phase transition of weak-to-strong
dissociation for strong preferential solvation. It can occur in expanded states
of a polymer chain. This transition line starts from a point on the solvent
coexistence curve and ends at a critical point in the plane of the temperature
and the solvent composition. The composition change around a charged rod is
long-ranged near the solvent critical point.
