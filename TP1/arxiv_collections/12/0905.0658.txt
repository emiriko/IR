We measure the effective mass (m*) of interacting two-dimensional electrons
confined to a 4.5 nm-wide AlAs quantum well. The electrons in this well occupy
a single out-of-plane conduction band valley with an isotropic in-plane Fermi
contour. When the electrons are partially spin polarized, m* is larger than its
band value and increases as the density is reduced. However, as the system is
driven to full spin-polarization via the application of a strong parallel
magnetic field, m* is suppressed down to values near or even below the band
mass. Our results are consistent with the previously reported measurements on
wide AlAs quantum wells where the electrons occupy an in-plane valley with an
anisotropic Fermi contour and effective mass, and suggest that the effective
mass suppression upon complete spin polarization is a genuine property of
interacting two-dimensional electrons.
