The traditional approach to feedback control is to apply forces to a system
by modifying the Hamiltonian. Here we show that quantum systems can be
controlled without any Hamiltonian feedback, purely by exploiting the random
quantum back-action of a continuous weak measurement. We demonstrate that,
quite remarkably, the quantum back-action of such an adaptive measurement is
just as effective at controlling quantum systems as traditional feedback.
