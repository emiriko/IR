We present a generic criterion which can be used in gravitational-wave data
analysis to distinguish an extreme-mass-ratio inspiral into a Kerr background
spacetime from one into a non-Kerr background spacetime. The criterion exploits
the fact that when an integrable system, such as the system that describes
geodesic orbits in a Kerr spacetime, is perturbed, the tori in phase space
which initially corresponded to resonances disintegrate so as to form the so
called Birkhoff chains on a surface of section, according to the
Poincar\'{e}-Birkhoff theorem. The KAM curves of these islands in such a chain
share the same ratio of frequencies, even though the frequencies themselves
vary from one KAM curve to another inside an island. On the other hand, the KAM
curves, which do not lie in a Birkhoff chain, do not share this characteristic
property. Such a temporal constancy of the ratio of frequencies during the
evolution of the gravitational-wave signal will signal a non-Kerr spacetime
which could then be further explored.
