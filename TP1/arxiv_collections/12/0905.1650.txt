Relativistic thermodynamics is constructed from the point of view of special
relativistic hydrodynamics. A relativistic four-current for heat and a general
treatment of thermal equilibrium between moving bodies is presented. The
different temperature transformation formulas of Planck and Einstein, Ott,
Landsberg and Doppler appear upon particular assumptions about internal heat
current.
