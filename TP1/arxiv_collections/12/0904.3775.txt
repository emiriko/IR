We use neutron scattering to study magnetic order and spin excitations in
BaFe$_{1.96}$Ni$_{0.04}$As$_{2}$. On cooling, the system first changes the
lattice symmetry from tetragonal to orthoromhbic near $\sim$97 K, and then
orders antiferromagnetically at $T_N=91$ K before developing weak
superconductivity below $\sim$15 K. Although superconductivity appears to
co-exist with static antiferromagnetic order from transport and neutron
diffraction measurement, inelastic neutron scattering experiments reveal that
magnetic excitations do not respond to superconductivity. Instead, the effect
of electron-doping is to reduce the c-axis exchange coupling in BaFe$_2$As$_2$
and induce quasi two-dimensional spin excitations. These results suggest that
transition from three-dimensional spin waves to two-dimensional spin
excitations by electron-doping is important for the separated
structural/magnetic phase transitions and high-temperature superconductivity in
iron arsenides.
