Requirements engineering is known to be a key factor for the success of
software projects. Inside this discipline, goal-oriented requirements
engineering approaches have shown specially suitable to deal with projects
where it is necessary to capture the alignment between system requirements and
stakeholders' needs, as is the case of data-warehousing projects. However, the
mere alignment of data-warehouse system requirements with business goals is not
enough to assure better data-warehousing products; measures and techniques are
also needed to assure the data-warehouse quality. In this paper, we provide a
modelling framework for data-warehouse quality measurement (i*DWQM). This
framework, conceived as an i* extension, provides support for the definition of
data-warehouse requirements analysis models that include quantifiable quality
scenarios, defined in terms of well-formed measures. This extension has been
defined by means of a UML profiling architecture. The resulting framework has
been implemented in the Eclipse development platform.
