The next generation of long baseline neutrino oscillation experiments will
aim at determining the unknown mixing angle $\theta_{13}$, the type of neutrino
mass hierarchy and CP-violation. We discuss the separation of these properties
by means of the energy dependence of the oscillation probability and we
consider an hybrid setup which combines the electron capture and the $\beta^+$
decay from the same radioactive ion with the same boost. We study the
sensitivity to the mixing angle and the CP-phase, the CP discovery potential
and the reach to determine the type of neutrino mass hierarchy. The analysis is
performed for different boosts and baselines. We conclude that the combination
of the two decay channels, with different neutrino energies, achieves
remarkable results.
