Results on Lambda, Anti-lambda, and Xi- production in centrality selected
Pb+Pb reactions at 40A and 158A GeV and in near-central C+C and Si+Si reactions
at 158A GeV are presented. Transverse mass spectra, rapidity spectra, and
multiplicities in dependence of the system size are discussed. Comparisons to
transport models (UrQMD2.3 and HSD) and to the core-corona approach are
performed. While Lambda and Anti-lambda production can be described by
transport models reasonably well, these models do not agree with the Xi-
measurements. On the other hand, the core-corona picture fits very well the
system-size dependence of Lambda and Xi-, while it agrees less well with the
Anti-lambda data.
