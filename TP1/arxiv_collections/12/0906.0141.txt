We derived equations of motion corresponding to Bianchi-I cosmological models
in the Lovelock gravity. Equations derived in the general case, without any
specific ansatz for any number of spatial dimensions and any order of the
Lovelock correction. We also analyzed the equations of motion solely taking
into account the highest-order correction and described the drastic difference
between the cases with odd and even numbers of spatial dimensions. For
power-law ansatz we derived conditions for Kasner and generalized Milne regimes
for the model considered. Finally, we discuss the possible influence of matter
in the form of perfect fluid on the solutions obtained.
