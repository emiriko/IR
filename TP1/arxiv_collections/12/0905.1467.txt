The aim of this review is to discuss in a pedagogical way the problem of the
emergence of a classical behavior in certain physical systems which, in
principle, are correctly described by quantum mechanics. It is stressed that
the limit $\hbar \to 0$ is not sufficient and the crucial role played by the
environment must be taken into account. In particular it is recalled the old
problem raised by Mott in 1929 (\cite{m}) concerning the straight tracks
observed in a cloud chamber, produced by an $\alpha$-particle emitted by a
source in the form of a spherical wave. The conceptual relevance of the problem
for a clearer understanding of the classical limit is discussed in a historical
perspective. Moreover a simple mathematical model is proposed, where the result
of Mott is obtained in a rigorous mathematical way.
