Starting from the famous Pauli problem on the possibility to associate
quantum states with probabilities, the formulation of quantum mechanics in
which quantum states are described by fair probability distributions
(tomograms, i.e. tomographic probabilities) is reviewed in a pedagogical style.
The relation between the quantum state description and the classical state
description is elucidated. The difference of those sets of tomograms is
described by inequalities equivalent to a complete set of uncertainty relations
for the quantum domain and to nonnegativity of probability density on phase
space in the classical domain. Intersection of such sets is studied. The
mathematical mechanism which allows to construct different kinds of tomographic
probabilities like symplectic tomograms, spin tomograms, photon number
tomograms, etc., is clarified and a connection with abstract Hilbert space
properties is established. Superposition rule and uncertainty relations in
terms of probabilities as well as quantum basic equation like quantum evolution
and energy spectra equations are given in explicit form. A method to check
experimentally uncertainty relations is suggested using optical tomograms.
Entanglement phenomena and the connection with semigroups acting on simplexes
are studied in detail for spin states in the case of two qubits. The
star-product formalism is associated with the tomographic probability
formulation of quantum mechanics.
