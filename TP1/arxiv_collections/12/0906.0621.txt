Recent de Haas-van Alphen (dHvA) experiments on high-Tc compounds have been
interpreted using Lifshitz-Kosevich (LK) theory, which ignores many-body
effects. However in quasi-2d systems, interactions plus Landau level
quantization give strong singularities in the self-energy $\Sigma$ and the
thermodynamic potential $\Omega$. These are rapidly suppressed as one increases
the c-axis tunneling amplitude $t_\perp$ and/or impurity scattering. We show
that 2d-3d crossover and interaction effects should show up in these
experiments, and that they can lead to strong deviations from LK behaviour.
Moreover, dHvA experiments in quasi-2d systems should clearly distinguish
between Fermi liquid and non-Fermi liquid states, for sufficiently weak
impurity scattering.
