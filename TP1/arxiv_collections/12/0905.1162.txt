Gamma-ray telescopes have reported some surprising observations of multi-TeV
photons from distant active galactic nuclei (AGN), which show no significant
attenuation due to pair production on either the extragalactic background light
(EBL), or the photons near the source. We suggest a new interpretation of these
observations, which is consistent with both the EBL calculations and the AGN
models. Cosmic rays with energies below 50 EeV, produced by AGN, can cross
cosmological distances, interact with EBL relatively close to Earth, and
generate the secondary photons observed by gamma-ray telescopes. We calculate
the spectrum of the secondary photons and find that it agrees with the
gamma-ray data. The delays in the proton arrival times can explain the orphan
flares, the lack of time correlations, and the mismatch of the variability time
scales inferred from the multiwavelength observations. The gamma-ray data are
consistent with the detection of the secondary photons, which has important
ramifications for gamma-ray astronomy, cosmic ray physics, EBL, and the
intergalactic magnetic fields (IGMF).
