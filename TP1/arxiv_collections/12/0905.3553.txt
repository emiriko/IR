Previous theorems concerning Weyl type systems, including Majumdar-Papapetrou
systems, are generalized in two ways, namely, we take these theorems into d
spacetime dimensions (${\rm d}\geq4$), and we also consider the very
interesting Weyl-Guilfoyle systems, i.e., general relativistic charged fluids
with nonzero pressure. In particular within Newton-Coulomb theory of charged
gravitating fluids, a theorem by Bonnor (1980) in three-dimensional space is
generalized to arbitrary $({\rm d}-1)>3$ space dimensions. Then, we prove a new
theorem for charged gravitating fluid systems in which we find the condition
that the charge density and the matter density should obey. Within general
relativity coupled to charged dust fluids, a theorem by De and Raychaudhuri
(1968) in four-dimensional spacetimes in rendered into arbitrary ${\rm d}>4$
dimensions. Then a theorem, new in ${\rm d}=4$ and ${\rm d}>4$ dimensions, for
Weyl-Guilfoyle systems, is stated and proved, in which we find the condition
that the charge density, the matter density, the pressure, and the
electromagnetic energy density should obey. This theorem comprises, as
particular cases, a theorem by Gautreau and Hoffman (1973) and results in four
dimensions by Guilfoyle (1999). Upon connection of an interior charged solution
to an exterior Tangherlini solution (i.e., a Reissner-Nordstr\"om solution in
d-dimensions), one is able to give a general definition for gravitational mass
for this kind of relativistic systems and find a mass relation with the several
quantities of the interior solution. It is also shown that for sources of
finite extent the mass is identical to the Tolman mass.
