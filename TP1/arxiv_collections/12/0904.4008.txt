In this paper we consider the anharmonic corrections to the anisotropic
elastic rod model for DNA. Our model accounts for the difference between the
bending energies of positive and negative rolls, which comes from the
asymmetric structure of the DNA molecule. We will show that the model can
explain the high flexibility of DNA at small length scales, as well as kink
formation at high deformation limit.
