We derive noncommutative Einstein equations for abelian twists and their
solutions in consistently symmetry reduced sectors, corresponding to twisted
FRW cosmology and Schwarzschild black holes. While some of these solutions must
be rejected as models for physical spacetimes because they contradict
observations, we find also solutions that can be made compatible with low
energy phenomenology, while exhibiting strong noncommutativity at very short
distances and early times.
