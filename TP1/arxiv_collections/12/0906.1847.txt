K to pi pi matrix elements of the electroweak operator Q_(27,1)^Delta I=3/2
are calculated on the RBC/UKQCD 32^3 x 64, L_s=16 lattices, using 2+1 dynamical
flavors and domain wall fermions, with an inverse lattice spacing of
a^(-1)=2.42(4) GeV. Data is interpolated or extrapolated to energy conserving
kinematics and a preliminary calculation of the experimental parameter |A_2| is
performed.
