Approximate analytic expressions for haze (and gloss) of Gaussian randomly
rough surfaces for various types of correlation functions are derived within
phase-perturbation theory. The approximations depend on the angle of incidence,
polarization of the incident light, the surface roughness, $\sigma$, and the
average of the power spectrum taken over a small angular interval about the
specular direction. In particular it is demonstrated that haze(gloss)
increase(decrease) with $\sigma/\lambda$ as $\exp(-A(\sigma/\lambda)^2)$ and
decreases(increase) with $a/\lambda$, where $a$ is the correlation length of
the surface roughness, in a way that depends on the specific form of the
correlation function being considered. These approximations are compared to
what can be obtained from a rigorous Monte Carlo simulation approach, and good
agreement is found over large regions of parameter space. Some experimental
results for the angular distribution of the transmitted light through polymer
films, and their haze, are presented and compared to the analytic
approximations derived in this paper. A satisfactory agreement is found. In the
literature haze of blown polyethylene films has been related to surface
roughness. Few authors have quantified the roughness and other have pointed to
the difficulty in finding the correct roughness measure.
