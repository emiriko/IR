The concept of dissociation-time entanglement provides a means of manifesting
non-classical correlations in the motional state of two counter-propagating
atoms. In this article, we discuss in detail the requirements for a specific
experimental implementation, which is based on the Feshbach dissociation of a
molecular Bose-Einstein condensate of fermionic lithium. A sequence of two
magnetic field pulses serves to delocalize both of the dissociation products
into a superposition of consecutive wave packets, which are separated by a
macroscopic distance. This allows to address them separately in a switched
Mach-Zehnder configuration, permitting to conduct a Bell experiment with simple
position measurements. We analyze the expected form of the two-particle wave
function in a concrete experimental setup that uses lasers as atom guides.
Assuming viable experimental parameters the setup is shown to be capable of
violating a Bell inequality.
