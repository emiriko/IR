We discuss a model of cosmic ray acceleration that accounts for the
observations of anomalous cosmic rays by Voyager 1 and 2. The model appeals to
fast magnetic reconnection rather than shocks as the driver of acceleration.
The ultimate source of energy is associated with magnetic field reversals that
occur in the heliosheath. It is expected that the magnetic field reversals will
occur throughout the heliosheath, but especially near the heliopause where the
flows slows down and diverge in respect to the interstellar wind and also in
the boundary sector-in the heliospheric current sheet. While the First Order
Fermi acceleration theory within reconnection layers is in its infancy, the
available predictions do not contradict the available data on anomalous cosmic
ray spectra measured by the spacecrafts. We argue that the Voyager data can be
one of the first pieces of evidence favoring the acceleration within regions of
fast magnetic reconnection, which we argue is a widely spread astrophysical
process.
