A n-time generalization of Newton's law (of universal gravitation) formula in
N =n + d + 1-dimensional space-time is conjectured. This formula implies a
relation for effective N-dimensional gravitational constant G_{eff} = G cos^2
\theta, where \theta is the angle between the direction of motion of two
particles in n-dimensional time manifold R^n.
