We present an application of the Faraday effect to produce a narrow band
atomic filter in an alkali metal vapor. In our experiment two Raman beams
separated in frequency by the ground state hyperfine splitting in 87Rb are
produced using an EOM and then filtered using the Faraday effect in an
isotopically pure 85Rb thermal vapor. An experimental transmission spectra for
the filter is presented along with a theoretical calculation. The performance
of the filter is then demonstrated and characterized using a Fabry-Perot
etalon. For a temperature of 70 degrees and a longitudinal magnetic field of 80
G a suppression to -18 dB is achieved, limited by the quality of the
polarizers.
