The CMS analysis strategy for the early data measurement of the inclusive W
and Z production cross-sections using their electron decay modes is presented.
This measurement is expected to be among the first from the LHC and so
appropriately robust selections and data-driven methods are used. A significant
measurement is possible with an integrated luminosity of 10 inverse pb.
