We present a compilation of the planet candidates currently known from direct
imaging. We have gathered available data from the literature and derive the
luminosity of all candidates in a homogeneous way using a bolometric
correction, the distances and the K band magnitudes of the objects. In a final
step we find the masses of the candidates from a comparison of the luminosity
or, if not available, an absolute brightness and several well known hot-start
evolutionary models.
