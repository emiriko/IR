Near magnitudes of Dirac particle mass-ratios, mixing hierarchy-quantities
and electroweak charges against the background of highly successful
flavor-universal one-generation EW theory is a puzzle in need of diverse
inclusive research. In this paper I study the problem in proper terms of lepton
and quark Deviation-from-Mass-Degeneracy (DMD) hierarchies at tree EW
approximation. As primary are considered not discrete flavor symmetry but
rather the deviations from mass-degeneracy-symmetry without inventing exact
particular symmetry. Empirically suggested benchmark flavor patterns (zero
approximation) and deviations from benchmarks caused by emergence of a small
related to EW charges parameter are considered two sources of realistic flavor
quantities. Physically interesting mass and mixing flavor quantities are
obtained as solutions of linear and quadratic DMD-hierarchy equation-pairs with
complementary patterns of quark and lepton DMD-hierarchies. Dual relations
between DMD-quantities of quarks and charged leptons (Dirac particles), on the
one hand, and neutrinos (likely Majorana particles), on the other hand, are
inferences. Considered in the literature approximate quark-neutrino mixing
angle complementarity appears naturally from the violation of benchmark
patterns by the emergent small parameter.
