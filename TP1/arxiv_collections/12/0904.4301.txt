We report systematic 57Fe-NMR and 75As-NMR/NQR studies on an underdoped
sample (T_c=20 K), an optimally doped sample (T_c=28 K), and an overdoped
sample (T_c=22 K) of oxygen-deficient iron (Fe)-based oxypnictide
superconductor LaFeAsO_{1-y}$. A microscopic phase separation between
superconducting domains and magnetic domains is shown to take place in the
underdoped sample, indicating a local inhomogeneity in association with the
density distribution of oxygen deficiencies. As a result, 1/T_1T in the normal
state of the superconducting domain decreases significantly upon cooling at
both the Fe and As sites regardless of the electron-doping level in
LaFeAsO_{1-y}. On the basis of this result, we claim that $1/T_1T$ is not
always enhanced by antiferromagnetic fluctuations close to an antiferromagnetic
phase in the underdoped superconducting sample. This contrasts with the
behavior in hole-doped Ba_{0.6}K_{0.4}Fe2As2(T_c= 38 K), which exhibits a
significant increase in $1/T_1T$ upon cooling. We remark that the crucial
difference between the normal-state properties of LaFeAsO_{1-y} and
Ba_{0.6}K_{0.4}Fe2As2 originates from the fact that the relevant Fermi surface
topologies are differently modified depending on whether electrons or holes are
doped into the FeAs layers.
