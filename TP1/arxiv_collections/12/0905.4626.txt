The crystal structures of the quasi-one-dimensional organic salts
(TMTTF)$_2$PF$_6$ and (TMTSF)$_2$PF$_6$ were studied by pressure-dependent
x-ray diffraction up to 10 GPa at room temperature. The unit-cell parameters
exhibit a clear anomaly due to a structural phase transition at 8.5 and 5.5 GPa
for (TMTTF)$_2$PF$_6$ and (TMTSF)$_2$PF$_6$, respectively.
