The concept of a spin-current is a useful tool in understanding
spin-transport in hybrid systems, but its very definition is problematic in
systems where spin-orbit coupling effects are strong. In the absence of
spin-dependent scattering, the spin-current remains well-defined. We here
propose a method for generating pure spin-currents in a normal metal where the
spin-current consequently does not suffer from the aforementioned problems
pertaining to its very definition or spin-relaxation processes. More
specifically, we show how an unpolarized incident charge-current can induce a
pure transverse spin-current by means of scattering at a normal metal/2DEG
interface. This occurs for both Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling. An
experimental setup for observation of this effect is proposed.
