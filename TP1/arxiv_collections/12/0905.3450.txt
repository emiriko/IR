We establish nearly optimal rates of convergence to self-similar solutions of
Smoluchowski's coagulation equation with kernels $K = 2$, $x + y$, and $xy$.
The method is a simple analogue of the Berry-Ess\'een theorem in classical
probability and requires minimal assumptions on the initial data, namely that
of an extra finite moment condition. For each kernel it is shown that the
convergence rate is achieved in the case of monodisperse initial data.
