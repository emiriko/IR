The atomic structure and elastic properties of Y-silicon nanowire junctions
of fork- and bough-types were theoretically studied and effective Young modulus
were calculated using the Tersoff interatomic potential. In the final stages of
bending, new bonds between different parts of the Y-shaped wires are formed. It
was found that the stiffness of the nanowires considered can be compared with
the stiffness of carbon nanotube Y-junctions.
