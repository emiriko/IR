We construct a sequence of nilpotent BRST charges in RNS superstring theory,
based on new gauge symmetries on the worldsheet, found in this paper. These new
local gauge symmetries originate from the global nonlinear space-time
$\alpha$-symmetries, shown to form a noncommutative ground ring in this work.
The important subalgebra of these symmetries is $U(3)\times{X_6}$, where $X_6$
is solvable Lie algebra consisting of 6 elements with commutators reminiscent
of the Virasoro type. We argue that the new BRST charges found in this work
describe the kinetic terms in string field theories around curved backgrounds
of the $AdS\times{CP}_n$-type, determined by the geometries of hidden extra
dimensions induced by the global $\alpha$-generators. The identification of
these backgrounds is however left for the work in progress.
