We present new data structures for approximately counting the number of
points in orthogonal range.
  There is a deterministic linear space data structure that supports updates in
O(1) time and approximates the number of elements in a 1-D range up to an
additive term $k^{1/c}$ in $O(\log \log U\cdot\log \log n)$ time, where $k$ is
the number of elements in the answer, $U$ is the size of the universe and $c$
is an arbitrary fixed constant. We can estimate the number of points in a
two-dimensional orthogonal range up to an additive term $ k^{\rho}$ in $O(\log
\log U+ (1/\rho)\log\log n)$ time for any $\rho>0$. We can estimate the number
of points in a three-dimensional orthogonal range up to an additive term
$k^{\rho}$ in $O(\log \log U + (\log\log n)^3+ (3^v)\log\log n)$ time for
$v=\log \frac{1}{\rho}/\log {3/2}+2$.
