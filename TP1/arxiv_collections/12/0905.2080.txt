We study an atomic Josephson junction (AJJ) in presence of two interacting
Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) confined in a double well trap. We assume that
bosons of different species interact with each other. The macroscopic wave
functions of the two components obey to a system of two 3D coupled
Gross-Pitaevskii equations (GPE). We write the Lagrangian of the system, and
from this we derive a system of coupled ordinary differential equations (ODE),
for which the coupled pendula represent the mechanic analogous. These
differential equations control the dynamical behavior of the fractional
imbalance and of the relative phase of each bosonic component. We perform the
stability analysis around the points which preserve the symmetry and get an
analytical formula for the oscillation frequency around the stable points. Such
a formula could be used as an indirect measure of the inter-species s-wave
scattering length. We also study the oscillations of each fractional imbalance
around zero and non zero - the macroscopic quantum self-trapping (MQST) - time
averaged values. For different values of the inter-species interaction
amplitude, we carry out this study both by directly solving the two GPE and by
solving the corresponding coupled pendula equations. We show that, under
certain conditions, the predictions of these two approaches are in good
agreement. Moreover, we calculate the crossover value of the inter-species
interaction amplitude which signs the onset of MQST.
