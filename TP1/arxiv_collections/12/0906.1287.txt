We calculate the coupling constants between the light vector mesons and heavy
mesons within the framework of the light-cone QCD sum rule in the leading order
of heavy quark effective theory. The sum rules are very stable with the
variations of the Borel parameter and the continuum threshold. The extracted
couplings will be useful in the study of the possible heavy meson molecular
states. They may also helpful in the interpretation of the proximity of
X(3872), Y(4260) and Z(4430) to the threshold of two charmed mesons through the
couple-channel mechanism.
