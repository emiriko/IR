We analyze the frequency-dependent noise and the heat production rate for a
dynamical quantum capacitor in the regime in which it emits single particles,
electrons and holes. At low temperature and slow driving the relaxation
resistance quantum, R_{q} = h/(2e^2), defines the heat production rate in both
the linear and non-linear response regimes. If a double-cavity capacitor emits
particles in pairs, the noise is enhanced. In contrast the energy dissipated is
suppressed or enhanced depending on whether an electron-hole pair or an
electron-electron (a hole-hole) pair is emitted.
