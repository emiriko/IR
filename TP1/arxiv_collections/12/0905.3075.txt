We analyze the 6.4 keV line and continuum emission from the molecular cloud
Sgr B2 and the source HESS J1745-303, which is supposed to be a complex of
molecular gas. From the HESS results it follows that Sgr A is a source of high
energy protons, which penetrate into molecular clouds producing there a TeV
gamma-ray flux. We present arguments that Sgr A may also produce a flux of
subrelativistic protons which generate the 6.4 keV line and bremsstrahlung
continuum emission from the clouds.
