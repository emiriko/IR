A pedagogical introduction to some of the main ideas and results of field
theories on quantized spacetimes is presented, with emphasis on what such field
theories may teach us about the problem of quantizing gravity. We examine to
what extent noncommutative gauge theories may be regarded as gauge theories of
gravity. UV/IR mixing is explained in detail and we describe its relations to
renormalization, to gravitational dynamics, and to deformed dispersion
relations in models of quantum spacetime of interest in string theory and in
doubly special relativity. We also discuss some potential experimental probes
of spacetime noncommutativity.
