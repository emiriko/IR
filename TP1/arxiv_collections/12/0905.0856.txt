The n,p-networks model is used to estimate binding energies and radii of
proton-rich (N < Z) nuclei. These calculations have been made for some
representative examples of even-Z and odd-Z nuclei with nucleon numbers lower
than sixty. Good agreement is found in the comparison of these results with
experimental data.
