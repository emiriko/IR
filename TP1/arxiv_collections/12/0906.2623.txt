Let $G$ be a connected and simply connected two-step nilpotent Lie group and
$\Gamma$ a lattice subgroup of $G$. In this note, we give a new multiplicity
formula, according to the sense of Moore, of irreducible unitary
representations involved in the decomposition of the quasi-regular
representation ${\rm Ind}_{\Gamma}^G(1)$. Extending then the Abelian case.
