We show that the Hubbard Hamiltonian with particle-assisted tunneling rates
--recently proposed to model a fermionic mixture near a broad Feshbach
resonance-- displays a ground state phase diagram with superfluid, insulating,
and phase separated regimes. In the latter case, when the populations are
balanced the two phases coexist in microscopic antiferromagnetic domains.
Macroscopic phase segregation into a high-density superfluid of molecules, and
a low-density Fermi liquid of single atoms appears in the density profile above
a critical polarization p_c.
