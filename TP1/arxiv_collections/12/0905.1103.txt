We apply the dynamical systems tools to study the (linear) dynamics of
Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universes that are fuelled by non-linear
electrodynamics. We focus, mainly, in two particular models. In the first model
the cosmic evolution is fuelled by cold dark matter, a cosmological constant
and a non-linear electrodynamics field. In the second case non-singular
cosmology and late-time accelerated expansion are unified in a model where the
Einstein's field equations are sourced only by cold dark matter and a
non-linear electrodynamics field. It is shown that, in contrast to previous
claims, the cosmological effects coming from the non-linear electrodynamics
field are not as generic as though. In fact, critical points in the phase space
that could be associated with non-linear electrodynamic effects are not found.
