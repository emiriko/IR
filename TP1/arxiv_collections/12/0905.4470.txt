The global response to weak time periodic forces of an array of noisy,
coupled nonlinear systems might show a nonmonotonic dependence on the number of
units in the array. This effect has been termed system size stochastic
resonance. In this paper, we analyze the nonmonotonic dependence on the system
size of the signal-to-noise ratio of a collective variable characterizing a
finite array of one-dimensional globally coupled bistable elements. By contrast
with the conventional nonmonotonic dependence with the strength of the noise
(stochastic resonance), system size stochastic resonance is found to be
restricted to some regions in parameter space.
