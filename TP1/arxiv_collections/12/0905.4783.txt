We present theory for the critical temperature of a Bose gas in a combined
harmonic lattice potential based on a mean-field description of the system. We
develop practical expressions for the ideal-gas critical temperature, and
corrections due to interactions, the finite-size effect, and the occupation of
excited bands. We compare our expressions to numerical calculations and find
excellent agreement over a wide parameter regime.
