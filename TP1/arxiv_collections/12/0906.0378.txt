In this paper we present and discuss the criteria for selecting potential
target stars suitable for the search for Earth like planets, with a special
emphasis on the stellar aspects of habitability. Missions that search for
terrestrial exoplanets will explore the presence and habitability of Earth-like
exoplanets around several hundred nearby stars, mainly F, G, K, and M stars.
The evaluation of the list of potential target systems in order to develop
mission concepts for a search for Terrestrial Exoplanets is essential. Using
the Darwin All Sky Star Catalogue (DASSC), we discuss the selection criteria,
configuration dependent sub-catalogues and the implication of stellar activity
for habitability.
