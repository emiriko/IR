In this article we calculate the leading order shear viscosity in QCD using
the resummed 3PI effective action. We work to 3-loop order in the effective
action. We show that the integral equations that resum the pinching and
collinear contributions are produced naturally by the formalism. All leading
order terms are included, without the need for any kind of power counting
arguments.
