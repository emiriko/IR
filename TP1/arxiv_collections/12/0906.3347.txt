We surveyed the HST UV spectra of 49 low-redshift quasars for z < 1 CIV
candidates, relying solely on the characteristic wavelength separation of the
doublet. After consideration of the defining traits of CIV doublets (e.g.,
consistent line profiles, other associated transitions, etc.), we defined a
sample of 38 definite (group G = 1) and five likely (G = 2) doublets with rest
equivalent widths W_r for both lines detected at >= 3 sigma. We conducted
Monte-Carlo completeness tests to measure the unblocked redshift (dz) and
co-moving pathlength (dX) over which we were sensitive to CIV doublets of a
range of equivalent widths and column densities. The absorber line density of
(G = 1+2) doublets is dN/dX = 4.1+0.7/-0.6 for log N(C^+3) >= 13.2, and dN/dX
has not evolved significantly since z = 5. The best-fit power-law to the G = 1
frequency distribution of column densities f(N(C^+3)) = k(N(C^+3)/N_0)^alpha_N
has coefficient k = (0.67+0.18/-0.16) x 10^-14 cm^2 and exponent alpha_N =
-1.50+0.17/-0.19, where N_0 = 10^14 cm^-2. Using the power-law model of
f(N(C^+3)), we measured the C^+3 mass density relative to the critical density:
Omega(C^+3) = (6.20+1.82/-1.52) x 10^-8 for 13 <= log N(C^+3) <= 15. This value
is a 2.8+/-0.7 increase in Omega(C^+3) compared to the error-weighted mean from
several 1 < z < 5 surveys for CIV absorbers. A simple linear regression to
Omega(C^+3) over the age of the Universe indicates that Omega(C^+3) has slowly
but steadily increased from z = 5 --> 0, with dOmega(C^+3)/dt_age =
(0.42+/-0.2) x 10^-8 Gyr^-1.
