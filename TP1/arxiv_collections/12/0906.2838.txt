The re-analysis of the published experimental data on the primary
gamma-transition intensities following neutron capture in different groups of
neutron resonances in $^{156,158}$Gd has been performed. There are determined
the most probable values of sum of E1 and M1 primary transitions, numbers of
excited by them levels of both parities, ratios of radiative strength functions
k(M1)/k(E1), dispersions of deviations of random values of intensities from the
average and ratios of mean intensities of primary transitions to levels J=5/2
with respect to analogous data for J=1/2 and 3/2 (capture of the 24 keV
neutrons) in narrow excitation energy intervals. All the data on level density
and sums of radiative strength functions confirm the presence of clearly
expressed step-like structure in level density below 3 MeV and general trend in
change in strength functions as changing primary gamma-transition energy.
Variations of distribution dispersions and, especially, ratio k(M1)/k(E1) (or
$k(E1)/k(M1)$) at changing excitation energy point to strong change in
structure of these nuclei above 1.0-1.5 MeV.
