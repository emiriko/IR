We compare and contrast the different points of view of rotation in general
relativity, put forward by Mach, Thirring and Lense, and Goedel. Our analysis
relies on two tools: (i) the Sagnac effect which allows us to measure rotations
of a coordinate system or induced by the curvature of spacetime, and (ii)
computer visualizations which bring out the alien features of the Goedel
Universe. In order to keep the paper self-contained, we summarize in several
appendices crucial ingredients of the mathematical tools used in general
relativity. In this way, our lecture notes should be accessible to researchers
familiar with the basic elements of tensor calculus and general relativity.
