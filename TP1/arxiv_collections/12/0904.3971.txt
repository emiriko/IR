We reconsider the leading HQE contributions to the absorptive part of the
mixing amplitude of neutral $D$ mesons by taking also $\alpha_s$ corrections
and subleading $1/m_c$ corrections into account. We show that these
contributions to $\Gamma_{12}$ do not vanish in the exact SU(3)$_F$ limit and
they also can have a large phase. Moreover, we give an example of a new physics
model that can enhance these leading HQE terms to $\Gamma_{12}$, which are
orders of magnitude lower than the current experimental expectation, by a
factor in the upper double-digit range.
