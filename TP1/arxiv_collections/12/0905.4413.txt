We use the data of Wisconsin H$\alpha$ Mapper (WHAM) to test the hypothesis
of whether the amplitudes and spectrum of density fluctuations measured by WHAM
can be matched to the data obtained for interstellar scintillations and
scattering. To do this, first of all, we adjusted the mean level of signal in
the adjacent patches of the data. Then, assuming that the spectrum is
Kolmogorov, we successfully matched the amplitudes of turbulence obtained from
the WHAM data and the interstellar density fluctuations reported in the
existing literature. As a result, we conclude that the existing data is
consistent with the Kolmogorov cascade which spans from $10^6$ to $10^{17}$
$m$.
