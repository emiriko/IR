The relativistic theory for the electric dipole moment (EDM) of paramagnetic
atoms arising from the electric dipole moment of the electron is presented. A
novel approach using the relativistic coupled-cluster method that incorporates
the residual Coulomb interaction to all orders and a weak parity and
time-reversal violating interaction to one order has been employed in Fr to
obtain the enhancement of the EDM of that atom compared to the EDM of the
electron. Trends of the different correlation effects and leading contributions
from different physical states are discussed. Our result in combination with
that of the Fr EDM that is currently in progress, has the potential to probe
the validity of the Standard Model (SM) of elementary particle physics.
