Virtual Compton scattering off the nucleon (VCS) is studied in the regime of
low energy of the outgoing real photon. This regime allows one to directly
access the generalized polarizabilities of the nucleon in a VCS experiment. In
the derivation of the low energy theorem for VCS that exists in the literature,
the low energy limit taken for virtual initial photons does not match on that
for real photons, when one approaches the initial photon's mass shell. While
this problem has for a long time been attributed to the non-analyticity of the
Compton amplitude with respect to the photon virtuality, I demonstrate that it
is merely due to an ill-defined low energy limit for VCS, on one hand, and to a
particular way of constructing the VCS amplitude, use in the literature, on the
other. I provide a uniform description of low energy Compton scattering with
real and virtual photons by defining a Lorentz-covariant operator sub-basis for
Compton scattering in that regime, that has six independent structures.
Correspondingly, six new generalized polarizabilities are introduced in the
Breit frame. These polarizabilities are defined as continuous functions of the
photon virtuality and at the real photon point match onto the nucleon
polarizabilities known from real Compton scattering.
