We consider twist-L operators in the planar N=6 superconformal Chern-Simons
ABJM theory. Their anomalous dimension gamma_L^{CS}(N) is a function of the
twist L, the spin N, and the dressed coupling of ABJM. We show that at
next-to-leading order in the large spin expansion, this anomalous dimension is
related to that of N=4 SYM twist operators by a simple scaling law.
