Coin flipping is a cryptographic primitive in which two spatially separated
players, who in principle do not trust each other, wish to establish a common
random bit. If we limit ourselves to classical communication, this task
requires either assumptions on the computational power of the players or it
requires them to send messages to each other with sufficient simultaneity to
force their complete independence. Without such assumptions, all classical
protocols are so that one dishonest player has complete control over the
outcome. If we use quantum communication, on the other hand, protocols have
been introduced that limit the maximal bias that dishonest players can produce.
However, those protocols would be very difficult to implement in practice
because they are susceptible to realistic losses on the quantum channel between
the players or in their quantum memory and measurement apparatus. In this
paper, we introduce a novel quantum protocol and we prove that it is completely
impervious to loss. The protocol is fair in the sense that either player has
the same probability of success in cheating attempts at biasing the outcome of
the coin flip. We also give explicit and optimal cheating strategies for both
players.
