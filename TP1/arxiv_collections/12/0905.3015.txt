The problem of imaging extended targets (sources or scatterers) is formulated
in the framework of compressed sensing with emphasis on subwavelength
resolution.
  The proposed formulation of the problems of inverse source/scattering is
essentially exact and leads to the random partial Fourier measurement matrix.
In the case of square-integrable targets, the proposed sampling scheme in the
Littlewood-Paley wavelet basis block-diagonalizes the scattering matrix with
each block in the form of random partial Fourier matrix corresponding to each
dyadic scale of the target. The resolution issue is analyzed from two
perspectives: stability and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The subwavelength
modes are shown to be typically unstable. The stability in the subwavelength
modes requires additional techniques such as near-field measurement or
illumination. The number of the stable modes typically increases as the
negative $d$-th (the dimension of the target) power of the distance between the
target and the sensors/source. The resolution limit is shown to be inversely
proportional to the SNR in the high SNR limit. Numerical simulations are
provided to validate the theoretical predictions.
