In this work we use the multiconfiguration Dirac-Fock method to calculate the
transition probabilities for all possible decay channels, radiative and
radiationless, of a K shell vacancy in Zn, Cd and Hg atoms. The obtained
transition probabilities are then used to calculate the corresponding
fluorescence yields which are compared to existing theoretical, semi-empirical
and experimental results.
