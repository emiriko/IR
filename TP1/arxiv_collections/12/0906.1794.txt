We find that three nonstoichiometric cubic binary chromium chalcogenides,
namely Cr3S4, Cr3Se4, and Cr3Te4, are stable half-metallic ferromagnets with
wide half-metallic gaps on the basis of systematic state-of-the-arts
first-principles calculations. We optimize their structures, and then calculate
their magnetic moments, electronic structures, formation heats, and elastic
moduli and investigate their structural stability and robustness of
ferromagnetism against antiferromagnetic fluctuations. Our calculated results
show that the three sulvanite phases are structurally stable and
ferromagnetically robust, and hence could be realized as epitaxial thin films.
We attribute the structural and ferromagnetic stability and the better
half-metallicity to their special effective Cr valence 2.667+. These findings
will open doors for much more high-performance spintronic materials compatible
with current semiconductor technology.
