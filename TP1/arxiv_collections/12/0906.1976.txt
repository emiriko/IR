Theories of interacting gauge fields and fermions can possess a running gauge
coupling with an infrared attractive fixed point (IRFP). We present a minimal
description of the physics of these systems and comment on some simple
expectations for results from lattice simulations done within the basin of
attraction of the IRFP in these theories.
