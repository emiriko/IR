For the class of attractive potentials V(r) <= 0 which vanish at infinity, we
prove that the ground-state energy E of the semirelativistic Hamiltonian
  H = \sqrt{m^2 + p^2} + V(r) is bounded below by the ground-state energy e of
the corresponding Klein--Gordon problem
  (p^2 + m^2)\phi = (V(r) -e)^2\phi. Detailed results are presented for the
exponential and Woods--Saxon potentials.
