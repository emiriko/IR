Quantum state transfer is a procedure, which allows to exchange quantum
information between stationary qubit systems. It is anticipated that the
transfer will find applications in solid-state quantum computing. In this
contribution, we discuss the effects of various, physically relevant models of
decoherence on a toy model of six qubit linearly coupled by the exchange
interaction. In many cases we observe the advantage of the two-qubit encoding,
which can be associated with the fact that this encoding does not require the
state initialization.
