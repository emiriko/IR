In large magnetoresistance devices spin torque-induced changes in resistance
can produce GHz current and voltage oscillations which can affect magnetization
reversal. In addition, capacitive shunting in large resistance devices can
further reduce the current, adversely affecting spin torque switching. Here, we
simultaneously solve the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation with spin torque and
the transmission line telegrapher's equations to study the effects of
resistance feedback and capacitance on magnetization reversal of both spin
valves and magnetic tunnel junctions. While for spin valves parallel (P) to
anti-parallel (AP) switching is adversely affected by the resistance feedback
due to saturation of the spin torque, in low resistance magnetic tunnel
junctions P-AP switching is enhanced. We study the effect of resistance
feedback on the switching time of MTJ's, and show that magnetization switching
is only affected by capacitive shunting in the pF range.
