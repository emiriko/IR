In this paper we investigate the von Neumann entropy in the ground state of
one-dimensional anyonic systems with the repulsive interaction. Based on the
Bethe-ansatz method, the entanglement properties for the arbitrary statistical
parameter ($0\leq\kappa\leq1$) are obtained from the one-particle reduced
density matrix in the full interacting regime. It is shown that the
entanglement entropy increases with the increase in the interaction strength
and statistical parameter. The statistic parameter affects the entanglement
properties from two aspects: renormalizing of the effective interaction
strength and introducing an additional anyonic phase. We also evaluate the
entanglement entropy of hard-core anyons for different statistical parameters
in order to clarify solely the effect induced by the anyonic phase.
