We examine here the classical dynamics of cold atoms in square optical
lattices, i.e. lattices obtained with two orthogonal stationary plane waves.
Contrary to much of the past studies in this domain, the potential is here time
independent and non dissipative. We show that, as a function of the
experimental parameters, very different behaviors are obtained, both for the
dynamics of atoms trapped inside individual sites, and for atoms travelling
between sites: inside the sites, chaos may be a main regime or, on the
contrary, may be negligible; outside the sites, chaos sometimes coexists with
other regimes. We discuss what are the consequences of these differences on the
macroscopic behavior of the atoms in the lattice, and we propose experimental
measurements able to characterize these dynamics and to distinguish between the
different cases.
