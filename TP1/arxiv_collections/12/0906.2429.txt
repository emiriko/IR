A new solution in the string background dual to N=1 SQCD-like theories is
presented. The gauge coupling in this solution has walking property. The Wilson
loop calculations show that quark anti-quark potential makes phase transitions.
Additionally the effect of flavours on other solutions in this background is
investigated by considering some unflavoured solutions and perturbing them with
small parameter $x=\frac{N_{f}}{N_{c}}$.
