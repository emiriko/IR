The structural behaviour of CsCdF3 under pressure is investigated by means of
theory and experiment. High-pressure powder x-ray diffraction experiments were
performed up to a maximum pressure of 60 GPa using synchrotron radiation. The
cubic $Pm\bar{3}m$ crystal symmetry persists throughout this pressure range.
Theoretical calculations were carried out using the full-potential linear
muffin-tin orbital method within the local density approximation and the
generalized gradient approximation for exchange and correlation effects. The
calculated ground state properties -- the equilibrium lattice constant, bulk
modulus and elastic constants -- are in good agreement with experimental
results. Under ambient conditions, CsCdF3 is an indirect gap insulator with the
gap increasing under pressure.
