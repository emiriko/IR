By extending the lepton sector of standard model to include one sterile
neutrino and two sets of new Higgs doublets and right-handed neutrinos, denoted
by $(\eta_1, N_1, N_3)$ and $(\eta_2, N_2, N_4)$, with two $Z_2$ symmetries,
the puzzles of neutrino masses, matter-antimatter asymmetry and cosmic-ray
excess observed by Fermi-LAT and PAMELA can be resolved simultaneously. The
characters of the model are: (a) neutrino masses arise from type-I and
radiative seesaw mechanisms; (b) leptogenesis leading to baryon asymmetry at
the energy scale of $O(1- 10\rm TeV)$ could be realized through soft $Z_2$
symmetry breaking effects; and (c) the conditions of small couplings for a
long-lived dark matter could be achieved naturally through loop corrections due
to the same soft symmetry breaking effects. The candidate for dark matter in
leptophilic decays could fit the Fermi-LAT and PAMELA data well.
