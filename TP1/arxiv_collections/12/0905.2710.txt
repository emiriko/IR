We propose a new mechanism for generating small neutrino masses which
predicts the relation m_\nu ~ v^4/M^3, where v is the electroweak scale, rather
than the conventional seesaw formula m_\nu ~ v^2/M. Such a mass relation is
obtained via effective dimension seven operators LLHH(H*H)/M^3, which arise
when an isospin 3/2 Higgs multiplet \Phi is introduced along with iso-triplet
leptons. The masses of these particles are naturally in the TeV scale. The
neutral member of \Phi acquires an induced vacuum expectation value and
generates neutrino masses, while its triply charged partner provides the
smoking gun signal of this scenario. These triply charged bosons can be pair
produced at the LHC and the Tevatron, with \Phi^{+++} decaying into W^+l^+l^+
or W^+W^+W^+, possibly with displaced vertices. The leptonic decays of
\Phi^{+++} will help discriminate between normal and inverted hierarchies of
neutrino masses. This scenario also allows for raising the standard Higgs boson
mass to values in excess of 500 GeV.
