We analyze by means of Matrix-Product-State simulations the correlation
dynamics of strongly-correlated superfluid Bose gases in one-dimensional
time-dependent optical lattices. We show that, as for the case of abrupt
quenches, a quasi-adiabatic modulation of the lattice is characterized by a
relatively long transient regime for which quasi-local single-particle
correlation functions have already converged to a new equilibrium, whereas
long-range correlations and particularly the quasi-condensate fraction may
still present a very significant dynamics well after the end of the lattice
modification. We also address the issue of adiabaticity by considering the
fidelity between the time-evolved state and the ground-state of the final
lattice.
