We present analytic expressions of all integrals required to complete the
explicit evaluation of the real-virtual integrated counterterms needed to
define a recently proposed subtraction scheme for jet cross sections at
next-to-next-to-leading order in QCD. We use the Mellin-Barnes representation
of these integrals in $4-2\epsilon$ dimensions to obtain the coefficients of
their Laurent expansions around $\epsilon=0$. These coefficients are given by
linear combinations of multidimensional Mellin-Barnes integrals. We compute the
coefficients of such expansions in $\epsilon$ both numerically and analytically
by complex integration over the Mellin-Barnes contours.
