In the data of the ether-drift experiments there might be sizable
fluctuations superposed on the smooth sinusoidal modulations due to the Earth's
rotation and orbital revolution. These fluctuations might reflect the
stochastic nature of the underlying "quantum ether" and produce vanishing
averages for all vectorial quantities extracted from a naive Fourier analysis
of the data. By comparing the typical stability limits of the individual
optical resonators with the amplitude of their relative frequency shift, the
presently observed signal, rather than being spurious experimental noise, might
also express fundamental properties of a physical vacuum similar to a
superfluid in a turbulent state of motion. In this sense, the situation might
be similar to the discovery of the CMBR that was first interpreted as mere
instrumental noise.
