We measure the top quark mass in top-antitop events using up to 3.6 /fb of
proton-antiproton collisions at sqrt{s}=2 TeV. New results are described for
matrix element methods with single lepton and dilepton channels, and template
methods with all-jets and dilepton channels. Standardization of systematic
uncertainties has proceeded between the CDF and D0 collaborations. A combined
measurement of 173.1+/-0.6(stat)+/-1.1(syst) GeV is achieved. Fits to all
measured electroweak parameters gives a Higgs boson mass 95% CL upper limit of
m_H < 163 GeV. We also present a new measurement of the W boson mass from D0.
Three different template methods are performed. Accounting for their
correlations, a combined measurement of M_W=80.401+/-0.043(stat+syst) GeV is
obtained.
