We extend the model of a 2$d$ solid to include a line of defects. Neighboring
atoms on the defect line are connected by ?springs? of different strength and
different cohesive energy with respect to the rest of the system. Using the
Migdal-Kadanoff renormalization group we show that the elastic energy is an
irrelevant field at the bulk critical point. For zero elastic energy this model
reduces to the Potts model. By using Monte Carlo simulations of the 3- and
4-state Potts model on a square lattice with a line of defects, we confirm the
renormalization-group prediction that for a defect interaction larger than the
bulk interaction the order parameter of the defect line changes discontinuously
while the defect energy varies continuously as a function of temperature at the
bulk critical temperature.
