In this study, the genes involved in the initial attack on fluorene by
Sphingomonas sp. LB126 were investigated. The ? and ? subunits of a dioxygenase
complex (FlnA1A2), showing 63% and 51% sequence identity respectively, with the
subunits of an angular dioxygenase from Gram-positive Terrabacter sp. DBF63,
were identified. When overexpressed in E. coli, FlnA1A2 was responsible for the
angular oxidation of fluorene, fluorenol, fluorenone, dibenzofuran and
dibenzo-p-dioxin. Moreover, FlnA1A2 was able to oxidize polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons and heteroaromatics, some of which were not oxidized by the
dioxygenase from Terrabacter sp. DBF63. Quantification of resulting oxidation
products showed that fluorene and phenanthrene were preferred substrates.
