We present a simple approximation of the non-perturbative renormalization
group designed for the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation and show that it yields the
correct phase diagram, including the strong-coupling phase with reasonable
scaling exponent values in physical dimensions. We find indications of a
possible qualitative change of behavior around $d=4$. We discuss how our
approach can be systematically improved.
