A simple physical conception explaining the experimentally observed
temperature dependence of the local mode frequencies in the ordering metal
hydrides is proposed. Calculations are performed for bcc vanadium deuterides.
The model can be applied to other physical phenomena which are related to the
hydrogen motion in metal lattices.
