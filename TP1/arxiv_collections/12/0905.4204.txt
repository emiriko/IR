We study nonrelativistic gravity using the Hamiltonian formalism. For the
dynamics of general relativity (relativistic gravity) the formalism is well
known and called the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM) formalism. We show that if the
lapse function is constrained correctly, then nonrelativistic gravity is
described by a consistent Hamiltonian system. Surprisingly, nonrelativistic
gravity can have solutions identical to relativistic gravity ones. In
particular, (anti-)de Sitter black holes of Einstein gravity and IR limit of
Horava gravity are locally identical.
