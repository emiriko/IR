A multichannel description of the light scalar mesons in the framework of the
Resonance-Spectrum Expansion is generalised by including vector-vector and
scalar-scalar channels, besides the usual pseudoscalar-pseudoscalar channels.
Experimental data for the isoscalar, isodoublet and isovector cases are fitted
up to energies well above 1 GeV. The resulting pole positions of the light and
intermediate scalar mesons are compared to the listed resonances. Possible
further improvements are discussed.
