There are numerous indications that a discrete substratum underlies continuum
spacetime. Any fundamentally discrete approach to quantum gravity must provide
some prescription for how continuum properties emerge from the underlying
discreteness. The causal set approach, in which the fundamental relation is
based upon causality, finds it easy to reproduce timelike distances, but has a
more difficult time with spatial distance, due to the unique combination of
Lorentz invariance and discreteness within that approach. We describe a method
to deduce spatial distances from a causal set. In addition, we sketch how one
might use an important ingredient in deducing spatial distance, the `$n$-link',
to deduce whether a given causal set is likely to faithfully embed into a
continuum spacetime.
