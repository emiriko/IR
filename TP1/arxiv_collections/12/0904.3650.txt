The goal of this paper is to present the implementation of a Radial Basis
Function neural network with built-in knowledge to recognize hand-written
characters. The neural network includes in its architecture gates controlled by
an attraction/repulsion system of coefficients. These coefficients are derived
from a preprocessing stage which groups the characters according to their
ascendant, central, or descendent components. The neural network is trained
using data from invariant moment functions. Results are compared with those
obtained using a K nearest neighbor method on the same moment data.
