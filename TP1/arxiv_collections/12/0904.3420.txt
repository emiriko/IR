This paper presents a new identity based strong designated verifier parallel
multi-proxy signature scheme. Multi-Proxy signatures allow the original signer
to delegate his signing power to a group of proxy signers. In our scheme, the
designated verifier can only validate proxy signatures created by a group of
proxy signer.
