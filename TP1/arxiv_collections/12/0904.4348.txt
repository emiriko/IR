In this paper the magnetic behaviour of undoped and 15% F doped SmFeAsO
(Sm-1111) and LaFeAsO (La-1111) samples is presented and discussed.
Magnetization measurements are not a simple tool to use for the
characterisation of the new family of Fe-based superconductors because magnetic
impurities can be easily formed during the preparation procedure and may affect
the magnetic signal. In spite of this problem bulk magnetization measurements,
properly treated, may give very useful information. In the undoped samples we
gathered the main aspects of the physical behavior of the 1111 phase, i.e. the
onset of the Spin Density Wave (SDW), the antiferromagnetic ordering at the Sm
sublattice and the susceptibility increase with increasing temperature above
the SDW temperature, and, in addition, we were able to estimate the Pauli
contribution to susceptibility and therein the Wilson ratio both for LaFeAsO
and SmFeAsO compounds, and the amplitude of the jump at the SDW temperature. In
the doped samples, while the presence of magnetic signals due to impurities is
dominating in the normal state, the superconducting behavior may be clearly
observed and studied. In particular, in the Sm-1111 superconducting sample the
coexistence-competition between superconductivity and antiferromagnetic
ordering of the Sm ions was clearly observed.
