The entanglement entropy of a pure quantum state of a bipartite system is
defined as the von Neumann entropy of the reduced density matrix obtained by
tracing over one of the two parts. Critical ground states of local Hamiltonians
in one dimension have an entanglement entropy that diverges logarithmically in
the subsystem size, with a universal coefficient that is is related to the
central charge of the associated conformal field theory. Here I will discuss
recent extensions of these ideas to a class of quantum critical points with
dynamic critical exponent $z=2$ in two space dimensions and to 2D systems in a
topological phase. The application of these ideas to quantum dimer models and
fractional quantum Hall states will be discussed.
