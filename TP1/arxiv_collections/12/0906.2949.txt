The nature of some baryonic resonances is still an unresolved issue. The case
of the N*(1535) is particularly interesting in this respect due to the nearby
etaN threshold and interference with the N*(1650). The N*(1535) has been
described as a threshold effect, as a genuine 3-quark resonance, or as
dynamically generated from the interaction of the octet of baryons with the
octet of mesons. In the scheme of dynamical generation, predictions for the
interaction of the N*(1535) with the photon can be made. In this study, we
simultaneously analyze the role of the N*(1535) in the piN-->piN and
gammaN-->piN reactions and compare to the respective amplitudes from partial
wave analyses. This test is very sensitive to the meson-baryon components of
the N*(1535).
