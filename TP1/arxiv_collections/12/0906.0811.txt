We examine charge fractionalization by chiral separation in a one-dimensional
fermion system described by Luttinger liquid theory. The focus is on the
question of whether the fractional charges are quantum mechanically sharp, and
in the analysis we make a distinction between the global charge, which is
restricted by boundary conditions, and the local charge where a background
contribution is subtracted. We show, by way of examples, that fractional
charges of arbitrary values, all which are quantum mechanically sharp, can be
introduced by different initial conditions. Since the system is gapless,
excitations of arbitrary low frequency contribute to the fluctuations, it is
important to make a precise definition of sharp charges, and this we we do by
subtraction of the ground state contribution. We very briefly comment on the
relevance of our analysis for proposed experiments.
