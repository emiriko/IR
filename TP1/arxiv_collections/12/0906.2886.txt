The probability density function (PDF) of flux $R$ is computed in systems
with logarithmic non-linearity using a model non-linear dynamical equation. The
PDF tails of the first moment flux are analytically predicted to be power law.
These PDF tails are shown to be broader than a Gaussian distribution and are a
manifestation of intermittency caused by short lived coherent structures
(instantons).
