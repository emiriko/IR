X-ray fluorescence spectra from monovalent ions (Cs+) that accumulate from
dilute solutions to form an ion-rich layer near a charged Langmuir monolayer
are presented. For the salt solution without the monolayer, the fluorescence
signals below the critical angle are significantly lower than the detection
sensitivity and only above the critical angle signals from the bulk are
observed. In the presence of a monolayer that provides surface charges, strong
fluorescence signals below the critical angle are observed. Ion density
accumulated at the interface are determined from the fluorescence. The
fluorescent spectra collected as a function of incident x-ray energy near the
LIII edge yield the extended absorption spectra from the ions, and are compared
to recent independent results. The fluorescence data from divalent Ba2+ with
and without monolayer are also presented.
