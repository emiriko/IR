We study the Sinai model for the diffusion of a particle in a one dimension
random potential in presence of a small concentration $\rho$ of perfect
absorbers using the asymptotically exact real space renormalization method. We
compute the survival probability, the averaged diffusion front and return
probability, the two particle meeting probability, the distribution of total
distance traveled before absorption and the averaged Green's function of the
associated Schrodinger operator. Our work confirms some recent results of
Texier and Hagendorf obtained by Dyson-Schmidt methods, and extends them to
other observables and in presence of a drift. In particular the power law
density of states is found to hold in all cases. Irrespective of the drift, the
asymptotic rescaled diffusion front of surviving particles is found to be a
symmetric step distribution, uniform for $|x| < {1/2} \xi(t)$, where $\xi(t)$
is a new, survival length scale ($\xi(t)=T \ln t/\sqrt{\rho}$ in the absence of
drift). Survival outside this sharp region is found to decay with a larger
exponent, continuously varying with the rescaled distance $x/\xi(t)$. A simple
physical picture based on a saddle point is given, and universality is
discussed.
