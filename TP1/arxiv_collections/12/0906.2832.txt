The CODALEMA experiment detects the cosmic air showers with an hybrid
detector composed of an array of scintillators and an array of antennas
triggered by the particle array. We will first describe the experiment and the
data analysis then we will focus on the sky distribution of the events detected
by the antennas which presents a strong asymmetry. We will show that this
asymmetry is well described and quantified at first order by an emission of the
shower electric field given by the cross product of the shower axis with the
geomagnetic field vector. The physical origin of this term is explained in
another talk in this conference.
