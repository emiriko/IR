The dynamic deformation upon stretching of Ni nanowires as those formed with
mechanically controllable break junctions or with a scanning tunneling
microscope is studied both experimentally and theoretically. Molecular dynamics
simulations of the breaking process are performed. In addition, and in order to
compare with experiments, we also compute the transport properties in the last
stages before failure using the first-principles implementation of Landauer's
formalism included in our transport package ALACANT.
