Discrete geometric estimators approach geometric quantities on digitized
shapes without any knowledge of the continuous shape. A classical yet difficult
problem is to show that an estimator asymptotically converges toward the true
geometric quantity as the resolution increases. We study here the convergence
of local estimators based on Digital Straight Segment (DSS) recognition. It is
closely linked to the asymptotic growth of maximal DSS, for which we show
bounds both about their number and sizes. These results not only give better
insights about digitized curves but indicate that curvature estimators based on
local DSS recognition are not likely to converge. We indeed invalidate an
hypothesis which was essential in the only known convergence theorem of a
discrete curvature estimator. The proof involves results from arithmetic
properties of digital lines, digital convexity, combinatorics, continued
fractions and random polytopes.
