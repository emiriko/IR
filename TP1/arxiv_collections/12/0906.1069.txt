BL Lac objects are low--power active nuclei exhibiting a variety of peculiar
properties that are caused by the presence of a relativistic jet and
orientation effects.
  We present here adaptive optics near-IR images at high spatial resolution of
the nearby BL Lac object PKS 0521-365, which is known to display a prominent
jet both at radio and optical frequencies. The observations were obtained in
Ks--band using the ESO multi-conjugated adaptive optics demonstrator at the
Very Large Telescope. This allowed us to obtain images with 0.1 arcsec
effective resolution. We performed a detailed analysis of the jet and its
related features from the near-IR images, and combined them with images
previously obtained with HST in the R band and by a re-analysis of VLA radio
maps. We find a remarkable similarity in the structure of the jet at radio,
near-IR, and optical wavelengths. The broad--band emission of the jet knots is
dominated by synchrotron radiation, while the nucleus also exhibits a
significant inverse Compton component. We discovered the near-IR counterpart of
the radio hotspot and found that the near-IR flux is consistent with being a
synchrotron emission from radio to X-ray. The bright red object (red-tip),
detached but well aligned with the jet, is well resolved in the near-IR and has
a linear light profile. Since it has no radio counterpart, we propose that it
is a background galaxy not associated with the jet. The new adaptive optics
near-IR images and previous observations at other frequencies allow us to study
the complex environment around the remarkable BL Lac object PKS 0521-365. These
data exemplify the capabilities of multi conjugate adaptive optics observations
of extragalactic extended sources.
