The Floquet spectrum of a class of driven SU(2) systems is shown to display a
butterfly pattern with multi-fractal properties. The level crossing between
Floquet states of the same parity or different parities is studied. The results
are relevant to studies of fractal statistics, quantum chaos, coherent
destruction of tunneling, and the validity of mean-field descriptions of
Bose-Einstein condensates.
