We fit the lattice QCD data of Kaczmarek et al for the free energy F1 and
internal energy U1 with a class of Coulomb, constant and linear potentials,
both pure and screened, matching the large distance to the short distance parts
of the lattice QCD finite temperature energies. We also include the hyperfine
potential in F1 and U1. We detail the bottomonium (and charmonium) binding and
the melting temperatures, both for the groundstate and for the excited states,
relevant for Hard Probes in Heavy Ion Collisions at LHC, where temperatures
well above Tc will be reached, much higher than the temperatures reached in
previous Heavy Ion Collisions.
