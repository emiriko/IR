We study the scattering of waves off a potential step in deformed honeycomb
lattices. For small deformations below a critical value, perfect Klein
tunneling is obtained. This means that a potential step in any direction
transmits waves at normal incidence with unit transmission probability,
irrespective of the details of the potential. Beyond the critical deformation,
a gap in the spectrum is formed, and a potential step in the deformation
direction reflects all normal-incidence waves, exhibiting a dramatic transition
form unit transmission to total reflection. These phenomena are generic to
honeycomb lattice systems, and apply to electromagnetic waves in photonic
lattices, quasi-particles in graphene, cold atoms in optical lattices.
