Several observations obtained in the last few years indicate that Soft
Gamma-ray Repeaters (SGRs) and Anomalous X-ray Pulsars (AXPs) are basically a
single class of isolated neutron stars. Their properties are well explained by
the magnetar model, based on neutron stars powered by magnetic fields as high
as 10^14 -10^15 G. Here I report some recent results obtained for the transient
Soft Gamma-ray Repeater SGR 1627-41, that started a new outburst after about 10
years from the previous one, and for the Anomalous X-ray Pulsar 1E 1547.0-5408.
The latter source recently showed a remarkable bursting activity, that
reinforces the similarity between AXPs and SGRs.
