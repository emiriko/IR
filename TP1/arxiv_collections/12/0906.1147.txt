The primary motivation for uptake of virtualization have been resource
isolation, capacity management and resource customization: isolation and
capacity management allow providers to isolate users from the site and control
their resources usage while customization allows end-users to easily project
the required environment onto a variety of sites. Various approaches have been
taken to integrate virtualization with Grid technologies. In this paper, we
propose an approach that combines virtualization on the existing software
infrastructure such as Pilot Jobs with minimum change on the part of resource
providers.
