We present numerical evidences for the validity of the inequality between the
total mass and the total angular momentum for multiple axially symmetric
(non-stationary) black holes. We use a parabolic heat flow to solve numerically
the stationary axially symmetric Einstein equations. As a by product our
method, we also give numerical evidences that there are no regular solutions of
Einstein equations that describe two extreme, axially symmetric black holes in
equilibrium.
