An exhaustive classification scheme of topological insulators and
superconductors is presented. The key property of topological insulators
(superconductors) is the appearance of gapless degrees of freedom at the
interface/boundary between a topologically trivial and a topologically
non-trivial state. Our approach consists in reducing the problem of classifying
topological insulators (superconductors) in d spatial dimensions to the problem
of Anderson localization at a (d-1) dimensional boundary of the system. We find
that in each spatial dimension there are precisely five distinct classes of
topological insulators (superconductors). The different topological sectors
within a given topological insulator (superconductor) can be labeled by an
integer winding number or a Z_2 quantity. One of the five topological
insulators is the 'quantum spin Hall' (or: Z_2 topological) insulator in d=2,
and its generalization in d=3 dimensions. For each dimension d, the five
topological insulators correspond to a certain subset of five of the ten
generic symmetry classes of Hamiltonians introduced more than a decade ago by
Altland and Zirnbauer in the context of disordered systems (which generalizes
the three well known "Wigner-Dyson'' symmetry classes).
