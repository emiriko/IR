The spectral weight evolution of the low-dimensional Mott insulator TiOCl
upon alkali-metal dosing has been studied by photoelectron spectroscopy. We
observe a spectral weight transfer between the lower Hubbard band and an
additional peak upon electron-doping, in line with quantitative expectations in
the atomic limit for changing the number of singly and doubly occupied sites.
This observation is an unconditional hallmark of correlated bands and has not
been reported before. In contrast, the absence of a metallic quasiparticle peak
can be traced back to a simple one-particle effect.
