We consider solutions of the focusing cubic and quintic Gross-Pitaevskii (GP)
hierarchies. We identify an observable corresponding to the average energy per
particle, and we prove that it is a conserved quantity. We prove that all
solutions to the focusing GP hierarchy at the $L^2$-critical or
$L^2$-supercritical level blow up in finite time if the energy per particle in
the initial condition is negative. Our results do not assume any factorization
of the initial data.
