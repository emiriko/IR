We study the reaction e+e- --> e+e-pi0 and measure the gamma gamma* --> pi0
transition form factor in the momentum transfer range from 4 to 40 GeV^2. The
analysis is based on 442 fb^-1 of integrated luminosity collected at PEP-II
with the BABAR detector at e+e- center-of-mass energies near 10.6 GeV.
