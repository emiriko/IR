Entanglement-based technologies, such as quantum information processing,
quantum simulations, and quantum-enhanced metrology, have the potential to
revolutionise our way of computing and measuring and help clarifying the
puzzling concept of entanglement itself. Ultracold atoms on atom chips are
attractive for their implementation, as they provide control over quantum
systems in compact, robust, and scalable setups. An important tool in this
system is a potential depending on the internal atomic state. Coherent dynamics
in this potential combined with collisional interactions allows entanglement
generation both for individual atoms and ensembles. Here, we demonstrate
coherent manipulation of Bose-condensed atoms in such a potential, generated in
a novel way with microwave near-fields on an atom chip. We reversibly entangle
atomic internal and motional states, realizing a trapped-atom interferometer
with internal-state labelling. Our system provides control over collisions in
mesoscopic condensates, paving the way for on-chip generation of many-particle
entanglement and quantum-enhanced metrology with spin-squeezed states.
