H1 has measured a number of different known particles and compared their
production to QCD models and to other reactions such as N-N collisions. ZEUS
has also measured the production of K0SK0S pairs with a view to searching for
glueballs. Several resonances are seen which are glueball candidates. The
results on the masses and widths are compared to other experiments.
