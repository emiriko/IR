The Mermin inequality provides a criterion for experimentally ruling out
local-realistic descriptions of multiparticle systems. A violation of this
inequality means that the particles must be entangled, but does not, in
general, indicate whether N-partite entanglement is present. For this, a
stricter bound is required. Here we discuss this bound and use it to propose
two different schemes for demonstrating N-partite entanglement with atoms. The
first scheme involves Bose-Einstein condensates trapped in an optical lattice
and the second uses Rydberg atoms in microwave cavities.
