A conjecture on the origin of elementary particle masses is discussed, based
on the micro-universe and quantum state reduction concepts. The reduction of
the quantum state of a real particle is understood to take place objectively;
in every interaction event with other real particles, the quantum state of the
particle is annihilated and a new one is created. In these events, the particle
is localised in time and in space, with a maximum precision established by the
uncertainty principle. The minimum energy required for this localisation
constitutes the chief contribution to the particle mass. A further contribution
is provided by the self-interaction of the particle during localisation, which
occurs within a finite duration. Some algorithms for estimating these two
contributions are presented and discussed.
