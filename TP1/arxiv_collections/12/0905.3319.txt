Strongly correlated amorphous solids are a class of glass-formers whose
inter-particle potential admits an approximate inverse power-law form in a
relevant range of inter-particle distances. We study the steady-state plastic
flow of such systems, firstly in the athermal, quasi-static limit, and secondly
at finite temperatures and strain rates. In all cases we demonstrate the
usefulness of scaling concepts to reduce the data to universal scaling
functions where the scaling exponents are determined a-priori from the
inter-particle potential. In particular we show that the steady plastic flow at
finite temperatures with efficient heat extraction is uniquely characterized by
two scaled variables; equivalently, the steady state displays an equation of
state that relates one scaled variable to the other two. We discuss the range
of applicability of the scaling theory, and the connection to density scaling
in supercooled liquid dynamics. We explain that the description of transient
states calls for additional state variables whose identity is still far from
obvious.
