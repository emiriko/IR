I discuss the role played by multiple partonic interactions (MPI) in the
early stages of relativistic heavy-ion collisions, for which a weak-coupling
QCD description is possible. From the Color Glass Condensate, through the
Glasma and into the Quark-Gluon-Plasma phase, MPI are at the origin of
interesting novel QCD phenomena.
