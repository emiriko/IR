some discrepancies in Copenhagen quantum mechanics have been summarized and the
arguments have been gathered why in the description of microscopic reality the
hidden-variable theory should be preferred. It has been shown, too, that the
earlier gap in physical descriptions of the microscopic and macroscopic worlds
may be practically removed. All corresponding statements have been based on
proofs that have been published earlier and reproduced in the given
contribution only partially. In the present paper the whole approach will be
explained more systematically. Some important points newly analyzed will be
added.
