We present evidences of the diffusive motion of the ground and tunnels and
show that if systematic movements are excluded then the remaining uncorrelated
component of the motion obeys a characteristic fractal law with the
displacement variance dY^2 scaling with time- and spatial intervals T and L as
dY^2 \propto T^(Alpha)L^(Gamma) with both exponents close to 1. We briefly
describe experimental methods of the mesa- and microscopic ground motion
detection used in the measurements at the physics research facilities sensitive
to the motion, particularly, large high energy elementary particle
accelerators. A simple mathematical model of the fractal motion demonstrating
the observed scaling law is also presented and discussed.
