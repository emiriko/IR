We present a new algorithm for isolating the real roots of a system of
multivariate polynomials, given in the monomial basis. It is inspired by
existing subdivision methods in the Bernstein basis; it can be seen as
generalization of the univariate continued fraction algorithm or alternatively
as a fully analog of Bernstein subdivision in the monomial basis. The
representation of the subdivided domains is done through homographies, which
allows us to use only integer arithmetic and to treat efficiently unbounded
regions. We use univariate bounding functions, projection and preconditionning
techniques to reduce the domain of search. The resulting boxes have optimized
rational coordinates, corresponding to the first terms of the continued
fraction expansion of the real roots. An extension of Vincent's theorem to
multivariate polynomials is proved and used for the termination of the
algorithm. New complexity bounds are provided for a simplified version of the
algorithm. Examples computed with a preliminary C++ implementation illustrate
the approach.
