We report on the observation of nonlinear magneto-gyrotropic photogalvanic
effect in HgTe/HgCdTe quantum wells. The interband absorption of mid-infrared
radiation as well as the intrasubband absorption of terahertz radiation in the
heterostructures is shown to cause a dc electric current in the presence of an
in-plane magnetic field. A cubic in magnetic field component of the
photocurrent is observed in quantum wells with the inverted band structure
only. The experimental data are discussed in terms of both the phenomenological
theory and microscopic models.
