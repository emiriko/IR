We demonstrate control of the collapse and expansion of an 88Sr Bose-Einstein
condensate using an optical Feshbach resonance (OFR) near the 1S0-3P1
intercombination transition at 689 nm. Significant changes in dynamics are
caused by modifications of scattering length by up to +- ?10a_bg, where the
background scattering length of 88Sr is a_bg = -2a0 (1a0 = 0.053 nm). Changes
in scattering length are monitored through changes in the size of the
condensate after a time-of-flight measurement. Because the background
scattering length is close to zero, blue detuning of the OFR laser with respect
to a photoassociative resonance leads to increased interaction energy and a
faster condensate expansion, whereas red detuning triggers a collapse of the
condensate. The results are modeled with the time-dependent nonlinear
Gross-Pitaevskii equation.
