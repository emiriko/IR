We point out that pseudomoduli -- tree-level flat directions that often
accompany dynamical supersymmetry breaking -- can be natural candidates for
TeV-scale dark matter in models of gauge mediation. The idea is general and can
be applied to different dark matter scenarios, including (but not limited to)
those of potential relevance to recent cosmic ray anomalies. We describe the
requirements for a viable model of pseudomoduli dark matter, and we analyze two
example models to illustrate the general mechanism -- one where the
pseudomoduli carry Higgsino-like quantum numbers, and another where they are SM
singlets but are charged under a hidden-sector $U(1)'$ gauge group.
