We provide a detailed study of the reflectivity of multiferroic TbMnO_3 for
wave numbers from 40 cm^{-1} to 1000 cm^{-1} and temperatures 5 K < T < 300 K.
Excitations are studied for polarization directions E || a, the polarization
where electromagnons are observed, and for E || c, the direction of the
spontaneous polarization in this material. The temperature dependencies of
eigenfrequencies, damping constants and polar strengths of all modes are
studied and analyzed. For E || a and below the spiral ordering temperature of
about 27 K we observe a transfer of optical weight from phonon excitations to
electromagnons, which mainly involves low-frequency phonons. For E || c an
unusual increase of the total polar strength and hence of the dielectric
constant is observed indicating significant transfer of dynamic charge probably
within manganese-oxygen bonds on decreasing temperatures.
