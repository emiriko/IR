We solve a model of polymers represented by self-avoiding walks on a lattice
which may visit the same site up to three times in the grand-canonical
formalism on the Bethe lattice. This may be a model for the collapse transition
of polymers where only interactions between monomers at the same site are
considered. The phase diagram of the model is very rich, displaying coexistence
and critical surfaces, critical, critical endpoint and tricritical lines, as
well as a multicritical point. From the grand-canonical results, we present an
argument to obtain the properties of the model in the canonical ensemble, and
compare our results with simulations in the literature. We do actually find
extended and collapsed phases, but the transition between them, composed by a
line of critical endpoints and a line of tricritical points, separated by the
multicritical point, is always continuous. This result is at variance with the
simulations for the model, which suggest that part of the line should be a
discontinuous transition. Finally, we discuss the connection of the present
model with the standard model for the collapse of polymers (self-avoiding
self-attracting walks), where the transition between the extended and collapsed
phases is a tricritical point.
