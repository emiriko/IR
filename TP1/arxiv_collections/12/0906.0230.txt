We discuss the possibility of searching for the $\Lam - \Lamb$ oscillations
for coherent $\Lam\Lamb$ production in the J/$\psi \to \Lam \Lamb$ decay
process. The sensitivity of measurement of $\Lam -\Lamb$ oscillation in the
external field at BES-III experiment is considered. These considerations
indicate an alternative way to probe the $\Delta B =2$ amplitude in addition to
neutron oscillation experiments. Both coherent and time-dependent information
can be used to extract the $\Lam-\Lamb$ oscillation parameter. With one year's
luminosity at BES-III, we can set an upper limit of $\delta m_{\Lam \Lamb} <
10^{-15}$ MeV at 90% confidence level, corresponding to about $10^{-6}$ s of
$\Lam-\Lamb$ oscillation time.
