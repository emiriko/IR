We used a local susceptibility approach in extensive polarized neutron
diffraction studies of the spin liquid \tbti. For a magnetic field applied
along the [110] and [111] directions, we found that, at high temperature, all
Tb moments are collinear and parallel to the field. With decreasing
temperature, the Tb moments reorient from the field direction to their local
anisotropy axes. For the [110] field direction, the field induced magnetic
structure at 10 K is spin ice-like, but with two types of Tb moments of very
different magnitudes. For a field along [111], the magnetic structure resembles
the so-called "one in-three out" found in spin ices, with the difference that
all Tb moments have an additional component along the [111] direction due to
the magnetic field. The temperature evolution of the local susceptibilities
clearly demonstrates a progressive change from Heisenberg to Ising behavior of
the Tb moments when lowering the temperature, which appears to be a crystal
field effect.
