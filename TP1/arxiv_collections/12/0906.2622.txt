It is shown that all torsion-free vacuum solutions of the model of dS gauge
theory of gravity are the vacuum solutions of Einstein field equations with the
same positive cosmological constant. Furthermore, for the gravitational
theories with more general quadratic gravitational Lagrangian ($F^2+T^2$), the
torsion-free vacuum solutions are also the vacuum solutions of Einstein field
equations.
