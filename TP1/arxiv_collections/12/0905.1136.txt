I find a class of black hole solutions to a (3+1) dimensional theory gravity
coupled to abelian gauge fields with negative cosmological constant that has
been proposed as the dual theory to a Lifshitz theory describing critical
phenomena in (2+1) dimensions. These black holes are all asymptotic to a
Lifshitz fixed point geometry and depend on a single parameter that determines
both their area (or size) and their charge. Most of the solutions are obtained
numerically, but an exact solution is also obtained for a particular value of
this parameter. The thermodynamic behaviour of large black holes is almost the
same regardless of genus, but differs considerably for small black holes.
Screening behaviour is exhibited in the dual theory for any genus, but the
critical length at which it sets in is genus-dependent for small black holes.
