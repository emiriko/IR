This article is the continued version of the analytical blowup solutions for
2-dimensional Euler-Poisson equations in "M.W. Yuen, Analytical Blowup
Solutions to the 2-dimensional Isothermal Euler-Poisson Equations of Gaseous
Stars, J. Math. Anal. Appl. 341 (1)(2008), 445-456." and "M.W. Yuen, Analytical
Blowup Solutions to the 2-dimensional Isothermal Euler-Poisson Equations of
Gaseous Stars II. arXiv:0906.0176v1". With the extension of the blowup
solutions with radial symmetry for the isothermal Euler-Poisson equations in
R^2, other special blowup solutions in R^N with non-radial symmetry are
constructed by the separation method. Key words: Analytical Solutions,
Euler-Poisson Equations, Isothermal, Blowup, Special Solutions, Non-radial
