We study the transport and deposition dynamics of colloids in saturated
porous media under unfavorable filtering conditions. As an alternative to
traditional convection-diffusion or more detailed numerical models, we consider
a mean-field description in which the attachment and detachment processes are
characterized by an entire spectrum of rate constants, ranging from shallow
traps which mostly account for hydrodynamic dispersivity, all the way to the
permanent traps associated with physical straining. The model has an analytical
solution which allows analysis of its properties including the long-time
asymptotic behavior and the profile of the deposition curves. Furthermore, the
model gives rise to a filtering front whose structure, stability, and
propagation velocity are examined. Based on these results, we propose an
experimental protocol to determine the parameters of the model.
