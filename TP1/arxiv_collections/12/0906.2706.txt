We present a theory of the quantum vacuum radiation that is generated by a
fast modulation of the vacuum Rabi frequency of a single two-level system
strongly coupled to a single cavity mode. The dissipative dynamics of the
Jaynes-Cummings model in the presence of anti-rotating wave terms is described
by a generalized master equation including non-Markovian terms. Peculiar
spectral properties and significant extracavity quantum vacuum radiation output
are predicted for state-of-the-art circuit cavity quantum electrodynamics
systems with superconducting qubits.
