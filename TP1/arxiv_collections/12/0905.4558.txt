We report the discovery by the Large Area Telescope (LAT) onboard the Fermi
Gamma-ray Space Telescope of high-energy gamma-ray emission from the peculiar
quasar PMN J0948+0022 (z=0.5846). The optical spectrum of this object exhibits
rather narrow Hbeta (FWHM(Hbeta) ~ 1500 km s^-1), weak forbidden lines and is
therefore classified as a narrow-line type I quasar. This class of objects is
thought to have relatively small black hole mass and to accrete at high
Eddington ratio. The radio loudness and variability of the compact radio core
indicates the presence of a relativistic jet. Quasi simultaneous
radio-optical-X-ray and gamma-ray observations are presented. Both radio and
gamma-ray emission (observed over 5-months) are strongly variable. The
simultaneous optical and X-ray data from Swift show a blue continuum attributed
to the accretion disk and a hard X-ray spectrum attributed to the jet. The
resulting broad band spectral energy distribution (SED) and, in particular, the
gamma-ray spectrum measured by Fermi are similar to those of more powerful
FSRQ. A comparison of the radio and gamma-ray characteristics of PMN J0948+0022
with the other blazars detected by LAT shows that this source has a relatively
low radio and gamma-ray power, with respect to other FSRQ. The physical
parameters obtained from modelling the SED also fall at the low power end of
the FSRQ parameter region discussed in Celotti & Ghisellini (2008). We suggest
that the similarity of the SED of PMN J0948+0022 to that of more massive and
more powerful quasars can be understood in a scenario in which the SED
properties depend on the Eddington ratio rather than on the absolute power.
