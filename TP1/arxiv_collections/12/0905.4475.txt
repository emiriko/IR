An algebraic system is proposed that represent surface cobordisms in
thickened surfaces. Module and comodule structures over Frobenius algebras are
used for representing essential curves. The proposed structure gives a unified
algebraic view of states of categorified Jones polynomials in thickened
surfaces and virtual knots. Constructions of such system are presented.
