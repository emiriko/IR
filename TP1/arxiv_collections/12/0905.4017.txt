The dynamics of solid deuterium (sD2) is studied by means of inelastic
scattering (coherent and incoherent) of thermal and cold neutrons at different
temperatures and para-ortho ratios. In this paper, the results for the
generalized density of states (GDOS) are presented and discussed. The
measurements were performed at the thermal neutron time-of-flight (TOF)
instrument IN4 at ILL Grenoble and at the cold neutron TOF instrument TOFTOF at
FRM II Garching. The GDOS comprises besides the hcp phonon excitations of the
sD2 the rotational transitions J = 0 ->1 and J = 1 -> 2. The intensities of
these rotational excitations depend strongly on the ortho-D2 molecule
concentration co in sD2. Above E = 10 meV there are still strong excitations,
which very likely may originate from higher energy damped optical phonons and
multi-phonon contributions. A method for separating the one- and multi-phononon
contributions to the density of states willbe presented and discussed.
