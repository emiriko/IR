Rare earth (R) orthoferrites RFeO_3 exhibit large volume transitions
associated with a spin collapse. We present here ab initio calculations on
LuFeO_3. We show that taking into account the strong correlation among the
Fe-3d electrons is necessary. Indeed, with the LDA+U method in the Projector
Augmented Wave (PAW), we are able to describe the isostructural phase
transition at 50 GPa, as well as a volume discontinuity of 6.0% at the
transition and the considerable reduction of the magnetic moment on the Fe
ions. We further investigate the effect of the variation of U and J and find a
linear dependence of the transition pressure on these parameters. We give an
interpretation for the non-intuitive effect of J. This emphasizes the need for
a correct determination of these parameters especially when the LDA+U is
applied to systems (e.g in geophysical investigations) where the transition
pressure is a priori unknown.
