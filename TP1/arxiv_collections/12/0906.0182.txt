We propose a quantum cloning machine, which clones a qubit into two clones
assuming known modulus of expectation value of Pauli Z-matrix. The process is
referred to as the mirror phase-covariant cloning, for which the input state is
a priori less known than that for the standard phase-covariant cloning.
Analytical expressions describing the cloning transformation and fidelity of
the clones are found. Extremal equations for the optimal cloning are derived
and analytically solved by generalizing a method of Fiurasek [Phys. Rev. A 64,
062310 (2001)]. Quantum circuits implementing the optimal cloning
transformation and their physical realization in a quantum-dot system are
described.
