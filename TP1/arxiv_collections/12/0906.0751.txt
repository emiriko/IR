The resonance frequency of an InAs quantum dot strongly coupled to a GaAs
photonic crystal cavity was electrically controlled via quantum confined Stark
effect. Stark shifts up to 0.3meV were achieved using a lateral Schottky
electrode that created a local depletion region at the location of the quantum
dot. We report switching of a probe laser coherently coupled to the cavity up
to speeds as high as 150MHz, limited by the RC constant of the transmission
line. The coupling rate and the magnitude of the Stark shift with electric
field were investigated while coherently probing the system.
