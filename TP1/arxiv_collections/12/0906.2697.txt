Traditionally the effects of MHD instabilities and micro-instabilities on
plasma confinement are investigated separately. However, these two
instabilities often occur simultaneously, with the overlap of the dynamics on a
broad range of spatial scales. It is thus vital to incorporate these
instabilities consistently by a proper multi-scale modeling. Furthermore, there
has been an overwhelming evidence that the overall transport of heat and
particles is significantly influenced by intermittency (or bursty events)
caused by coherent structures. A crucial question in plasma confinement is thus
the prediction of the probability distribution functions (PDFs) of the
transport due to these structures and of their formation.
  In this paper, we investigate intermittent transport in a multi-scale model
by consistently incorporating both tearing instabilities and micro-instability
due to pressure gradient.
