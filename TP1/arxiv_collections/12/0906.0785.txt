Electrically generated spin polarization is probed directly in bulk GaN using
Kerr rotation spectroscopy. A series of n-type GaN epilayers are grown in the
wurtzite phase both by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) and metalorganic chemical
vapor deposition (MOCVD) with a variety of doping densities chosen to broadly
modulate the transverse spin lifetime, T2*. The spin polarization is
characterized as a function of electrical excitation energy over a range of
temperatures. Despite weak spin-orbit interactions in GaN, a current-induced
spin polarization (CISP) is observed in the material at temperatures of up to
200 K.
