We investigate two coupled microdisks with non-identical radii focusing on
the parametric evolution of energy levels and the unidirectional far-field
emission. We show that the evolution of energy levels is characterized by the
avoided crossing intrinsically associated with the exceptional point or the
non-Hermitian degeneracy. These spectral properties explain highly asymmetric
near-field intensity pattern of the resonance mode. The observed unidirectional
far-field emission is shown to be understood by considering the forbidden
inter-disk coupling in the ray picture induced by the frustrated total internal
reflection near the closest point between two disks when the inter-disk
distance is small enough.
