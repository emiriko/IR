We consider the possible discovery potential for single production of charged
heavy leptons via anomalous interactions at the envisaged Compact Linear
Collider (CLIC) by taking into account initial state radiation (ISR) and
beamstrahlung effects. We calculate the production cross sections and decay
widths of charged heavy leptons in the context of anomalous interactions at
center of mass energies $\sqrt{s}=1$ and 3 TeV. The signal and corresponding
backgrounds are studied in detail for the mass range 300-1900 GeV.
