A local bootstrap method is proposed for the analysis of electoral vote-count
first-digit frequencies, complementing the Benford's Law limit. The method is
calibrated on five presidential-election first rounds (2002--2006) and applied
to the 2009 Iranian presidential-election first round. Candidate K has a highly
significant (p< 0.15%) excess of vote counts starting with the digit 7. This
leads to other anomalies, two of which are individually significant at p\sim
0.1%, and one at p\sim 1%. Independently, Iranian pre-election opinion polls
significantly reject the official results unless the five polls favouring
candidate A are considered alone. If the latter represent normalised data and a
linear, least-squares, equal-weighted fit is used, then either candidates R and
K suffered a sudden, dramatic (70%\pm 15%) loss of electoral support just prior
to the election, or the official results are rejected (p\sim 0.01%).
