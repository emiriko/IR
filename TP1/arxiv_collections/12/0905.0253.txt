Since its launch in April 2007, the AGILE satellite detected with its
Gamma-Ray Imaging Detector (GRID) several blazars at high significance: 3C 279,
3C 454.3, PKS 1510-089, S5 0716+714, 3C 273, W Comae, Mrk 421 and PKS 0537-441.
Moreover, AGILE was able both to rapidly respond to sudden changes in blazar
activity state at other wavelengths and to alert other telescopes quickly in
response to changes in the gamma-ray fluxes. Thus, we were able to obtain
multiwavelength data from other observatories such as Spitzer, Swift, RXTE,
Suzaku, INTEGRAL, MAGIC, VERITAS, as well as radio-to-optical coverage by means
of the GASP Project of the WEBT and REM. This large multifrequency coverage
gave us the opportunity to study the Spectral Energy Distribution of these
sources from radio to gamma-rays energy bands and to investigate the different
mechanisms responsible for their emission. We present an overview of the AGILE
results on these gamma-ray blazars and the relative multifrequency data.
