The problem is sequence prediction in the following setting. A sequence
$x_1,...,x_n,...$ of discrete-valued observations is generated according to
some unknown probabilistic law (measure) $\mu$. After observing each outcome,
it is required to give the conditional probabilities of the next observation.
The measure $\mu$ belongs to an arbitrary class $\C$ of stochastic processes.
We are interested in predictors $\rho$ whose conditional probabilities converge
to the "true" $\mu$-conditional probabilities if any $\mu\in\C$ is chosen to
generate the data. We show that if such a predictor exists, then a predictor
can also be obtained as a convex combination of a countably many elements of
$\C$. In other words, it can be obtained as a Bayesian predictor whose prior is
concentrated on a countable set. This result is established for two very
different measures of performance of prediction, one of which is very strong,
namely, total variation, and the other is very weak, namely, prediction in
expected average Kullback-Leibler divergence.
