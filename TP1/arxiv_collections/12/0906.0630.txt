Theoretical models suggest that the Quantum Chromo-Dynamics (QCD) phase
diagram has a critical point demarcating the order of transition between the
two phases: the hadron gas, in which the quarks are confined and the
Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). The central goal of the experiments with relativistic
heavy-ion collisions is to create and study such form of matter called the QGP
and understand the QCD phase diagram. The STAR (Solenoidal Tracker At RHIC)
detector is pertinent for the RHIC (Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider) energy
scan program where we plan to explore this exciting physics possibility using
heavy-ion collisions at various center of mass energies. A first test run with
Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 9.2 GeV took place in early 2008. We
present the recent STAR results from this run of the identified particles
(pion, kaon and proton) transverse momentum spectra and ratios. Also we shall
present and discuss the results of the azimuthal anisotropy parameters
($v_{1}$, $v_{2}$) along with the pion interferometry measurements. These
recent results from Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 9.2 GeV are compared
with other SPS and RHIC measurements.
