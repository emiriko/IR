We calculate bottom-hadron mass splittings with respect to $B_d$ and
$\Lambda_b$ using full QCD with 2+1 flavors of dynamical Kogut-Susskind sea
quarks and domain-wall valence quarks along with a static heavy quark. Our
lattices have spatial volume of $(2.5{fm})^3$ with lattice spacing about 0.124
fm and a range of pion masses as low as 291 MeV. Our results are in agreement
with experimental observations and other lattice calculations within our
statistical and systematic errors. In particular, we find the mass of the
$\Omega_b$ to be consistent with the recent CDF measurement. We also predict
the mass for the as yet unobserved $\Xi^\prime_b$ to be 5955(27) MeV.
