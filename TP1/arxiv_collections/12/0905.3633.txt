CoRoT-2a is a young (about 0.5 Gyr) G7V star accompanied by a transiting
hot-Jupiter, discovered by the CoRoT satellite (Alonso et al. 2008; Bouchy et
al. 2008). An analysis of its photospheric activity, based on spot modelling
techniques previously developed by our group for the analysis of the Sun as a
star, shows that the active regions on CoRoT-2a arised within two active
longitudes separated by about 180 degrees and rotating with periods of 4.5221
and 4.5543 days, respectively, at epoch of CoRoT observations (112 continous
days centered at 2007.6). We show that the total spotted area oscillates with a
period of about about 8.9 days, a value close to 10 times the synodic period of
the planet with respect to the active longitude pattern rotating in 4.5221
days. Moreover, the variance of the stellar flux is modulated in phase with the
planet orbital period. This suggests a possible star-planet magnetic
interaction, a phenomenon already seen in other extrasolar planetary systems
hosting hot-Jupiters.
