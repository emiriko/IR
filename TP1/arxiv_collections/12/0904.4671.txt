We discuss the target space pseudoduality in supersymmetric sigma models on
symmetric spaces using two different methods, orthonormal coframe and component
expansion. These two methods yield similar results to the classical cases with
the exception that commuting bracket relations in classical case turns out to
be anticommuting ones because of the appearance of grassmann numbers. In
component expansion method it is understood that constraint relations in case
of non-mixing pseudoduality are the remnants of mixing pseudoduality. Once
mixing terms are included in the pseudoduality relations the constraint
relations disappear.
