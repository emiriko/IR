A recent surprising finding that electronic compressibility measured
experimentally in monolayer graphene can be described solely in terms of the
kinetic energy [J. Martin, et al., Nat. Phys. 4, 144 (2008)] is explained
theoretically as a direct consequence of the linear energy dispersion and the
chirality of massless Dirac electrons. For bilayer graphene we show that
contributions to the compressibility from the electron correlations are
restored. We attribute the difference to the respective momentum dependence of
the low energy band structures of the two materials.
