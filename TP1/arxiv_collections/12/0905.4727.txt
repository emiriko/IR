We present an improved measurement of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect for the
exoplanetary system HD 17156, based on radial-velocity data gathered with the
Subaru 8.2m telescope throughout the planetary transit of UT 2008 November 7.
The data allow for a precise and independent determination of the projected
spin-orbit angle of this system: $\lambda = 10.0^{\circ} \pm 5.1^{\circ}$. This
result supersedes the previous claim of $\lambda = 62^{\circ} \pm 25^{\circ}$
by Narita et al., which was based on lower-precision data with poor statistics.
Thus the stellar spin and planetary orbital axes of the HD 17156 system are
likely to be well-aligned, despite the planet's large orbital eccentricity
suggesting a history of strong dynamical interactions.
