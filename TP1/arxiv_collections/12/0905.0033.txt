This work demonstrates the existence of both negative refraction and a
negative refractive index in an optical uniaxial absorbent medium that can be
characterized by ordinary and extraordinary refractive indices. Negative
refraction occurs in any absorbent uniaxial medium if the real part of the
extraordinary index is less than its imaginary part. The refractive index is
negative when the incident medium is sufficiently dense and the incident angle
exceeds a critical angle that is defined here.
