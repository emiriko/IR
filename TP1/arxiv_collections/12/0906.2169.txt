We apply the direct method of obtaining reductions to the Toda hierarchy of
equations. The resulting equations form a hierarchy of ordinary differential
difference equations, also known as delay-differential equations. Such a
hierarchy appears to be the first of its kind in the literature. All possible
reductions, under certain assumptions, are obtained. The Lax pair associated to
this reduced hierarchy is obtained.
