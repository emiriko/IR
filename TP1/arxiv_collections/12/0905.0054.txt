The capacitance between two adjacent nodes on an infinite square grid of
identical capacitors can easily be found by superposition, and the solution is
found by explotting the symmetry of the grid. The mathematical problem
presented in this work involves the solution of an infinite set of linear,
inhomogenous difference equations which are solved by the method of separation
of variables.
