The ALICE experiment at LHC is dedicated to study matter formed in heavy-ion
collisions, but also has a strong physics program for $pp$ collisions. In these
collisions, protons will collide at energies never reached before under
laboratory conditions. At the high energies, ALICE will enable us to study jet
physics in detail, especially the production of multiple jet events, setting
the baseline for heavy-ion. Three-jet events allow us to examine the properties
of quark and gluon jets, providing a suitable tool for testing QCD
experimentally. We discuss the selection method and topology of three-jet
events in ALICE. The analysis was performed on two PYTHIA data sets, both
involving $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 14$ TeV with enhanced jet production.
The results from the dedicated jet MC production are discussed and compared to
previous studies at CDF and D\O. We investigate the possibilities to determine
gluon jet candidates.
