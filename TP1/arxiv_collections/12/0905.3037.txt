A new instrument with a dual-beam H-alpha Doppler system is being developed
at the Udaipur Solar Observatory (USO) in order to improve the quality and
quantity of data on quiet, activated and erupting filaments and prominences on
the Sun, especially those associated with geo-effective coronal mass ejections.
These data can be potentially used to construct three-dimensional topology of
erupting filaments as they leave the surface of the Sun and can be compared
with multi-wavelength data obtained from space missions such as STEREO, SOHO,
and Hinode. The characterization of various optical components for the
instrument is being carried out, and some preliminary results are described in
the paper.
