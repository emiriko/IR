Growing demands for the voltage-driven spintronic applications with
ultralow-power consumption have led to new interest in exploring the
voltage-induced magnetization switching in ferromagnetic metals. In this study,
we observed a large perpendicular magnetic anisotropy change in Au(001) /
ultrathin Fe80Co20(001) / MgO(001) / Polyimide / ITO junctions, and succeeded
in realizing a clear switching of magnetic easy axis between in-plane and
perpendicular directions. Furthermore, employing a perpendicularly magnetized
film, voltage-induced magnetization switching in the perpendicular direction
under the assistance of magnetic fields was demonstrated. These pioneering
results may open a new window of electric-field controlled spintronics devices.
