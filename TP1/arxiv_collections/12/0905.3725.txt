We report a tunable single-photon source based on a single trapped ion.
Employing spontaneous Raman scattering and in-vacuum optics with large
numerical aperture, single photons are efficiently created with controlled
temporal shape and coherence time. These can be varied between 70 ns and 1.6
$\mu$s, as characterized by operating two sources simultaneously in two remote
ion traps which reveals mutual and individual coherence through two-photon
interference.
