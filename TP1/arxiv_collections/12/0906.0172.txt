We prove a multiplicity result for a class of strongly indefinite nonlinear
second order asymptotically linear systems with Dirichlet boundary conditions.
The key idea for the proof is to bring together the classical shooting method
and the Maslov index of the linear Hamiltonian systems associated to the
asymptotic limits of the given nonlinearity.
