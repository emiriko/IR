We describe searches for $B^0$ meson decays to the charmless final states
$\pi^0 K^0_SK^0_S$, $\eta K^0_S K^0_S$, and $\eta^{\prime}K^0_SK^0_S$. The data
sample corresponds to $467 \times 10^{6}$ $B\bar{B}$ pairs produced in $e^+e^-$
annihilation and collected with the BABAR detector at the SLAC National
Accelerator Laboratory. We find no significant signals and determine the 90%
confidence level upper limits on the branching fractions, in units of
$10^{-7}$, $\cal{B}(B^0 \ra \pi^0K^0_SK^0_S) <9 $, $\cal{B}(B^0 \ra \eta
K^0_SK^0_S) <10$, and $\cal{B}(B^0 \ra \eta^{\prime}K^0_SK^0_S) <20$.
