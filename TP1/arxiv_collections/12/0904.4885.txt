The Monte Carlo model JEWEL 1.0 (Jet Evolution With Energy Loss) simulates
parton shower evolution in the presence of a dense QCD medium. In its current
form medium interactions are modelled as elastic scattering based on
perturbative matrix elements and a simple prescription for medium induced gluon
radiation. The parton shower is interfaced with a hadronisation model. In the
absence of medium effects JEWEL is shown to reproduce jet measurements at LEP.
The collisional energy loss is consistent with analytic calculations, but with
JEWEL we can go a step further and characterise also jet-induced modifications
of the medium. Elastic and inelastic medium interactions are shown to lead to
distinctive modifications of the jet fragmentation pattern, which should allow
to experimentally distinguish between collisional and radiative energy loss
mechanisms. In these proceedings the main JEWEL results are summarised and a
Monte Carlo algorithm is outlined that allows to include the
Landau-Pomerantschuk-Migdal effect in probabilistic frameworks.
