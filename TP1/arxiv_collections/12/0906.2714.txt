We study some spring mass models for a structure having a unilateral spring
of small rigidity $\epsilon$. We obtain and justify an asymptotic expansion
with the method of strained coordinates with new tools to handle such defects,
including a non negligible cumulative effect over a long time: $T_\eps \sim
\eps^{-1}$ as usual; or, for a new critical case, we can only expect: $T_\eps
\sim \eps^{-1/2}$. We check numerically these results and present a purely
numerical algorithm to compute "Non linear Normal Modes" (NNM); this algorithm
provides results close to the asymptotic expansions but enables to compute NNM
even when $\epsilon$ becomes larger.
