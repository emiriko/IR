A large class of fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states can be classified
according to their pattern of zeros, which describes the order of zeros in
ground state wave functions as various clusters of electrons are brought
together. The pattern-of-zeros approach can be generalized to systematically
classify multilayer/spin-unpolarized FQH states, which has led to the
construction of a class of non-Abelian multicomponent FQH states. Here we
discuss some of the simplest non-Abelian two-component states that we find and
the possibility of their experimental realization in bilayer systems at $\nu =
2/3$, 4/5, 4/7, 4/9, 1/4, etc.
