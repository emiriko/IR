The transition pion-photon form factor is studied within the framework of
Light-Cone QCD Sum Rules. The spectral density for the next-to-leading order
corrections is calculated for any Gegenbauer harmonic. At the level of the
next-to-next-to-leading (NNLO) radiative corrections, only that part of the
hard-scattering amplitude is included that is proportional to the
$\beta$-function, taking into account the leading zeroth-order harmonic. The
relative size of the NNLO contribution in the prediction for the form factor
$F^{\gamma^{*}\gamma\pi}(Q^2)$ has been analyzed, making use of the BLM
scale-setting procedure. In addition, predictions for the form factor
$F^{\gamma^{*}\rho\pi}$ are obtained that turn out to be sensitive to the
endpoint behavior of the pion distribution amplitude, thus providing in
connection with experimental data an additional adjudicator for the pion
distribution amplitude. In a note added, we comment on the preliminary
high-$Q^2$ BaBar data on $F^{\gamma^{*}\gamma\pi}$ arguing that the significant
growth of the form factor between 10 and 40 GeV$^2$ cannot be explained in
terms of higher-order perturbative corrections at the NNLO.
