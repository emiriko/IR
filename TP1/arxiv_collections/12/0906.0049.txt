This work-in-progress focuses on the refinement of application of the
intensional logic to cyberforensic analysis and its benefits are compared with
the finite-state automata approach. This work extends the use of the scientific
intensional programming paradigm onto modeling and implementation of a
cyberforensics investigation process with the backtrace of event
reconstruction, modeling the evidence as multidimensional hierarchical
contexts, and proving or disproving the claims with it in the intensional
manner of evaluation. This is a practical, context-aware improvement over the
finite state automata (FSA) approach we have seen in the related works. As a
base implementation language model we use in this approach is a new dialect of
the Lucid programming language, that we call Forensic Lucid and in this paper
we focus on defining hierarchical contexts based on the intensional logic for
the evaluation of cyberforensic expressions.
