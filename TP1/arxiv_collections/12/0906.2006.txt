We present a spectroscopic study of the stellar cluster population of M82,
the archetype starburst galaxy, based primarily on new Gemini-North
multi-object spectroscopy of 49 star clusters. These observations constitute
the largest to date spectroscopic dataset of extragalactic young clusters,
giving virtually continuous coverage across the galaxy; we use these data to
deduce information about the clusters as well as the M82 post-starburst disk
and nuclear starburst environments. Spectroscopic age-dating places clusters in
the nucleus and disk between (7, 15) and (30, 270) Myr, with distribution peaks
at ~10 and ~140 Myr respectively. We find cluster radial velocities in the
range (-160, 220) km/s (wrt the galaxy centre) and line of sight Na I D
interstellar absorption line velocities in (-75, 200) km/s, in many cases
entirely decoupled from the clusters. As the disk cluster radial velocities lie
on the flat part of the galaxy rotation curve, we conclude that they comprise a
regularly orbiting system. Our observations suggest that the largest part of
the population was created as a result of the close encounter with M81 ~220 Myr
ago. Clusters in the nucleus are found in solid body rotation on the bar. The
possible detection of WR features in their spectra indicates that cluster
formation continues in the central starburst zone. We also report the potential
discovery of two old populous clusters in the halo of M82, aged >8 Gyr. Using
these measurements and simple dynamical considerations, we derive a toy model
for the invisible physical structure of the galaxy, and confirm the existence
of two dominant spiral arms.
