In this article, we review recent progresses on the holographic
understandings of the entanglement entropy in the AdS/CFT correspondence. After
reviewing the general idea of holographic entanglement entropy, we will explain
its applications to confinement/deconfinement phase transitions, black hole
entropy and covariant formulation of holography.
