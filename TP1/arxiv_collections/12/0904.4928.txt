There is now ample evidence that the interstellar thick disks of spiral
galaxies are dusty. Although the majority of extraplanar gas in the first few
kiloparsecs above the plane of a spiral galaxy is matter that has been expelled
from the thin disk, the feedback-driven expulsion does not destroy dust grains
altogether (and there is not yet any good measure suggesting it changes the
dust-to-gas mass ratio). Direct optical imaging of a majority of edge-on spiral
galaxies shows large numbers of dusty clouds populating the thick disk to
heights z~2 kpc. These observations are likely revealing a cold, dense phase of
the thick disk interstellar medium. New observations in the mid-infrared show
emission from traditional grains and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in
the thick disks of spiral galaxies. PAHs are found to have large scale heights
and to arise both in the dense dusty clouds traced through direct optical
imaging and in the diffuse ionized gas. In this contribution, we briefly
summarize these probes of dust in the thick disks of spiral galaxies. We also
argue that not only can dust can be used to trace extraplanar material that has
come from within the thick disk, but that its absence can be a marker for newly
accreted matter from the circumgalactic or intergalactic medium. Thus,
observations of dust can perhaps provide a quantitative measure of the
importance of "outflow versus infall" in spiral galaxies.
