The crystal structure of the layered iron arsenide Sr3Sc2O5Fe2As2 was
determined between 300 and 10 K. The lattice parameters of the tetragonal cell
decrease anisotropically according to delta(c)/c : delta(a)/a = 4.2, which
results in a slight flattening of the As-Fe-As bond angle within the FeAs
layers. No indication of a structural instability could be detected. 57Fe
Moessbauer spectroscopic data show a single signal at 4.2, 77, and 298 K,
respectively, subjected to quadrupole splitting. The isomer shift increases
from 0.36(1) mm/s at 298 K to 0.49(1) mm/s at 4.2 K. No indication for magnetic
ordering was found.
