Equilibrium molecular dynamics simulation and the Green-Kubo formalism were
used to calculate self-diffusion coefficient, shear viscosity,and thermal
conductivity for 30 different quadrupolar two-center Lennard-Jones fluids along
the bubble line and in the homogeneous liquid. It was systematically
investigated how anisotropy, i.e. elongation, and quadrupole momentum influence
the transport properties. The reduced elongation L* was varied from 0 to 0.8
and the reduced squared quadrupole momentum Q*2 from 0 to 4, i.e. in the entire
range in which parameters for real fluids are expected. The statistical
uncertainty of the reported data varies with transport property, for
self-diffusion coefficient data the error bars are typically lower than 3 %,
for shear viscosity and thermal conductivity they are about 8 and 12 %,
respectively.
