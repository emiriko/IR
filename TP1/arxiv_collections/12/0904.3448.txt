We introduce several infinite families of new critical exponents for the
random-cluster model and present scaling arguments relating them to the k-arm
exponents. We then present Monte Carlo simulations confirming these
predictions. These new exponents provide a convenient way to determine k-arm
exponents from Monte Carlo simulations. An understanding of these exponents
also leads to a radically improved implementation of the Sweeny Monte Carlo
algorithm. In addition, our Monte Carlo data allow us to conjecture an exact
expression for the shortest-path fractal dimension d_min in two dimensions:
d_min = (g+2)(g+18)/(32g) where g is the Coulomb-gas coupling, related to the
cluster fugacity q via q = 2 + 2 cos(g\pi/2) with 2 \le g \le 4.
