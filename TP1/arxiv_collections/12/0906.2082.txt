We present recent measurements of the CKM angle alpha using data collected by
the BABAR detector at the PEP-II asymmetric-energy e^+e^- collider at the SLAC
National Accelerator Laboratory, operating at the Upsilon(4S) resonance. We
present constraints on alpha from B->pipi, B->rhorho and B->rhopi decays.
