In this paper we consider several constrained activity scheduling problems in
the time and space domains, like finding activity orderings which optimize the
values of several objective functions (time scheduling) or finding optimal
locations where certain types of activities will take place (space scheduling).
We present novel, efficient algorithmic solutions for all the considered
problems, based on the dynamic programming and greedy techniques. In each case
we compute exact, optimal solutions.
