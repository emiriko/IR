The ability to render objects invisible using a cloak - not detectable by an
external observer - for concealing objects has been a tantalizing goal1-6.
Here, we demonstrate a cloak operating in the near infrared at a wavelength of
1550 nm. The cloak conceals a deformation on a flat reflecting surface, under
which an object can be hidden. The device has an area of 225 um2 and hides a
region of 1.6 um2. It is composed of nanometre size silicon structures with
spatially varying densities across the cloak. The density variation is defined
using transformation optics to define the effective index distribution of the
cloak.
