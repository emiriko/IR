In this paper we study the embedding of Riemannian manifolds in low
codimension. The well-known result of Nash and Kuiper says that any short
embedding in codimension one can be uniformly approximated by $C^1$ isometric
embeddings. This statement clearly cannot be true for $C^2$ embeddings in
general, due to the classical rigidity in the Weyl problem. In fact Borisov
extended the latter to embeddings of class $C^{1,\alpha}$ with $\alpha>2/3$. On
the other hand he announced in that the Nash-Kuiper statement can be extended
to local $C^{1,\alpha}$ embeddings with $\alpha<(1+n+n^2)^{-1}$, where $n$ is
the dimension of the manifold, provided the metric is analytic. Subsequently a
proof of the 2-dimensional case appeared. In this paper we provide analytic
proofs of all these statements, for general dimension and general metric.
