Drawing from todays best-in-class solutions, we identify power-saving
strategies that have succeeded in the past and look forward to new ideas and
paradigms. We strongly believe that designing energy-efficient network
equipment can be compared to building sports cars, task-oriented, focused and
fast. However, unlike track-bound sports cars, ultra-fast and purpose-built
silicon yields better energy efficiency when compared to more generic family
sedan designs that mitigate go-to-market risks by being the masters of many
tasks. Thus, we demonstrate that the best opportunities for power savings come
via protocol simplification, best-of-breed technology, and silicon and software
optimization, to achieve the least amount of processing necessary to move
packets. We also look to the future of networking from a new angle, where
energy efficiency and environmental concerns are viewed as fundamental design
criteria and forces that need to be harnessed to continually create more
powerful networking equipment.
