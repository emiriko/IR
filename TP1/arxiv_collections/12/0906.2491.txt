Considered here are Boussinesq systems of equations of surface water wave
theory over a variable bottom. A simplified such Boussinesq system is derived
and solved numerically by the standard Galerkin-finite element method. We study
by numerical means the generation of tsunami waves due to bottom deformation
and we compare the results with analytical solutions of the linearized Euler
equations. Moreover, we study tsunami wave propagation in the case of the Java
2006 event, comparing the results of the Boussinesq model with those produced
by the finite difference code MOST, that solves the shallow water wave
equations.
