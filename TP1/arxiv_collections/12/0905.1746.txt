Consider a smooth, projective family of canonically polarized varieties over
a smooth, quasi-projective base manifold Y, all defined over the complex
numbers. It has been conjectured that the family is necessarily isotrivial if Y
is special in the sense of Campana. We prove the conjecture when Y is a surface
or threefold.
  The proof uses sheaves of symmetric differentials associated to fractional
boundary divisors on log canonical spaces, as introduced by Campana in his
theory of Orbifoldes Geometriques. We discuss a weak variant of the
Harder-Narasimhan Filtration and prove a version of the Bogomolov-Sommese
Vanishing Theorem that take the additional fractional positivity along the
boundary into account. A brief, but self-contained introduction to Campana's
theory is included for the reader's convenience.
