The dynamics of cold atoms in conservative optical lattices obviously depends
on the geometry of the lattice. But very similar lattices may lead to deeply
different dynamics. For example, in a 2D optical lattice with a square mesh,
the sign of the detuning plays a crucial role: in the blue detuned case,
trajectories of an atom inside a well are chaotic for high enough energies. On
the contrary, in the red detuned case, chaos is completely inhibited inside the
wells. Here, we study in details the dynamical regimes of atoms inside a well
of a red detuned lattice, with the aim to understand the dynamical mechanisms
leading to the disappearance of chaos. We show that the motions in the two
directions of space are frequency locked in most of the phase space, for most
of the parameters of the lattice and atoms. This synchronization, not as strict
as that of a dissipative system, is nevertheless a mechanism powerful enough to
explain that chaos cannot appear in red detuned lattices.
