The formation of quantum computer test structures in silicon by ion
implantation enables the characterization of spin readout mechanisms with
ensembles of dopant atoms and the development of single atom devices. We
briefly review recent results in the characterization of spin dependent
transport and single ion doping and then discuss the diffusion and segregation
behaviour of phosphorus, antimony and bismuth ions from low fluence, low energy
implantations as characterized through depth profiling by secondary ion mass
spectrometry (SIMS). Both phosphorus and bismuth are found to segregate to the
SiO2/Si interface during activation anneals, while antimony diffusion is found
to be minimal. An effect of the ion charge state on the range of antimony ions,
121Sb25+, in SiO2/Si is also discussed.
