We investigate the momentum given to a protoneutron star, the pulsar kick,
during the first 10 seconds after temperature equilibrium is reached. Using a
model with two sterile neutrinos obtained by fits to the MiniBoone and LSND
experiments there is a large mixing angle, and the effective volume for
emission is calculated. Using formulations with neutrinos created by URCA
processes in a strong magnetic field, so the lowest Landau level has a sizable
probability, we find that with known paramenters the asymmetric sterile
neutrino emissivity might account for large pulsar kicks.
