We study non-linear dc transport in graphene using a hydrodynamic approach
and conclude that in clean samples the drift velocity saturates at a weakly
density-dependent value v_{sat} ~ 10^7 cm/s. We show that saturation results
from the interactions between graphene's Dirac quasi-particles and both
acoustic and optical phonons. Saturation is accompanied by substantial electron
heating and is not reached at realistic driving fields in moderately or
strongly disordered samples. We find that it is essential to account for
interactions among graphene's Dirac quasi-particles, which increase the linear
response resistivity at high temperatures or low densities.
