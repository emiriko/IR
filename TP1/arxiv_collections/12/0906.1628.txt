We report the crystal structure and unconventional magnetic ordering of
Cs_2Cu_3CeF_{12}, which is composed of buckled kagome lattice of Cu^{2+} ions.
The exchange network in the buckled kagome lattice is fairly anisotropic, so
that the present spin system can be divided into two subsystems: alternating
Heisenberg chains with strong antiferromagnetic exchange interactions and
dangling spins. Although the direct exchange interactions between neighboring
spins were found to be all antiferromagnetic, ferromagnetic magnetic ordering
of the dangling spins was observed. Magnetization exhibits a plateau at
one-third of the saturation magnetization. These observations can be understood
in terms of the indirect interaction between dangling spins mediated by the
chain spin.
