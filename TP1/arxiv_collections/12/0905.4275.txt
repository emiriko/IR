We have searched for variable stars in deep V-band images of a field towards
the Galactic plane in Carina. The images were taken with VIMOS instrument at
ESO VLT during 4 contiguous nights in April 2005. We detected 348 variables
among 50897 stars in the magnitude range between V=15.4 and V=24.5 mag. Upon
detection, we classified the variables by direct eye inspection of their light
curves. All variable objects but 9 OGLE transits in the field are new
discoveries. We provide a complete catalog of all variables which includes
eclipsing/ellipsoidal binaries, miscellaneous pulsators (mostly delta
Scuti-type variables), stars with flares and other (irregular and likely
long-period) variables. Only two of the stars in our sample are known to host
planets. Our result give some implications for future large variability
surveys.
