This article presents the results of a study which concerns Instrumented
Collective Learning Situations (ICLS) used in higher education and according to
different actors's point of view (instructional designer and tutor). Considered
actors have been involved in ICLS conception or in their use with students. We
determine several forms of ICLS (in terms of scenario, tools, kind of activity)
and what educational approaches are adopted by educational actors in their
practices. We detail the results of our study, mainly by highlighting the
"home-made" approach of the actors, that is based on an opportunist and
pragmatic use of available tools in order to fit into the educational contexts.
