This paper studies the leading chiral corrections to heavy quark-diquark
symmetry predictions for doubly heavy baryon semileptonic decay form factors.
We derive the coupling between heavy diquarks and weak current in the limit of
heavy quark-diquark symmetry, and construct the chiral Lagrangian for doubly
heavy baryons coupled to weak current. We evaluate chiral corrections to doubly
heavy baryon zero-recoil semileptonic decay for both unquenched and partially
quenched QCD. This theory is used to derive chiral extrapolation expressions
for measurements of form factors of doubly heavy baryon zero-recoil
semileptonic decay in lattice QCD simulations.
