We study the properties of two-color nonlinear localized modes which may
exist at the interfaces separating two different periodic photonic lattices in
quadratic media, focussing on the impact of phase mismatch of the photonic
lattices on the properties, stability, and threshold power requirements for the
generation of interface localized modes. We employ both an effective discrete
model and continuum model with periodic potential and find good qualitative
agreement between both models. Dynamics excitation of interface modes shows
that, a two-color interface twisted mode splits into two beams with different
escaping angles and carrying different energies when entering a uniform medium
from the quadratic photonic lattice. The output position and energy contents of
each two-color interface solitons can be controlled by judicious tuning of
