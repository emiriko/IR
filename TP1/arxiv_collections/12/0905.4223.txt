Before the age of modern photographic and CCD observations alpha Cassiopeiae
was labelled as a variable star, though this variability has not been seen with
modern instrumentation. We present an analysis of 3 years of high precision
space-based photometric measurements of the suspected variable star alpha
Cassiopeiae, obtained by the broad band Solar Mass Ejection Imager (SMEI)
instrument on board the Coriolis satellite. Over the 3 years of observations
the star appears to not show any significant variability. Also, data from the
Hipparcos epoch photometry annex shows no significant variability.
