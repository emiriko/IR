We discovered that when circularly polarized light is obliquely incident on a
two-dimensional metallic photonic crystal slabs, electrical voltage is induced
perpendicularly to the incident plane. Signal sign is reversed by changing the
sense of polarization or incident angle. The origin of this transverse
photo-induced voltage is explained in terms of the force linear in light
intensity induced by the asymmetry brought by angular momentum of incident
light.
