We compare the observed splitting in the PL spectrum of a strongly coupled
light-matter system, with the splitting of its dressed modes. In the presence
of non-negligible decoherence, the two may differ considerably. Whereas the
dressed mode splitting has a simple expression, the observed splitting has no
general analytical expression in terms of radicals of the system parameters.
