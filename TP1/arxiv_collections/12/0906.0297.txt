We elucidate the physics of the dynamical transition via 10-100ns molecular
dynamics simulations at temperatures spanning 160-300K. By tracking the energy
fluctuations, we show that the protein dynamical transition is marked by a
cross-over from piecewise stationary to stationary processes that underlie the
dynamics of protein motions. A two-time-scale function captures the
non-exponential character of backbone structural relaxations. One is attributed
to the collective segmental motions and the other to local relaxations. The
former is well-defined by a single-exponential, nanosecond decay, operative at
all temperatures. The latter is described by a set of processes that display a
distribution of time-scales. Though their average remains on the picosecond
time-scale, the distribution is markedly contracted at the onset of the
transition. The collective motions are shown to impose bounds on time-scales
spanned by local dynamical processes. The piecewise stationary character below
the transition implicates the presence of a collection of sub-states whose
interactions are restricted. At these temperatures, a wide distribution of
local motion time-scales, extending beyond that of nanoseconds is observed. At
physiological temperatures, local motions are confined to time-scales faster
than nanoseconds. This relatively narrow window makes possible the appearance
of multiple channels for the backbone dynamics to operate.
