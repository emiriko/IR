We discuss the emergence of a spontaneous temperature and critical current
spatial modulation in current-carrying high temperature superconducting wire.
The modulation of the critical current along the wire on a scale of 3 - 10 mm
forces a fraction of the transport current to crisscross the resistive
interface between the superconducting film and normal metal stabilizer attached
to it. This generates additional heat that allows such a structure to be self
sustainable. Stability and the conditions for experimental observation of this
phenomenon are also discussed.
