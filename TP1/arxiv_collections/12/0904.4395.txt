Hartree-Fock atom in a strong electric static field is considered. It is
demonstrated that exchange between outer and inner electrons, taken into
account by the so-called Fock term affects strongly the long-range behavior of
the inner electron wave function. As a result, it dramatically increases its
probability to be ionized. A simple model is analyzed demonstrating that the
decay probability, compared to the case of a local (Hartree) atomic potential,
increases by many orders of magnitude. As a result of such increase, the ratio
of inner to outer electrons ionization probability became not too small. It is
essential that the effect of exchange upon probability of inner electron
ionization by strong electric field is proportional to the square of the number
of outer electrons. It signals that in clusters the inner electron ionization
by strong field, the very fact of which is manifested by e.g. high energy
quanta emission, has to be essentially increased as compared to this process in
gaseous atomic objects.
