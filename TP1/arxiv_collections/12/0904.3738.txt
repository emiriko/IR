We show that a degenerate gas of two-species bosonic atoms interacting
through a p-wave Feshbach resonance (as realized in, e.g., a 85Rb-87Rb mixture)
exhibits a finite-momentum atomic-molecular superfluid (AMSF), sandwiched by a
molecular p-wave (orbital spinor) superfluid and by an s-wave atomic superfluid
at large negative and positive detunings, respectively. The magnetic field can
be used to tune the modulation wave vector of the AMSF state, as well as to
drive quantum phase transitions in this rich system.
