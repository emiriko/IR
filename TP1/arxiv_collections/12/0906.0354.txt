In this paper we present two searches for new physics in Upsilon(3S) decays
collected by the BABAR detector. We search for charged lepton-flavour violating
decays of the Upsilon(3S), which are unobservable in the Standard Model but are
predicted to occur in several beyond-the-Standard Model scenarios. We also
search for production of a light Higgs or Higgs-like state produced in
radiative decays of the Upsilon(3S) and decaying to muon pairs.
