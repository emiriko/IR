The collective interactions of many partons in the first stage of the
collisions is the usual accepted explanation of the sizable elliptical flow.
The clustering of color sources provides a framework of partonic interactions.
In this scheme, we show a reasonable agreement with RHIC data for pT<1.5 GeV/c
in both the dependence of v2 transverse momentum and in the shape of the
nuclear modified factor on the azimuthal angle for different centralities. We
show the predictions at LHC energies for Pb-Pb. In the case of proton-proton
collisions a sizable v2 is obtained at this energy.
