Braids groups provide an alternative to number theoretic public cryptography
and can be implemented quite efficiently. The paper proposes five signature
schemes: Proxy Signature, Designated Verifier, Bi-Designated Verifier,
Designated Verifier Proxy Signature And Bi-Designated Verifier Proxy Signature
scheme based on braid groups. We also discuss the security aspects of each of
the proposed schemes.
