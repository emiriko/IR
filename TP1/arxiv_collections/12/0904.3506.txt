We investigate the addition spectrum of a graphene quantum dot in the
vicinity of the electron-hole crossover as a function of perpendicular magnetic
field. Coulomb blockade resonances of the 50 nm wide dot are visible at all
gate voltages across the transport gap ranging from hole to electron transport.
The magnetic field dependence of more than 50 states displays the unique
complex evolution of the diamagnetic spectrum of a graphene dot from the
low-field regime to the Landau regime with the n=0 Landau level situated in the
center of the transport gap marking the electron-hole crossover. The average
peak spacing in the energy region around the crossover decreases with
increasing magnetic field. In the vicinity of the charge neutrality point we
observe a well resolved and rich excited state spectrum.
