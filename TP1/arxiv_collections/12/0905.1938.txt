We consider the transport and the noise characteristics for the case of a
T-shape double quantum dot system using the equation of motion method. Our
theoretical results, obtained in an approximation equivalent to the
Hartree-Fock approximation, account for non-zero on-site Coulomb interaction in
both the detector and side dots. The existence of a non-zero Coulomb
interaction implies an additional two resonances in the detector's dot density
of states and thereafter affects the electronic transport properties of the
system. The system's conductance presents two Fano dips as function of the
energy of the localized electronic level in the side dot. The Fano dips in the
system's conductance can be observed both for strong (fast detector) and weak
coupling (slow detector) between the detector dot and the external electrodes.
Due to stronger electronic correlations the noise characteristics in the case
of a slow detector are much higher. This setup may be of interest for the
practical realization of qubit states in quantum dots systems.
