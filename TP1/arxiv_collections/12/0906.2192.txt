We consider a simple extension to the previously found gravity solution
corresponding to a boost invariant Bjorken plasma, by allowing components that
are asymmetric under parity flipping of the spacetime rapidity. Besides the
question whether this may have a realization in collisions of different species
of projectiles, such as lead-gold collision, our new time dependent gravity
background can serve as a test ground for the recently proposed second order
conformal viscous hydrodynamics. We find that non-trivial parity-asymmetric
effects start to appear at second order in late time expansion, and we map the
corresponding energy-momentum tensor to the second order conformal
hydrodynamics to find certain second order transport coefficients. Our results
are in agreement with the previous results in literature, giving one more
corroborative evidence for the validity of the framework.
