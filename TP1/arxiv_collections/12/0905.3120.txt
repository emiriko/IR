Compact binary coalescence (CBC) is one of the most promising sources of
gravitational waves. These sources are usually searched for with matched
filters which require accurate calculation of the GW waveforms and generation
of large template banks. We present a complementary search technique based on
algorithms used in un-modeled searches. Initially designed for detection of
un-modeled bursts, which can span a very large set of waveform morphologies,
the search algorithm presented here is constrained for targeted detection of
the smaller subset of CBC signals. The constraint is based on the assumption of
elliptical polarisation for signals received at the detector. We expect that
the algorithm is sensitive to CBC signals in a wide range of masses, mass
ratios, and spin parameters. In preparation for the analysis of data from the
fifth LIGO-Virgo science run (S5), we performed preliminary studies of the
algorithm on test data. We present the sensitivity of the search to different
types of simulated CBC waveforms. Also, we discuss how to extend the results of
the test run into a search over all of the current LIGO-Virgo data set.
