In this work - the second of a pair of articles - we consider transport
through spatially symmetric quantum dots with leads whose widths or positions
do not obey the spatial symmetry. We use the semiclassical theory of transport
to find the symmetry-induced contributions to weak localization corrections and
universal conductance fluctuations for dots with left-right, up-down, inversion
and four-fold symmetries. We show that all these contributions are suppressed
by asymmetric leads, however they remain finite whenever leads intersect with
their images under the symmetry operation. For an up-down symmetric dot, this
means that the contributions can be finite even if one of the leads is
completely asymmetric. We find that the suppression of the contributions to
universal conductance fluctuations is the square of the suppression of
contributions to weak localization. Finally, we develop a random-matrix theory
model which enables us to numerically confirm these results.
