We derive the fully retarded energy shift of a neutral atom in two different
geometries useful for modelling etched microstructures. First we calculate the
energy shift due to a reflecting cylindrical wire, and then we work out the
energy shift due to a semi-infinite reflecting half-plane. We analyze the
results for the wire in various limits of the wire radius and the distance of
the atom from the wire, and obtain simple asymptotic expressions useful for
estimates. For the half-plane we find an exact representation of the
Casimir-Polder interaction in terms of a single, fast converging integral,
which is easy to evaluate numerically.
