A method to generate new classes of random matrix ensembles is proposed.
Random matrices from these ensembles are Lax matrices of classically integrable
systems with a certain distribution of momenta and coordinates. The existence
of an integrable structure permits to calculate the joint distribution of
eigenvalues for these matrices analytically. Spectral statistics of these
ensembles are quite unusual and in many cases give rigorously new examples of
intermediate statistics.
