We use extensive DMRG calculations to show that a classification of SU(n)
spin chains with regard to the existence of spinon confinement and hence a
Haldane gap obtained previously for valence bond solid models applies to SU(n)
Heisenberg chains as well. In particular, we observe spinon confinement due to
a next-nearest neighbor interaction in the SU(4) representation 10 spin chain.
