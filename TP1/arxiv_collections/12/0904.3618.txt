Zero and longitudinal field $\mu$SR measurements in Pb$_2$VO(PO$_4$)$_2$ and
BaCdVO(PO$_4$)$_2$, two prototypes of the frustrated $S=1/2$ square lattice
model with competing ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions, are
presented. Both systems are observed to undergo a phase transition to a
long-range magnetic order at $T_N\simeq 3.46$ K, for Pb$_2$VO(PO$_4$)$_2$, and
at $T_N\simeq 0.99$ K, for BaCdVO(PO$_4$)$_2$. In Pb$_2$VO(PO$_4$)$_2$ both the
temperature dependence of the order parameter and the longitudinal relaxation
rate above $T_N$ are consistent with a two-dimensional XY model. On the other
hand, for BaCdVO(PO$_4$)$_2$, which lies very close to the magnetically
disordered region of the phase diagram where a bond-nematic order was
predicted, a peculiar logarithmic increase of the relaxation is observed above
$T_N$. In both systems a rather broad distribution of internal fields at the
muon sites is noticed below $T_N$. The origin of this distribution is discussed
in the light of the $\mu$SR experiments already performed on $S=1/2$ frustrated
antiferromagnets on a square lattice.
