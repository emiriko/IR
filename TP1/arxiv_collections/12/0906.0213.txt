For dissipation-free photon-photon interaction at the single photon level, we
analyze one-photon transition and two-photon transition induced by photon pairs
in three-level atoms using two-photon wavefunctions. We show that the
two-photon absorption can be substantially enhanced by adjusting the time
correlation of photon pairs. We study two typical cases: Gaussian wavefunction
and rectangular wavefunction. In the latter, we find that under special
conditions one-photon transition is completely suppressed while the high
probability of two-photon transition is maintained.
