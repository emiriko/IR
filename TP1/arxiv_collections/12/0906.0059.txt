We study the emergent role of many-body effects on a two dimensional electron
gas (2DEG) within the Thomas-Fermi-Poisson approximation, including both the
exchange and correlation interactions in the presence of a strong perpendicular
magnetic field. It is shown that, the indirect interactions widen the
odd-integer incompressible strips spatially, whereas the even-integer filling
factors almost remain unaffected.
