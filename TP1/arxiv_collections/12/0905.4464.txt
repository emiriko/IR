An overview of the recent measurements of the top antitop quark pair
production cross section in proton antiproton collisions at \sqrt{s}=1.96 TeV
in lepton + jets and dilepton final states is presented. These measurements are
based on 1 -- 2.8 fb^{-1} of data collected with the D0 and CDF experiments at
the Fermilab Tevatron collider. The cross section is measured with a precision
close to 8% and found to be compatible with the standard model prediction.
Interpretations of the cross-section measurements for charge higgs search and
for top quark mass measurement are also discussed.
