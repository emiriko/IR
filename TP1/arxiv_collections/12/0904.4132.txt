Wigner and Serber symmetries for the two-nucleon system provide unique
examples of long distance symmetries in Nuclear Physics, i.e. symmetries of the
meson exchange forces broken only at arbitrarily small distances. We analyze
the large Nc picture as a key ingredient to understand these, so far
accidental, symmetries from a more fundamental viewpoint. A set of sum rules
for NN phase-shifts, NN potentials and coarse grained V_lowk NN potentials can
be derived showing Wigner SU(4) and Serber symmetries not to be fully
compatible everywhere. The symmetry breaking pattern found from the partial
wave analysis data, high quality potentials in coordinate space at long
distances and their V_lowk relatives is analyzed on the light of large N(c)
contracted SU(4) symmetry. Our results suggest using large Nc potentials as
long distance ones for the two-nucleon system where the meson exchange
potential picture is justified and known to be consistent with large Nc
counting rules. We also show that potentials based on chiral expansions do not
embody the Wigner and Serber symmetries nor do they scale properly with Nc. We
implement the One Boson Exchange potential realization saturated with their
leading Nc contributions due to pi,sigma,rho and omega mesons. The short
distance 1/r^3 singularities stemming from the tensor force can be handled by
renormalization of the Schrodinger equation. A good description of deuteron
properties and deuteron electromagnetic form factors in the impulse
approximation for realistic values of the meson-nucleon couplings is achieved
