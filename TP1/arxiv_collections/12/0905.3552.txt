Aims. To study at multiple frequencies the radio emission arising from the
massive galaxy cluster MACS J0717.5+3745 (z=0.55). Known to be an extremely
complex cluster merger, the system is uniquely suited for an investigation of
the phenomena at work in the intra-cluster medium (ICM) during cluster
collisions. Methods. We use multi-frequency and multi-resolution data obtained
with the Very Large Array radio telescope, and X-ray features revealed by
Chandra, to probe the non-thermal and thermal components of the ICM, their
relations and interactions. Results. The cluster shows highly complex radio
emission. A bright, giant radio halo is detected at frequencies as high as 4.8
GHz. MACS J0717.5+3745 is the most distant cluster currently known to host a
radio halo. This radio halo is also the most powerful ever observed, and the
second case for which polarized radio emission has been detected, indicating
that the magnetic field is ordered on large scales.
