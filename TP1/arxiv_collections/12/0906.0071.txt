Let $X_1,..., X_n$ be independent, uniformly random points from $[0,1]^2$. We
prove that if we add edges between these points one by one by order of
increasing edge length then, with probability tending to 1 as the number of
points $n$ tends to $\infty$, the resulting graph gets its first Hamilton cycle
at exactly the same time it loses its last vertex of degree less than two. This
answers an open question of Penrose and provides an analogue for the random
geometric graph of a celebrated result of Ajtai, Koml\'os and Szemer\'edi and
independently of Bollob\'as on the usual random graph. We are also able to
deduce very precise information on the limiting probability that the random
geometric graph is Hamiltonian analogous to a result of Koml\'os and
Szemer{\'e}di on the usual random graph. The proof generalizes to uniform
random points on the $d$-dimensional hypercube where the edge-lengths are
measured using the $l_p$-norm for some $1<p\leq\infty$. The proof can also be
adapted to show that, with probability tending to 1 as the number of points $n$
tends to $\infty$, there are cycles of all lengths between 3 and $n$ at the
moment the graph loses its last vertex of degree less than two.
