This work verifies the principle that gravitation is caused by {\it energy}
and not simply by mass alone. A model is proposed in which cosmic ray protons
flow radially through the galaxy. The resulting electric field energy creates a
gravitational force, in addition to the conventional Newtonian force. The model
yields a rotation curve that agrees in detail with the experimental curve. The
total electric field energy is calculated. It is the missing mass of the
galaxy.
