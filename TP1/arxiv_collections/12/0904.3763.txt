A sampling procedure to compute exactly the rate of activated processes
arising in systems at equilibrium or nonequilibrium steady state is presented.
The procedure is a generalization of the method in [A. Warmflash, P.
Bhimalapuram, and A. R. Dinner, J. Chem. Phys., 127, 154112 (2007); A. Dickson,
A. Warmflash, and A. R. Dinner, J. Chem. Phys., 130, 074104 (2009)] in which
one performs simulations restricted into cells by using a reinjection rule at
the boundaries of the cells which is consistent with the exact probability
fluxes through these boundaries. Our generalization uses results from
transition path theory which indicate how to twist the dynamics to calculate
reaction rates.
