We study the pseudoduality transformation on the symmetric space sigma
models. We switch the Lie group valued pseudoduality equations to Lie algebra
valued ones, which leads to an infinite number of pseudoduality equations. We
obtain an infinite number of conserved currents on the tangent bundle of the
pseudodual manifold. We show that there can be mixing of decomposed spaces with
each other, which leads to mixings of the following expressions. We obtain the
mixing forms of curvature relations and one loop renormalization group beta
functions by means of these currents.
