Recent PAMELA and ATIC data seem to indicate an excess in positron cosmic
rays above approximately 10 GeV which might be due to galactic Dark Matter
particle annihilation. However the background of this signal suffers many
uncertainties that make our task difficult in constraining Dark Matter or any
other astrophysical explanation for these recent surprising data.
