Acoustic waves are one of the primary suspects besides magnetic fields for
the chromospheric heating process to temperatures above radiative equilibrium
(RE). We derived the mechanical wave energy as seen in line-core velocities to
obtain a measure of mechanical energy flux with height for a comparison with
the energy requirements in a semi-empirical atmosphere model. We analyzed a
1-hour time series and a large-area map of Ca II H spectra on the traces of
propagating waves. We analyzed the velocity statistics of several spectral
lines in the wing of Ca II H, and the line-core velocity of Ca II H. We
converted the velocity amplitudes into volume and mass energy densities. For
comparison, we used the increase of internal energy necessary to lift a RE
atmosphere to the HSRA temperature stratification. We find that the velocity
amplitude grows in agreement with linear wave theory and thus slower with
height than predicted from energy conservation. The mechanical energy of the
waves above around z~500 km is insufficient to maintain the chromospheric
temperature rise in the semi-empirical HSRA model. The intensity variations of
the Ca line core (z~1000 km) can be traced back to the velocity variations of
the lowermost forming spectral line considered (z~ 250 km). The chromospheric
intensity, and hence, (radiation) temperature variations are seen to be induced
by passing waves originating in the photosphere.
