Stellar clusters are potential acceleration sites of very-high-energy (VHE, E
> 100GeV) particles since they host supernova remnants (SNRs) and pulsar wind
nebulae (PWNe). Additionally, in stellar clusters, particles can also be
accelerated e.g. at the boundaries of wind-blown bubbles, in colliding wind
zones in massive binary systems or in the framework of collective wind or
wind/supernova(SN) ejecta scenarios. Motivated by the detection of VHE
gamma-ray emission towards Westerlund 2 and assuming similar particle
acceleration mechanisms at work, Westerlund 1 is an even more promising target
for VHE gamma-ray observations given that massive star content and distance are
more favorable for detectable VHE gamma-ray emission compared to Westerlund 2.
Here, H.E.S.S. observations of massive stellar clusters in general with special
emphasis on the most massive stellar cluster in the galaxy, Westerlund 1 are
summarized.
