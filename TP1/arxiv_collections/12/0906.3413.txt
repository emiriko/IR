It is known that the numbers which occur in Apery's proof of the
irrationality of zeta(2) have many interesting congruence properties while the
associated generating function satisfies a second order differential equation.
We prove supercongruences for a generalization of numbers which arise in
Beukers' and Zagier's study of integral solutions of Apery-like differential
equations.
