Biomolecule Visualization with Ellipsoidal Coarse-graining (BioVEC) is a tool
for visualizing molecular dynamics simulation data while allowing
coarse-grained residues to be rendered as ellipsoids. BioVEC reads in
configuration files, which may be output from molecular dynamics simulations
that include orientation output in either quaternion or ANISOU format, and can
render frames of the trajectory in several common image formats for subsequent
concatenation into a movie file. The BioVEC program is written in C++, uses the
OpenGL API for rendering, and is open source. It is lightweight, allows for
user-defined settings for and texture, and runs on either Windows or Linux
platforms.
