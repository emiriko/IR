We present the results of a search for relations between observables that are
independent of the Chiral Pertubation Theory (ChPT) Next-to-Next-to-Leading
Order (NNLO) Low-Energy Constants (LECs). We have found some relations between
observables in $\pi\pi$, $\pi K$ scattering and $K_{l4}$ decay which have been
evaluated numerically using the old fit (fit 10 in [1] of the NLO LECs.
