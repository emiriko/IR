Water Cherenkov Detectors (WCD) are efficient detectors for detecting GRBs in
the 10 GeV - 1 TeV energy range using the single particle technique, given
their sensitivity to low energy secondary photons produced by high energy
photons when cascading in the atmosphere. The Large Aperture GRB Observatory
(LAGO) operates arrays of WCD in high altitude sites (above 4500 m a.s.l.) in
Bolivia, Mexico and Venezuela, with planned extension to Peru. Details on the
operation and stability of these WCD in remote sites with high background rates
of particles will be detailed, and compared to simulations. Specific issues due
to operation at high altitude, atmospheric effects and solar activity, as well
as possible hardware enhancements will also be presented.
