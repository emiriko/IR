We present mid-IR observations from Gemini/TReCS that spatially resolve the
dust emission around SR 21. The protoplanetary disk around SR 21 is believed to
have a cleared gap extending from stellocentric radii of ~0.5 AU to ~20 AU,
based on modeling of the observed spectral energy distribution. Our new
observations resolve the dust emission, and our data are inconsistent with the
previous model. We require the disk to be completely cleared within ~10 AU,
without the hot inner disk spanning ~0.25-0.5 AU posited previously. To fit the
SED and mid-IR imaging data together, we propose a disk model with a large
inner hole, but with a warm companion--possibly surrounded by circumstellar
material of its own--residing near the outer edge of the cleared region. We
also discuss a model with a narrow ring included in a large cleared inner disk
region, and argue that it is difficult to reconcile with the data.
