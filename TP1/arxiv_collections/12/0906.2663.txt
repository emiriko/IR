We present the results from first spectropolarimetric observations of the
solar photosphere acquired at the Dunn Solar Telescope with the Interferometric
Bidimensional Spectrometer. Full Stokes profiles were measured in the Fe I
630.15 nm and Fe I 630.25 nm lines with high spatial and spectral resolutions
for 53 minutes, with a Stokes V noise of 0.003 the continuum intensity level.
The dataset allows us to study the evolution of several magnetic features
associated with G-band bright points in the quiet Sun. Here we focus on the
analysis of three distinct processes, namely the coalescence, fragmentation and
cancellation of G-band bright points. Our analysis is based on a SIR inversion
of the Stokes I and V profiles of both Fe I lines. The high spatial resolution
of the G-band images combined with the inversion results helps to interpret the
undergoing physical processes. The appearance (dissolution) of high-contrast
G-band bright points is found to be related to the local increase (decrease) of
the magnetic filling factor, without appreciable changes in the field strength.
The cancellation of opposite-polarity bright points can be the signature of
either magnetic reconnection or the emergence/submergence of magnetic loops.
