Quantum networks are essential to quantum information distributed
applications, and communicating over them is a key challenge. Complex networks
have rich and intriguing properties, which are as yet unexplored in the quantum
setting. Here, we study the effect of entanglement percolation as a means to
establish long-distance entanglement between arbitrary nodes of quantum complex
networks. We develop a theory to analytically study random graphs with
arbitrary degree distribution and give exact results for some models. Our
findings are in good agreement with numerical simulations and show that the
proposed quantum strategies enhance the percolation threshold substantially.
Simulations also show a clear enhancement in small-world and other real-world
networks.
