According to the so-called ``Quantum Darwinist'' approach, the emergence of
``classical islands'' from a quantum background is assumed to obey a
(selection) principle of maximal information. We illustrate this idea by
considering the coupling of two particles that interact through a
position-dependent potential. This approach sheds a new light on the emergence
of classical logics and of our classical preconceptions about the world. The
distinction between internal and external world, the Cartesian prejudice
according to which the whole can be reduced to the sum of its parts and the
appearance of preferred representation bases such as the position is seen here
as the result of a very long evolution and would correspond to the most useful
way of extracting stable and useful information from the quantum correlations.
