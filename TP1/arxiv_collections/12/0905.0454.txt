In this paper, we present a partial survey of the tools borrowed from tensor
algebra, which have been utilized recently in Statistics and Signal Processing.
It is shown why the decompositions well known in linear algebra can hardly be
extended to tensors. The concept of rank is itself difficult to define, and its
calculation raises difficulties. Numerical algorithms have nevertheless been
developed, and some are reported here, but their limitations are emphasized.
These reports hopefully open research perspectives for enterprising readers.
