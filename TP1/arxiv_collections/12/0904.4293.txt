For the understanding of planetary and stellar dynamos an overview of the
major parameter dependences of convection driven dynamos in rotating spherical
fluid shells is desirable. Although the computationally accessible parameter
space is limited, earlier work is extended with emphasis on higher Prandtl
numbers and uniform heat flux condition at the outer boundary. The transition
from dynamos dominated by non-axisymmetric components of the magnetic field to
those dominated by the axisymmetric components depends on the magnetic Prandtl
number as well as on the ordinary Prandtl number for higher values of the
rotation parameter $\tau$. The dependence of the transition on the latter
parameter is also discussed. A variety of oscillating dynamos is presented and
interpreted in terms of dynamo waves, standing oscillation or modified
relaxation oscillations.
