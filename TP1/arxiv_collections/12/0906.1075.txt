Jet production in electron-proton scattering at HERA provides an important
testing ground for Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). The inclusive jet and
multi-jet cross sections recently measured by H1 and ZEUS collaborations allow
a precise determination of the strong coupling and test of its running.
Additionally, a measurement of the angular correlations in the 3-jet events
gives a handle on the fundamental gauge structure of the QCD.
