The transition form factors of $\bar B_s^0\to D_{s}^+(2317)$ and $\bar
B_s^0\to D_s^+(1968)$ at large recoil region are investigated in the light cone
sum rules approach, where the heavy quark effective theory is adopted to
describe the form factors at small recoil region. With the form factors
obtained, we carry out a detailed analysis on both the semileptonic decays
$\bar B_s^0\to D_s^+(1968,2317) l \bar{\nu}_l$ and nonleptonic decays $B_s \to
D_s^+(1968,2317) M$ with $M$ being a light meson or a charmed meson under the
factorization approach. Our results show that the branching fraction of $\bar
B_s^0\to D_s^+(2317) \mu \bar{\nu}_\mu$ is around $2.3 \times 10^{-3}$, which
should be detectable with ease at the Tevatron and LHC. It is also found that
the branching fractions of $\bar B_s^0\to D_s^+(1968) l \bar{\nu}_l$ are almost
one order larger than those of the corresponding $B_s^0\to D_s^+(2317) l
\bar{\nu}_l$ decays. The consistency of predictions for $B_s \to
D_s^+(1968,2317) L$ ($L$ denotes a light meson) in the factorization assumption
and $k_T$ factorization also supports the success of color transparency
mechanism in the color allowed decay modes. Most two-charmed meson decays of
$B_s$ meson possess quite large branching ratios that are accessible in the
experiments. These channels are of great importance to explore the hadronic
structure of charmed mesons as well as the nonperturbative dynamics of QCD.
