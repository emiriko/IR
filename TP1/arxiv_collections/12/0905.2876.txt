In analogy with values of the classical Euler Gamma-function at rational
numbers and the Riemann zeta-function at positive integers, we consider
Thakur's geometric Gamma-function evaluated at rational arguments and Carlitz
zeta-values at positive integers. We prove that, when considered together, all
of the algebraic relations among these special values arise from the standard
functional equations of the Gamma-function and from the Euler-Carlitz relations
and Frobenius p-th power relations of the zeta-function.
