Using data of three well-observed type-II plateau supernovae (SNe II-P), SNe
1987A, 1999em and 2003hn; and two atmosphere models by Eastman et al. (1996)
and Dessart & Hillier (2005b) we derive calibrations for bolometric corrections
and effective temperature from BVI photometry. The typical scatter of the
bolometric correction is 0.11 mag. With these results we obtain bolometric
light curves and effective temperature evolution for a sample of 33 SNe II-P.
The SN sample shows a range of 1 dex in plateau luminosity and plateau
durations from 75 to 120 days. Comparing the shape of the transition between
the plateau and the radioactive tail, we find that the size of the drop is in
the range of 0.8 to 1.12 dex.
