Here we show that variations of temperature, even of a few degrees in
amplitude, induce the ageing of a granular pile. In particular, we report
measurements of physical properties of a granular heap submitted to thermal
cycles. Namely, we focus on the evolution of the thermal linear-expansion
coefficient and of the thermal conductivity of the pile with the number of
cycles. The present contribution nicely supplements a recent article we
published elsewhere [Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{101}, 148303 (2008)] and
introduces a different and promising method to impose temperature cycles to a
granular pile.
