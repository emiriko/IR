In this paper, we investigate the structure of highest weight modules over
the quantum queer superalgebra $U_q(q(n))$. The key ingredients are the
triangular decomposition of $U_q(q(n))$ and the classification of finite
dimensional irreducible modules over quantum Clifford superalgebras. The main
results we prove are the classical limit theorem and the complete reducibility
theorem for $U_q(q(n))$-modules in the category $O_q^{\geq 0}$.
