In this paper, I study the coarsening dynamics of two-dimensional dry foam
sandwiched by deformable membranes. The time-varying deformation of the
confining membranes gives rise to a significant alteration in the evolution of
polygonal cells of bubbles when compared to the case of rigid membranes. This
alteration is attributed to the correlation between the rate of inter-cell gas
transfer and temporal fluctuation in surface curvature within a cell domain.
The existing material constants are referred to understand the utility of the
correlation effect toward the artificial control of the coarsening dynamics.
