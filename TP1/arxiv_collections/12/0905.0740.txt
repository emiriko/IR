REC (Regular Expression Compiler) is a concise programming language which
allows students to write programs without knowledge of the complicated syntax
of languages like FORTRAN and ALGOL. The language is recursive and contains
only four elements for control. This paper describes an interpreter of REC
written in FORTRAN.
