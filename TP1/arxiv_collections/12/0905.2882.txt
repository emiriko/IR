Our aim in this paper is to analyse the phenotypic effects (evolvability) of
diverse coding conversion operators in an instance of the states based
evolutionary algorithm (SEA). Since the representation of solutions or the
selection of the best encoding during the optimization process has been proved
to be very important for the efficiency of evolutionary algorithms (EAs), we
will discuss a strategy of coupling more than one representation and different
procedures of conversion from one coding to another during the search.
Elsewhere, some EAs try to use multiple representations (SM-GA, SEA, etc.) in
intention to benefit from the characteristics of each of them. In spite of
those results, this paper shows that the change of the representation is also a
crucial approach to take into consideration while attempting to increase the
performances of such EAs. As a demonstrative example, we use a two states SEA
(2-SEA) which has two identical search spaces but different coding conversion
operators. The results show that the way of changing from one coding to another
and not only the choice of the best representation nor the representation
itself is very advantageous and must be taken into account in order to
well-desing and improve EAs execution.
