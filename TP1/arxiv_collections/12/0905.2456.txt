One method to search for particle dark matter is to hunt down its
annihilation products. In the Solar System, three potential types of signals of
annihilation have been identified: neutrinos and gamma-rays from the Sun, and
neutrinos from the Earth. Each of these signals depends sensitively on the
orbital evolution of dark matter once it becomes bound to the Solar System. I
will review progress on characterizing these signals based on recent
improvements in the determination of the properties of the bound dark matter
population.
