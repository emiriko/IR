We study how an oscillating mirror affects the electromagnetically induced
transparency (EIT) of an atomic ensemble, which is confined in a gas cell
placed inside a micro-cavity with an oscillating mirror in one end. The
oscillating mirror is modeled as a quantum mechanical harmonic oscillator. The
cavity field acts as a probe light of the EIT system and also produces a light
pressure on the oscillating mirror. The back-action from the mirror to the
cavity field results in several (from one to five) steady-states for this
atom-assisted optomechanical cavity, producing a complex structure in its EIT.
We calculate the susceptibility with respect to the few (from one to three)
stable solutions found here for the equilibrium positions of the oscillating
mirror. We find that the EIT of the atomic ensemble can be significantly
changed by the oscillating mirror, and also that the various steady states of
the mirror have different effects on the EIT.
