To study the onset of a stationary dynamo in the presence of inner or outer
walls of various electromagnetic properties, we propose a simple 1D-model in
which the flow is replaced by an alpha effect. The equation of dispersion of
the problem is derived analytically. It is solved numerically for walls of
different thicknesses and of electric conductivity and magnetic permeability
different from those of the fluid in motion. We also consider walls in the
limit of infinite conductivity or permeability.
