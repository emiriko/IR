The Binder cumulant at the phase transition of Ising models on square
lattices with ferromagnetic couplings between nearest neighbors and with
competing antiferromagnetic couplings between next--nearest neighbors, along
only one diagonal, is determined using Monte Carlo techniques. In the phase
diagram a disorder line occurs separating regions with monotonically decaying
and with oscillatory spin--spin correlations. Findings on the variation of the
critical cumulant with the ratio of the two interaction strengths are compared
to related recent results based on renormalization group calculations.
