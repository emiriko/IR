Symmetric extendibility of quantum states has recently drawn attention in the
context of quantum cryptography to judge whether quantum states shared between
two distant parties can be purified by means of one-way error correction
protocols. In this letter we study the symmetric extendibility in a specific
class of two-qudit states, i. e. states composed of two d-level systems, in
order to find upper bounds on tolerable error rates for a wide class of
qudit-based quantum cryptographic protocols using two-way error correction. In
important cases these bounds coincide with previously known lower bounds,
thereby proving sharpness of these bounds in arbitrary finite-dimensional
systems.
