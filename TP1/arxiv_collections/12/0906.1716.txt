We study Aldous' conjecture that the spectral gap of the interchange process
on a weighted undirected graph equals the spectral gap of the random walk on
this graph. We present a conjecture in the form of an inequality, and prove
that this inequality implies Aldous' conjecture by combining an interlacing
result for Laplacians of random walks on weighted graphs with representation
theory. We prove the conjectured inequality for several important instances. As
an application of the developed theory, we prove Aldous' conjecture for a large
class of weighted graphs, which includes all wheel graphs, all graphs with four
vertices, certain nonplanar graphs, certain graphs with several weighted cycles
of arbitrary length, as well as all trees.
  Caputo, Liggett, and Richthammer have recently resolved Aldous' conjecture,
after independently and simultaneously discovering the key ideas developed in
the present paper.
