We study the behaviour of the magnetization in a half-metallic
ferromagnet/nonmagnetic insulator/ferromagnetic metal/paramagnetic metal
(FM1/NI/FM2/PM) tunnel junction. It is calculated self-consistently within the
nonequilibrium Keldysh formalism. The magnetic regions are treated as band
ferromagnets and are described by the single-band Hubbard model. We developed a
nonequilibrium spectral density approach to solve the Hubbard model
approximately in the switching magnet. By applying a voltage to the junction it
is possible to switch between antiparallel (AP) and parallel (P) alignment of
the magnetizations of the two ferromagnets. The transition from AP to P occurs
for positive voltages while the inverse transition from P to AP can be induced
by negative voltages only. This behaviour is in agreement with the Slonczewski
model of current-induced switching and appears self-consistently within the
model, i.e. without using half-classical methods like the
Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation.
