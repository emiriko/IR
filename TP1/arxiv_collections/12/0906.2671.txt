We consider a stochastic perturbation of a FitzHugh-Nagumo system. We show
that it is possible to generate oscillations for values of parameters which do
not allow oscillations for the deterministic system. We also study the
appearance of a new equilibrium point and new bifurcation parameters due to the
noisy component.
