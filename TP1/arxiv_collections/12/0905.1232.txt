A Gutzwiller-type variational wave function is proposed for the neutron
resonance mode in the cuprate superconductors. An efficient re-weighting
technique is devised to perform variational Monte Carlo simulation on the
proposed wave function which is composed of linearly superposed Gutzwiller
projected Slater determinants. The calculation, which involves no free
parameter, predicts qualitatively correct behavior for both the energy and the
spectral weight of the resonance mode as functions of doping.
