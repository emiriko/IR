Shear and bulk viscosity and thermal conductivity for argon, krypton, xenon,
and methane and the binary mixtures argon+krypton and argon+methane were
determined by equilibrium molecular dynamics with the Green-Kubo method. The
fluids were modeled by spherical Lennard-Jones pair-potentials with parameters
adjusted to experimental vapor liquid-equilibria data alone. Good agreement
between the predictions from simulation and experimental data is found for
shear viscosity and thermal conductivity of the pure fluids and binary
mixtures. The simulation results for the bulk viscosity show only poor
agreement with experimental data for most fluids, despite good agreement with
other simulations data from the literature. This indicates that presently
available experimental data for the bulk viscosity, a property which is
difficult to measure, are inaccurate.
