Symmetry breaking in Hsub2, quantified with Kratzer bond theory, leads to
vibrational levels with errors of only 0,00008 %. For quanta, 0,0011 % errors
are smaller than with any ab initio QM method. Chiral behavior of covalent bond
Hsub2 implies bonding between left- and right-handed atoms HsubL and HsubR or
between hydrogen H and antihydrogen Hbar. This generic Hsub2 asymmetry is given
away by a Hund-type Mexican hat curve, invisible in QM.
