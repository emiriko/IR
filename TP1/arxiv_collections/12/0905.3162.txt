During 2006 Mar - 2007 Jan, we used the IRAC and MIPS instruments on the
Spitzer Space Telescope to study the infrared emission from the ensemble of
fragments, meteoroids, and dust tails in the more than 3 degree wide
73P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 3 debris field. We also investigated contemporaneous
ground based and HST observations. In 2006 May, 55 fragments were detected in
the Spitzer image. The wide spread of fragments along the comet's orbit
indicates they were formed from the 1995 splitting event. While the number of
major fragments in the Spitzer image is similar to that seen from the ground by
optical observers, the correspondence between the fragments with optical
astrometry and those seen in the Spitzer images cannot be readily established,
due either to strong non-gravitational terms, astrometric uncertainties, or
transience of the fragments outgassing. The Spitzer data resolve the structure
of the dust comae at a resolution of 1000 km, and they reveal the infrared
emission due to large (mm to cm size) particles in a continuous dust trail that
closely follows the projected orbit. We detect fluorescence from outflowing CO2
gas from the largest fragments (B and C), and we measure the CO2:H2O proportion
(1:10 and 1:20, respectively). Three dimensionless parameters to explain
dynamics of the solid particles: alpha (sublimation reaction), beta (radiation
pressure), and nu (ejection velocity). The major fragments have nu>alpha>beta
and are dominated by the kinetic energy imparted to them by the fragmentation
process. The small, ephemeral fragments seen by HST in the tails of the major
fragments have alpha>nu>beta dominated by rocket forces. The meteoroids along
the projected orbit have beta~nu>>alpha. Dust in the fragments' tails has
beta>>(nu+alpha) and is dominated by radiation pressure.
