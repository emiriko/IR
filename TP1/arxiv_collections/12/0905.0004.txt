We consider the effect of various defects and boundary structures on the low
energy electronic properties in conducting zigzag and armchair carbon
nanotubes. The tight binding model of the conduction bands is mapped exactly
onto simple lattice models consisting of two uncoupled parallel chains.
Imperfections such as impurities, structural defects or caps can be easily
included into the effective lattice models, allowing a detailed physical
interpretation of their consequences. The method is quite general and can be
used to study a wide range of possible imperfections in carbon nanotubes. We
obtain the electron density patterns expected from a scanning tunneling
microscopy experiment for half fullerene caps and two typical impurities in the
bulk of a tube, namely the Stone-Wales defect and a single vacancy.
