Through its projects, the ?Atelier Inter-\'etablissements de Productique
Lorrain? (AIPL), as the owner and contractor of rank 1, is committed to provide
his customers (teachers, training courses, students etc...) credible teaching
materials at the scale of a real industrial flexible production of goods and
services. In this changing context, its managerial team has chosen to suppress
the CIM concept, which proposes an integrated enterprise, to steering
distributed system information (SI), heterogeneous, autonomous and scalable
depending on the ephemeral cooperation between industrial partners who now
exchanges information and material flows. These aspects are studied in research
on CRAN (Centre de Recherche en Automatique de Nancy ? Research Centre for
Automatic Control) as part of a thesis based on the recursive aspect of systems
and their models and their multi-scale aspects and multi-views, in a
Model-Based-System-Engineering (MBSE) methodology proposal of an
System-Engineering (SE) focused on the product. To validate this research, a
MBSE has been implemented on a case study to AIPL: the "eLearning in
eProduction? project.
