Designed as a high-sensitivity gamma-ray observatory, the Fermi Large Area
Telescope is also an electron detector with a large acceptance exceeding 2m^2
sr at 300 GeV. Building on the gamma-ray analysis, we have developed an
efficient electron detection strategy which provides sufficient background
rejection for measurement of the steeply-falling electron spectrum up to 1 TeV.
Our high precision data show that the electron spectrum falls with energy as
E^(-3.0) and does not exhibit prominent spectral features. Interpretations in
terms of a conventional diffusive model as well as a potential local extra
component are briefly discussed.
