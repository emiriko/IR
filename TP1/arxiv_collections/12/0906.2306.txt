Decompositions of the world into systems have typically been regarded as
arbitrary extra-theoretical assumptions in discussions of quantum measurement.
One can instead regard decompositions as part of the theory, and ask what
conditions they must satisfy for self-consistency. It is shown that
self-consistent decompositions that specify a measurement context (i.e. von
Neumann decompositions) must represent apparatus as containing internal
decohering environments and as having known pointer components and ready
states. Under these circumstances a von Neumann decomposition can function as a
component of the ready state of the observer. Minimal no-collapse quantum
mechanics supplemented by these consistency requirements on von Neumann
decompositions avoids the measurement problem.
