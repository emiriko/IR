The Sigma-pi invariant-mass spectra in the resonant capture of K- at rest in
4He, 3He and d are calculated by a coupled-channel procedure for a K-p
quasi-bound state of an arbitrary chosen mass (M) and width (Gamma). A chi2
analysis of old 4He bubble chamber data shows a dominance of the s-orbit
absorption, and yielded M = 1405.5 ^(+1.4)_(-1) MeV/c2 and Gamma = 26
^(+4)_(-3) MeV, where a possible population of Sigma0(1385) and also a small
p-orbit capture contribution are taken into account. This result confirms the
Lambda(1405) ansatz, whereas recent chiral-SU(3) predictions (M ~ 1420 MeV/c2)
are excluded. A more stringent test by using a 3He target is proposed .
