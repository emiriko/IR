Cavity-enhanced radiation pressure coupling between optical and mechanical
degrees of freedom allows quantum-limited position measurements and gives rise
to dynamical backaction enabling amplification and cooling of mechanical
motion. Here we demonstrate purely dispersive coupling of high Q nanomechanical
oscillators to an ultra-high finesse optical microresonator via its evanescent
field, extending cavity optomechanics to nanomechanical oscillators. Dynamical
backaction mediated by the optical dipole force is observed, leading to
laser-like coherent nanomechanical oscillations solely due to radiation
pressure. Moreover, sub-fm/Hz^(1/2) displacement sensitivity is achieved, with
a measurement imprecision equal to the standard quantum limit (SQL), which
coincides with the nanomechanical oscillator's zero-point fluctuations. The
achievement of an imprecision at the SQL and radiation-pressure dynamical
backaction for nanomechanical oscillators may have implications not only for
detecting quantum phenomena in mechanical systems, but also for a variety of
other precision experiments. Owing to the flexibility of the near-field
coupling approach, it can be readily extended to a diverse set of
nanomechanical oscillators and particularly provides a route to experiments
where radiation pressure quantum backaction dominates at room temperature,
enabling ponderomotive squeezing or QND measurements.
