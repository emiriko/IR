Our aim in this paper is to show an example of the formalism we have
developed to avoid the label-tensor-product-vector-space-formalism of quantum
mechanics when dealing with indistinguishable quanta. States in this new vector
space, that we call the Q-space, refer only to occupation numbers and
permutation operators act as the identity operator on them, reflecting in the
formalism the unobservability of permutations, a goal of quasi-set theory.
