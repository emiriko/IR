Aligning protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks of different species has
drawn a considerable interest recently. This problem is important to
investigate evolutionary conserved pathways or protein complexes across
species, and to help in the identification of functional orthologs through the
detection of conserved interactions. It is however a difficult combinatorial
problem, for which only heuristic methods have been proposed so far. We
reformulate the PPI alignment as a graph matching problem, and investigate how
state-of-the-art graph matching algorithms can be used for that purpose. We
differentiate between two alignment problems, depending on whether strict
constraints on protein matches are given, based on sequence similarity, or
whether the goal is instead to find an optimal compromise between sequence
similarity and interaction conservation in the alignment. We propose new
methods for both cases, and assess their performance on the alignment of the
yeast and fly PPI networks. The new methods consistently outperform
state-of-the-art algorithms, retrieving in particular 78% more conserved
interactions than IsoRank for a given level of sequence similarity.
