We investigate quantum dynamics of the excited electronic states in the
double-exchange model at half-filling by solving coupled equations for the
quantum evolution of electrons and Landau-Lifshits-Gilbert equation for
classical spins. The non-adiabatic quantum transitions driving the relaxation
are coordinated through the self-organized space-time structure of the
electron/spin dynamics leading to a resonant precession analogous to the ESR
process.
