In a world demanding the best performance from financial investments,
distributed applications occupy the first place among the proposed solutions.
This particularity is due to their distributed architecture which is able to
acheives high performance. Currently, many research works aim to develop tools
that facilitate the implementation of such applications. The urgent need for
such applications in all areas pushes researchers to accelerate this process.
However, the lack of standardization results in the absence of strategic
decisions taken by computer science community. In this article, we argue that
Java technology represents an elegant compromise ahead of the list of the
currently available solutions. In fact, by promoting the independence of
hardware and software, Java technology makes it possible to overcome pitfalls
that are inherent to the creation of distributed applications.
