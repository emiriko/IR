The traditional cultures of Aboriginal Australians include a significant
astronomical component, which is usually reported in terms of songs or stories
associated with stars and constellations. Here we argue that the astronomical
components extend further, and include a search for meaning in the sky, beyond
simply mirroring the earth-bound understanding. In particular, we have found
that traditional Aboriginal cultures include a deep understanding of the motion
of objects in the sky, and that this knowledge was used for practical purposes
such as constructing calendars. We also present evidence that traditional
Aboriginal Australians made careful records and measurements of cyclical
phenomena, and paid careful attention to unexpected phenomena such as eclipses
and meteorite impacts.
