Electromagnetic (EM) emissions in a wide frequency spectrum ranging from kHz
to MHz are produced by opening cracks, which can be considered as the so-called
precursors of general fracture. We emphasize that the MHz radiation appears
earlier than the kHz in both laboratory and geophysical scale. An important
challenge in this field of research is to distinguish characteristic epochs in
the evolution of precursory EM activity and identify them with the equivalent
last stages in the earthquake (EQ) preparation process. Recently, we proposed
the following two epochs/stages model: (i) The second epoch, which includes the
finally emerged strong impulsive kHz EM emission is due to the fracture of the
high strength large asperities that are distributed along the activated fault
sustaining the system. (ii) The first epoch, which includes the initially
emerged MHz EM radiation is thought to be due to the fracture of a highly
heterogeneous system that surrounds the family of asperities. A catastrophic EQ
of magnitude Mw = 6.3 occurred on 06/04/2009 in central Italy. The majority of
the damage occurred in the city of L'Aquila. Clear kHz - MHz EM anomalies have
been detected prior to the L'Aquila EQ. Herein, we investigate the seismogenic
origin of the detected MHz anomaly. The analysis in terms of intermittent
dynamics of critical fluctuations reveals that the candidate EM precursor: (i)
can be described in analogy with a thermal continuous phase transition; (ii)
has anti-persistent behaviour. These features suggest that the emerged
candidate precursor could be triggered by microfractures in the highly
disordered system that surrounded the backbone of asperities of the activated
fault. We introduce a criterion for an underlying strong critical behavior.
