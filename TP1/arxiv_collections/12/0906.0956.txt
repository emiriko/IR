In this paper we briefly review the current status of the Cosmic Microwave
Background (CMB) observations, summarising the latest results obtained from CMB
experiments, both in intensity and polarization, and the constraints imposed on
the cosmological parameters. We also present a summary of current and future
CMB experiments, with a special focus on the quest for the CMB B-mode
polarization.
