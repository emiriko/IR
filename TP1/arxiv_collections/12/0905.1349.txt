We present a method to derive separability criteria for the different classes
of multiparticle entanglement, especially genuine multiparticle entanglement.
The resulting criteria are necessary and sufficient for certain families of
states. Further, the criteria are superior to all known entanglement criteria
for many other families; also they allow the detection of bound entanglement.
We next demonstrate that they are easily implementable in experiments and
discuss applications to the decoherence of multiparticle entangled states.
