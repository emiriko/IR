We establish the use of dielectrophoresis for the directed parallel assembly
of individual flakes and nanoribbons of few-layer graphene into electronic
devices. This is a bottom-up approach where source and drain electrodes are
prefabricated and the flakes are deposited from a solution using an alternating
electric field applied between the electrodes. These devices are characterized
by scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, Raman spectroscopy
and electron transport measurements. They are shown to be electrically active
and their current carrying capacity and subsequent failure mechanism is
revealed. Akin to carbon nanotubes, we show that the dielectrophoretic
deposition is self-limiting to one flake per device and is scalable to
ultra-large-scale integration densities, thereby enabling the rapid screening
of a large number of devices.
