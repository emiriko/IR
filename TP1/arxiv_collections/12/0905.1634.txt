The phase separation between a striped polaron liquid at the particular
density and a high density polaron liquid is described by a modified Van der
Waals scheme. The striped polaron liquid represents the pseudo gap matter or
Wigner-like polaron phase at 1/8 doping in cuprate superconductors. The model
includes the tendency of pseudo- Jahn-Teller polarons to form anisotropic
directional bonds at a preferential volume with the formation of different
liquid phases. The model gives the coexistence of a first low density polaron
striped liquid and a second high density liquid that appears in cuprate
superconductors for doping larger than 1/8. We discuss how the strength of
anisotropic bonds controls the variation the phase separation scenarios for
complex systems in the presence of a quantum critical point where the phase
separation vanishes.
