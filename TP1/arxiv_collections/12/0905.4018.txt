The nucleon distribution amplitudes and the nucleon-to-pion transition
distribution amplitudes are investigated at leading twist within the frame of a
light-cone quark model. The distribution amplitudes probe the three-quark
component of the nucleon light-cone wave function, while higher order
components in the Fock-space expansion of the nucleon state are essential to
describe the nucleon-to-pion transition distribution amplitudes. Adopting a
meson-cloud model of the nucleon the nucleon-to-pion transition distribution
amplitudes are calculated for the first time.
