Quantum cryptographic technology (QCT) is expected to be a fundamental
technology for realizing long-term information security even against
as-yet-unknown future technologies. More advanced security could be achieved
using QCT together with contemporary cryptographic technologies. To develop and
spread the use of QCT, it is necessary to standardize devices, protocols, and
security requirements and thus enable interoperability in a multi-vendor,
multi-network, and multi-service environment. This report is a technical
summary of QCT and related topics from the viewpoints of 1) consensual
establishment of specifications and requirements of QCT for standardization and
commercialization and 2) the promotion of research and design to realize
New-Generation Quantum Cryptography.
