It is effective to improve the reliability and availability of large-scale
cluster systems through the analysis of failures. Existed failure analysis
methods understand and analyze failures from one or few dimension. The analysis
results are partial and with less precision because of the limitation of data
source. This paper presents multidimensional analysis based on graph mining to
analyze multi-source system logs, which is a promising failure analysis method
to get more complete and precise failure knowledge.
