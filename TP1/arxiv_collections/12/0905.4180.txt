We wish to construct solutions of Taub-NUT spacetime in Einstein-Born-Infeld
gravity in even dimensions. Since Born-Infeld theory is a nonlinear
electrodynamics theory, in leads to nonlinear differential equations. However a
proper analytical solution was not obtain, we try to solve it numerically (by
the Runge-Kotta method) with initial conditions coinciding with those of our
previous work in Einstein-Maxwell gravity. We solve equations for 4, 6 and 8
dimensions and do data fitting by the least-squares method. For N=l=b=1, the
metric turns to the NUT solution only in 8 dimensions, but in 4 and 6
dimensions the spacetime does not have any Nut solution.
