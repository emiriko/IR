We present a variational analysis for a half-quantum vortex (HQV) in the
equal-spin-pairing superfluid state which, under suitable conditions, is
believed to be realized in Sr2RuO4 and 3He-A. Our approach is based on a
description of the HQV in terms of a BCS-like wave function with a
spin-dependent boost. We predict a novel feature: the HQV, if stable, should be
accompanied by a non-zero spin polarization. Such a spin polarization would
exist in addition to the one induced by the Zeeman coupling to the external
field and hence may serve as an indicator in experimental search for HQV.
