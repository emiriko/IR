The paper proposes a new message passing algorithm for cycle-free factor
graphs. The proposed "entropy message passing" (EMP) algorithm may be viewed as
sum-product message passing over the entropy semiring, which has previously
appeared in automata theory. The primary use of EMP is to compute the entropy
of a model. However, EMP can also be used to compute expressions that appear in
expectation maximization and in gradient descent algorithms.
