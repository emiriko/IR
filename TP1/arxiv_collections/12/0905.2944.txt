If a probability density p(\x) (\x\in\R^k) is bounded and R(t) := \int
\exp(t\ell(\x)) \d\x < \infty for some linear functional \ell and all
t\in(0,1), then, for each t\in(0,1) and all large enough n, the n-fold
convolution of the t-tilted density p_t(\x) := \exp(t\ell(\x)) p(\x)/R(t) is
bounded. This is a corollary of a general, "non-i.i.d." result, which is also
shown to enjoy a certain optimality property. Such results are useful for
saddle-point approximations.
