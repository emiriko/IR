We study the dynamics of hydration water/protein association in folded
proteins, using lysozyme and myoglobin as examples. Extensive molecular
dynamics simulations are performed to identify underlying mechanisms of the
dynamical transition that corresponds to the onset of amplified atomic
fluctuations in proteins. The number of water molecules within a cutoff
distance of each residue scales linearly with protein depth index and is not
affected by the local dynamics of the backbone. Keeping track of the water
molecules within the cutoff sphere, we observe an effective residence time,
scaling inversely with depth index at physiological temperatures while the
diffusive escape is highly reduced below the transition. A depth independent
orientational memory loss is obtained for the average dipole vector of the
water molecules within the sphere when the protein is functional. While below
the transition temperature, the solvent is in a glassy state, acting as a solid
crust around the protein, inhibiting any large scale conformational
fluctuations. At the transition, most of the hydration shell unfreezes and
water molecules collectively make the protein more flexible.
