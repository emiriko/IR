We calculate the optimality of a doublet precursor to the canonical genetic
code with respect to mitigating the effects of point mutations and compare our
results to corresponding ones for the canonical genetic code. We find that the
proposed precursor has much less optimality than that of the canonical code.
Our results render unlikely the notion that the doublet precursor was an
intermediate state in the evolution of the canonical genetic code. These
findings support the notion that code optimality reflects evolutionary
dynamics, and that if such a doublet code originally had a biochemical
significance, it arose before the emergence of translation.
