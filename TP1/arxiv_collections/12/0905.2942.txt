We introduce the quantum stochastic walk (QSW), which determines the
evolution of generalized quantum mechanical walk on a graph that obeys a
quantum stochastic equation of motion. Using an axiomatic approach, we specify
the rules for all possible quantum, classical and quantum-stochastic
transitions from a vertex as defined by its connectivity. We show how the
family of possible QSWs encompasses both the classical random walk (CRW) and
the quantum walk (QW) as special cases, but also includes more general
probability distributions. As an example, we study the QSW on a line, the QW to
CRW transition and transitions to genearlized QSWs that go beyond the CRW and
QW. QSWs provide a new framework to the study of quantum algorithms as well as
of quantum walks with environmental effects.
