Within the framework of linearized Einstein field equations we compute the
gravito-magnetic effects on a test particle orbiting a slowly rotating,
spherical body with a rotating matter ring fixed to the equatorial plane. Our
results show that the effect on the precession of particle orbits is increased
by the presence of the ring.
