We have performed de Haas-van Alphen measurements of the Fermi surface of
alpha-uranium single crystals at ambient pressure within the alpha-3 charge
density wave (CDW) state from 0.020 K - 10 K and magnetic fields to 35 T using
torque magnetometry. The angular dependence of the resulting frequencies is
described. Effective masses were measured and the Dingle temperature was
determined to be 0.74 K +/- 0.04 K. The observation of quantum oscillations
within the alpha-3 CDW state gives new insight into the effect of the charge
density waves on the Fermi surface. In addition we observed no signature of
superconductivity in either transport or magnetization down to 0.020 K
indicating the possibility of a pressure-induced quantum critical point that
separates the superconducting dome from the normal CDW phase.
