We confirm and extend the recent finding that the central surface density
r_0*rho_0 galaxy dark matter halos, where r_0 and rho_0 are the halo core
radius and central density, is nearly constant and independent of galaxy
luminosity. Based on the co-added rotation curves of about 1000 spiral
galaxies, mass models of individual dwarf irregular and spiral galaxies of late
and early types with high-quality rotation curves and, galaxy-galaxy weak
lensing signals from a sample of spiral and elliptical galaxies, we find that
log(r_0*rho_0) = 2.15 +- 0.2, in units of log(Msol/pc^2). We also show that the
observed kinematics of Local Group dwarf spheroidal galaxies are consistent
with this value. Our results are obtained for galactic systems spanning over 14
magnitudes, belonging to different Hubble Types, and whose mass profiles have
been determined by several independent methods. In the same objects, the
approximate constancy of rho_0*r_0 is in sharp contrast to the systematical
variations, by several orders of magnitude, of galaxy properties, including
rho_0 and central stellar surface density.
