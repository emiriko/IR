We discuss the applicability of the $k_T$ factorization theorem to low-$p_T$
hadron production in hadron-hadron collision in a simple toy model, which
involves only scalar particles and gluons. It has been shown that the $k_T$
factorization for high-$p_T$ hadron hadroproduction is broken by soft gluons in
the Glauber region, which are exchanged among a transverse-momentum-dependent
(TMD) parton density and other subprocesses of the collision. We explain that
the contour of a loop momentum can be deformed away from the Glauber region at
low $p_T$, so the above residual infrared divergence is factorized by means of
the standard eikonal approximation. The $k_T$ factorization is then restored in
the sense that a TMD parton density maintains its universality. Because the
resultant Glauber factor is independent of hadron flavors, experimental
constraints on its behavior are possible. The $k_T$ factorization can also be
restored for the transverse single-spin asymmetry in hadron-hadron collision at
low $p_T$ in a similar way, with the residual infrared divergence being
factorized into the same Glauber factor.
