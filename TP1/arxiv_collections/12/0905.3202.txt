We show that two commonly used definitions for the heat current give
different results--through the Kubo formula--for the heat conductivity of
oscillator chains. The difference exists for finite chains, and is expected to
be important more generally for small structures. For a chain of N particles
that are tethered at the ends, the ratio of the heat conductivities calculated
with the two currents differs from unity by O(1/N). For a chain held at
constant pressure, the difference from unity decays more slowly, and is
consistent with O(1/N^eta) with 1 > eta > 0.5.
