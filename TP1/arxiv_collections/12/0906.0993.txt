The Fisher Matrix is the backbone of modern cosmological forecasting. We
describe the Fisher4Cast software: a general-purpose, easy-to-use, Fisher
Matrix framework. It is open source, rigorously designed and tested and
includes a Graphical User Interface (GUI) with automated LATEX file creation
capability and point-and-click Fisher ellipse generation. Fisher4Cast was
designed for ease of extension and, although written in Matlab, is easily
portable to open-source alternatives such as Octave and Scilab. Here we use
Fisher4Cast to present new 3-D and 4-D visualisations of the forecasting
landscape and to investigate the effects of growth and curvature on future
cosmological surveys. Early releases have been available at
http://www.cosmology.org.za since May 2008 with 750 downloads in the first
year. Version 2.2 is made public with this paper and includes a Quick Start
guide and the code used to produce the figures in this paper, in the hope that
it will be useful to the cosmology and wider scientific communities.
