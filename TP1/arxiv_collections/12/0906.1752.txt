We discuss the possibility that the observed low-order multipole features of
the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) all originate in the
termination shock (TS) region of the heliosheath that surrounds the solar
system. If the intrinsic CMB spectrum is assumed to be a pure monopole (2.73K)
then thermodynamic processes occurring within the plasma region of the TS could
imprint the observed power spectrum of the low-order multipoles and their
alignment (the so-called "axis of evil") onto this background isotropic CMB.
Conditions are outlined for the geometric shape of the TS region. A key
requirement of this model is that the TS plasma be characterized as an
optically thin graybody with non-LTE perturbations. Data from the ongoing
Voyager missions is critical to this study. We present four significant recent
observations in support of this ansatz.
