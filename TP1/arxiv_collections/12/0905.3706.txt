The decays of a light scalar meson into a vector meson and a photon ($S\to
V\gamma)$ are evaluated in the tetraquark and quarkonium assignments of the
scalar states. A link with the radiative decays $\phi\to S\gamma$ is
established: experimental results for $S\to V\gamma$ will allow to understand
if the direct, quark-loop contribution to $\phi\to S\gamma$ or the kaon-loop
contribution is dominant. Also strong decays $S\to PP$ -where $P$ denotes a
pseudoscalar meson- are investigated: the tetraquark assignment works better
than the quarkonium one. It is then also discussed why the tetraquark
assignment is favoured with respect to a loosely bound kaonic molecular
interpretation of $a_{0}(980)$ and $f_{0}(980)$ mesons.
