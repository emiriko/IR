We study the possible annihilation cross section of scalar dark matter and
its coupling \lambda_D to the standard model Higgs in the case of the
electroweak symmetry breaking driven by unparticle. Here the annihilation
process occurs with the help of three intermediate scalars which appear after
the mixing. By respecting the annihilation rate which is compatible with the
current relic density we predict the tree level coupling \lambda_D. We observe
that the unparticle scaling d_u plays a considerable role on the annihilation
process and, therefore, on the coupling \lambda_D.
