The N*(1535) resonance contributions to the pn->d\phi reaction are evaluated
in an effective Lagrangian model. The \pi-, \eta-, and \rho-meson exchange are
considered. It is shown that the contributions from \pi- and \rho-meson
exchange are dominant, while the contribution from \eta-meson exchange is
negligibly small. Our theoretical results reproduce the experimental data of
both total cross section and angular distribution well. This is another
evidence that the N*(1535) resonance has large s\bar{s} component leading to a
large coupling to N\phi, which may be the real origin of the OZI rule violation
in the \piN and pN reactions.
