Within the magnetar scenario, the "twisted magnetosphere" model appears very
promising in explaining the persistent X-ray emission from the Soft Gamma
Repeaters and the Anomalous X-ray Pulsars (SGRs and AXPs). In the first two
papers of the series, we have presented a 3D Monte Carlo code for solving
radiation transport as soft, thermal photons emitted by the star surface are
resonantly upscattered by the magnetospheric particles. A spectral model
archive has been generated and implemented in XSPEC. Here we report on the
systematic application of our spectral model to different XMM-Newton and
Integral observations of SGRs and AXPs. We find that the synthetic spectra
provide a very good fit to the data for the nearly all the source (and source
states) we have analyzed.
