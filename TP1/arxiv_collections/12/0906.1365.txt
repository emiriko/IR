Prospective searches about Higgs physics and beyond the Standard Model are
presented for the CMS and ATLAS experiments. Possible excesses of events in
real data could be an indication of the existence of new particles, even with
few hundred pb-1 of integrated luminosity. In this paper the focus is on the
current analyses strategies and on the potential both for a discovery and/or
for an exclusion of the Standard Model Higgs boson in the main decay channels.
The searches for some supersymmetric and exotic particles predicted by several
theoretical models are also discussed.
