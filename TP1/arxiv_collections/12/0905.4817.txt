We study properties of magnetic field-induced Bose-Einstein condensate of
triplons as a function of temperature and the field within the
Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov approach including the anomalous density. We show that
the magnetization is continuous across the transition, in agreement with the
experiment. In sufficiently strong fields the condensate becomes unstable due
to triplon-triplon repulsion. As a result, the system is characterized by two
critical magnetic fields: one producing the condensate and the other destroying
it. We show that nonparabolic triplon dispersion arising due to the gapped bare
spectrum and the crystal structure has a strong influence on the phase diagram.
