The technical procedure of a search of bursts of very high energy gamma rays
from evaporation of primordial black holes on air-shower array "Andyrchy" of
Baksan Neutrino Observatory of Institute for Nuclear Research is described. The
theoretical model used in the present work assumes that the chromosphere around
the evaporating black hole does not form. For minimization of the cosmic ray
background the method of multidimensional analysis of modelled as well as
experimentally detected events is applied. The new upper limit on the
concentration of evaporating primordial black holes in the local region of
Galaxy is obtained. The comparison of the results of different experiments is
given.
