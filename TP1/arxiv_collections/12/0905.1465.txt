We calculate the scalar Casimir energy and Casimir force for a $R^3\times N$
Kaluza-Klein piston setup in which the extra dimensional space $N$ contains a
non-commutative 2-sphere, $S_{FZ}$. The cases to be studied are $T^d\times
S_{FZ}$ and $S_{FZ}$ respectively as extra dimensional spaces, with $T^d$ the
$d$ dimensional commutative torus. The validity of the results and the
regularization that the piston setup offers are examined in both cases. Finally
we examine the 1-loop corrected Casimir energy for one piston chamber, due to
the self interacting scalar field in the non-commutative geometry. The
computation is done within some approximations. We compare this case for the
same calculation done in Minkowski spacetime $M^D$. A discussion on the
stabilization of the extra dimensional space within the piston setup follows at
the end of the article.
