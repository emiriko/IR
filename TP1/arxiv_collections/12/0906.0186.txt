Let L be k((\epsilon)), where k is an algebraic closure of a finite field
with q elements and \epsilon is an indeterminate, and let \sigma be the
Frobenius automorphism. Let G be a split connected reductive group over the
fixed field of \sigma in L, and let I be the Iwahori subgroup of G(L)
associated to a given Borel subgroup of G. Let W be the extended affine Weyl
group of G. Given x in W and b in G(L), we have some subgroup of G(L) that acts
on the affine Deligne-Lusztig variety X_x(b) = {gI in G(L)/I : g^{-1}b\sigma(g)
is in IxI} and hence a representation of this subgroup on the Borel-Moore
homology of the variety. We investigate this representation for certain b in
the cases when G is SL_2 and G is SL_3.
