The ferromagnetic quantum phase transition in the perovskite ruthenate
Sr$_{1-x}$Ca$_x$RuO$_3$ is studied by low-temperature magnetization and
electrical resistivity measurements on thin films. The films were grown
epitaxially on SrTiO$_3$ substrates using metalorganic aerosol deposition and
characterized by X-ray diffraction and room temperature scanning tunneling
microscopy. High residual resistivity ratios of 29 and 16 for $x=0$ and $x=1$,
respectively, prove the high quality of the investigated samples. We observe a
continuous suppression of the ferromagnetic Curie temperature from $T_C=160$ K
at $x=0$ towards $T_C\to 0$ at $x_c\approx 0.8$. The analysis of the electrical
resistivity between 2 and 10 K reveals $T^2$ and $T^{3/2}$ behavior at $x\leq
0.6$ and $x\geq 0.7$, respectively. For undoped CaRuO$_3$, the measurement has
been extended down to 60 mK, revealing a crossover to $T^2$ behavior around 2
K, which suggests a Fermi-liquid ground state in this system.
