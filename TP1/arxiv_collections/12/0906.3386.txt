The GIII red giant star epsilon Oph has been found to exhibit several modes
of oscillation by the MOST mission. We interpret the observed frequencies of
oscillation in terms of theoretical radial p-mode frequencies of stellar
models. Evolutionary models of this star, in both shell H-burning and core
He-burning phases of evolution, are constructed using as constraints a
combination of measurements from classical ground-based observations (for
luminosity, temperature, and chemical composition) and seismic observations
from MOST. Radial frequencies of models in either evolutionary phase can
reproduce the observed frequency spectrum of epsilon Oph almost equally well.
The best-fit models indicate a mass in the range of 1.85 +/- 0.05 Msun with
radius of 10.55 +/- 0.15 Rsun. We also obtain an independent estimate of the
radius of epsilon Oph using high accuracy interferometric observations in the
infrared K' band, using the CHARA/FLUOR instrument. The measured limb darkened
disk angular diameter of epsilon Oph is 2.961 +/- 0.007 mas. Together with the
Hipparcos parallax, this translates into a photospheric radius of 10.39 +/-
0.07 Rsun. The radius obtained from the asteroseismic analysis matches the
interferometric value quite closely even though the radius was not constrained
during the modelling.
