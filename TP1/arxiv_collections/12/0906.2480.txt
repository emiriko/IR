We study the capture of galactic dark matter by the Solar System. The effect
is due to the gravitational three-body interaction between the Sun, one of the
planets, and a dark matter particle. The analytical estimate for the capture
cross-section is derived and the upper and lower bounds for the total mass of
the captured dark matter particles are found. The estimates for their density
are less reliable. The most optimistic of them give an enhancement of dark
matter density by about three orders of magnitudes compared to its value in our
Galaxy. However, even this optimistic value remains below the best present
observational upper limits by about two orders of magnitude.
