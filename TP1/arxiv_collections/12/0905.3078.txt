In the mass range of 1e15 g up to 1e26 g, primordial black holes (PBHs) as a
possible contribution to the dark matter are still unexplored. In this
contribution, we investigate the possibility of an electromagnetic signal from
PBH interactions with astrophysical objects in the Galaxy. We find that a
signal from passages cannot be observed, since, depending on the mass, either
the interaction probability or the energy loss is too small. Further, we
discuss possible effects from high-mass PBHs at masses >1e26 g, where PBHs can
still contribute to the dark matter at the order of ~10%. Here, we find that a
significant fraction of PBHs can be captured in the Hubble time. These captures
could therefore lead to detectable effects.
