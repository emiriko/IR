We address the formation and propagation of vector solitons in optical
lattices in the presence of anisotropy-induced walk-off between ordinary and
extraordinary polarized field components. Stable vector solitons trapped by the
lattice form above a threshold power, while decreasing the lattice depth below
a critical value results in the abrupt release of the caged solitons, that then
move across the lattice and may get trapped in a desired lattice channel.
