We present observations of a new double-image gravitational lens system, ULAS
J082016.1+081216, of image separation 2.3" and high (~6) flux ratio. The system
is selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectroscopic quasar list using
new high-quality images from the UKIRT Deep Sky Survey (UKIDSS). The lensed
quasar has a source redshift of 2.024, and we identify the lens galaxy as a
faint red object of redshift 0.803+/-0.001. Three other objects from the UKIDSS
survey, selected in the same way, were found not to be lens systems. Together
with the earlier lens found using this method, the SDSS-UKIDSS lenses have the
potential to significantly increase the number of quasar lenses found in SDSS,
to extend the survey to higher flux ratios and lower separations, and to give
greater completeness which is important for statistical purposes.
