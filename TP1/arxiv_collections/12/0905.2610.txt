Fermionic alkaline-earth atoms have unique properties that make them
attractive candidates for the realization of novel atomic clocks and degenerate
quantum gases. At the same time, they are attracting considerable theoretical
attention in the context of quantum information processing. Here we demonstrate
that when such atoms are loaded in optical lattices, they can be used as
quantum simulators of unique many-body phenomena. In particular, we show that
the decoupling of the nuclear spin from the electronic angular momentum can be
used to implement many-body systems with an unprecedented degree of symmetry,
characterized by the SU(N) group with N as large as 10. Moreover, the interplay
of the nuclear spin with the electronic degree of freedom provided by a stable
optically excited state allows for the study of spin-orbital physics. Such
systems may provide valuable insights into strongly correlated physics of
transition metal oxides, heavy fermion materials, and spin liquid phases.
