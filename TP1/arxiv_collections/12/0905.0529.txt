We estimated photospheric velocities by separately applying the Fourier Local
Correlation Tracking (FLCT) and Differential Affine Velocity Estimator (DAVE)
methods to 2708 co-registered pairs of SOHO/MDI magnetograms, with nominal
96-minute cadence and ~2" pixels, from 46 active regions (ARs) from 1996-1998
over the time interval t45 when each AR was within 45^o of disk center. For
each magnetogram pair, we computed the average estimated radial magnetic field,
B; and each tracking method produced an independently estimated flow field, u.
We then quantitatively characterized these magnetic and flow fields by
computing several extensive and intensive properties of each; extensive
properties scale with AR size, while intensive properties do not depend
directly on AR size. Intensive flow properties included moments of speeds,
horizontal divergences, and radial curls; extensive flow properties included
sums of these properties over each AR, and a crude proxy for the ideal Poynting
flux, the total |u| B^2. Several magnetic quantities were also computed,
including: total unsigned flux; a measure of the amount of unsigned flux near
strong-field polarity inversion lines, R; and the total B^2. Next, using
correlation and discriminant analysis, we investigated the associations between
these properties and flares from the GOES flare catalog, when averaged over
both t45 and shorter time windows, of 6 and 24 hours. We found R and total |u|
B^2 to be most strongly associated with flares; no intensive flow properties
were strongly associated with flares.
