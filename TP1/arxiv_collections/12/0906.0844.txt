We propose a resource distribution strategy to reduce the average travel time
in a transportation network given a fixed generation rate. Suppose that there
are essential resources to avoid congestion in the network as well as some
extra resources. The strategy distributes the essential resources by the
average loads on the vertices and integrates the fluctuations of the
instantaneous loads into the distribution of the extra resources. The
fluctuations are calculated with the assumption of unlimited resources, where
the calculation is incorporated into the calculation of the average loads
without adding to the time complexity. Simulation results show that the
fluctuation-integrated strategy provides shorter average travel time than a
previous distribution strategy while keeping similar robustness. The strategy
is especially beneficial when the extra resources are scarce and the network is
heterogeneous and lowly loaded.
