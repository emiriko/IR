We study soliton solutions to a nonlinear Schrodinger equation with a
saturated nonlinearity. Such nonlinearities are known to possess minimal mass
soliton solutions. We consider a small perturbation of a minimal mass soliton,
and identify a system of ODEs similar to those from Comech and Pelinovsky
(2003), which model the behavior of the perturbation for short times. We then
provide numerical evidence that under this system of ODEs there are two
possible dynamical outcomes, which is in accord with the conclusions of
Pelinovsky, Afanasjev, and Kivshar (1996). For initial data which supports a
soliton structure, a generic initial perturbation oscillates around the stable
family of solitons. For initial data which is expected to disperse, the finite
dimensional dynamics follow the unstable portion of the soliton curve.
