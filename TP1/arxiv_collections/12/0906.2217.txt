The two-parameter Poisson-Dirichlet distribution is the law of a sequence of
decreasing nonnegative random variables with total sum one. It can be
constructed from stable and Gamma subordinators with the two-parameters,
$\alpha$ and $\theta$, corresponding to the stable component and Gamma
component respectively. The moderate deviation principles are established for
the two-parameter Poisson-Dirichlet distribution and the corresponding
homozygosity when $\theta$ approaches infinity, and the large deviation
principle is established for the two-parameter Poisson-Dirichlet distribution
when both $\alpha$ and $\theta$ approach zero.
