A sensor web is a collection of heterogeneous sensors which autonomously
reacts to the observed environment. The SouthEast Alaska MOnitoring Network for
Science, Technology, Education, and Research (SEAMONSTER) project has
implemented a sensor web in partially glaciated watersheds near Juneau, Alaska,
on the edge of the Juneau Icefield. By coupling the SEAMONSTER sensor web with
digital earth technologies the scientific utility, education and public
outreach efforts, and sensor web management of the project all greatly benefit.
This paper describes the scientific motivation for a sensor web, the technology
developed to implement the sensor web, the software developed to couple the
sensor web with digital earth technologies, and demonstrates the SEAMONSTER
sensor web in a digital earth framework.
