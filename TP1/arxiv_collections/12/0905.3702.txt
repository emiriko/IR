We apply the needlet formalism to the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe
5-year data, looking for evidence of non-Gaussianity in the bispectrum of the
needlet amplitudes. We confirm earlier findings of an asymmetry in the
non-Gaussianity between the northern and southern galactic hemispheres. We
attempt to isolate which scales and geometrical configurations are most
anomalous, and find the bispectrum is most significant on large scales and in
the more co-linear configurations, and also in the `squeezed' configurations.
However, these anomalies do not appear to affect the estimate of the non-linear
parameter $\fnl$, and we see no significant difference between its value
measured in the two hemispheres.
