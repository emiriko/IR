Proof of factorization of soft and collinear divergences in non-equilibrium
QCD may be necessary to study hadronic signatures of quark-gluon plasma at RHIC
and LHC. In this paper we prove factorization of soft and collinear divergences
in non-equilibrium QED by using Schwinger-Keldysh closed-time path integral
formalism in the background field method in pure gauge.
