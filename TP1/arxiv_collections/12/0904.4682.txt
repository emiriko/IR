We report on the Suzaku observation of neutron star low-mass X-ray binary
Cygnus X-2 which reveals a presence of the iron K_alpha emission line. The line
profile shows a significant red wing. This discovery increases the number of
neutron star sources where red-skewed iron lines were observed and strongly
suggests that this phenomenon is common not only in black holes but also in
other types of accreting compact objects. We examine the line profile in terms
of models which attribute its production to the relativistic effects due to
reflection of X-ray radiation from a cold accretion disk and also as a result
of the line formation in the extended wind/outflow configuration. Both models
are able to adequately represent the observed line profile. We consider the
results of line modeling in the context of subsecond variability. While we were
unable to conclusively disqualify one of the models, we find that the wind
paradigm has several advantages over the relativistic disk reflection model.
