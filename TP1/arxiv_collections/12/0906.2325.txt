Large LAr TPCs are among the most powerful detectors to address open problems
in particle and astro-particle physics, such as CP violation in leptonic
sector, neutrino properties and their astrophysical implications, proton decay
search etc. The scale of such detector implies severe constraints on their
readout and DAQ system. In this article we describe a data acquisition scheme
for this new generation of large detectors. The main challenge is to propose a
scalable and easy to use solution able to manage a large number of channels at
the lowest cost. It is interesting to note that these constraints are very
similar to those existing in Network Telecommunication Industry. We propose to
study how emerging technologies like ATCA and $\mu$TCA could be used in
neutrino experiments. We describe the design of an Advanced Mezzanine Board
(AMC) including 32 ADC channels. This board receives 32 analogical channels at
the front panel and sends the formatted data through the $\mu$TCA backplane
using a Gigabit Ethernet link. The gigabit switch of the MCH is used to
centralize and to send the data to the event building computer. The core of
this card is a FPGA (ARIA-GX from ALTERA) including the whole system except the
memories. A hardware accelerator has been implemented using a NIOS II $\mu$P
and a Gigabit MAC IP. Obviously, in order to be able to reconstruct the tracks
from the events a time synchronisation system is mandatory. We decided to
implement the IEEE1588 standard also called Precision Timing Protocol, another
emerging and promising technology in Telecommunication Industry. In this
article we describe a Gigabit PTP implementation using the recovered clock of
the gigabit link. By doing so the drift is directly cancelled and the PTP will
be used only to evaluate and to correct the offset.
