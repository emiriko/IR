Context: Recent calculations of pulsation modes in rapidly rotating
polytropic models and models based on the Self-Consistent Field method
(MacGregor et al. 2007) have shown that the frequency spectrum of low degree
pulsation modes can be described by an empirical formula similar to Tassoul's
asymptotic formula (Tassoul 1980), provided that the underlying rotation
profile is not too differential (Lignieres & Georgeot 2008, Reese et al. 2009).
  Aims: Given the simplicity of this asymptotic formula, we investigate whether
it can provide a means by which to identify pulsation modes in rapidly rotating
stars.
  Methods: We develop a new mode identification scheme which consists in
scanning a multidimensional parameter space for the formula coefficients which
yield the best-fitting asymptotic spectra. This mode identification scheme is
then tested on artificial spectra based on the asymptotic formula, on random
frequencies and on spectra based on full numerical eigenmode calculations for
which the mode identification is known beforehand. We also investigate the
effects of adding random frequencies to mimic the effects of chaotic modes
which are also expected to show up in such stars (Lignieres & Georgeot 2008).
