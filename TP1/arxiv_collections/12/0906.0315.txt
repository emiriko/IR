There is a persistent state of confusion regarding the account of the quantum
origin of the seeds of cosmological structure during inflation. In fact, a
recent article (C. Kiefer & D. Polarski, ArXiv: 0810.0087 [astro-ph]) addresses
the question "Why do the Cosmological Perturbations look Classical?" and offers
an answer based on unitary quantum mechanics (i.e., without reference to the
projection postulate) relying on the decoherence type of analysis. The argument
is, thus, implicitly assuming that decoherence offers a satisfactory solution
to the measurement problem in quantum mechanics. We will review here, why do
we, together with various other researchers in the field, consider that this is
not the case, in general, and particularly not at all in the situation at hand.
In fact, as has been previously discussed (A. Perez, H. Sahlmann, and D.
Sudarsky, CQG 23, 2317, (2006);[arXiv: gr-qc/0508100]), we will argue that the
cosmological situation is one where the measurement problem of quantum
mechanics appears in a particular exacerbated form, and that, it is this, even
sharper conondrum, the one that should be addressed when dealing with the
inflationary account of the origin of the seeds of cosmic structure in the
early universe.
