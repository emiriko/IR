We investigate the role of size quantization in the vacuum force between
metallic films of nanometric thickness. The force is calculated by the Lifshitz
formula with the film dielectric tensor derived from the one-electron energies
and wavefunctions under the assumption of a constant potential inside the film
and a uniform distribution of the positive ion charge. The results show that
quantization effects tend to reduce the force with respect to the continuum
plasma model. The reduction is more significant at low electron densities and
for film size of the order of few nanometers and persists for separation
distances up to 10 nm. Comparison with previous work indicates that the
softening of the boundary potential is important in determining the amount of
the reduction. The calculations are extended to treat Drude intraband
absorption. It is shown that the inclusion of relaxation time enhances the size
quantization effects in the force calculations.
