This study concerns the fast and accurate solution of the line radiation
transfer problem, under non-LTE conditions. We propose and evaluate an
alternative iterative scheme to the classical ALI-Jacobi method, and to the
more recently proposed Gauss-Seidel and Successive Over-Relaxation (GS/SOR)
schemes. Our study is indeed based on the application of a preconditioned
bi-conjugate gradient method (BiCG-P). Standard tests, in 1D plane parallel
geometry and in the frame of the two-level atom model, with monochromatic
scattering, are discussed. Rates of convergence between the previously
mentioned iterative schemes are compared, as well as their respective timing
properties. The smoothing capability of the BiCG-P method is also demonstrated.
