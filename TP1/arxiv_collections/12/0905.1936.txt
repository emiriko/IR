In our ongoing search for close and faint companions around T Tauri stars in
the Chamaeleon star-forming region, we recently (Schmidt et al 2008b) presented
direct observations and integral field spectroscopy of a new common proper
motion companion to the young T-Tauri star and Chamaeleon member CT Cha and
discussed its properties in comparison to other young, low-mass objects and to
synthetic model spectra from different origins. We now obtained for the first
time direct H-Band observations of the companion CT Cha b and of another faint
companion candidate (cc2) approximately 1.9 arcsec northeast of CT Cha using
the Adaptive Optics (AO) instrument Naos-Conica (NACO) at the Very Large
Telescope (VLT) of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) in February 2008.
  From these data we can now exclude by 4.4 & 4.8 sigma that CT Cha b is a
non-moving background object and find cc2 to be most likely a background star
of spectral type <= K4 with a proper motion of mu{alpha} cos{delta} = -8.5 +/-
5.7 mas/yr and mu{delta} = 12.0 +/- 5.6 mas/yr, not consistent with being a
member of the Cha I star-forming region.
