This paper analyses the phenomenon of entanglement exchange in Bohm's pilot
wave interpretation of quantum mechanics. The interesting feature of the
phenomenon is that systems become entangled without causal interaction; hence
it is a useful situation for investigating the unique nature of interaction in
Bohmian mechanics. The first two sections introduce, respectively, entanglement
exchange in the standard interpretation of quantum mechanics, and the basic
principles of Bohmian mechanics. The next section shows that the Bohmian
interpretation makes the same experimental predictions about entanglement
exchange as the standard one. The final section draws some conclusions about
interactions and entanglement in Bohmian mechanics.
