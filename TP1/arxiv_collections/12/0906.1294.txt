The topological charge is constructed for SU(3) center vortex world-surfaces
composed of elementary squares on a hypercubic lattice. In distinction to the
SU(2) case investigated previously, it is necessary to devise a proper
treatment of the color structure at vortex branchings, which arise in the SU(3)
case, but not for SU(2). The construction is used to evaluate the topological
susceptibility in the random vortex world-surface model of infrared Yang-Mills
dynamics. Results for the topological susceptibility are reported as a function
of temperature, including both the confined as well as the deconfined phase.
