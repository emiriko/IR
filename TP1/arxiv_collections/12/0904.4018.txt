A pseudo honeycomb system Li2RuO3 exhibits a second-order-like transition at
temperature T=Tc=540 K to a low-T nonmagnetic phase with a significant lattice
distortion forming Ru-Ru pairs. For this system, we have calculated the band
structure, using the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) in both the high-
and low- T phases, and found that the results of the calculation can naturally
explain the insulating behavior observed in the low-T phase. The detailed
characters of the Ru 4d t2g bands obtained by the tight-binding fit to the
calculated dispersion curves show clear evidence that the structural transition
is driven by the formation of the Ru-Ru molecular-orbits, as proposed in our
previous experimental studies.
