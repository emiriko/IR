We realize the logarithm of the third smallest known Salem number as the
topological entropy of a K3 surface automorphism with a Siegel disk and a
pointwisely fixed curve at the same time. We also show the logarithm of the
Lehmer number, the smallest known Salem number, is not realizable as the
topological entropy of any Enriques surface automorphism. These results are
entirely inspired by McMullen's works and Mathematica programs.
