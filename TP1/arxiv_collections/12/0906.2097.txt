We study the field-induced quantum critical point (QCP) in YbRh$_2$Si$_2$ by
low-temperature magnetization, $M(T)$, and magnetic Gr\"uneisen ratio,
$\Gamma_{\rm mag}$, measurements and compare the results with previous thermal
expansion, $\beta(T)$, and critical Gr\"uneisen ratio, $\Gamma^{cr}(T)$, data
on YbRh$_2$(Si$_{0.95}$Ge$_{0.05}$)$_2$. In the latter case, a slightly
negative chemical pressure has been used to tune the system towards its
zero-field QCP. The magnetization derivative $-dM/dT$ is far more singular than
thermal expansion, reflecting a strongly temperature dependent pressure
derivative of the field at constant entropy, $(dH/dP)_S=V_m\beta/(dM/dT)$
($V_m$: molar volume), which saturates at $(0.15\pm 0.04)$ T/GPa for $T\to 0$.
The line $T^\star(H)$, previously observed in Hall- and thermodynamic
measurements, separates regimes in $T$-$H$ phase space of stronger
$(\epsilon>1$) and weaker $(\epsilon<1$) divergent $\Gamma_{\rm mag}(T)\propto
T^{-\epsilon}$.
