Current-induced torques are commonly used to manipulate non-collinear
magnetization configurations. In this article we discuss current-induced
torques present in a certain class of collinear magnetic systems, relating them
to current-induced changes in magnetic anisotropy energy. We present a
quantitative estimate of their characteristics in uniform strained
ferromagnetic (Ga,Mn)As.
