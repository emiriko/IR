We analyzed the magnetic susceptibilities of several Cr spinels using two
recent models for the geometrically frustrated pyrochlore lattice, the Quantum
Tetrahedral Mean Field model and a Generalized Constant Coupling model. Both
models can describe the experimental data for ACr2 O4 (with A = Zn, Mg, and Cd)
satisfactorily, with the former yielding a somewhat better agreement with
experiment for A = Zn, Mg. The obtained exchange constants for nearest and
next-nearest neighbors are discussed.
