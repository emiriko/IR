Computer algebra in Java is a promising field of development. It has not yet
reached an industrial strength, in part because of a lack of good user
interfaces. Using a general purpose scripting language can bring a natural
mathematical notation, akin to the one of specialized interfaces included in
most computer algebra systems. We present such an interface for Java computer
algebra libraries, using scripts available in the JSR 223 framework. We
introduce the concept of `symbolic programming' and show its usefulness by
prototypes of symbolic polynomials and polynomial rings.
