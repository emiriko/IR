We prove that QIP(2), the class of problems having two-message quantum
interactive proof systems, is a subset of PSPACE. This relationship is obtained
by means of an efficient parallel algorithm, based on the multiplicative
weights update method, for approximately solving a certain class of
semidefinite programs.
