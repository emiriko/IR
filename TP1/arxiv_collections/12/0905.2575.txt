Although general relativity (GR) passes all present experimental tests with
flying colors, it remains important to study alternative theories of gravity
for several theoretical and phenomenological reasons that we recall in these
lecture notes. The various possible ways of modifying GR are presented, and we
notably show that the motion of massive bodies may be changed even if one
assumes that matter is minimally coupled to the metric as in GR. This is
illustrated with the particular case of scalar-tensor theories of gravity,
whose Fokker action is discussed, and we also mention the consequences of the
no-hair theorem on the motion of black holes. The finite size of the bodies
modifies their motion with respect to pointlike particles, and we give a simple
argument showing that the corresponding effects are generically much larger in
alternative theories than in GR. We also discuss possible modifications of
Newtonian dynamics (MOND) at large distances, which have been proposed to avoid
the dark matter hypothesis. We underline that all the previous classes of
alternatives to GR may a priori be used to predict such a phenomenology, but
that they generically involve several theoretical and experimental
difficulties.
