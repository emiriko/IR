Starting from the total energy expressions within density functional theory,
we are able to perform a comparison of several currently used charged-defect
finite-size supercell correction schemes in a unified manner. This approach
also provides a framework for a further development of corrections not only for
DFT supercell calculations, but also for more advanced methods and for complex
geometries. The comparison is performed for three separate defect cases: a
gallium vacancy in GaAs, a beryllium interstitial in GaAs and a vacancy in
diamond. We found two methods working sufficiently well for all three cases: a
method which is very similar to one presented by Freysoldt, and a slightly
altered potential alignment method.
