We describe the transfer of quantum information and correlations from an
entangled tripartite bosonic system to three separate qubits through their
local environments also in the presence of various dissipative effects. Optimal
state mapping and entanglement transfer are shown in the framework of optical
cavity quantum electrodynamics involving qubit-like radiation states and
two-level atoms via the mediation of cavity modes. For an input GHZ state mixed
with white noise we show the occurrence of sudden death and birth of
entanglement that is discontinuously exchanged among the tripartite subsystems.
