Measurements of strong suppression of inclusive hadron distributions and
di-hadron correlations at high $p_{T}$, while providing evidence for partonic
energy loss, also suffer from geometric biases due to the competition of energy
loss and fragmentation. The measurements of fully reconstructed jets is
expected to lack these biases as the energy flow is measured independently of
the fragmentation details. In this article, we review the recent results from
the heavy ion collisions collected by the STAR experiment at RHIC on direct jet
reconstruction utilizing the modern sequential recombination and cone jet
reconstruction algorithms together with their background subtraction
techniques. In order to assess the jet reconstruction biases a comparison with
the jet cross section measurement in $\sqrt{s}=200$ GeV p+p collisions scaled
by the number of binary nucleon-nucleon collisions to account for nuclear
geometric effects is performed. Comparison of the inclusive jet cross section
obtained in central Au+Au events with that in $p+p$ collisions, published
previously by STAR, suggests that unbiased jet reconstruction in the complex
heavy ion environment indeed may be possible.
