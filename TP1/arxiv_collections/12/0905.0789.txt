The propagation of waves in two space dimensions exhibited by two exact
solutions to the field equations of Einstein's unified field theory is
investigated under the assumption that the metric s_{ik} is the one already
chosen by Kursunoglu and by H\'ely in the years 1952-1954. It is shown that,
for both exact solutions, with this choice of the metric the propagation of the
waves occurs in the wave zone with the fundamental velocity (ds^2=0).
