We study the matter-antimatter asymmetry through the leptogenesis mechanism
in a specific model with the Friedberg-Lee (FL) symmetry.We relate the
leptogenesis with the CP violating Dirac and Majorana phases in the
Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata leptonic mixing matrix and illustrate the net baryon
asymmetry of the universe in terms of these phases.
