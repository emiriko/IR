We allow simultaneously for a CDM--DE coupling and non--zero neutrino masses
and find that significant coupling and neutrino mass are (slightly)
statistically favoured in respect to a cosmology with no coupling and
negligible neutrino mass (our best fits are: C~1/2m_p, m_\nu~0.12eV each
flavor). We assume DE to be a self--interacting scalar field and use a standard
Monte Carlo Markov Chain approach.
