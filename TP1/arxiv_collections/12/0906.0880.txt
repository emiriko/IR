The angular distributions of fission fragments for the $^{32}$S+$^{184}$W
reaction at center-of-mass energies of 118.8, 123.1, 127.3, 131.5, 135.8, 141.1
and 144.4 MeV were measured. The experimental fission excitation function is
obtained. The fragment angular anisotropy ($\mathcal{A}_{\rm exp}$) is found by
extrapolating the each fission angular distributions. The measured fission
cross sections of the $^{32}$S+$^{182,184}$W reaction are decomposed into
fusion-fission, quasifission and fast fission contributions by the dinuclear
system model. The total evaporation residue excitation function for the
$^{32}$S+$^{184}$W reaction calculated in the framework of the advanced
statistical model is in good agreement with the available experimental data up
to about $E_{\rm c.m.}\approx 160$ MeV. The theoretical descriptions of the
experimental capture excitation functions for both reactions and quantities
$K_0^2$, $<\ell^2>$ and $\mathcal{A}_{\rm exp}$ which characterize angular
distributions of the fission products were performed by the same partial
capture cross sections at the considered range of beam energy.
