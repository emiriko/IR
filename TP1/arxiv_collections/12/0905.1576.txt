Ideally, strong non-linearities could be used to implement quantum gates for
photonic qubits by well controlled two photon interactions. However, the
dependence of the non-linear interaction on frequency and time makes it
difficult to preserve a coherent pulse shape that could justify a single mode
model for the time-frequency degree of freedom of the photons. In this paper,
we analyze the problem of temporal multi-mode effects by considering the pulse
shape of the average output field obtained from a coherent input pulse. It is
shown that a significant part of the two photon state transformation can be
derived from this semi-classical description of the optical non-linearity. The
effect of a non-linear system on a two photon state can then be determined from
the density matrix dynamics of the coherently driven system using input-output
theory. As an example, the resonant non-linearity of a single two level atom is
characterized. The results indicate that the most efficient non-linear effect
may not be the widely studied single mode phase shift, but the transfer of one
of the photons to an orthogonal mode distinguished by its temporal and spectral
properties.
