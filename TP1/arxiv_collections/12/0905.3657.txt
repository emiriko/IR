We show that primordial black holes can be formed in the matter-dominated era
with gravity described by the Brans-Dicke theory. Considering an early
matter-dominated era between inflation and reheating, we found that the
primordial black holes formed during that era evaporate at a quicker than those
of early radiation-dominated era. Thus, in comparison with latter case, less
number of primordial black holes could exist today. Again the constraints on
primordial black hole formation tend towards the larger value than their
radiation-dominated era counterparts indicating a significant enhancement in
the formation of primordial black holes during the matter-dominaed era.
