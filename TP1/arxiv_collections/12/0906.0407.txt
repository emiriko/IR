We report enhanced optomechanical coupling by embedding a nano-mechanical
beam resonator within an optical race-track resonator. Precise control of the
mechanical resonator is achieved by clamping the beam between two low-loss
photonic crystal waveguide couplers. The low insertion loss and the rigid
mechanical support provided by the couplers yield both high mechanical and
optical Q-factors for improved signal quality.
