We study a scenario that a hidden gaugino dark matter decays into the
standard-model particles (and their supersymmetric partners) through a kinetic
mixing with the gaugino of a U(1)B-L broken at a scale close to the grand
unification scale. We show that decay of the hidden gaugino can explain
excesses in the cosmic-ray electrons and positrons observed by PAMELA and
Fermi.
