In the context of glass fiber manufacturing the onset of lubrication by a C18
double-chained cationic surfactant has been investigated at high normal contact
pressures. Comparison with adsorption kinetics demonstrates that lubrication is
not directly connected to the surfactant surface excess but originates from the
transition to a defect-free bilayer which generates limited dissipation. The
impact of ionic strength and shear rate has also been studied.
