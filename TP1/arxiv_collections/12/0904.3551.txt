The set of entanglement measures proposed by Hein, Eisert, and Briegel for
n-qubit graph states [Phys. Rev. A 69, 062311 (2004)] fails to distinguish
between inequivalent classes under local Clifford operations if n > 6. On the
other hand, the set of invariants proposed by van den Nest, Dehaene, and De
Moor (VDD) [Phys. Rev. A 72, 014307 (2005)] distinguishes between inequivalent
classes, but contains too many invariants (more than 2 10^{36} for n=7) to be
practical. Here we solve the problem of deciding which entanglement class a
graph state of n < 9 qubits belongs to by calculating some of the state's
intrinsic properties. We show that four invariants related to those proposed by
VDD are enough for distinguishing between all inequivalent classes with n < 9
qubits.
