Hard exclusive pi+ electroproduction is investigated within the handbag
approach. The prominent role of the pion-pole contribution is demonstrated. It
is also shown that the experimental data require a twist-3 effect which ensues
from the helicity-flip generalized parton distribution H_T and the twist-3 pion
wave function. The results calculated from this handbag approach are compared
in detail with the experimental data on cross sections and spin asymmetries
measured with a polarized target. It is also commented on consequences of this
approach for exclusive \pi^0 and vector-meson electroproduction.
