Basic properties of Uhlmann's partial fidelities are discussed. Statistical
interpretation in terms of POVM measurements is established. Multiplicativity
properties are considered. The relationship between partial fidelities and
partitioned trace distances is derived. As it is shown, the partial fidelities
cannot decrease under unistochastic quantum operations. Thus, the partial
fidelities have good properties in the sense of their use as distinguishability
measures.
