The hot subdwarf (sd) stars in the Palomar Green (PG) catalog of ultraviolet
excess (UVX) objects play a key role in investigations of the frequency and
types of binary companions and the distribution of orbital periods. These are
important for establishing whether and by which channels the sd stars arise
from interactions in close binary systems. It has been suggested that the list
of PG sd stars is biased by the exclusion of many stars in binaries, whose
spectra show the Ca II K line in absorption. A total of 1125 objects that were
photometrically selected as candidates were ultimately rejected from the final
PG catalog using this K-line criterion. We study 88 of these "PG-Rejects"
(PGRs), to assess whether there are significant numbers of unrecognized sd
stars in binaries among the PGR objects. The presence of a sd should cause a
large UVX. We assemble GALEX, Johnson V, and 2MASS photometry and compare the
colors of these PGR objects with those of known sd stars, cool single stars,
and hot+cool binaries. Sixteen PGRs were detected in both the far- and near-
ultraviolet GALEX passbands. Eleven of these, plus the 72 cases with only an
upper limit in the far-ultraviolet band, are interpreted as single cool stars.
Of the remaining five stars, three are consistent with being sd stars paired
with a cool main sequence companion, while two may be single stars or composite
systems of another type. We discuss the implications of these findings for the
1125 PGR objects as a whole. (slightly abridged)
