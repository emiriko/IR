We report resistivity and upper critical field B_c2(T) data for As deficient
LaO_(0.9)F_(0.1)FeAs_(1-delta) in a wide temperature and high field range up to
60 T. These disordered samples exhibit a slightly enhanced superconducting
transition at T_c = 29 K and a significantly enlarged slope dB_(c2))/dT = -5.4
T/K near T_c which contrasts with a flattening of B_(c2)(T) starting near 23 K
above 30 T. This flattening is interpreted as Pauli limiting behaviour (PLB)
with B_(c2)(0) approx 63 T. We compare our results with B_(c2)(T)-data reported
in the literature for clean and disordered samples. Whereas clean samples show
no PLB for fields below 60 to 70 T, the hitherto unexplained flattening of
B_(c2)(T) for applied fields H || ab observed for several disordered closely
related systems is interpreted also as a manifestation of PLB. Consequences of
our results are discussed in terms of disorder effects within the frame of
conventional and unconventional superconductivity.
