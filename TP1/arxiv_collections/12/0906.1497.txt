In this report we present systematic magnetic studies of pure iron oxide
nanoparticles and gold iron oxide nanocomposite with increasing Au particle
size/content. For the magnetic studies of these samples we have measured: (1)
zero field cooled (ZFC) and field cooled (FC) magnetization, (2) ac
susceptibility, (3) magnetization vs field at various temperatures, (4)
thermoremanant magnetization relaxation (TRM) and zero field cooled
magnetization relaxation (ZFCM) at fixed temperature for various wait times tw
for studying the aging effect, (5) magnetization memory effect and (6) exchange
bias as a function of cooling field. The detailed magnetic measurement analysis
indicates that the pure Fe3O4 nanoparticles sample behaves like a
superparamagnet and on incorporation of gold (Au) nanoparticles the
nanocomposite system slowly evolves from superparamagnetic to superspin glass
state. The memory and aging effect enhances with the increase of the Au
nanoparticle size/content. The most important observation in this study is the
enhancement of magnetization with the incorporation of Au nanoparticles. The
enhancement increases with the increase in the Au content in the nanocomposite.
We have explained the cause of this enhancement of magnetization as due to
large orbital magnetic moment formation at the Au/magnetic particle interface.
