The goal of this paper is to offer a full support for universities and
quality assessment committees in retrieving the feedback from their students
regarding to their teaching staff. The computer based application presented
before ([Cri07]) collects data from the students. Another part of the
application, presented in this paper, processes this data and presents the
statistical results concerning each teacher.
