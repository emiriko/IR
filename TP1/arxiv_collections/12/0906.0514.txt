We propose a model based on random dynamical systems (RDS) in information
spaces (realized as rings of $p$-adic integers) which supports Buonomano's
non-ergodic interpretation of quantum mechanics. In this model the memory
system of an equipment works as a dynamical system perturbed by noise.
Interference patterns correspond to attractors of RDS. There exists a large
class of $p$-adic RDS for which interference patterns cannot be disturbed by
noise. Therefore, if the equipment is described by such a RDS then the result
of statistical experiment does not depend on noise in the equipment. On the one
hand, we support the corpuscular model, because a quantum particle can be
described as a corpuscular object. On the other hand, our model does not differ
strongly from the wave model, because a quantum particle interacts with the
whole equipment. Hence the interaction has nonlocal character. For example, in
the two slit experiment a quantum particle interacts with both slits (but it
passes only one of them).
