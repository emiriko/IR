We study improper mixtures from a quantum logical and geometrical point of
view. Taking into account the fact that improper mixtures do not admit an
ignorance interpretation and must be considered as states in their own right,
we do not follow the standard approach which considers improper mixtures as
measures over the algebra of projections. Instead of it, we use the convex set
of states in order to construct a new lattice whose atoms are all physical
states: pure states and improper mixtures. This is done in order to overcome
one of the problems which appear in the standard quantum logical formalism,
namely, that for a subsystem of a larger system in an entangled state, the
conjunction of all actual properties of the subsystem does not yield its actual
state. In fact, its state is an improper mixture and cannot be represented in
the von Neumann lattice as a minimal property which determines all other
properties as is the case for pure states or classical systems. The new lattice
also contains all propositions of the von Neumann lattice. We argue that this
extension expresses in an algebraic form the fact that -alike the classical
case- quantum interactions produce non trivial correlations between the
systems. Finally, we study the maps which can be defined between the extended
lattice of a compound system and the lattices of its subsystems.
