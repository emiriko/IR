We consider the ensemble of curves
$\{\gamma_{\alpha,N}:\alpha\in(0,1],N\in\N\}$ obtained by linearly
interpolating the values of the normalized theta sum
$N^{-1/2}\sum_{n=0}^{N'-1}\exp(\pi i n^2\alpha)$, $0\leq N'<N$. We prove the
existence of limiting finite-dimensional distributions for such curves as
$N\to\infty$, with respect to an absolutely continuous probability measure
$\mu_R$ on $(0,1]$. Our Main Theorem generalizes a result by Marklof and Jurkat
and van Horne. Our proof relies on the analysis of the geometric structure of
such curves, which exhibit spiral-like patterns (curlicues) at different
scales. We exploit a renormalization procedure constructed by means of the
continued fraction expansion of $\alpha$ with even partial quotients and a
renewal-type limit theorem for the denominators of such continued fraction
expansions.
