Two examples of $\mathrm{Diff}^+S^1$-invariant closed two-forms obtained from
forms on jet bundles, which does not admit equivariant moment maps are
presented. The corresponding cohomological obstruction is computed and shown to
coincide with a nontrivial Lie algebra cohomology class on
$H^2(\mathfrak{X}(S^1))$.
