This paper proposes a complete IFoF system architecture derived from
simplified IEEE802.15.3c PHY layer proposal to successfully ensure near 1 Gbps
on the air interface. The system architecture utilizes low complexity baseband
processing modules. The byte/frame synchronization technique is designed to
provide a high value of preamble detection probability and a very small value
of the false detection probability. Conventional Reed-Solomon RS (255, 239)
coding is used for Channel Forward Error Correction (FEC). Good communication
link quality and Bit Error Rate (BER) results at 875 Mbps are achieved with
directional antennas.
