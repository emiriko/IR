(abridged) A Chandra observation of the X-ray bright group NGC 5044 shows
that the X-ray emitting gas has been strongly perturbed by recent outbursts
from the central AGN and also by motion of the central dominant galaxy relative
to the group gas. The NGC 5044 group hosts many small radio quiet cavities with
a nearly isotropic distribution, cool filaments, a semi-circular cold front and
a two-armed spiral shaped feature of cool gas. A GMRT observation of NGC 5044
at 610 MHz shows the presence of extended radio emission with a "torus-shaped"
morphology. The largest X-ray filament appears to thread the radio torus,
suggesting that the lower entropy gas within the filament is material being
uplifted from the center of the group. The radio emission at 235 MHz is much
more extended than the emission at 610 MHz, with little overlap between the two
frequencies. One component of the 235 MHz emission passes through the largest
X-ray cavity and is then deflected just behind the cold front. A second
detached radio lobe is also detected at 235 MHz beyond the cold front. All of
the smaller X-ray cavities in the center of NGC 5044 are undetected in the GMRT
observations. Since the smaller bubbles are probably no longer momentum driven
by the central AGN, their motion will be affected by the group "weather" as
they buoyantly rise outward. Hence, most of the enthalpy within the smaller
bubbles will likely be deposited near the group center and isotropized by the
group weather. The total mechanical power of the smaller radio quiet cavities
is $P_c = 9.2 \times 10^{41}$erg s$^{-1}$ which is sufficient to suppress about
one-half of the total radiative cooling within the central 10 kpc. This is
consistent with the presence of H$\alpha$ emission within this region which
shows that at least some of the gas is able to cool.
