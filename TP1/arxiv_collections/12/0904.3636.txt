We perform the first long-time exploration of the classical dynamics of a
driven billiard with a four dimensional phase space. With increasing velocity
of the ensemble we observe an evolution from a large chaotic sea with
stickiness due to regular islands to thin chaotic channels with diffusive
motion leading to Fermi acceleration. As a surprising consequence, we encounter
a crossover, which is not parameter induced but rather occurs dynamically, from
amplitude dependent tunable subdiffusion to universal normal diffusion in
momentum space. In the high velocity case we observe particle focusing in phase
space.
