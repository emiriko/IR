In this work we construct algebraic equation for elements of spectrum of
linearized Fokker - Planck differential operator for incompressible fluid. We
calculate roots of this equation using simple numeric method. For all these
roots real part is positive, that is corresponding solutions are damping.
Eigenfunctions of linearized Fokker - Planck differential operator for
incompressible fluid are expressed as linear combinations of eigenfunctions of
usual Fokker - Planck differential operator. Poisson's equation for pressure is
derived from incompressibility condition. It is stated, that the pressure could
be totally eliminated from dynamics equations. The Cauchy problem setup and
solution method is presented. The role of zero pressure solutions as
eigenfunctions for confluent eigenvalues is emphasized.
