We propose a mechanism of superconductivity from purely repulsive
interactions in the strong coupling regime, where the BCS
(Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer) mechanism such as the spin-fluctuation approach is
difficult to apply. Based on the SU(2) slave-rotor representation of the
Hubbard model, we find that the single energy scale for the amplitude formation
of Cooper pairs and their phase coherence is separated into two energy scales,
allowing the so called pseudogap state where such Cooper pairs are coherent
locally but not globally, interpreted as realization of the density-phase
uncertainty principle. This superconducting state shows the temperature-linear
decreasing ratio of superfluid weight, resulting from strong phase
fluctuations.
