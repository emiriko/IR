We study the influence of the shape of compact dimensions to the Casimir
energy and Casimir force of a scalar field. We examine both the massive and the
massless scalar field. The total spacetime topology is $M^D\times
T^2_{\theta}$, where $M^D$ is the $D$ dimensional Minkowski spacetime and
$T^2_{\theta}$ the twisted torus described by $R_1$, $R_2$ and $\theta$. For
the case $R_1=R_2$ we found that the massive bulk scalar field Casimir energy
is singular for $D$=even and this singularity is $R$-dependent and remains even
when the force is calculated. Also the massless Casimir energy and force is
regular only for D=4 (!). This is very interesting phenomenologically. We
examine the energy and force as a function of $\theta$. Also we address the
stabilization problem of the compact space. We also briefly discuss some
phenomenological implications.
