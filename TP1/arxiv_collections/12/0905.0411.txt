The recoil properties of the product nuclei from the interaction of 2.2
GeV/nucleon 12-C ions from Nuclotron of the Laboratory of High Energies (LHE),
Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) at Dubna with a 118-Sn target have
been studied using catcher foils. The experimental data were analyzed using the
mathematical formalism of the standard two-step vector model. The results for
12-C ions are compared with those for deuterons and protons. Three different
Los Alamos versions of the Quark-Gluon String Model (LAQGSM) were used for
comparison with our experimental data.
