The standing wave solution on an idealized mass spring system can be found
using straight forward algebra. The solution is found when this system makes
jump rope like rotations around an axis.The standing wave forms a constant
shape in a radial direction using the centripetal force condition. The wave is
projected back onto the x,y plane to get the planar time dependent solutions.
The allowed frequencies are found for a discrete system as well as a continuous
system.
