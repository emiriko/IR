Inhomogeneous broadening of energy levels is one of the principal limiting
factors for achieving "slow" or "stationary" light in solid state media by
means of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT), a quantum version of
stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP). Stark-shift-chirped
rapid-adiabatic-passage (SCRAP) has been shown to be far less sensitive to
inhomogeneous broadening than STIRAP, a population transfer technique to which
it is closely related. We further optimise the pulses used in SCRAP to be even
less sensitive to inhomogeneous broadening in a lambda-type three-level system.
The optimised pulses perform at a higher fidelity than the standard gaussian
pulses for a wide range of detunings (i.e. large inhomogeneous broadening).
