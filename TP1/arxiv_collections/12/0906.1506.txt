We are discussing long-time, scaling limit for the anomalous diffusion
composed of the subordinated L\'evy-Wiener process. The limiting anomalous
diffusion is in general non-Markov, even in the regime, where ensemble averages
of a mean-square displacement or quantiles representing the group spread of the
distribution follow the scaling characteristic for an ordinary stochastic
diffusion. To discriminate between truly memory-less process and the non-Markov
one, we are analyzing deviation of the survival probability from the (standard)
Sparre-Andersen scaling.
