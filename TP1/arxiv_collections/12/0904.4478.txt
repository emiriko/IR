We address the dual challenge of estimating deviations from Gaussianity
arising in models of the Early Universe, whilst retaining information necessary
to assess whether a detection of non-Gaussianity is primordial. We do this by
constructing a new statistic, the bispectrum-related power spectrum, which is
constructed from a map of the Cosmic Microwave Background. The estimator is
optimised for primordial non-Gaussianity detection, but can also be useful in
distinguishing primordial non-Gaussianity from secondary non-Gaussianity, such
as may arise from unsubtracted point sources, or residuals from component
separation. Extending earlier studies we present unbiased non-Gaussianity
estimators optimised for partial sky coverage and inhomogeneous noise
associated with realistic scan strategies, but which retain the ability to
assess foreground contamination.
