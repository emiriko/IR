We report on the etching of graphene devices with a helium ion beam,
including in situ electrical measurement during lithography. The etching
process can be used to nanostructure and electrically isolate different regions
in a graphene device, as demonstrated by etching a channel in a suspended
graphene device with etched gaps down to about 10 nm. Graphene devices on
silicon dioxide (SiO2) substrates etch with lower He ion doses and are found to
have a residual conductivity after etching, which we attribute to contamination
by hydrocarbons.
