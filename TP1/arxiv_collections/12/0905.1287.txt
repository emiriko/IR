As of early 2009, latest results on Galactic sources (mainly shell-type and
plerionic supernova remnants), as observed in the very-high-energy gamma-ray
domain, are reviewed. A particular attention is given to those obtained with
the H.E.S.S experiment during its Galactic Plane Survey which now covers the
inner part of the Milky Way. From the well identified gamma-ray sources to
those without any obvious counterpart and the putative Galactic diffuse
emission, this observational window fully deserves to be celebrated during this
International Year of Astronomy, as a new mean to image the Galaxy and reveal
sites of particle acceleration, potentially at the origin of Galactic cosmic
rays.
