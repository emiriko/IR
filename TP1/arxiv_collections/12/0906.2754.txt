We expound in detail a method frequently used to reduce the Dirac equation in
D-dimensional (D >= 4) spherically symmetric spacetimes to a pair of coupled
partial differential equations in two variables. As a simple application of
these results we exactly calculate the quasinormal frequencies of the uncharged
Dirac field propagating in the D-dimensional Nariai spacetime.
