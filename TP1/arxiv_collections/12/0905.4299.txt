A proper estimation of the chiral low-energy constants of Chiral Perturbation
Theory is a very important task. To this end resonance chiral Lagrangians have
been used fruitfully. We have studied the determination of chiral couplings at
next-to-leading (NLO) order in the 1/N(C) expansion, keeping full control of
the renormalization scale dependence. We find that, by imposing short-distance
constraints coming from QCD, resonance saturation at NLO in 1/N(C) is
satisfied. In other words, the chiral couplings can be written in terms of the
resonance masses and couplings and do not depend explicitly on the coefficients
of the chiral operators in the Goldstone boson sector of Resonance Chiral
Theory.
