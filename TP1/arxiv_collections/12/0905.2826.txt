We propose an all-optical scheme to probe the dynamical correlations of a
strongly-interacting gas of ultracold atoms. The proposed technique is based on
a pump-and-probe scheme: a coherent light pulse is initially converted into an
atomic coherence and later retrieved after a variable storage time. The
efficiency of the proposed method to measure the one-particle Green function of
the gas is validated by numerical and analytical calculations of the expected
signal for the two cases of a normal Fermi gas and a BCS superfluid state.
Protocols to extract the superfluid gap and the full quasi-particle dispersions
are discussed.
