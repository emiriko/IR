We present a recent study of vector meson-vector meson interaction using a
unitary approach based on the hidden-gauge Lagrangians. We find that 11 states
get dynamically generated, corresponding to poles of the scattering matrices on
the second Riemann sheet. Five of them are associated to the $f_0(1370)$,
$f_0(1710)$, $f_2(1270)$, $f_2'(1525)$, and $K^*_2(1430)$, by comparing the
mass, width, and decay pattern of these states with those of their experimental
counterparts. Six others with the quantum numbers of $h_1$, $a_0$, $b_1$,
$a_2$, $K^*_0$, and $K_1$ can not be clearly identified with any experimentally
observed resonances and should be taken as predictions to be tested by future
experiments.
