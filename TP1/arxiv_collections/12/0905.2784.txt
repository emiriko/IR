The ability to manipulate nano-particles at the nano-scale is critical for
the development of active quantum systems. This paper presents a new technique
to manipulate diamond nano-crystals at the nano-scale using a scanning electron
microscope, nano-manipulator and custom tapered optical fibre probes. The
manipulation of a ~ 300 nm diamond crystal, containing a single
nitrogen-vacancy centre, onto the endface of an optical fibre is demonstrated.
The emission properties of the single photon source post manipulation are in
excellent agreement with those observed on the original substrate.
