The dynamics of the gravitational collapse is examined in the realm of string
based formalism of D-branes that encompass General Relativity as a low energy
limit. A complete analytical solution is given to the spherically symmetric
collapse of a pure dust star, including its matching with a corrected
Schwarzschild exterior spacetime. The collapse forms a black hole (an exterior
event horizon) enclosing not a singularity but perpetually bouncing matter in
the infinite chain of spacetime maximal analytical extensions inside the outer
event horizon. This chain of analytical extensions has a structure analogous to
that of the Reissner-Nordstrom solution, except that the timelike singularities
are avoided by bouncing barriers. The interior trapped bouncing matter has the
possibility of being expelled by disruptive nonlinear resonance mechanisms.
