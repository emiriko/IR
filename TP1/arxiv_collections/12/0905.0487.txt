The WMAP haze is an excess in the 22 to 93 GHz frequency bands of WMAP
extending about 10 degrees from the galactic center. We show that synchrotron
emission from electron-positron pairs injected into the interstellar medium by
the galactic population of pulsars with energies in the 1 to 100 GeV range can
explain the frequency spectrum of the WMAP haze and the drop in the average
haze power with latitude. The same spectrum of high energy electron-positron
pairs from pulsars, which gives rise to the haze, may also generate the
observed excesses in AMS, HEAT and PAMELA. We discuss the spatial morphology of
the pulsar synchrotron signal and its deviation from spherical symmetry, which
may provide an avenue to determine the pulsar contribution to the haze.
