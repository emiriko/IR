We have investigated the shifts of the core-level photoemission spectra of
La$_{0.6}$Sr$_{0.4}$MnO$_3$ thin films grown on three kinds of substrates,
SrTiO$_3$, (LaAlO$_3$)$_{0.3}$-(SrAl$_{0.5}$Ta$_{0.5}$O$_3$)$_{0.7}$, and
LaAlO$_3$. The experimental shifts of the La 4d and Sr 3d core levels are
almost the same as the calculation, which we attribute to the absence of
covalency effects on the Madelung potentials at these atomic sites due to the
nearly ionic character of these atoms. On the other hand, the experimental
shifts of the O $1s$ and Mn $2p$ core levels are negligibly small, in
disagreement with the calculation. We consider that this is due to the strong
covalent character of the Mn-O bonds.
