We spectroscopically study the variability of H-alpha emission in mid- to
late-M dwarfs on timescales of ~0.1-1 hr as a proxy for magnetic variability.
About 80% of our sample exhibits statistically significant variability on the
full range of timescales probed by the observations, and with amplitude ratios
in the range of ~1.2-4. No events with an order of magnitude increase in
H-alpha luminosity were detected, indicating that their rate is < 0.05 /hr (95%
confidence level). We find a clear increase in variability with later spectral
type, despite an overall decrease in H-alpha "activity" (i.e.,
L_{H-alpha}/L_{bol}). For the ensemble of H-alpha variability events, we find a
nearly order of magnitude increase in the number of events from timescales of
about 10 to 30 min, followed by a roughly uniform distribution at longer
durations. The event amplitudes follow an exponential distribution with a
characteristic scale of Max(EW)/Min(EW)}-1 ~ 0.7. This distribution predicts a
low rate of ~ 10^{-6} /hr for events with (Max(EW)/Min(EW) > 10, but
serendipitous detections of such events in the past suggests that they
represent a different distribution. Finally, we find a possible decline in the
amplitude of events with durations of > 0.5 hr, which may point to a typical
energy release in H-alpha events for each spectral type (E_{H-alpha} ~
L_{H-alpha} x t ~ const). Longer observations of individual active objects are
required to further investigate this possibility. Similarly, a larger sample
may shed light on whether H-alpha variability correlates with properties such
as age or rotation velocity.
