The Serre construction of rank two holomorphic bundles with a section is
adapted to construct generalized holomorphic bundles on a generalized complex
4-manifold from the data of a set of points on an elliptic curve. The
motivation is the special case of rank two Poisson modules on a complex surface
with a holomorphic Poisson structure.
