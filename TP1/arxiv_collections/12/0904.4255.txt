We have studied the [100]-[110] anisotropy of the Compton profile in the
bilayer manganite. Quantitative agreement is found between theory and
experiment with respect to the anisotropy in the two metallic phases (i.e. the
low temperature ferromagnetic and the colossal magnetoresistant phase under a
magnetic field of 7 T). Robust signatures of the metal-insulator transition are
identified in the momentum density for the paramagnetic phase above the Curie
temperature. We interpret our results as providing direct evidence for the
transition from the metallic-like to the admixed ionic-covalent bonding
accompanying the magnetic transition. The number of electrons involved in this
phase transition is estimated from the area enclosed by the Compton profile
anisotropy differences. Our study demonstrates the sensitivity of the Compton
scattering technique for identifying the number and type of electrons involved
in the metal-insulator transition.
