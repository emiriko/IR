The model by Braginskii for the viscous stress tensor is used to determine
the shear and gyroviscous forces acting within a toroidally confined plasma.
Comparison is made to a previous evaluation which contains an inconsistent
treatment of the radial derivative and neglects the effect of the pitch angle.
Parallel viscosity contributes a radial shear viscous force which may develop
for sufficient vertical asymmetry to the ion velocity profile. An evaluation is
performed of this radial viscous force for a tokamak near equilibrium which
indicates qualitative agreement between theory and measurement for impure
plasma discharges with strong toroidal flow.
