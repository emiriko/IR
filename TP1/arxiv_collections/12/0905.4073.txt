A novel technique is employed for estimating attenuation curves in galaxies
where only photometry and spectroscopic redshifts are available. This technique
provides a powerful measure of particular extinction features such as the UV
bump at 2175\A, which has been observed in environments ranging from the Milky
Way to high-redshift star-forming galaxies. Knowledge of the typical strength
of the UV bump as a function of environment and redshift is crucial for
converting restframe UV flux into star formation rates. The UV bump will impart
a unique signature as it moves through various filters due to redshifting; its
presence can therefore be disentangled from other stellar population effects.
The utility of this technique is demonstrated with a large sample of galaxies
drawn from the DEEP2 Galaxy Redshift Survey. The observed B-R color of
star-forming galaxies at 0.6<z<1.4 disfavors the presence of a UV bump as
strong as observed in the Milky Way, and instead favors restframe UV
(1800A<lambda<3000A) attenuation curves similar to the Milky Way without a UV
bump or a power-law with index delta=-0.7. Stronger constraints on the strength
of the UV bump in galaxies can be achieved if independent constraints on the
V-band optical depth are available.
