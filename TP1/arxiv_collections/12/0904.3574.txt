We study theoretically the effects of spatial confinement on the phoretic
motion of a dissolved particle driven by composition gradients generated by
chemical reactions of its solvent, which are active only on certain parts of
the particle surface. We show that the presence of confining walls increases in
a similar way both the composition gradients and the viscous friction, and the
overall result of these competing effects is an increase in the phoretic
velocity of the particle. For the case of steric repulsion only between the
particle and the product molecules of the chemical reactions, the absolute
value of the velocity remains nonetheless rather small.
