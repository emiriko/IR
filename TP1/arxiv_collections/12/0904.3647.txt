The TACTIC gamma-ray telescope, equipped with a tracking light collector of
$\sim$9.5m$^2$ area and a 349-pixel imaging camera has been in operation at
Mount Abu in Western India since 2001. Having a sensitivity of detecting the
Crab Nebula above 1.2 TeV at 5.0$\sigma$ significance level in 25h of
observations, this telescope has detected gamma-ray emissions from Mrk501 and
Mrk421 and is presently being deployed for monitoring of AGNs. As a new Indian
initiative in $\gamma$-ray astronomy we are setting up the 21-m diameter MACE
$\gamma$-ray telescope at the high altitude (4200m asl) astronomical site at
Hanle in North India. This telescope will deploy a 1408-pixels integrated
camera at its focal plane. Designed to operate at a trigger threshold of
$\sim$30 GeV, this telescope is expected to be operational in 2011. Some of the
salient features of the TACTIC telescope along with the results of its recent
observations and the design details of the MACE telescope are presented in this
paper.
