We numerically evaluate the entanglement spectrum (singular value
decomposition of the wavefunction) of paired states of fermions in two
dimensions that break parity and time-reversal symmetries, focusing on the
spin-polarized $p_x+ip_y$ case. The entanglement spectrum of the weak-pairing
(BCS) phase contains a Majorana zero mode, indicating non-Abelian topological
order. In contrast, for the strong-pairing (BEC) phase, we find no such mode,
consistent with Abelian topological order.
