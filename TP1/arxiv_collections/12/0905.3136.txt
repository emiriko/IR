We introduce a variant to the Diffusion Monte Carlo algorithm that can be
employed to study the effects of the Rashba interaction in a many electron
systems. Because of the spin--orbit nature of Rashba interaction a standard
algorithm cannot be applied and therefore a specific imaginary time spin
dependent propagator has been developed and implemented following previous work
developed in the framework of nuclear physics. We computed the ground state
energy of the 2D electron gas at different densities for several values of the
Rashba interaction strength as a function of "Rashba spin states" polarization.
Comparison is given with analytically known Hartree-Fock results and for the
system in absence of Coulomb interaction.
