A new instrument for high resolution imaging of fast-neutrons is presented
here. It is designed for energy selective radiography in nanosecond-pulsed
broad-energy (1 - 10 MeV) neutron beams. The device presented here is based on
hydrogenous scintillator screens and single- or multiple-gated intensified
camera systems (ICCD). A key element is a newly developed optical amplifier
which generates sufficient light for the high-speed intensified camera system,
even from such faint light sources as fast plastic and liquid scintillators.
Utilizing the Time-of-Flight (TOF) method, the detector incorporating the above
components is capable of simultaneously taking up to 8 images, each at a
different neutron energy.
