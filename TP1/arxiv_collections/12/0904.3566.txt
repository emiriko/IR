This paper discusses a new variable equation of state parameter leading to
exact solutions of the Einstein field equations describing traversable
wormholes. In addition to generalizing the notion of phantom energy, the
equation of state generates a mathematical model that combines the generalized
phantom energy and the generalized Chaplygin gas models.
