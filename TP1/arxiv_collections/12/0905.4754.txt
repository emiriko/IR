When a top quark decays there is a large amount of angular correlation, in
its rest frame, between its spin orientation and the direction of flight of the
charged lepton from its decay. In this letter we investigate the prospects of
measuring this angular correlation using the MC@NLO framework. The strength of
the correlation is investigated for different spin bases. The robustness
against variations of PDF sets and uncertainties, factorization scale
dependence, center-of-mass energy, and the jet R-parameter, is also examined.
