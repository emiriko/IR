We present the CIFF proof procedure for abductive logic programming with
constraints, and we prove its correctness. CIFF is an extension of the IFF
proof procedure for abductive logic programming, relaxing the original
restrictions over variable quantification (allowedness conditions) and
incorporating a constraint solver to deal with numerical constraints as in
constraint logic programming. Finally, we describe the CIFF system, comparing
it with state of the art abductive systems and answer set solvers and showing
how to use it to program some applications. (To appear in Theory and Practice
of Logic Programming - TPLP).
