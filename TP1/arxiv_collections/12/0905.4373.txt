We consider a massless, minimally coupled scalar field propagating through
the geometry of a black 3-brane in an asymptotically $AdS_5 \times S^5$ space.
The wave equation for modes traveling purely in the holographic direction
reduces to a Heun equation and the corresponding greybody factor is obtained
numerically. Approximations valid in the low- and high-frequency regimes are
also obtained analytically. The greybody factor is then used to determine the
rate of evaporation of these large black holes in the context of the evaporon
model proposed in \cite{Rocha:2008fe}. This setting represents the evolution of
a black hole under Hawking evaporation with a known CFT dual description and is
therefore unitary. Information must then be preserved under this evaporation
process.
