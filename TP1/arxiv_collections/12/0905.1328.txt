We present a catalog of 1750 massive stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud,
with accurate spectral types compiled from the literature, and a photometric
catalog for a subset of 1268 of these stars, with the goal of exploring their
infrared properties. The photometric catalog consists of stars with infrared
counterparts in the Spitzer SAGE survey database, for which we present uniform
photometry from 0.3-24 microns in the UBVIJHKs+IRAC+MIPS24 bands. The resulting
infrared color-magnitude diagrams illustrate that the supergiant B[e], red
supergiant and luminous blue variable (LBV) stars are among the brightest
infrared point sources in the Large Magellanic Cloud, due to their intrinsic
brightness, and at longer wavelengths, due to dust. We detect infrared excesses
due to free-free emission among ~900 OB stars, which correlate with luminosity
class. We confirm the presence of dust around 10 supergiant B[e] stars, finding
the shape of their spectral energy distributions (SEDs) to be very similar, in
contrast to the variety of SED shapes among the spectrally variable LBVs. The
similar luminosities of B[e] supergiants (log L/Lo>=4) and the rare, dusty
progenitors of the new class of optical transients (e.g. SN 2008S and NGC 300
OT), plus the fact that dust is present in both types of objects, suggests a
common origin for them. We find the infrared colors for Wolf-Rayet stars to be
independent of spectral type and their SEDs to be flatter than what models
predict. The results of this study provide the first comprehensive roadmap for
interpreting luminous, massive, resolved stellar populations in nearby galaxies
at infrared wavelengths.
