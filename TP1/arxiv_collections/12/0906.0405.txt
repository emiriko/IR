We report the coupling of photons from an optical fiber taper to surface
plasmon modes of silver nanowires. The launch of propagating plasmons can be
realized not only at ends of the nanowires, but also at the midsection. The
degree of the coupling can be controlled by adjusting the light polarization.
In addition, we present the coupling of light into multiple nanowires from a
single optical fiber taper simultaneously. Our demonstration offers a novel
method for optimizing plasmon coupling into nanoscale metallic waveguides and
promotes the realization of highly integrated plasmonic devices.
