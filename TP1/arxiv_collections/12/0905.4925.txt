This article examines how breaking a Lorentz-invariant description of nature
at tiny space-time intervals would affect the non-Gaussian character of the
pattern of primordial perturbations left by inflation. We specifically study a
set of irrelevant operators that preserve the spatial symmetries of the usual
inflationary background. The non-Gaussian component in the primordial
fluctuations can be much larger than the usual, small, inflationary prediction
and can thus lead to much stronger constraints on the role of "trans-Planckian"
physics in inflation than those from the measurements of the primordial power
spectrum.
