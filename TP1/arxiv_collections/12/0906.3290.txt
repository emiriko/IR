The search for direct interactions of dark matter particles remains one of
the most pressing challenges of contemporary experimental physics. A variety of
different approaches is required to probe the available parameter space and to
meet the technological challenges. Here, we review the experimental efforts
towards the detection of direct dark matter interactions using scintillating
crystals at cryogenic temperatures. We outline the ideas behind these detectors
and describe the principles of their operation. Recent developments are
summarized and various results from the search for rare processes are
presented. In the search for direct dark matter interactions, the CRESST-II
experiment delivers competitive limits, with a sensitivity below 5x10^(-7) pb
on the coherent WIMP-nucleon cross section.
