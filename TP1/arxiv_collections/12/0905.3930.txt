We propose and design a new type of nonlinear metamaterials exhibiting a
resonant electric response at microwave frequencies. By introducing a varactor
diode as a nonlinear element within each resonator, we are able to shift the
frequency of the electric mode stop-band by changing the incident power,
without affecting the magnetic response. These elements could be combined with
the previously developed nonlinear magnetic metamaterials in order to create
negative index media with control over both electric and magnetic
nonlinearities.
