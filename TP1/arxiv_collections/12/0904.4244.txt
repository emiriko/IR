We combine new Spitzer Space Telescope observations in the mid- and
far-infrared with SCUBA 850 micron observations to improve the measurement of
dust temperatures, masses and luminosities for 11 galaxies of the SCUBA Local
Universe Galaxy Survey (SLUGS). By fitting dust models we measure typical dust
masses of 10E7.9 M_sol and dust luminosities of ~ 10E10 L_sol, for galaxies
with modest star formation rates. The data presented in this paper combined
with previous observations show that cold dust is present in all types of
spiral galaxies and is a major contributor to their total luminosity. Because
of the lower dust temperature of the SCUBA sources measured in this paper, they
have flatter Far-IR nu F_nu(160um)/nu F_nu(850um) slopes than the larger
Spitzer Nearby Galaxies Survey (SINGS), the sample that provides the best
measurements of the dust properties of galaxies in the nearby universe. The new
data presented here added to SINGS extend the parameter space that is well
covered by local galaxies, providing a comprehensive set of templates that can
be used to interpret the observations of nearby and distant galaxies.
