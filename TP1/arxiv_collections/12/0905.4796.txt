This is the second of a series of papers on the special relativistic
classical statistical mechanics. Employing the general theory developed in the
first paper we rigorously derive the relativistic Vlasov, Landau and Boltzmann
equation. The latter two advocate the J{\"u}ttner distribution as the
equilibrium distribution. We thus, at the full microscopic level, provide a
support for the recent numerical finding [D. Cubero {\it et. al.}, Phys. Rev.
Lett. \textbf{99}, 170601 (2007)] of the special relativistic generalization of
the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. Furthermore, the present theory allows us
to rigorously calculate various correlation functions at the relativistic
many-body equilibrium. Therefore, the relativistic many-body equilibrium
conjecture of Hakim is justified.
