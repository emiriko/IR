We present recent results for radiative and electroweak penguin decays of $B$
me son at Belle. Measurements of differential branching fraction, isospin
asymmetr y, $K^*$ polarization, and forward-backward asymmetry as functions of
$q^2$ for $B \to K^{(*)}ll$ decays are reported. For the results of the
radiative process, we report measurements of branching fractions for inclusive
$B\to X_s \gamma$ and the exclusive $B\to K \eta' \gamma$ modes.
