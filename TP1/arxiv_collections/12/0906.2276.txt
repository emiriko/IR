The integration of ferromagnetic and ferroelectric materials into hybrid
heterostructures yields multifunctional systems with improved or novel
functionality. We here report on the structural, electronic and magnetic
properties of the ferromagnetic double perovskite Sr2CrReO6, grown as epitaxial
thin film onto ferroelectric BaTiO3. As a function of temperature, the
crystal-structure of BaTiO3 undergoes phase transitions, which induce
qualitative changes in the magnetic anisotropy of the ferromagnet. We observe
abrupt changes in the coercive field of up to 1.2T along with resistance
changes of up to 6.5%. These results are attributed to the high sensitivity of
the double perovskites to mechanical deformation.
