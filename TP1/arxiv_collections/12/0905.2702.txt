I propose a feedback model to explain the correlation between the
supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass and the host galaxy bulge mass. The
feedback is based on narrow jets that are launched by the central SMBH, and
expel large amounts of mass to large distances. The condition is that the jets
do not penetrate through the inflowing gas, such that they can deposit their
energy in the inner region where the bulge is formed. For that to occur, the
SMBH must move relative to the inflowing gas, such that the jets continuously
encounter fresh gas. Taking into account the relative motion of the SMBH and
the inflowing gas I derive a relation between the mass accreted by the SMBH and
the mass that is not expelled, and is assumed to form the bulge. This relation
is not linear, but rather the SMBH to bulge mass ratio increases slowly with
mass. The same mechanism was applied to suppress star formation in cooling flow
clusters, making a tighter connection between the feedback in galaxy formation
and cooling flows.
