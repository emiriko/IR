We explore the available parameter space of the minimal vectorial Standard
Model. In this theory, the gauge currents are initially vectorial but the Higgs
sector produces chiral mass eigenstates, leading to a set of heavy right-handed
mirror particles. We describe the phenomenology of the residual parameter space
and suggest that the model will be readily tested at the LHC.
