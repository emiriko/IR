In this paper we establish a relation between quantum relative phase,
$m$-tangle, and multi-local Lorentz-group invariant or
$SL(2,\mathbb{C})^{\times m}$-invariant $S^{2}_{(m)}$. Our construction is
based on the orthogonal complement of a positive operator valued measure on
quantum phase. In particular, we propose a quantity based on the quantum
relative phase of a multi-qubit operator that coincides with
  $m$-tangle, and multi-local Lorentz-group invariant.
