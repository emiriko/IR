We investigate the dependence of the electrical resistivity of $\sim 60 $nm
thick single crystalline graphite samples on the defect concentration produced
by proton irradiation at very low fluences. We show that the resistivity
decreases few percent at room temperature after inducing defects at
concentrations as low as $\sim 0.1 $ppm due to the increase in the carrier
density, in agreement with theoretical estimates. The overall results indicate
that the carrier densities measured in graphite are not intrinsic but related
to defects and impurities.
