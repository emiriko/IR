The Gemini Planet Imager (GPI) is an instrument designed for the Gemini South
telescope to image young Jupiter-mass planets in the infrared. To achieve the
high contrast needed for this, it employs an apodized pupil Lyot coronagraph
(APLC) to remove most of the starlight. Current designs use a
partially-transmitting apodizer in the pupil; we examine the use of binary
apodizations in the form of starshaped shaped pupils, and present a design that
could achieve comparable performance, along with a series of design guidelines
for creating shaped pupil versions of APLCs in other systems.
