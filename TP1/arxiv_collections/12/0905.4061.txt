We explored the anomalously low moment in MnSi found by experiment (~0.4
$\mu_{\text{B}}$/Mn) vs the moment predicted by density functional theory (~1.0
$\mu_{\text{B}}$/Mn). With the addition of a Hubbard-U correction, we found
several solutions with lower moments. These lower moment solutions show an
unusual magnetic order and a magnetic quadrupole moment. The behavior of the
moment under pressure does not follow the experimental trend.
