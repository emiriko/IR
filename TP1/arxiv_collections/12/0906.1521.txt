Stable and switchable polarization of ferroelectric materials opens a
possibility to electrically control their functional behavior. A particularly
promising approach is to employ ferroelectric tunnel junctions where the
polarization reversal in a ferroelectric barrier changes the tunneling current
across the junction. Here, we demonstrate the reproducible tunneling
electroresistance effect using a combination of Piezoresponse Force Microscopy
(PFM) and Conducting Atomic Force Microscopy (C-AFM) techniques on
nanometer-thick epitaxial BaTiO3 single crystal thin films on SrRuO3 bottom
electrodes. Correlation between ferroelectric and electronic transport
properties is established by the direct nanoscale visualization and control of
polarization and tunneling current in BaTiO3 films. The obtained results show a
change in resistance by about two orders of magnitude upon polarization
reversal on a lateral scale of 20 nm at room temperature. These results are
promising for employing ferroelectric tunnel junctions in non-volatile memory
and logic devices, not involving charge as a state variable.
