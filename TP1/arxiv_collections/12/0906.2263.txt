In this paper we discuss how we can read a planets spectrum to assess its
habitability and search for the signatures of a biosphere. After a decade rich
in giant exoplanet detections, observation techniques have now reached the
ability to find planets of less than 10 MEarth (so called Super-Earths) that
may potentially be habitable. How can we characterize those planets and assess
if they are habitable? The new field of extrasolar planet search has shown an
extraordinary ability to combine research by astrophysics, chemistry, biology
and geophysics into a new and exciting interdisciplinary approach to understand
our place in the universe. The results of a first generation mission will most
likely result in an amazing scope of diverse planets that will set planet
formation, evolution as well as our planet in an overall context.
