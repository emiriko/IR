We present a novel approach to study the ground state and elementary
excitations in compounds where spins and orbitals are entangled by on-site
relativistic spin-orbit interaction. The appropriate degrees of freedom are
localized states with an effective angular momentum J. We generalize J to
arbitrary large values while maintaining the delicate spin-orbital
entanglement. After projecting the inter-site exchange interaction to the
manifold of effective spins, a systematic 1/J expansion of the effective
Hamiltonian is realized using the Holstein-Primakoff transformation.
Applications to representative compounds Sr2IrO4 and particularly vanadium
spinels AV2O4 are discussed.
