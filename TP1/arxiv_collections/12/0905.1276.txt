We investigate the effect of Na intercalation in the layered Mott insulator
TiOCl within the framework of density functional theory. We show that the
system remains always insulating for all studied Na concentrations, and the
evolution of the spectral weight upon Na doping is consistent with recent
photoemission experiments. We predict the Na-doped superlattice structures, and
show that substitutions of O by F, Cl by S, or Ti by V (or Sc), respectively,
fail to metallize the system. We propose a description in terms of a
multiorbital ionic Hubbard model in a quasi-two-dimensional lattice and discuss
the nature of the insulating state under doping. Finally, a likely route for
metallizing TiOCl by doping is proposed.
