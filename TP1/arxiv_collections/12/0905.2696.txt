We discuss neutralino dark matter arising from supersymmetric models with
extra inert Higgsinos and singlinos, where inert means that their scalar
partners do not get vacuum expectation values. As an example, we consider the
extended neutralino sector of the E$_6$SSM, which predicts three families of
Higgs doublet pairs, plus three singlets, plus a $Z'$, together with their
fermionic superpartners. We show that the two families of inert doublet
Higgsinos and singlinos predicted by this model provide an almost decoupled
neutralino sector with a naturally light LSP which can account for the cold
dark matter relic abundance independently of the rest of the model, providing
that the ratio of the two usual Higgs doublets satisfies tan beta < 2.
