The static solutions of the axially symmetric vacuum Einstein equations with
a finite number of Relativistic Multipole Moments are described by means of a
function that can be written in the same analytic form as the Newtonian
gravitational multipole potential. A family of so-called MSA
(Multipole-Symmetry Adapted) coordinates are introduced and calculated at any
multipole order to perform the transformation of the Weyl solutions.
  In analogy with a previous result obtained in Newtonian gravity, the
existence of a symmetry of a certain system of differential equations leading
to the determination of that kind of multipole solutions in General Relativity
is explored. The relationship between the existence of this kind of coordinate
and the symmetries mentioned is proved for some cases, and the characterization
of the MSA system of coordinates by means of this relationship is discussed.
