Libraries of stellar spectra are fundamental tools in the study of stellar
populations and in automatic determination of atmospheric parameters for large
samples of observed stars. In the context of the present volume, here I give an
overview of the current status of stellar spectral libraries from the
perspective of stellar population modeling: what we have currently available,
how good they are, and where we need further improvement.
