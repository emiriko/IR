The ZEUS and H1 collaborations have made the first direct measurements of the
longitudinal proton structure function, FL, which is strongly correlated to the
gluon density in the proton. The ZEUS collaboration have also extracted the
structure function, F2, which, for the first time, has been done so at high y
without any assumptions about FL.
