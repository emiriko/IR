We investigate ferromagnetic ordering in an itinerant ultracold atomic Fermi
gas with repulsive interactions and population imbalance. In a spatially
uniform system, we show that at zero temperature the transition to the
itinerant magnetic phase transforms from first to second order with increasing
population imbalance. Drawing on these results, we elucidate the phases present
in a trapped geometry, finding three characteristic types of behavior with
changing population imbalance. Finally, we outline the potential experimental
implications of the findings.
