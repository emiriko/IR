Understanding the origins and distribution of matter in the Universe is one
of the most important quests in physics and astronomy. Themes range from
astro-particle physics to chemical evolution in the Galaxy to cosmic
nucleosynthesis and chemistry in an anticipation of a full account of matter in
the Universe. Studies of chemical evolution in the early Universe will answer
questions about when and where the majority of metals were formed, how they
spread and why they appar today as they are. The evolution of matter in our
Universe cannot be characterized as a simple path of development. In fact the
state of matter today tells us that mass and matter is under constant
reformation through on-going star formation, nucleosynthesis and mass loss on
stellar and galactic scales. X-ray absorption studies have evolved in recent
years into powerful means to probe the various phases of interstellar and
intergalactic media. Future observatories such as IXO and Gen-X will provide
vast new opportunities to study structure and distribution of matter with high
resolution X-ray spectra. Specifically the capabilities of the soft energy
gratings with a resolution of R=3000 onboard IXO will provide ground breaking
determinations of element abundance, ionization structure, and dispersion
velocities of the interstellar and intergalactic media of our Galaxy and the
Local Group
