In this talk notes we expose the possibility to induce the cosmological
constant from extra dimensions, in a geometrical framework where our
four-dimensional Riemannian space-time is embedded into a five-dimensional Weyl
integrable space. In particular following the approach of the induced matter
theory, we show that when go down from five to four dimensions, we may recover
in the context of the general theory of relativity, the induced energy momentum
tensor of the induced matter theory plus a cosmological constant term, that is
determined by the presence of the Weyl scalar field on the bulk.
