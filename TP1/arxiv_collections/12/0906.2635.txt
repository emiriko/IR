Clusters of genes that have evolved by repeated segmental duplication present
difficult challenges throughout genomic analysis, from sequence assembly to
functional analysis. Improved understanding of these clusters is of utmost
importance, since they have been shown to be the source of evolutionary
innovation, and have been linked to multiple diseases, including HIV and a
variety of cancers. Previously, Zhang et al. (2008) developed an algorithm for
reconstructing parsimonious evolutionary histories of such gene clusters, using
only human genomic sequence data. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic
model for the evolution of gene clusters on a phylogeny, and an MCMC algorithm
for reconstruction of duplication histories from genomic sequences in multiple
species. Several projects are underway to obtain high quality BAC-based
assemblies of duplicated clusters in multiple species, and we anticipate that
our method will be useful in analyzing these valuable new data sets.
