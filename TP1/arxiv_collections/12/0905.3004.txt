This document describes the physics potential of a new fixed-target program
based on a ~1 TeV proton source. Two proton sources are potentially available
in the future: the existing Tevatron at Fermilab, which can provide 800 GeV
protons for fixed-target physics, and a possible upgrade to the SPS at CERN,
called SPS+, which would produce 1 TeV protons on target. In this paper we use
an example Tevatron fixed-target program to illustrate the high discovery
potential possible in the charm and neutrino sectors. We highlight examples
which are either unique to the program or difficult to accomplish at other
venues.
