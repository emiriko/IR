This paper presents new results about digital straight segments, their
recognition and related properties. They come from the study of the
arithmetically based recognition algorithm proposed by I. Debled-Rennesson and
J.-P. Reveill\`es in 1995 [Debled95]. We indeed exhibit the relations
describing the possible changes in the parameters of the digital straight
segment under investigation. This description is achieved by considering new
parameters on digital segments: instead of their arithmetic description, we
examine the parameters related to their combinatoric description. As a result
we have a better understanding of their evolution during recognition and
analytical formulas to compute them. We also show how this evolution can be
projected onto the Stern-Brocot tree. These new relations have interesting
consequences on the geometry of digital curves. We show how they can for
instance be used to bound the slope difference between consecutive maximal
segments.
