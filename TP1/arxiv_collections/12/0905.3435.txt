We report observations of the gyrotropic change in magnetic susceptibility of
the Fe$^{3+}$ electron paramagnetic resonance at 12.037GHz (between spin states
$|1/2>$ and $|3/2>$) in sapphire with respect to applied magnetic field.
Measurements were made by observing the response of the high-Q Whispering
Gallery doublet (WGH$_{\pm17,0,0}$) in a Hemex sapphire resonator cooled to 5
K. The doublets initially existed as standing waves at zero field and were
transformed to traveling waves due to the gyrotropic response.
