We propose a phenomenological Hamiltonian for the interaction of neutral
macroscopic bodies with the electromagnetic field. Subsequently we revisit the
assumption according to which the retarded interactions between neutral
macroscopic bodies can be obtained through an additive principle i.e. summing
the volume elements defined by the macroscopic bodies.
