GHz-peaked spectrum (GPS) radio sources are thought to be young objects which
later evolve into FR-I and FR-II radio galaxies. We have used the Australia
Telescope 20GHz (AT20G) survey catalogue to select a uniform sample of GPS
sources with spectral peaks above 5GHz, which should represent the youngest
members of this class. In this paper, we present e-VLBI observations of ten
such objects which are associated with nearby (z<0.15) galaxies and so
represent a new population of local, low--power GPS sources. Our e-VLBI
observations were carried out at 4.8GHz with the Australia Telescope Long
Baseline Array (LBA) using a real--time software correlator. All ten sources
were detected, and were unresolved on scales of ~100mas, implying that they are
typically less than 100pc in linear size.
