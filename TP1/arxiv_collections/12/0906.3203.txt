We study here the Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) environment through the analysis of
the optical absorption features due to the gas surrounding the GRB. In
particular, we analyze high resolution spectroscopic observations of GRB080319B
and GRB080330 taken with UVES at the VLT, starting 8m30s and 1.5hr after the
GRB trigger, respectively. The spectra show that the ISM of the GRB host
galaxies are complex, with several components contributing to the host
absorption system. In addition, we detect strong excited absorption lines, from
which we derive information on the gas distance from the site of the GRB
explosion. Under the assumption that the excited features are produced by
indirect UV pumping, we found that this distance results to be 2-6 kpc for
GRB080319B and 280+/-50 pc for GRB080330, meaning that the power of the GRB
radiation can influence the conditions of the interstellar medium up to a
distance of several hundred pc.
