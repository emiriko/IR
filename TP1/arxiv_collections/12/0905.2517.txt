GENIE is a new neutrino event generator for the experimental neutrino physics
community. The goal of the project is to develop a `canonical' neutrino
interaction physics Monte Carlo whose validity extends to all nuclear targets
and neutrino flavors from MeV to PeV energy scales. Currently, emphasis is on
the few-GeV energy range, the challenging boundary between the non-perturbative
and perturbative regimes, which is relevant for the current and near future
long-baseline precision neutrino experiments using accelerator-made beams. The
design of the package addresses many challenges unique to neutrino simulations
and supports the full life-cycle of simulation and generator-related analysis
tasks.
  GENIE is a large-scale software system, consisting of 120,000 lines of C++
code, featuring a modern object-oriented design and extensively validated
physics content. The first official physics release of GENIE was made available
in August 2007, and at the time of the writing of this article, the latest
available version was v2.4.4.
