The techniques of principal and independent component analysis are applied to
images of ultracold atoms. As an illustrative example, we present the use of
these model-independent methods to rapidly determine the differential phase of
a BEC interferometer from large sets of images of interference patterns. These
techniques have been useful in the calibration of the experiment and in the
investigation of phase randomization. The details of the algorithms are
provided.
