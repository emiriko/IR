We investigate the ground states of 1D continuum models having short-range
ferromagnetic type interactions and a wide class of competing longer-range
antiferromagnetic type interactions. The model is defined in terms of an energy
functional, which can be thought of as the Hamiltonian of a coarse-grained
microscopic system or as a mesoscopic free energy functional describing various
materials. We prove that the ground state is simple periodic whatever the
prescribed total magnetization might be. Previous studies of this model of
frustrated systems assumed this simple periodicity but, as in many examples in
condensed matter physics, it is neither obvious nor always true that ground
states do not have a more complicated, or even chaotic structure.
