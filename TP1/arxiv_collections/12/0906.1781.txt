Fascinating developments in optical pulse engineering over the last 20 years
lead to the generation of laser pulses as short as few femtosecond, providing a
unique tool for high resolution time domain spectroscopy. However, a number of
the processes in nature evolve with characteristic times of the order of 1 fs
or even shorter. Time domain studies of such processes require at first place
sub-fs resolution, offered by pulse depicting attosecond localization. The
generation, characterization and proof of principle applications of such pulses
is the target of the attoscience.
  In the paper the thermal processes on the attosecond scale are described. The
Klein-Gordon and Proca equations are developed. The relativistic effects in the
heat transport on nanoscale are discussed. It is shown that the standard
Fourier equation can not be valid for the transport phenomena induced by
attosecond laser pulses. The heat transport in nanoparticles and nanotubules is
investigated.
