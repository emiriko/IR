We define a new parameter to quantify the antigenic distance between two H3N2
influenza strains: we use this parameter to measure antigenic distance between
circulating H3N2 strains and the closest vaccine component of the influenza
vaccine. For the data between 1971 and 2004, the measure of antigenic distance
correlates better with efficacy in humans of the H3N2 influenza A annual
vaccine than do current state of the art measures of antigenic distance such as
phylogenetic sequence analysis or ferret antisera inhibition assays. We suggest
that this measure of antigenic distance could be used to guide the design of
the annual flu vaccine. We combine the measure of antigenic distance with a
multiple-strain avian influenza transmission model to study the threat of
simultaneous introduction of multiple avian influenza strains. For H3N2
influenza, the model is validated against observed viral fixation rates and
epidemic progression rates from the World Health Organization FluNet - Global
Influenza Surveillance Network. We find that a multiple-component avian
influenza vaccine is helpful to control a simultaneous multiple introduction of
bird-flu strains. We introduce Population at Risk (PaR) to quantify the risk of
a flu pandemic, and calculate by this metric the improvement that a multiple
vaccine offers.
