The possible mechanisms of generation of the neutrino of small masses and
sterile neutrino are considered. In the supposition of stability of tracks of a
left-right symmetry concerning masses of constituent quarks, the angles of
mixing of quarks are evaluated. With usage of experimental data on neutrino
oscillation parameters the neutrino masses on order of magnitude are computed.
