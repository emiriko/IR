Quantum interference of helicity amplitudes provides a powerful tool for
measuring the spins of new particles. By looking at the azimuthal angular
dependence of the differential cross-section in the production followed by
decay of a new particle species one can determine its spin by looking at the
various cosine modes. The heavy spin-2 Kaluza-Klein (KK) graviton provides a
unique signature with a $\cos{(4 \phi)}$ mode. We study the feasibility of this
approach to measuring the spin of the KK graviton in the Randall-Sundrum Model
at the LHC.
