Peres/Mermin arguments about no-hidden variables in quantum mechanics are
used for displaying a pair (R, S) of entangling Clifford quantum gates, acting
on two qubits. From them, a natural unitary representation of Coxeter/Weyl
groups W(D5) and W(F4) emerges, which is also reflected into the splitting of
the n-qubit Clifford group Cn into dipoles C$\pm$n . The union of the
three-qubit real Clifford group C+ 3 and the Toffoli gate ensures a orthogonal
representation of the Weyl/Coxeter group W(E8), and of its relatives. Other
concepts involved are complex reflection groups, BN pairs, unitary group
designs and entangled states of the GHZ family.
