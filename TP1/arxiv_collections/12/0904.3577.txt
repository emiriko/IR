We can solve the Wheeler-DeWitt equation of the small universe enough to
metric becomes diagonal and take a Gaussian normal coordinate. Our previous
works are concerning to this paper. In this paper, we only write how to solve
the Wheeler-DeWitt equation of such universe. Our motivation is simple, that is
to solve the Wheeler-DeWitt equation. Even if the Wheeler-DeWitt equation is
solved, quantum gravity does not complete yet. However, this work may be one of
the first step to quantum gravity.
