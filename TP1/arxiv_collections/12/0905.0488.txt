Let X be a smooth algebraic variety over a field K containing the real
numbers. We introduce the notion of twisted associative (resp. Poisson)
deformation of the structure sheaf of X. These are stack-like versions of usual
deformations. We prove that there is a twisted quantization operation from
twisted Poisson deformations to twisted associative deformations, which is
canonical and bijective on gauge equivalence classes. This result extends work
of Kontsevich, and our own earlier work, on deformation quantization of
algebraic varieties.
