It has been found that there is a strong correlation between the circular
velocity V_c and the central stellar velocity dispersion \sigma_0 of galaxies.
In this respect, low surface brightness galaxies (LSB) follow a different
relation when compared to Elliptical and high surface brightness (HSB)
galaxies. The intrinsic scatter of the V_c-\sigma_0 is partially due to the
different concentration of the light distribution. In this work we measure the
C_28 concentration parameter for a sample of 17 LSB finding that the C_28
parameter does not account for the different behavior in the $V_c - {\sigma}_0$
for this class of objects.
