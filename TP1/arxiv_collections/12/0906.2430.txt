In this paper we explicitly evaluate the one-loop effective action in four
dimensions for scalar and spinor fields under the influence of a strong,
covariantly constant, magnetic field in curved spacetime. In the framework of
zeta function regularization, we find the one-loop effective action to all
orders in the magnetic field up to linear terms in the Riemannian curvature. As
a particular case, we also obtain the one-loop effective action for massless
scalar and spinor fields. In this setting, we found that the vacuum energy of
charged spinors with small mass becomes very large due entirely by the
gravitational correction.
