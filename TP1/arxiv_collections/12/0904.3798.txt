Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) fitting is a well-developed astrophysical
tool that has recently been applied to high-redshift Lyman Alpha-emitting
galaxies. If rest-frame ultraviolet through near-infrared photometry is
available, it allows the simultaneous determination of the star formation
history and dust extinction of a galaxy. Lyman Alpha-emitter SED fitting
results from the literature find star formation rates ~3 M_sun/yr, stellar
masses ~10^9 M_sun for the general population but ~10^10 M_sun for the subset
detected by IRAC, and very low dust extinction, A_V < 0.3, although a couple of
outlying analyses prefer significantly more dust and higher intrinsic star
formation rates. A checklist of 14 critical choices that must be made when
performing SED fitting is discussed.
