(Abridged) We have discovered an intermediate polar (IP) in the 100 ks
Chandra observation of Baade's Window (BW), a low extinction region at ~ 4 deg
south of the Galactic Center. The source exhibits large X-ray modulations at a
period of 1028.4 s in the 0.3 - 8 keV band. The X-ray spectral fit with a power
law model shows the integrated spectrum is intrinsically hard (photon index ~
0.44) and moderately absorbed (NH22 ~ 0.15). Quantile analysis reveals that the
modulations in the X-ray flux strongly correlate with spectral changes that are
dominated by varying internal absorption. The X-ray spectrum of the source is
heavily absorbed (NH22 > 1) during the faint phases, while the absorption is
consistent with the field value during the bright phases. These X-ray
properties are typical signatures of IPs. Images taken with the IMACS camera on
the Magellan 6.5m telescope show a faint (V ~ 22), relatively blue object
within the 2 sigma error circle of the Chandra source. If we assume a nominal
range of absolute V magnitude for a cataclysmic variable (MV ~ 5.5-10.5) and
the known reddening in the region, the source would likely be at a distance of
2-10 kpc. The corresponding average Lx would be $6 \times 10^{31} - 10^{33}$
erg s$^{-1}$ in the 2-8 keV band. Assuming the space density of IPs follows the
stellar distribution, which is highly concentrated in the Galactic Bulge, the
source is probably a relatively bright IP belonging to the Galactic Bulge X-ray
population, the majority of which is now believed to be magnetic cataclysmic
variables.
