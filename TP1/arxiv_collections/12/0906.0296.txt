We present a set of gas-phase Planck mean and Rosseland mean opacity tables
applicable for simulations of star and planet formation, stellar evolution,
disk modelling at various metallicities in hydrogen-rich environments. The
tables are calculated for gas temperatures between 1000K and 10000K and total
hydrogen number densities between 10^2 cm^-3 and 10^17 cm^-3. The
carbon-to-oxygen ratio is varied from 0.43 to well above 2.0, the
nitrogen-to-oxygen ration between 0.14 and 100.0. The tables are calculated for
a range of metallicities down to [M/H]'= log N_M/N_H=-7.0. We demonstrate how
the mean opacities and the abundances of the opacity species vary with C/O,
N/O, and [M/H]'. We use the element abundances from Grevesse, Asplund & Sauval
(2007), and we provide additional tables for the oxygen-abundance value from
Caffau et al.(2008). All tables will be available online under
