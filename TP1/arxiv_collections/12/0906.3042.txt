We propose a scheme to implement an optical Kagome lattice for ultra-cold
atoms with controllable s-wave interactions between nearest neighbor sites and
a gauge potential. The atoms occupy three different internal atomic levels with
electromagnetically-induced coupling between the levels. We show that by
appropriately shifting the triangular lattice potentials, experienced by atoms
in different levels, the Kagome lattice can be realized using only two standing
waves, generating a highly frustrated quantum system for the atoms.
