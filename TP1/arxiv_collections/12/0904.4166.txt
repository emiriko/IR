We present experiments on slow shear flow in a split-bottom linear shear
cell, filled with layered granular materials. Shearing through two different
materials separated by a flat material boundary is shown to give narrow shear
zones, which refract at the material boundary in accordance with Snell's law in
optics. The shear zone is the one that minimizes the dissipation rate upon
shearing, i.e.a manifestation of the principle of least dissipation. We have
prepared the materials as to form a granular lens. Shearing through the lens is
shown to give a very broad shear zone, which corresponds to fulfilling Snell's
law for a continuous range of paths through the cell.
