We derive an effective thermodynamic potential (Omega_eff) at finite
temperature (T>0) and zero quark-chemical potential (mu_R=0), using the
singular-gauge instanton solution and Matsubara formula for N_c=3 and N_f=2 in
the chiral limit. The momentum-dependent constituent-quark mass is also
obtained as a function of T, employing the Harrington-Shepard caloron solution
in the large-N_c limit. In addition, we take into account the imaginary quark
chemical potential mu_I = A_4, translated as the traced Polayakov-loop (Phi) as
an order parameter for the Z(N_c) symmsetry, characterizing the confinement
(intact) and deconfinement (spontaneously broken) phases. As a result, we
observe the crossover of the chiral (chi) order parameter sigma^2 and Phi. It
also turns out that the critical temperature for the deconfinment phase
transition, T^Z_c is lowered by about (5-10)% in comparison to the case with a
constant constituent-quark mass. This behavior can be understood by
considerable effects from the partial chiral restoration and nontrivial QCD
vacuum on Phi. Numerical calculations show that the crossover transitions occur
at (T^chi_c,T^Z_c) ~ (216,227) MeV.
