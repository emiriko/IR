Chicone et al [CMP (1995)] have shown that, kinematic fast dynamos in
diffusive media, could exist only on a closed, 2D Riemannian manifold of
constant negative curvature. This report, shows that their result cannot be
extended to oscillatory ${\alpha}^{2}$-dynamos, when there are resonance modes,
between toroidal and poloidal frequencies of twisted magnetic flux tubes. Thus,
dynamo action can be supported in regions, where Riemannian curvature is
positive. For turbulent dynamos, this seems physically reasonable, since
recently, [Shukurov et al PRE (2008)] have obtained a Moebius flow strip in
sodium liquid, torus Perm dynamo where curvature is also connected to the
magnetic fields via diffusion. This could be done, by adjusting the
corresponding frequencies till they achieved resonance. Actually 2D torus, is a
manifold of zero mean curvature, where regions of positive and negative
curvatures exist. It is shown that, Riemannian solitonic surface, endowed with
a steady ${\alpha}^{2}$-dynamo from magnetic filamentary structures [Wilkin et
al,PRL (2007)].
