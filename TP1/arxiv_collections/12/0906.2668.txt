We generalize a "one eigenstate" theorem of Levy, Perdew and Sahni (LPS) to
the case of densities coming from eigenmixture density operators. The
generalization is of a special interest for the radial density functional
theory (RDFT) for nuclei, a consequence of the rotational invariance of the
nuclear Hamiltonian; when nuclear ground states (GSs) have a finite spin, the
RDFT uses eigenmixture density operators to simplify predictions of GS energies
into one-dimensional, radial calculations. We also study Schr\"odinger
equations governing spin eigendensity matrices.
