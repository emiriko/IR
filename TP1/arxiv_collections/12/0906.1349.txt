Based on 58 SLACS strong-lens early-type galaxies with direct total-mass and
stellar-velocity dispersion measurements, we find that inside one effective
radius massive elliptical galaxies with M_eff >= 3x10^10 M_sun are
well-approximated by a power-law ellipsoid with an average logaritmic density
slope of <gamma'_LD> = -dlog(rho_tot)/dlog(r)=2.085^{+0.025}_{-0.018} (random
error on mean) for isotropic orbits with beta_r=0, +-0.1 (syst.) and
sigma_gamma' <= 0.20^{+0.04}_{-0.02} intrinsic scatter (all errors indicate the
68 percent CL). We find no correlation of gamma'_LD with galaxy mass (M_eff),
rescaled radius (i.e. R_einst/R_eff) or redshift, despite intrinsic differences
in density-slope between galaxies. Based on scaling relations, the average
logarithmic density slope can be derived in an alternative manner, fully
independent from dynamics, yielding <gamma'_SR>=1.959 +- 0.077. Agreement
between the two values is reached for <beta_r> =0.45 +- 0.25, consistent with
mild radial anisotropy. This agreement supports the robustness of our results,
despite the increase in mass-to-light ratio with total galaxy mass: M_eff ~
L_{V,eff}^(1.363+-0.056). We conclude that massive early-type galaxies are
structurally close-to homologous with close-to isothermal total density
profiles (<=10 percent intrinsic scatter) and have at most some mild radial
anisotropy. Our results provide new observational limits on galaxy formation
and evolution scenarios, covering four Gyr look-back time.
