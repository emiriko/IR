We carry out a theoretical study on the isotropic-nematic phase transition
and phase separation in amyloid fibril solutions. Borrowing the thermodynamic
model employed in the study of cylindrical micelles, we investigate the
variations in the fibril length distribution and phase behavior with respect to
changes in the protein concentration, fibril's rigidity, and binding energy. We
then relate our theoretical findings to the nematic ordering observed in Hen
Lysozyme fibril solution.
