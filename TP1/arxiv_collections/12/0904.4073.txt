In contemporary cryptographic systems, secret keys are usually exchanged by
means of methods, which suffer from mathematical and technology inherent
drawbacks. That could lead to unnoticed complete compromise of cryptographic
systems, without a chance of control by its legitimate owners. Therefore a need
for innovative solutions exists when truly and reliably secure transmission of
secrets is required for dealing with critical data and applications. Quantum
Cryptography (QC), in particular Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) can answer that
need.
  The business white paper (BWP) summarizes how secret key establishment and
distribution problems can be solved by quantum cryptography. It deals with
several considerations related to how the quantum cryptography innovation could
contribute to provide business effectiveness. It addresses advantages and also
limitations of quantum cryptography, proposes a scenario case study, and
invokes standardization related issues. In addition, it answers most frequently
asked questions about quantum cryptography.
