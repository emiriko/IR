The previous twelve turnout rates of French national elections by
municipality show regularities. These regularities do not depend on the
national turnout level, nor on the nature of the election. Based on past
statistical regularities we make three predictions. The first one deals with
the standard deviation of the turnout rate by municipality. The second one
refers to the continuity in time of the heterogeneity of turnout rates in the
vicinity of a municipality. The last one is about the correlation between the
heterogeneity of turnout rates in the vicinity of a municipality and the
population in its surroundings. Details, explanations and discussions will be
given in forthcoming papers.
