Total mass-to-light ratio M/L_B for S0 - Irr galaxies, where M is the
dynamical mass within the optical radius R_25, increases systematically with
(B-V)_0 color, but slower than that is predicted by stellar population
evolution models. It shows that the mean ratio between dark halo and stellar
masses is higher for more "blue" galaxies. However some galaxies don't follow
this general trend. The properties of galaxies with extremely high and
extremely low values of M/L_B ratios are compared, and different factors,
accounting for the extremes, are analyzed. The conclusion is that in some cases
too high or too low M/L_B ratios are associated with observational errors, in
other cases - with non-typical dark halo mass fraction, or with peculiarities
of disc stellar population. Particularly, discs of some galaxies with low M/L_B
ratios turn out to be unusually "light" for their luminosity and colors, which
indicates a substantial deficit of low mass stars as the most probable cause of
low M/L_B.
