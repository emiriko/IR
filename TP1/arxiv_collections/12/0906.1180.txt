We propose a continuous time quantum search algorithm using a generalization
of the Jaynes-Cummings model. In this model the states of the atom are the
elements among which the algorithm realizes the search, exciting resonances
between the initial and the searched states. This algorithm behaves like
Grover's algorithm; the optimal search time is proportional to the square root
of the size of the search set and the probability to find the searched state
oscillates periodically in time. In this frame, it is possible to reinterpret
the usual Jaynes-Cummings model as a trivial case of the quantum search
algorithm.
