Using the Feynman-Kac and Cameron-Martin-Girsanov formulas, we obtain a
generalized integral fluctuation theorem (GIFT) for discrete jump processes by
constructing a time-invariable inner product. The existing discrete IFTs can be
derived as its specific cases. A connection between our approach and the
conventional time-reversal method is also established. Different from the
latter approach that was extensively employed in existing literature, our
approach can naturally bring out the definition of a time-reversal of a
Markovian stochastic system. Additionally, we find the robust GIFT usually does
not result into a detailed fluctuation theorem.
