The mass formation of basic vector mesons up to energy 3.8 GeV was studied.
The investigation was done with using of jet mechanism, the harmonic quarks and
neutral colorless groups. The stage of a whole string with a zero interquark
momentum was considered as a separate stage of hadronization. The quark group
with rest mass equal to experimental mass of hadron was named as flower. The
quark flowers were found for $\rho$, $\omega$, $\varphi$, $\psi/J$, $\psi$(2S)
and $\psi$(3770). The flower mass of $\psi$(2S) was defined as 3686.09 MeV. The
structure of quark flowers is symmetrical and consists from an aura and central
part. The formation of quark shells, the condensation of quarks on the quark
leaders, the floral schemes of kaon formation and complicated hadronization are
discussed.
