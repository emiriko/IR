In the recent paper by one of the authors (MBS) and A. A. Malykh on the
classification of second-order PDEs with four independent variables that
possess partner symmetries (J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. Vol. 42 (2009) 395202
(20pp)), mixed heavenly equation and Husain equation appear as closely related
canonical equations admitting partner symmetries. Here for the mixed heavenly
equation and Husain equation, formulated in a two-component form, we present
recursion operators, Lax pairs of Olver-Ibragimov-Shabat type and discover
their Lagrangians, symplectic and bi-Hamiltonian structure. We obtain all point
and second-order symmetries, integrals and bi-Hamiltonian representations of
these systems and their symmetry flows together with infinite hierarchies of
nonlocal higher symmetries.
