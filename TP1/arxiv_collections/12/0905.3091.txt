This paper proposes and analyzes fully data driven methods for inference
about the mean function of a stochastic process from a sample of independent
trajectories of the process, observed at discrete time points and corrupted by
additive random error. The proposed method uses thresholded least squares
estimators relative to an approximating function basis. The variable threshold
levels are estimated from the data and the basis is chosen via cross-validation
from a library of bases. The resulting estimates adapt to the unknown sparsity
of the mean function relative to the selected approximating basis, both in
terms of the mean squared error and supremum norm. These results are based on
novel oracle inequalities. In addition, uniform confidence bands for the mean
function of the process are constructed. The bands also adapt to the unknown
regularity of the mean function, are easy to compute, and do not require
explicit estimation of the covariance operator of the process. The simulation
study that complements the theoretical results shows that the new method
performs very well in practice, and is robust against large variations
introduced by the random error terms.
