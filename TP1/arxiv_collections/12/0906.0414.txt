One of the key aspects governing the mechanical performance of composite
materials is debonding: the local separation of reinforcing constituents from
matrix when the interfacial strength is exceeded. In this contribution, two
strategies to estimate the overall response of particulate composites with
rigid-brittle interfaces are investigated. The first approach is based on a
detailed numerical representation of a composite microstructure. The resulting
problem is discretized using the Finite Element Tearing and Interconnecting
method, which, apart from computational efficiency, allows for an accurate
representation of interfacial tractions as well as mutual inter-phase contact
conditions. The candidate solver employs the assumption of uniform fields
within the composite estimated using the Mori-Tanaka method. A set of
representative numerical examples is presented to assess the added value of the
detailed numerical model over the simplified micromechanics approach.
