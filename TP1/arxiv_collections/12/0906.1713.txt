General-purpose, intelligent, learning agents cycle through sequences of
observations, actions, and rewards that are complex, uncertain, unknown, and
non-Markovian. On the other hand, reinforcement learning is well-developed for
small finite state Markov decision processes (MDPs). Up to now, extracting the
right state representations out of bare observations, that is, reducing the
general agent setup to the MDP framework, is an art that involves significant
effort by designers. The primary goal of this work is to automate the reduction
process and thereby significantly expand the scope of many existing
reinforcement learning algorithms and the agents that employ them. Before we
can think of mechanizing this search for suitable MDPs, we need a formal
objective criterion. The main contribution of this article is to develop such a
criterion. I also integrate the various parts into one learning algorithm.
Extensions to more realistic dynamic Bayesian networks are developed in Part
II. The role of POMDPs is also considered there.
