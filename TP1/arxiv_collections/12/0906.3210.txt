The state-resolved differential cross sections for both the 1s2 1S0 - 1s2s
1S0 monopolar transition and the 1s2 1S0 - 1s2p 1P1 dipolar transition of
atomic helium have been measured over a large momentum transfer region by the
high-resolution inelastic X-ray scattering (IXS) for the first time. The almost
perfect match of the present measurement with the theoretical calculations
gives a stringent test of the theoretical method and the calculated
wavefunctions. Our results demonstrate that high-resolution IXS is a powerful
tool for studying the excitations in atoms and molecules.
