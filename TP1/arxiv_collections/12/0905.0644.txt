Entanglement of isolated elementary particles other than photons has not yet
been achieved. We show how building blocks demonstrated with one trapped
electron might be used to make a model system and method for entangling two
electrons. Applications are then considered, including two-qubit gates and more
precise quantum metrology protocols.
