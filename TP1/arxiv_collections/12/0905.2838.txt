Half-integer photon-resonances in a periodically shaken double well are
investigated on the level of the N-particle quantum dynamics. Contrary to
non-linear mean-field equations, the linear N-particle Schrodinger equation
does not contain any non-linearity which could be the origin of such
resonances. Nevertheless, analytic calculations on the N-particle level explain
why such resonances can be observed even for particle numbers as low as N = 2.
These calculations also demonstrate why fractional photon resonances are not
restricted to half-integer values.
