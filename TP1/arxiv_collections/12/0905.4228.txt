We present recent investigations on the vector and axial-vector transitions
of the baryon antidecuplet within the framework of the self-consistent SU(3)
chiral quark-soliton model, taking into account the 1/N_c rotational and linear
m_s corrections. The main contribution to the electric-like transition form
factor comes from the wave-function corrections. This is a consequence of the
generalized Ademollo-Gatto theorem. It is also found that in general the
leading-order contributions are almost canceled by the rotational 1/N_c
corrections. The results are summarized as follows: the vector and tensor
K^*-N-Theta coupling constants, g_{K^*-N-Theta}=0.74 - 0.87 and
f_{K^*-N-Theta}=0.53 - 1.16, respectively, and Gamma_{Theta->KN}=0.71 MeV,
based on the result of the K-N-Theta coupling constant g_{K-n-Theta}=0.83. We
also show the differential cross sections and beam asymmetries, based on the
present results. We also discuss the connection of present results with the
original work by Diakonov, Petrov, and Polyakov.
