In the present work a procedure is build up, that allows obtaining dark
matter and cosmic acceleration in our 4 dimensional universe embedded in a 5
dim. manifold. Both, DM and the factor causing cosmic acceleration, as well
ordinary matter are induced in the in the 4D space-time by a warped but empty
from matter 5D bulk. The procedure is carried out in the framework of the
Weyl-Dirac version of Wesson's IMT enriched by Rosen's approach. Making in the
given procedure use of present observational data one can develope a model of
the vuniverse with conventional matter, DM and cosmic acceleration induced by
the 5D bulk.
