To describe the interaction of molecular vibrations with electrons at a
quantum dot contacted to metallic leads, we extend an analytical approach that
we previously developed for the many-polaron problem. Our scheme is based on an
incomplete variational Lang-Firsov transformation, combined with a perturbative
calculation of the electron-phonon self-energy in the framework of generalised
Matsubara functions. This allows us to describe the system at weak to strong
coupling and intermediate to large phonon frequencies. We present results for
the quantum dot spectral function and for the kinetic coefficient that
characterises the electron transport through the dot. With these results we
critically examine the strengths and limitations of our approach, and discuss
the properties of the molecular quantum dot in the context of polaron physics.
We place particular emphasis on the importance of corrections to the concept of
an antiadiabatic dot polaron suggested by the complete Lang-Firsov
transformation.
