Polycrystalline samples of RO1-xFxFeAs (0 < x < 0.25) (R = La, Sm, Gd) were
investigated by wavelength-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (WDX) in the electron
microscope to determine the composition of the samples, in particular the
fluorine content. It was found that the measured fluorine content can deviate
considerably from the initial weight. In the lanthanum compound LaO1-xFxFeAs,
we found good agreement mainly for x > 0.05, but for x < 0.05 the fluorine
hardly goes into the sample. For the samarium compound we measured less than
half the fluorine in the sample as initially weighed at all fluorine
concentrations. These measured values are taken into account when drawing the
electronic phase diagrams of LaO1-xFxFeAs and SmO1-xFxFeAs. This leads to a
more consistent picture of both of the diagrams in comparison to the plot of
the initial weight.
