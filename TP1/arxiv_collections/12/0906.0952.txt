In this paper, we calculate the explicit expression for the fugacity for two-
and three-dimensional weakly interacting Bose and Fermi gases from their
equations of state in isochoric and isobaric processes, respectively, based on
the mathematical result of the boundary problem of analytic functions --- the
homogeneous Riemann-Hilbert problem. We also discuss the Bose-Einstein
condensation phase transition of three-dimensional hard-sphere Bose gases.
