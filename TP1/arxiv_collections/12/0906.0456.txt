We propose the conformon as a quantum of conformational change for energy
transfer in alpha-helical proteins. The underlying mechanism of interaction
between the quantum of excitation and the conformational degrees of freedom is
nonlinear and leads to solitary wave packets of conformational energy. The
phenomenon is specific to alpha-helices and not to beta-sheets in proteins due
to the three strands of hydrogen bonds constituting the alpha-helical backbone.
