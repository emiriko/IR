Cosmic shear measurements rely on our ability to measure and correct the
Point Spread Function (PSF) of the observations. This PSF is measured using
stars in the field, which give a noisy measure at random points in the field.
Using Wiener filtering, we show how errors in this PSF correction process
propagate into shear power spectrum errors. This allows us to test future
space-based missions, such as Euclid or JDEM, thereby allowing us to set clear
engineering specifications on PSF variability. For ground-based surveys, where
the variability of the PSF is dominated by the environment, we briefly discuss
how our approach can also be used to study the potential of mitigation
techniques such as correlating galaxy shapes in different exposures. To
illustrate our approach we show that for a Euclid-like survey to be statistics
limited, an initial pre-correction PSF ellipticity power spectrum, with a
power-law slope of -3 must have an amplitude at l =1000 of less than 2 x
10^{-13}. This is 1500 times smaller than the typical lensing signal at this
scale. We also find that the power spectrum of PSF size \dR^2) at this scale
must be below 2 x 10^{-12}. Public code available as part of iCosmo at
