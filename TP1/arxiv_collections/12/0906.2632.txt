Non-relativisitic second-order corrections to the wave function at origin in
muonic and exotic atoms are considered. The corrections are due to the
electronic vacuum polarization. Such corrections are of interest due to various
effective approaches, which take into account QED and hadronic effects. The
wave function at origin plays a key role in the calculation of the pionium
lifetime, various finite nuclear size effects and the hyperfine splitting. The
results are obtained for the $1s$ and $2s$ states in pionic and muonic hydrogen
and deuterium and in pionium, a bound system of $\pi^+$ and $\pi^-$.
Applications to the hyperfine structure and the Lamb shift in muonic hydrogen
are also considered.
