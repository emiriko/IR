We analyze momentarily static initial data sets of the gravitational field
produced by two-point sources in five-dimensional Kaluza-Klein spacetimes.
These initial data sets are characterized by the mass, the separation of
sources and the size of a extra dimension. Using these initial data sets, we
discuss the condition for black hole formation, and propose a new conjecture
which is a hybrid of the four-dimensional hoop conjecture and the
five-dimensional hyperhoop conjecture. By using the new conjecture, we estimate
the cross section of black hole formation due to collisions of particles in
Kaluza-Klein spacetimes. We show that the mass dependence of the cross section
gives us information about the size and the number of the compactified extra
dimensions.
