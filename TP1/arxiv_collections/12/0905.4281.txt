Preliminary results on diffractive W and Z production in proton-antiproton
collisions at a c.m.s. energy of 1.96 TeV are presented and discussed.
Differential cross sections are measured from data collected with the CDF-II
detector at the Fermilab Tevatron collider using a Roman pot spectrometer that
detects leading antiprotons. The ratio of diffractive to total W production
rates (diffractive fraction) agrees with that measured by CDF in Run-I using a
rapidity gap diffractive signature. The W and Z diffractive fractions are equal
within the measurement uncertainties, which are dominated by a 20% statistical
uncertainty in the diffractive Z measurement. Prospects for extending the
diffractive W a nd Z studies at the Large Hadron Collider are discussed.
