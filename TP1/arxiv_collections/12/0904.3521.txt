A model for nonequilibrium dynamical mean-field theory is constructed for the
infinite dimensional Hubbard lattice. We impose nonequilibrium by expressing
the physical orbital as a superposition of a left-($L$) moving and right-($R$)
moving electronic state with the respective chemical potential $\mu_L$ and
$\mu_R$. Using the second-order iterative perturbation theory we calculate the
quasi-particle properties as a function of the chemical potential bias between
the $L$ and $R$ movers, i.e. $\Phi = \mu_L - \mu_R$. The evolution of the
nonequilibrium quasi-particle spectrum is mapped out as a function of the bias
and temperature. The quasi-particle states with the renormalized Fermi energy
scale $\varepsilon^0_{QP}$ disappear at $\Phi\sim\varepsilon^0_{QP}$ in the low
temperature limit. The second-order perturbation theory predicts that in the
vicinity of the Mott-insulator transition at the Coulomb parameter $U=U_c$,
there exists another critical Coulomb parameter $U_d$ ($<U_c$) such that, for
$U_d<U<Uc$, quasi-particle states are destroyed abruptly when
$(\varepsilon^0_{QP})^2\sim a(\pi k_BT_c)^2+ b\Phi_c^2$ with the critical
temperature $T_c$, the critical bias $\Phi_c$ and the numerical constants $a$
and $b$ at the order of unity.
