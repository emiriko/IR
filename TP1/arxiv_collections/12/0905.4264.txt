Let G be a classical p-adic group and $(\psi ,\epsilon)$ the Langlands
parameter of an irreducible supercuspidal representation of a Levi subgroup of
G. Using data from $(\psi ,\epsilon)$, we determine explicitly the intertwining
algebra of the representation which is induced from the orbit of the
supercuspidal representation associated to $(\psi ,\epsilon)$.
