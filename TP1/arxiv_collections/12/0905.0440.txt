Traditional cryptography assumes an eavesdropper receives an error-free copy
of the transmitted ciphertext. Wyner's wiretap channel model recognizes that at
the physical layer both the intended receiver and the passive eavesdropper
inevitably receive an error-prone version of the transmitted message which must
be corrected prior to decryption. This paper considers the implications of
using both channel and cryptographic codes under the wiretap channel model in a
way that enhances the \emph{information-theoretic} security for the friendly
parties by keeping the information transfer to the eavesdropper small. We
consider a secret-key cryptographic system with a linear feedback shift
register (LFSR)-based keystream generator and observe the mutual information
between an LFSR-generated sequence and the received noise-corrupted ciphertext
sequence under a known-plaintext scenario. The effectiveness of a noniterative
fast correlation attack, which reduces the search time in a brute-force attack,
is shown to be correlated with this mutual information. For an iterative fast
correlation attack on this cryptographic system, it is shown that an EXIT chart
and mutual information are very good predictors of decoding success and failure
by a passive eavesdropper.
