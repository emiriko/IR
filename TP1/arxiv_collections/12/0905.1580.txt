Leptons will play a key role in the first measurements performed by the LHC
experiments. The ATLAS and CMS detectors are now built, and early estimates of
their performances have been revisited. The expected first physics signals are
described: they will shed light on the level of detector understanding and
allow a control of the systematics uncertainties, opening the road to new and
precision physics.
