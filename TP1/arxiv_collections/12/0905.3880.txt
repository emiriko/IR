The two main results of this note are on the one hand that if V is a
2-dimensional potentially trianguline representation of G_Qp then V satisfies
at least one of the following properties (1) V is split trianguline (2) V is a
direct sum of characters or an induced representation (3) V is a twist of a de
Rham representation, and on the other hand that there exists some 2-dimensional
representations of G_Qp which are not potentially trianguline.
