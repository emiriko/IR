We derived the low energy effective action for the collective modes in
asymmetric fermionic systems with attractive interaction. We obtained the phase
diagram in terms of the chemical potentials. It features a stable gapless
superfluidity with one Fermi surface on the BEC side of the resonance. Also we
predict a sharp increase in outer core of a vortex, i.e. vortex size, upon
entering into the gapless phase. This may serve as a signature of a gapless
phase.
