Motivated by recent work on Hom-Lie algebras, a twisted version of the
Yang-Baxter equation, called the Hom-Yang-Baxter equation (HYBE), was
introduced by the author in an earlier paper. In this paper, several more
classes of solutions of the HYBE are constructed. Some of these solutions of
the HYBE are closely related to the quantum enveloping algebra of sl(2), the
Jones-Conway polynomial, and Yetter-Drinfel'd modules. We also construct a new
infinite sequence of solutions of the HYBE from a given one. Along the way, we
compute all the Lie algebra endomorphisms on the (1+1)-Poincare algebra and
sl(2).
