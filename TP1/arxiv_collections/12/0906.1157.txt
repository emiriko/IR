The upgrade of the DA$\Phi$NE machine layout requires a modification of the
size and position of the inner focusing quadrupoles of KLOE$^2$ thus asking for
the realization of two new calorimeters covering the quadrupoles area. To
improve the reconstruction of $K_L\to 2\pi^0$ events with photons hitting the
quadrupoles, a tile calorimeter, QCALT, with high efficiency to low energy
photons (20-300 MeV), time resolution of less than 1 ns and space resolution of
few cm, is needed. We propose a tile calorimeter with a high granularity
readout corresponding to about 2500 silicon photomultipliers (SiPM) of $1\times
1$ mm$^2$ area. Moreover, the low polar angle regions need the realization of a
dense crystal calorimeter with very high time resolution performances to extend
the acceptance for multiphotons events. Best candidates for this calorimeter
are LYSO crystals with APD readout or PbWO$_4$ crystals with large area SIPM
readout.
