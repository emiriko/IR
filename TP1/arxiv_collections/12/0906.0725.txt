After nine years of operation the BABAR experiment at the B factory PEPII
(Standford Linear Accelerator Center) stopped data taking in April 2008. The
last three month of data taking were devoted to e+e- collisions at center of
mass energies of the Upsilon(2S), Upsilon(3S) and to an energy scan above the
Upsilon(4S). Besides the observation of the bottomonium ground state eta_b, the
center of mass energy dependent e+e- -> b bbar cross section was measured in
the energy range from 10.54 to 11.20 GeV. BELLE observed an enhancement in the
production cross section for e+e- -> Upsilon(nS) pi+ pi- -> mu+ mu- pi+ pi- in
an energy scan from 10.83 to 11.02 GeV.
