We carry out first-principles calculations of the dependence of the intrinsic
anomalous Hall conductivity of hcp Co on the magnetization direction. The Hall
conductivity decreases smoothly from 481 S/cm to 116 S/cm as the magnetization
is tilted from the c-axis to the ab-plane. This factor-of-four reduction
compares well with measurements on single crystals, while the angular average
of 226 S/cm is in excellent agreement with the value of 205 S/cm measured in
polycrystalline films. The strong anisotropy of the anomalous Hall conductivity
is a consequence of spin-orbit induced changes in the electron states near the
Fermi level as the magnetization is rotated.
