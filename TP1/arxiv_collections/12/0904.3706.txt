MINOS is an accelerator neutrino oscillation experiment at Fermilab. An
intense high energy neutrino beam is produced at Fermilab and sent to a near
detector on the Fermilab site and also to a 5 kTon far detector 735 km away in
the Soudan mine in northern Minnesota. The experiment has now had several years
of running with millions of events in the near detector and hundreds of events
recorded in the far detector. I will report on the recent results from this
experiment which include precise measurement of $|\Delta m^2_{32}|$, ~analysis
of neutral current data to limit the component of sterile neutrinos, and the
search for $\nu_\mu \to \nu_e$ conversion. The focus will be on the analysis of
data for $\nu_\mu \to \nu_e$ conversion. Using data from an exposure of
$3.14\times 10^{20}$ protons on target, we have selected electron type events
in both the near and the far detector. The near detector is used to measure the
background which is extrapolated to the far detector. We have found 35 events
in the signal region with a background expectation of $27\pm 5(stat)\pm
2(syst)$. Using this observation we set a 90% C.L. limit of $\sin^2 2
\theta_{13} < 0.29$ for $\delta_{cp} = 0$ and normal mass hierarchy. Further
analysis is under way to reduce backgrounds and improve sensitivity.
