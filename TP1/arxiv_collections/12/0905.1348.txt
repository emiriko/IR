We study various aspects of the renormalization of the Resonance Chiral
Theory at the one-loop level using a spin-one resonance propagator as a
concrete example. We calculate explicitly the one-loop self-energy within the
antisymmetric tensor field formalism, briefly discuss the general structure of
the corresponding propagator obtained by means of the Dyson re-summation and
give a classification of the propagating degrees of freedom. We find that
additional pathological poles (negative norm ghosts or tachyons) are
unavoidably generated and various scenarios according to their position are
possible. We also briefly comment on the eventual dynamical generation of the
opposite parity resonances which are frozen at the tree level and discuss the
role of appropriate symmetry which could prevent such a scenario.
