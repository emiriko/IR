Superconductivity of quasi-one-dimensional organic conductors with a
quarter-filled band is investigated using the two-loop renormalization group
approach to the extended Hubbard model for which both the single electron
hopping t_{\perp} and the repulsive interaction V_{\perp} perpendicular to the
chains are included. For a four-patches Fermi surface with deviations to
perfect nesting, we calculate the response functions for the dominant
fluctuations and possible superconducting states. By increasing V_{\perp}, it
is shown that a d-wave (singlet) to f-wave (triplet) superconducting state
crossover occurs, and is followed by a vanishing spin gap. Furthermore, we
study the influence of a magnetic field through the Zeeman coupling, from which
a triplet superconducting state is found to emerge.
