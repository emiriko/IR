In this letter we present a solution to describe simultaneously the light
isoscalar and isovector vector mesons in constituent quark models. In Ref. [1]
the $q\bar q$ spectrum was studied in a generalized constituent quark model
constrained by the $NN$ phenomenology and the baryon spectrum. An overall good
fit to the available experimental data was obtained. A major problem of this
description was the relative position of the vector $\omega$ and $\rho$ mesons.
The present results improve the description of the isoscalar meson
spectroscopy. They should serve as a step forward in distinguishing
conventional quark model mesons from exotic states.
