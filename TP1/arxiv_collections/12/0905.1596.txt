We study a slow classical system [particle] coupled to a fast quantum system
with discrete energy spectrum. We adiabatically exclude the quantum system and
construct an autonomous dynamics for the classical particle in successive
orders of the small ratio $\epsilon$ of the characteristic times. It is known
that in the order $\epsilon^0$ the particle gets an additional
[Born-Oppenheimer] potential, while in the order $\eps^1$ it feels an effective
magnetic field related to the Berry phase. In the order $\epsilon^2$ the motion
of the classical particle can be reduced to a free [geodesic] motion on a
curved Riemannian manifold, with the metric generated by the excluded quantum
system. This motion has a number of unusual features, e.g., it combines
subspaces of different (Riemannian and pseudo-Riemannian) signature for the
metric tensor. In the order $\epsilon^3$ the motion of the classical particle
is still described by a Lagrangian, but the latter linearly depends on the
particle's acceleration. This implies the existence of a spin tensor
[non-orbital angular momentum] for the particle. This spin tensor is related to
the momentum via an analogue of the zitterbewegung effect. The Hamiltonian
structure of the system is non-trivial and is defined via non-linear Poisson
brackets. The linear dependence of the effective classical Lagrangian on
higher-order derivatives is seen as well in the higher orders $\epsilon^n$.
