Based on a Lagrangian with a coupling of two gluons to J^pi=0^+ (the quantum
numbers of the vacuum) which decay to q-qbar pairs, a model is presented, in
which hadrons couple directly to the absolute vacuum of fluctuating gluon
fields. By self-consistency requirements the confinement potential as well as
hadron densities and masses are obtained, which are in good agreement with
experimental data on scalar and vector mesons. In comparison with potential
models additional states are predicted, which can explain the large continuum
of scalar states in the low mass spectrum and new states in the charm region.
The present model is consistent with the concept, that the hadron masses can be
understood by binding effects of the quarks.
