A new type of the gas cell for the resonance ionization laser ion source at
the Leuven Isotope Separator On Line (LISOL) has been developed and tested at
off-line and on-line conditions. Two-step selective laser ionization is applied
to produce purified beams of radioactive isotopes. The selectivity of the ion
source has been increased by more than one order of magnitude by separation of
the stopping and laser ionization regions. This allows to use electrical fields
for further ion purification.
