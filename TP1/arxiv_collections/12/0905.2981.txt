Scalar composite boson masses have been computed in QCD and Technicolor
theories with the help of the homogeneous Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE),
resulting in a scalar mass that is twice the dynamically generated fermion or
technifermion mass ($m_{dyn}$). We show that in the case of walking (or
quasi-conformal) technicolor theories, where the $m_{dyn}$ behavior with the
momenta may be quite different from the one predicted by the standard operator
product expansion, this result is incomplete and we must consider the effect of
the normalization condition of the BSE to determine the scalar masses. We
compute the composite Higgs boson mass for several groups with technifermions
in the fundamental and higher dimensional representations and comment about the
experimental constraints on these theories, which indicate that models based on
walking theories with fermions in the fundamental representation may, within
the limitations of our approach, have masses quite near the actual direct
exclusion limit.
