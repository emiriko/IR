We introduce an effective numerical method of density matrix determination of
fiber coupled single photon generated in process of spontaneous parametric down
conversion in type I non-collinear configuration. The presented theory has been
successfully applied in case of source exploited in Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 123601
(2007) to demonstrate the experimental characterization of spectral state of
single photon.
