The general problem of performance advantage obtainable by the use of
nonclassical transmitted states over classical ones is considered. Attention is
focused on the situation where system loss is significant and additive Gaussian
noise may be present at the receiver. Under the assumption that the total
received state is classical, rigorous output density operator representations
and their trace distance bounds are developed for classical and nonclassical
transmitted states. For applications with high loss in all modes, a practical
No-Go theorem is enunciated that rules out the possibility of significant
advantage of nonclassical over classical states. The recent work on quantum
illumination is discussed as an example of our no-go approach.
