We investigate density fluctuations in a scenario with gravitino dark matter
in the framework of modulated reheating, which is known to generate large
non-Gaussianity. We show that gravitino dark matter is disfavored if primordial
fluctuations have large local-type non-Gaussianity in this framework. We also
briefly discuss the case with the curvaton mechanism and some other possible
dark matter scenarios.
