Investigations of molecular magnets are driven both by prospective
applications in future storage technology or quantum computing as well as by
fundamental questions. Nowadays numerical simulation techniques and computer
capabilities make it possible to investigate spin Hamiltonians with realistic
arrangements of local anisotropy tensors. In this contribution I will discuss
the magnetic response of a small spin system with special emphasis on
non-collinear alignments of the local anisotropy axes.
