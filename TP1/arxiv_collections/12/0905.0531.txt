The surface code scheme for quantum computation features a 2d array of
nearest-neighbor coupled qubits yet claims a threshold error rate approaching
1% (NJoP 9:199, 2007). This result was obtained for the toric code, from which
the surface code is derived, and surpasses all other known codes restricted to
2d nearest-neighbor architectures by several orders of magnitude. We describe
in detail an error correction procedure for the toric and surface codes, which
is based on polynomial-time graph matching techniques and is efficiently
implementable as the classical feed-forward processing step in a real quantum
computer. By direct simulation of this error correction scheme, we determine
the threshold error rates for the two codes (differing only in their boundary
conditions) for both ideal and non-ideal syndrome extraction scenarios. We
verify that the toric code has an asymptotic threshold of p = 15.5% under ideal
syndrome extraction, and p = 7.8 10^-3 for the non-ideal case, in agreement
with prior work. Simulations of the surface code indicate that the threshold is
close to that of the toric code.
