We report on the experimental investigation of a high-frequency
  (1MHz - 1.8GHz) dielectric dispersion in unpoled and poled
  Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 ceramics. Two overlapping loss peaks could be revealed in the
dielectric spectrum. The linear dependence between the lower-frequency peak
position and average grain size D, which holds for D< 10mkm, indicates that the
corresponding polarization mechanism originates from piezoelectric resonances
of grains. The intensity of the higher-frequency peak is drastically reduced by
poling. It is thus proposed that this loss peak is related to domain-wall
contribution to the dielectric dispersion.
