Statistical models for describing the probability distribution over the
states of biological systems are commonly used for dimensional reduction. Among
these models, pairwise models are very attractive in part because they can be
fit using a reasonable amount of data: knowledge of the means and correlations
between pairs of elements in the system is sufficient. Not surprisingly, then,
using pairwise models for studying neural data has been the focus of many
studies in recent years. In this paper, we describe how tools from statistical
physics can be employed for studying and using pairwise models. We build on our
previous work on the subject and study the relation between different methods
for fitting these models and evaluating their quality. In particular, using
data from simulated cortical networks we study how the quality of various
approximate methods for inferring the parameters in a pairwise model depends on
the time bin chosen for binning the data. We also study the effect of the size
of the time bin on the model quality itself, again using simulated data. We
show that using finer time bins increases the quality of the pairwise model. We
offer new ways of deriving the expressions reported in our previous work for
assessing the quality of pairwise models.
