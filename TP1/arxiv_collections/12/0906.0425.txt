We consider evolution of a double quantum dot (DQD) two-electron spin qubit
which is continuously weakly measured with a linear charge detector (quantum
point contact). Since the interaction between the spins of two electrons
depends on their charge state, the charge measurement affects the state of two
spins, and induces non-trivial spin dynamics. We consider the regimes of strong
and weak coupling to the detector, and investigate the measurement-induced spin
dynamics both analytically and numerically. We observe emergence of the
negative-result evolution and the system stabilization due to an analog of
quantum Zeno effect. Moreover, unitary evolution between the triplet and a
singlet state is induced by the negative-result measurement. We demonstrate
that these effects exist for both strong and weak coupling between the detector
and the DQD system.
