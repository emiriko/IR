The Hall effect of LuRh2Si2--the non-magnetic homologue of the heavy-fermion
material YbRh2Si2--is studied with two different setups: In the conventional
single-field geometry, the field dependence is analyzed in terms of the
differential Hall coefficient. Beyond that, the recently developed
crossed-field experiment allows to examine the linear-response Hall coefficient
as a function of magnetic field. The results reveal the expected analogy
between both experiments which corroborates the equivalent findings in
YbRh2Si2. This emphasizes the applicability to investigate field-induced
quantum critical points with both methods.
