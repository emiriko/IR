The ability to teleport entanglement through maximally entangled mixed states
as defined by concurrence and linear entropy is studied. We show how the
teleported entanglement depends on the quality of the quantum channel used, as
defined through its entanglement and mixedness, as well as the form of the
target state to be teleported. We present new results based on the fidelity of
the teleported state as well as an experimental set-up that is immediately
implementable with currently available technology.
