We present numerical simulations of the axisymmetric accretion of a massive
magnetized plasma torus on a rotating black hole. We use a realistic equation
of state, which takes into account neutrino cooling and energy loss due to
nucleus dissociations. We simulated various magnetic field configurations and
torus models, both optically thick and thin for neutrinos. It is shown that the
neutrino cooling does not significantly change either the structure of the
accretion flow or the total energy release of the system. The calculations
evidence heating of the wind surrounding the collapsar by the shock waves
generated at the jet-wind border. This mechanism can give rise to a hot corona
around the binary system like SS433.
  Angular momentum of the accreting matter defines the time scale of the
accretion. Due to the absence of the magnetic dynamo in our calculations, the
initial strength and topology of the magnetic field determines magnetization of
the black hole, jet formation properties and the total energy yield. We
estimated the total energy transformed to jets as $1.3\times 10^{52}$ {ergs}
which was sufficient to explain hypernova explosions like GRB 980425 or GRB
030329.
