In this paper we extend our 2007 paper, Comparative Quantum Cosmology:
Causality, Singularity, and Boundary Conditions, arXiv:0710.5046 to include
consideration of universal expansion, various implications of extendibility and
incompleteness in spacetime metrics and, absent the treatment of Feynman
diagrams, the use of Penning trap dynamics as explained by Ferdandez and
Velazquez to describe the Hamiltonians of space-times with no characteristic
upper or lower bound and to compare the above with Peter Lynds' conjecture on
the specialness of initial conditions in inflationary theory in quantum
cosmology.
