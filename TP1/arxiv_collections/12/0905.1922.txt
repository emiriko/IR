Optical transmission measurements were made on 98% porosity silica aerogel
samples under various degrees of uniaxial strain. Uniaxially compressed
aerogels exhibit large birefringence, proportional to the amount of
compression, up to the 15% strain studied. The birefringence is mostly
reversible and reproducible through multiple compression-decompression cycles.
Our study demonstrates that uniaxially strained high porosity aerogels can be
used as tunable waveplates in a broad spectral range.
