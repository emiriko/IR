The wave equation for vectors and symmetric tensors in spherical coordinates
is studied under the divergence-free constraint. We describe a numerical
method, based on the spectral decomposition of vector/tensor components onto
spherical harmonics, that allows for the evolution of only those scalar fields
which correspond to the divergence-free degrees of freedom of the
vector/tensor. The full vector/tensor field is recovered at each time-step from
these two (in the vector case), or three (symmetric tensor case) scalar fields,
through the solution of a first-order system of ordinary differential equations
(ODE) for each spherical harmonic. The correspondence with the
poloidal-toroidal decomposition is shown for the vector case. Numerical tests
are presented using an explicit Chebyshev-tau method for the radial coordinate.
