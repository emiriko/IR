We performed high pressure experiments on La(0.8)Ca(0.2-x)Sr(x)MnO(3) (LCSMO)
(0<x< 0.2) ceramic samples in order to analyze the validity of the well known
relation between the A mean ionic radius (<rA>) and the Curie temperature Tc of
hole-doped manganites at a fixed doping level and for doping values below the
0.3 (Mn+4/Mn+3) ratio. By considering our results and collecting others from
the literature, we were able to propose a phenomenological law that considers
the systematic dependence of Tc with structural and electronic parameters. This
law predicts fairly well the pressure sensitivity of Tc, its dependence with
the A-cation radius disorder and its evolution in the high pressure range.
Considering a Double Exchange model, modified by polaronic effects, the
phenomenological law obtained for Tc can be associated with the product of two
terms: the polaronic modified bandwidth and an effective hole doping.
