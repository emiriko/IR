Recently more and more attention has been paid to the intrusion detection
systems (IDS) which don't rely on signature based detection approach. Such
solutions try to increase their defense level by using heuristics detection
methods like network-level emulation. This technique allows the intrusion
detection systems to stop unknown threats, which normally couldn't be stopped
by standard signature detection techniques.
  In this article author will describe general concepts of network-level
emulation technique including its advantages and disadvantages (weak sides)
together with providing potential countermeasures against this type of
detection method.
