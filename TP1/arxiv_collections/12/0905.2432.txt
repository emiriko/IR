We calculate the "strange quark content of the nucleon", <N| s s_bar |N>,
which is important for interpreting the results of some dark matter detection
experiments. The method is to evaluate quark-line disconnected correlations on
the MILC lattice ensembles, which include the effects of dynamical strange
quarks. After continuum and chiral extrapolations, the result is <N |s s_bar
|N> = 0.69 +- 0.07(statistical) +- 0.09(systematic), in the modified minimal
subtraction scheme (2 GeV), or for the renormalization scheme invariant form,
m_s partial{M_N}/partial{m_s} = 59(6)(8) MeV.
