The electric dipole polarizabilities of $^3$H, $^3$He, and $^4$He are
calculated directly using the Schr\"odinger equation with the latest generation
of two- and three-nucleon interactions. These polarizabilities are necessary in
order to obtain accurate nuclear-polarization corrections for transitions
involving S-waves in one- and two-electron atoms. Our results are compared to
previous results, and it is shown that direct calculations of the electric
polarizability of $^4$He using modern nuclear potentials are smaller than
published values calculated using experimental photoabsorption data. The status
of this topic is assessed in the context of precise measurements of transitions
in one- and two-electron atoms.
