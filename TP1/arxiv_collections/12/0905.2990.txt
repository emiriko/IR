To select the most relevant sentences of a document, it uses an optimal
decision algorithm that combines several metrics. The metrics processes,
weighting and extract pertinence sentences by statistical and informational
algorithms. This technique might improve a Question-Answering system, whose
function is to provide an exact answer to a question in natural language. In
this paper, we present the results obtained by coupling the Cortex summarizer
with a Question-Answering system (QAAS). Two configurations have been
evaluated. In the first one, a low compression level is selected and the
summarization system is only used as a noise filter. In the second
configuration, the system actually functions as a summarizer, with a very high
level of compression. Our results on French corpus demonstrate that the
coupling of Automatic Summarization system with a Question-Answering system is
promising. Then the system has been adapted to generate a customized summary
depending on the specific question. Tests on a french multi-document corpus
have been realized, and the personalized QAAS system obtains the best
performances.
