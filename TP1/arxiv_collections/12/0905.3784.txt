In this article, we take the vector charmonium-like state Y(4660) as a
$\psi'f_0(980)$ bound state (irrespective of the hadro-charmonium and the
molecular state) tentatively, study its mass using the QCD sum rules, the
numerical value $M_Y=4.71\pm0.26 \rm{GeV}$ is consistent with the experimental
data. Considering the SU(3) symmetry of the light flavor quarks and the heavy
quark symmetry, we also study the bound states $\psi'\sigma(400-1200)$,
$\Upsilon'"f_0(980)$ and $\Upsilon"'\sigma(400-1200)$ with the QCD sum rules,
and make reasonable predictions for their masses.
