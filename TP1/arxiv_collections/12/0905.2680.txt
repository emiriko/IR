For general asymptotically sub-additive potentials (resp. asymptotically
additive potentials) on general topological dynamical systems, we establish
some variational relations between the topological entropy of the level sets of
Lyapunov exponents, measure-theoretic entropies and topological pressures in
this general situation. Most of our results are obtained without the assumption
of the existence of unique equilibrium measures or the differentiability of
pressure functions. Some examples are constructed to illustrate the
irregularity and the complexity of multifractal behaviors in the sub-additive
case and in the case that the entropy map that is not upper-semi continuous.
