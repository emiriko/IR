In an anisotropic universe, observers not positioned at a point of special
symmetry should observe cosmic parallax - the relative angular motion of test
galaxies over cosmic time. It was recently argued that the non-observance of
this effect in upcoming precision astrometry missions such as Gaia may be used
to place strong bounds on the position of off-center observers in a void-model
universe described by the Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi metric. We consider the
analogous effect in anisotropic cosmological models described by an
axisymmetric homogeneous Bianchi type I metric and discuss whether any
observation of cosmic parallax would distinguish between different anisotropic
evolutions.
