The interlayer magnetoresistance of a quasi-two-dimensional layered metal
with a d-wave pseudogap is calculated semiclassically. An expression for the
interlayer resistivity as a function of the strength and direction of the
magnetic field, the magnitude of the pseudogap, temperature, and scattering
rate is obtained. We find that the pseudogap, by introducing low-energy nodal
quasiparticle contours, smooths the dependence on field direction in a manner
characteristic of its anisotropy. We thus propose that interlayer resistance
measurements under a strong field of variable orientation can be used to fully
characterize an anisotropic pseudogap. The general result is applied to the
case of a magnetic field parallel to the conducting layers using a model band
structure appropriate for overdoped T$\ell$2201.
