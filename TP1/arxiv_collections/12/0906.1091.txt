This paper is devoted to the study of Lyapunov-type inequality for Neumann
boundary conditions at higher eigenvalues. Our main result is derived from a
detailed analysis about the number and distribution of zeros of nontrivial
solutions and their first derivatives, together with the use of suitable
minimization problems. This method of proof allows to obtain new information on
Lyapunov constants. For instance, we prove that as in the classical result by
Lyapunov, the best constant is not attained. Additionally, we exploit the
relation between Neumann boundary conditions and disfocality to provide new
nonresonance conditions at higher eigenvalues.
