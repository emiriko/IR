Component-based systems often describe context requirements in terms of
explicit inter-component dependencies. Studying large instances of such
systems?such as free and open source software (FOSS) distributions?in terms of
declared dependencies between packages is appealing. It is however also
misleading when the language to express dependencies is as expressive as
boolean formulae, which is often the case. In such settings, a more appropriate
notion of component dependency exists: strong dependency. This paper introduces
such notion as a first step towards modeling semantic, rather then syntactic,
inter-component relationships. Furthermore, a notion of component sensitivity
is derived from strong dependencies, with ap- plications to quality assurance
and to the evaluation of upgrade risks. An empirical study of strong
dependencies and sensitivity is presented, in the context of one of the
largest, freely available, component-based system.
