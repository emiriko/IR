The (guiding-center) "Hall viscosity" is a fundamental tensor property of
incompressible ``Hall fluids'' exhibiting the fractional quantum Hall effect;
it determines the stress induced by a non-uniform electric field, and the
intrinsic dipole moment on (unreconstructed) edges. It is characterized by a
rational number and an intrinsic metric tensor that defines distances on an
``incompressibility lengthscale''. These properties do not require rotational
invariance in the 2D plane. The sign of the guiding-center Hall viscosity
distinguishes particle fluids from hole fluids, and its magnitude provides a
lower bound to the coefficient of the $O(q^4)$ small-q limit of the guiding
center structure factor, a fundamental measure of incompressibility. This bound
becomes an equality for conformally-invariant model wavefunctions such as
Laughlin or Moore-Read states.
