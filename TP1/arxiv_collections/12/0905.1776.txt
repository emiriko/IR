This paper deals with five-dimensional black hole solutions in (a)
Einstein-Yang-Mills-Gauss-Bonnet theory and (b)Einstein-Maxwell-Gauss-Bonnet
theory with a cosmological constant for spherically symmetric space time. The
geometry of the black hole thermodynamics has been studied for both the black
holes.
