By virtue of the technique of integration within an ordered product (IWOP) of
operators we present a new approach for deriving generalized thermo vacuum
state which is simpler in form that the result by using the Umezawa-Takahashi
approach, in this way the thermo field dynamics can be developed. Applications
of the new state are discussed.
