The MIMAC project is multi-chamber detector for Dark Matter search, aiming at
measuring both track and ionization with a matrix of micromegas micro-TPC
filled with He3 and CF4. Recent experimental results on the first measurements
of the Helium quenching factor at low energy (1 keV recoil) are presented.
