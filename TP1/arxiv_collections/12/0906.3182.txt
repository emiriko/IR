Experimental data of arrays "Andyrchy" and "Carpet-2" of Baksan Neutrino
Observatory (Institute for Nuclear Research), obtained in the regime of a
detection of the single cosmic-ray component, are used for a search of the
bursts of cosmic gamma rays from evaporating primordial black holes. Different
theoretical models of the evaporation process are used for the analysis.
Distributions of the counting rate fluctuations on both arrays agree with the
expectations from the cosmic ray background. The new constraints on the
concentration of evaporating primordial black holes in the local region of
Galaxy are obtained. The comparison of the results of different experiments is
given.
