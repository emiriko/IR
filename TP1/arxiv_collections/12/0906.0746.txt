Propagating, directionally dependent, polarized spin-currents are created in
an anisotropic planar semiconductor microcavity, via Rayleigh scattering of
optically injected polaritons in the optical spin Hall regime. The influence of
anisotropy results in the suppression or enhancement of the pseudospin
precession of polaritons scattered into different directions. This is exploited
to create intense spin currents by excitation on top of localized defects. A
theoretical model considering the influence of the total effective magnetic
field on the polariton pseudospin quantitatively reproduces the experimental
observations.
