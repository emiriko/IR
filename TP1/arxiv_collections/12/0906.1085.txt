The traditional quantum control theory focuses on linear quantum system. Here
we show the effect of nonlinearity on quantum control of a two-level system, we
find that the nonlinearity can change the controllability of quantum system.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Lyapunov control can be used to overcome
this uncontrollability induced by the nonlinear effect.
