The Strongly Coupled Standard Model predicts a rich spectrum of excited
states at the Fermi scale. We study the first radial excitations of the vector
bosons. The inclusion of these new states affects the low energy phenomenology
of the model. We put constraints on the effective couplings by performing a
global fit with the electroweak observables, and we find that the excitations
have to be rather decoupled from the low-energy states.
