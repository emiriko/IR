We demonstrate that a chiral particle-hole condensate is always induced by a
number-conserving ground state of non-zero angular momentum in the presence of
a magnetic field. The magnetic interaction originates from the coupling with
the intrinsic orbital moment of the chiral state when the field is applied
perpendicularly to the plane. According to our numerical results the induction
mechanism is practically temperature independent providing robustness to these
states up to high temperatures. This opens the door for manipulating the
anomalous Hall response resulting from this intricate class of states for
technological applications while it also suggests that chiral particle-hole
condensates may be hidden in various complex materials.
