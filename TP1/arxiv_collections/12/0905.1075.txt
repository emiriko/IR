To allow for a comparison of theoretical predictions for spin chains with
experimental data, it is often important to take impurity effects as well as
interchain couplings into account. Here we present the field theory for finite
spin chains at finite temperature and calculate experimentally measurable
quantities like susceptibilities and nuclear magnetic resonance spectra. For
the interchain couplings we concentrate on geometries relevant for cuprate spin
chains like Sr$_2$CuO$_3$ and SrCuO$_2$. The field theoretical results are
compared to experimental as well as numerical data obtained by the density
matrix renormalization group.
