The aim of the present paper is to present a versatile scheme for the
computation of optical properties of solids, with particular emphasis on
realistic many-body calculations for correlated materials. Geared at the use
with localized basis sets, we extend the commonly known lattice "Peierls
substitution" approach to the case of multi-atomic unit cells. We show in how
far this generalization can be deployed as an approximation to the full Fermi
velocity matrix elements that enter the continuum description of the response
of a solid to incident light. We further devise an upfolding scheme to
incorporate optical transitions, that involve high energy orbitals that had
been downfolded in the underlying many-body calculation of the electronic
structure. As an application of the scheme, we present results on a material of
longstanding interest, vanadium dioxide, VO2. Using dynamical mean-field data
of both, the metallic and the insulating phase, we calculate the corresponding
optical conductivities, elucidate optical transitions and find good agreement
with experimental results.
