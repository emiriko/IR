Performance of quantum process estimation is naturally limited to
fundamental, random, and systematic imperfections in preparations and
measurements. These imperfections may lead to considerable errors in the
process reconstruction due to the fact that standard data analysis techniques
presume ideal devices. Here, by utilizing generic auxiliary quantum or
classical correlations, we provide a framework for estimation of quantum
dynamics via a single measurement apparatus. By construction, this approach can
be applied to quantum tomography schemes with calibrated faulty state
generators and analyzers. Specifically, we present a generalization of "Direct
Characterization of Quantum Dynamics" [M. Mohseni and D. A. Lidar, Phys. Rev.
Lett. 97, 170501 (2006)] with an imperfect Bell-state analyzer. We demonstrate
that, for several physically relevant noisy preparations and measurements, only
classical correlations and small data processing overhead are sufficient to
accomplish the full system identification. Furthermore, we provide the optimal
input states for which the error amplification due to inversion on the
measurement data is minimal.
