An overview of recent measurements of charm and beauty production in ep
collisions at HERA is presented. Various techniques are used by the ZEUS and H1
collaborations to efficiently tag heavy quarks in events and different regions
of phase space are explored. Differential cross sections are measured in both
photoproduction and deep-inelastic scattering. The predictions based on
perturbative QCD calculations at next-to-leading order are generally found to
describe the proton structure and the production of heavy quarks.
