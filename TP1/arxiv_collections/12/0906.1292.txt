The scaling of fluctuations in the distribution of ground-state energies or
costs with the system size N for Ising spin glasses is considered using an
extensive set of simulations with the Extremal Optimization heuristic across a
range of different models on sparse and dense graphs. These models exhibit very
diverse behaviors, and an asymptotic extrapolation is often complicated by
higher-order corrections. The clearest picture, in fact, emerges from the study
of graph-bipartitioning, a combinatorial optimization problem closely related
to spin glasses. Aside from two-spin interactions with discrete bonds, we also
consider problems with Gaussian bonds and three-spin interactions, which behave
differently to a significant degree.
