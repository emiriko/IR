Ever since the first observations that we are living in an accelerating
universe, it has been asked what dark energy is. There are various explanations
all of which with have various draw backs or inconsistencies. Here we show that
using a dark spinor field it is possible to have an equation of state that
crosses the phantom divide, becoming a dark phantom spinor which evolves into
dark energy. This type of equation of state has been mildly favored by
experimental data, however, in the past there were hardly any candidate
theories that satisfied this crossing without creating ghosts or causing a
singularity which results in the universe essentially ripping. The dark spinor
model converges to dark energy in a reasonable time frame avoiding the big rip
and without attaining negative kinetic energy as it crosses the phantom divide.
