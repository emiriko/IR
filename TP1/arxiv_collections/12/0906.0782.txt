We consider the problem of oscillation damping in air of a thermally actuated
microlever as it is gradually approached towards an infinite wall in parallel
geometry. As the gap is decreased from 20 nm down to 400 nm, we observe the
increasing damping of the lever Brownian motion in the fluid laminar regime.
This manifests itself as a linear decrease with distance of the lever quality
factor accompanied by a dramatic softening of its resonance, and eventually
leads to the freezing of the CL oscillation. We are able to quantitatively
explain this behavior by analytically solving the Navier-Stokes equation with
perfect slip boundary conditions. Our findings may have implications for
microfluidics and micro- nano-electromechanical applications.
