We propose a full-fledged open string framework that seems suited to study
the black hole information paradox. We set up a configuration to compute the
scattering amplitude of a IIB open string around a D5-brane. The D5-brane is
situated at the origin of a transverse D3-brane. A string perturbation theory
is employed where the geometry of the D5-brane is treated as a potential. We
reason that the setup is capable of reconciling the unitary evolution of states
and information loss that is measured by an observer on the D3 brane. With the
configurations of these kinds, the information loss is an apparent phenomenon:
it is just a manifestation of the fact that the D3-observer does not have
access to the "hair" of the D5 black brane.
