Higgs boson and massive-graviton productions in association with two jets via
vector-boson fusion (VBF) processes and their decays into a vector-boson pair
at hadron colliders are studied. They include scalar and tensor boson
production processes via weak-boson fusion in quark-quark collisions, gluon
fusion in quark-quark, quark-gluon and gluon-gluon collisions, as well as their
decays into a pair of weak bosons or virtual gluons which subsequently decay
into $\ell\bar\ell$, $q\bar q$ or $gg$. We give the helicity amplitudes
explicitly for all the VBF subprocesses, and show that the VBF amplitudes
dominate the exact matrix elements not only for the weak-boson fusion processes
but also for all the gluon fusion processes when appropriate selection cuts are
applied, such as a large rapidity separation between two jets and a slicing cut
for the transverse momenta of the jets. We also show that our off-shell
vector-boson current amplitudes reduce to the standard quark and gluon
splitting amplitudes with appropriate gluon-polarization phases in the
collinear limit. Nontrivial azimuthal angle correlations of the jets in the
production and in the decay of massive spin-0 and -2 bosons are manifestly
expressed as the quantum interference among different helicity states of the
intermediate vector-bosons. Those correlations reflect the spin and the CP
nature of the Higgs bosons and the massive gravitons.
