We present a combined radio, X-ray and optical study of the galaxy cluster
RXCJ2003.5-2323. The cluster hosts one of the largest, most powerful and
distant giant radio halos known to date, suggesting that it may be undergoing a
strong merger process. The aim of our multiwavelength study is to investigate
the radio-halo cluster merger scenario. We studied the radio properties of the
giant radio halo in RXCJ2003.5-2323 by means of new radio data obtained at 1.4
GHz with the Very Large Array, and at 240 MHz with the Giant Metrewave Radio
Telescope, in combination with previously published GMRT data at 610 MHz. The
dynamical state of the cluster was investigated by means of X-ray Chandra
observations and optical ESO--NTT observations. Our study confirms that
RXCJ2003.5-2323 is an unrelaxed cluster. The unusual filamentary and clumpy
morphology of the radio halo could be due to a combination of the filamentary
structure of the magnetic field and turbulence in the inital stage of a cluster
merger.
