Classical models for dark energy can exhibit a variety of singularities, many
of which occur for scale factors much bigger than the Planck length. We address
here the issue whether some of these singularities, the big freeze and the big
demarrage, can be avoided in quantum cosmology. We use the framework of quantum
geometrodynamics. We restrict our attention to a class of models whose matter
content can be described by a generalized Chaplygin gas and be represented by a
scalar field with an appropriate potential. Employing the DeWitt criterium that
the wave function be zero at the classical singularity, we show that a class of
solutions to the Wheeler-DeWitt equation fulfilling this condition can be
found. These solutions thus avoid the classical singularity. We discuss the
reasons for the remaining ambiguity in fixing the solution.
