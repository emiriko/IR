We study the time-dependent conductance of electron-glasses excited by
electromagnetic radiation at microwaves (MW) and infra-red frequencies. In
either case the conductance G is enhanced during exposure but its time
dependence after the radiation is turned off is qualitatively different
depending on the frequency. For comparison, results of excitation produced by a
gate-voltage and temperature changes are also shown. The glassy nature of the
system allows us to demonstrate that the MW-enhanced conductance is not due to
heating. These findings are discussed in terms of an energy E_{c} that
characterizes the equilibrium charge distribution of the electron-glass.
