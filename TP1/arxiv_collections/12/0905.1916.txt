Viral infections can be broadly divided into infections that are cleared from
the host (acute) and those that persist (chronic). Why some viruses establish
chronic infections while other do not is poorly understood. One possibility is
that the host's immune response is impaired during chronic infections and is
unable to clear the virus from the host. In this report we use a recently
proposed framework to estimate the per capita killing efficacy of CD8$^+$ T
cells, specific for the MT389 epitope of polyoma virus (PyV), which establishes
a chronic infection in mice. Surprisingly, the estimated per cell killing
efficacy of MT389-specific effector CD8$^+$ T cells during the acute phase of
the infection was very similar to the previously estimated efficacy of effector
CD8$^+$ T cells specific to lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus
(LCMV-Armstrong), which is cleared from the host. We also find that during the
chronic phase of the infection the killing efficacy of PyV-specific CD8$^+$ T
cells was only half of that of cells in the acute phase. This decrease in the
killing efficacy is again surprisingly similar to the change in the killing
efficacy of LCMV-specific CD8$^+$ T cells from the peak of the response to the
memory phase. Interestingly, we also find that PyV-specific CD8$^+$ T cells in
the chronic phase of the infection require lower doses of antigen to kill a
target cell. In summary, we find little support for the hypothesis that
persistence of infections is caused by inability of the host to mount an
efficient immune response, and that even in the presence of an efficient
CD8$^+$ T cell response, some viruses can still establish a persistent
infection.
