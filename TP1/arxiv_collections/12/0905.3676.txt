The use of the equations of motion and meson field redefinitions allows the
development of a simplified resonance chiral theory lagrangian: terms including
resonance fields and a large number of derivatives can be reduced into
corresponding O(p2) resonance operators, containing the lowest possible number
of derivatives. This is shown by means of the explicit computation of the pion
vector form-factor up to next-to-leading order in 1/Nc. The study of the
renormalization group equations for the corresponding couplings demonstrates
the existence of an infrared fixed point in the resonance theory. The
possibility of developing a perturbative 1/Nc expansion in the slow running
region around the fixed point is shown here.
