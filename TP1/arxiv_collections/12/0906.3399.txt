Coisotropic deformations of algebraic varieties are defined as those for
which an ideal of the deformed variety is a Poisson ideal. It is shown that
coisotropic deformations of sets of intersection points of plane quadrics,
cubics and space algebraic curves are governed, in particular, by the dKP,
WDVV, dVN, d2DTL equations and other integrable hydrodynamical type systems.
Particular attention is paid to the study of two- and three-dimensional
deformations of elliptic curves. Problem of an appropriate choice of Poisson
structure is discussed.
