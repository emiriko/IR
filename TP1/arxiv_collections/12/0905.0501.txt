We quantify the Fisher information content of the cosmic shear survey
two-point function as a function of noise and resolution. The two point
information of dark matter saturates at the trans-linear scale. We investigate
the impact of non-linear non-Gaussianity on the information content for
lensing, which probes the same dark matter. To do so we heavily utilize N-body
simulations in order to probe accurately the non-linear regime. While we find
that even in a perfect survey, there is no clear saturation scale, we observe
that non-linear growth induced non-Gaussianity could lead to a factor of ~4
reduction for the common Dark Energy figure of merit. This effect is however
mitigated by realistic levels of shot noise and we find that for future
surveys, the effect is closer to a factor of 1.5. To do so, we develop a new
scheme to compute the relevant covariant matrix. It leads us to claim an
unbiased estimator with an order of magnitude improvement in accuracy with only
twice more simulations than previously used. Finally, we evaluate the error on
the errors using bootstrap methods.
