Edge turbulent structures are commonly observed in fusion devices and are
generally believed to be responsible for confinement degradation. Among their
origin Drift-Alfven turbulence is one of the most commonly suggested.
Drift-Alfven paradigm allows the existence of localized vortex-like structures
observed also in various systems. Here we present the evidence of the presence
of drift-Alfv\'en vortices in the edge region of RFX-Mod RFP device, showing
how these structures are responsible for electromagnetic turbulence at the edge
and its intermittent nature.
