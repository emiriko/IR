We study minimal disjoint degenerations for representations of tame quivers.
In particular, we prove that their codimensions are bounded by 2. Therefore a
quiver is Dynkin resp. Euclidean resp. wild iff the codimensions are 1 resp.
bounded by 2 resp. unbounded. We explain also that for tame quivers the
complete classification of all minimal disjoint degenerations is a finite
problem that can be solved with the help of a computer.
