In this note, we apply a special metric ansatz to simplify the equations of
motion for gravitational systems. Then we construct charged brane solutions in
$D=n+p+2$ dimensions which have spherical symmetry of $S^n$ and translational
symmetry along $p$ directions. They are characterized by mass density, uniform
tension and electric/magnetic charges, and nonsingular only for specific
tension. In particular, we find the limits and the coordinate transformations
which reduce the charged brane solutions to $M2$- and $M5$-branes. We also
obtain the regularity condition for an electrically charged two-brane solution
which has two tensions.
