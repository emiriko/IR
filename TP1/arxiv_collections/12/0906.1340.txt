Connected two-point field strength correlators have been measured on the
lattice in quaternionic projective sigma-model of pure SU(2) Yang-Mills theory.
The correlation lengths, extracted from the exponential fit for these
correlators, are found to be lambda_1^{-1} = 1.40(3) GeV and lambda^{-1} =
1.51(3) GeV in good agreement with other existing calculations. The dependence
of bilocal functions on the connector shape was studied.
