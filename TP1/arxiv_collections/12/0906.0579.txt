A technique involving ^{55}Fe X-rays provides a straightforward method to
measure the response of a detector. The detector's response can lead directly
to a calculation of the conversion gain (e^- ADU^{-1}), as well as aid detector
design and performance studies. We calibrate the ^{55}Fe X-ray energy response
and pair production energy of HgCdTe using 8 HST WFC3 1.7 \micron flight grade
detectors. The results show that each K$\alpha$ X-ray generates 2273 \pm 137
electrons, which corresponds to a pair-production energy of 2.61 \pm 0.16 eV.
The uncertainties are dominated by our knowledge of the conversion gain. In
future studies, we plan to eliminate this uncertainty by directly measuring
conversion gain at very low light levels.
