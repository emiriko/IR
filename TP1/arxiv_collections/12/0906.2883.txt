High Energy Nuclear Physics (HENP) collaborations' experience show that the
computing resources available at a single site are often neither sufficient nor
satisfy the need of remote collaborators. From latencies in the network
connectivity to the lack of interactivity, work at distant computing centers is
often inefficient. Having fully functional software stack on local resources is
a strong enabler of science opportunities for any local group who can afford
the time investment.
  Prague's heavy-ions group participating in STAR experiment at RHIC has been a
strong advocate of local computing as the most efficient means of data
processing and physics analyses. Tier 2 computing center was set up at a
Regional Computing Center for Particle Physics called "Golias".
  We report on our experience in setting up a fully functional Tier 2 center
and discuss the solutions chosen to address storage space and analysis issues
and the impact on the farms overall functionality. This includes a locally
built STAR analysis framework, integration with a local DPM system (a cost
effective storage solution), the influence of the availability and quality of
the network connection to Tier 0 via a dedicated CESNET/ESnet link and the
development of light-weight yet fully automated data transfer tools allowing
the movement of entire datasets from BNL (Tier 0) to Golias (Tier 2).
