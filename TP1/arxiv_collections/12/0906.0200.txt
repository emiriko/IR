We study the limit of quasilocal mass defined in [4] and [5] for a family of
spacelike 2-surfaces in spacetime. In particular, we show the limit coincides
with the ADM mass at spatial infinity. The limit for coordinate spheres of a
boosted slice of the Schwarzchild solution is computed explicitly and shown to
give the expected energy-momentum four vector.
