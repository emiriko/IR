Usually, the Kohlrausch (stretched exponential) function is employed to fit
the luminescence decays. In this work we propose to use the Tsallis
distribution as an alternative to describe them. We show that the curves of the
luminescence decay obtained from the Tsallis distribution are close to those
ones obtained from the stretched exponential. Further, we show that our result
can fit well the data of porous silicon at low temperature and simulation
result of the trapping controlled luminescence model.
