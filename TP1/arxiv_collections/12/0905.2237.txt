We investigate the possibilities of constraining the light gravitino mass
m_{3/2} from future cosmic microwave background (CMB) surveys. A model with
light gravitino with the mass m_{3/2}<O(10) eV is of great interest since it is
free from the cosmological gravitino problem and, in addition, can be
compatible with many baryogenesis/leptogenesis scenarios such as the thermal
leptogenesis. We show that the lensing of CMB anisotropies can be a good probe
for m_{3/2} and obtain an expected constraint on m_{3/2} from precise
measurements of lensing potential in the future CMB surveys, such as the
PolarBeaR and CMBpol experiments. If the gravitino mass is m_{3/2}=1 eV, we
will obtain the constraint for the gravitino mass as m_{3/2} < 3.2 eV (95%
C.L.) for the case with Planck+PolarBeaR combined and
m_{3/2}=1.04^{+0.22}_{-0.26} eV (68% C.L.) for CMBpol. The issue of Bayesian
model selection is also discussed.
