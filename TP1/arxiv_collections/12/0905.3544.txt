I discuss topics in the strong QCD dynamics that are of relevance to studies
of the $B$ mesons and to the spectroscopy of heavy hadrons. In particular the
limitations from the hadronic dynamics for the determination of the
weak-interaction parameters are discussed as well as some models for the newly
observed apparently exotic resonances with hidden charm.
