We compute the effect of Landau-level-mixing on the effective two-body and
three-body pseudopotentials for electrons in the lowest and second Landau
levels. We find that the resulting effective three-body interaction is
attractive in the lowest relative angular momentum channel. The renormalization
of the two-body pseudopotentials also shows interesting structure. We comment
on the implications for the $\nu=5/2$ fractional quantum Hall state.
