Data about stability areas of Nd1-xDyxFe3(BO3)4 trigonal phases in fluxes on
the bismuth trimolibdate basis and feature of labile phase dynamics conditions
is noted. Group growth conditions of these phases single crystals on seeds and
at spontaneous nucleation in a thin layer of flux on crystal carrier are
described. Temperature and field dependences of magnetization and a specific
heat for crystals with x = 0,1 and x = 0,25 are analyzed. The conclusion, that
unlike easy plane NdFe3(BO3)4 antiferromagnetic and easy axis DyFe3(BO3)4 ones,
spontaneous spin-flop transitions are inherent in these single crystals is
resulted and it is connected with mutual influence of rare-earth subsystems
through the common Fe-subsystem with strong exchange interaction. The
anisotropies competition exerts essential influence on induced by field H
parallel c3 magnetic phase transitions too.
