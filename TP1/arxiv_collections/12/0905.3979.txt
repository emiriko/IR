We discuss the hadronic molecule issue in the light and heavy meson sector.
Thereby we use the radiative decays of the scalars f0(980) and a0(980) to study
its possible molecular K barK structure. Further on we extend our formalism to
mesons with open charm and strangeness, Ds0*(2317) and Ds1(2460), whose
hadronic molecule interpretation is analyzed in weak decays with f0(980) in the
final state.
