Zeilberger proved the Refined Alternating Sign Matrix Theorem, which gives a
product formula, first conjectured by Mills, Robbins and Rumsey, for the number
of alternating sign matrices with given top row. Stroganov proved an explicit
formula for the number of alternating sign matrices with given top and bottom
rows. Fischer and Romik considered a different kind of "doubly-refined
enumeration" where one counts alternating sign matrices with given top two
rows, and obtained partial results on this enumeration. In this paper we
continue the study of the doubly-refined enumeration with respect to the top
two rows, and use Stroganov's formula to prove an explicit formula for these
doubly-refined enumeration numbers.
