The cosmic-ray excess observed by PAMELA in the positron fraction and by
FERMI and HESS in the electron + positron flux can be interpreted in terms of
DM annihilations or decays into leptonic final states. Final states into tau's
or 4mu give the best fit to the excess. However, in the annihilation scenario,
they are incompatible with photon and neutrino constraints, unless DM has a
quasi-constant density profile. Final states involving electrons are less
constrained but poorly fit the excess, unless hidden sector radiation makes
their energy spectrum smoother, allowing a fit to all the data with a
combination of leptonic modes. In general, DM lighter than about a TeV cannot
fit the excesses, so PAMELA should find a greater positron fraction at higher
energies. The DM interpretation can be tested by FERMI gamma observations above
10 GeV: if the electronic excess is everywhere in the DM halo, inverse Compton
scattering on ambient light produces a well-predicted gamma excess that FERMI
should soon detect.
