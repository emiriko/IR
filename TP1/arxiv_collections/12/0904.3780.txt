Compressed sensing has shown that it is possible to reconstruct sparse high
dimensional signals from few linear measurements. In many cases, the solution
can be obtained by solving an L1-minimization problem, and this method is
accurate even in the presence of noise. Recent a modified version of this
method, reweighted L1-minimization, has been suggested. Although no provable
results have yet been attained, empirical studies have suggested the reweighted
version outperforms the standard method. Here we analyze the reweighted
L1-minimization method in the noisy case, and provide provable results showing
an improvement in the error bound over the standard bounds.
