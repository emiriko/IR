Different from sequential programs, parallel programs possess their own
characteristics which are difficult to analyze in the multi-process or
multi-thread environment. This paper presents an innovative method to
automatically analyze the SPMD programs. Firstly, with the help of clustering
method focusing on similarity analysis, an algorithm is designed to locate
performance problems in parallel programs automatically. Secondly a Rough Set
method is used to uncover the performance problem and provide the insight into
the micro-level causes. Lastly, we have analyzed a production parallel
application to verify the effectiveness of our method and system.
