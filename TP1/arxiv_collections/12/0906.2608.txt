We calculate the band structure and the conductance of periodic corrugated
graphene nanoribbons within the framework of the tight-binding $p$-orbital
model. We consider corrugated structures based on host ribbons with armchair
and zigzag edges and three different types of corrugations (armchair edges,
zigzag edges as well as a rectangular corrugation). We demonstrate that for
armchair host ribbons, depending on the type of corrugation, a band gap or
low-velocity minibands appear near the charge neutrality point. For higher
energies the allowed Bloch state bands become separated by mini-stopbands. By
contrast, for corrugated ribbons with the zigzag host, the corrugations
introduce neither band gaps nor stopbands (except for the case of the
rectangular corrugations). The conductances of finite corrugated ribbons are
analyzed on the basis of the corresponding band structures. For a sufficiently
large number of corrugations the conductance follows the number of the
corresponding propagating Bloch states and shows pronounced oscillations due to
the Fabry-Perot interference within the corrugated segments. Finally we
demonstrate that edge disorder strongly affects the conductances of corrugated
ribbons. Our results indicate that observation of miniband formation in
corrugated ribbons would require clean, edge-disorder free samples, especially
for the case of the armchair host lattice.
