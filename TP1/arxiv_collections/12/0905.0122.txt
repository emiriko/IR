We derive expressions for pion electroproduction amplitudes in the 1/N_c
expansion of QCD, and obtain from them linear relations between the
electromagnetic multipole amplitudes that hold at all energies. The
leading-order relations in 1/N_c compare favorably with available data
(especially away from resonances), but the next-to-leading-order relations tend
to provide only small or no improvement.
