We have performed x-ray linear and circular magnetic dichroism experiments at
the Mn L2,3-edge of the La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 ultra thin films. Our measurements show
that the antiferromagnetic (AF) insulating phase is stabilized by the
interfacial rearrangement of the Mn 3d orbitals, despite the relevant
magnetostriction anisotropic effect on the double-exchange ferromagnetic (FM)
metallic phase. As a consequence, the Mn atomic magnetic moment orientation and
how it reacts to strain differ in the FM and AF phases. In some cases a FM
insulating (FMI) phase adds to the AF and FM. Its peculiar magnetic properties
include in-plane magnetic anisotropy and partial release of the orbital moment
quenching. Nevertheless the FMI phase appears little coupled to the other ones.
