A theory of the separation of a system of indirect excitons into a condensed
and a gaseous phases with the formation of regular patterns of alternating
phases in inhomogeneous external fields is developed. The theory is applied to
the study of the non-uniform distribution of the exciton density in a double
quantum well under a slot cut in a metallic electrode. It is shown that in a
certain range of exciton generation rates a chain of light emitting islands
periodically localized along the slot is developed. By creating a biased
external potential along the slot the periodical pattern could be forced to
move along the slot. Also the structures of condensed phases distribution
arising at periodical external potential is considered.
