We obtain a criterion on the commutativity of polynomials in the enveloping
algebra of a Lie algebra in terms of an involution condition with respect to
the Berezin bracket. As an application, it is shown that the commutativity
requirement of missing label operators for reduction chains in the missing
label problem can be solved analytically.
