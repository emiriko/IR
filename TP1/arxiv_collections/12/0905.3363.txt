All our statements about the physical world are expressed in terms of
everyday notions and thus in terms of classical physics. This necessity is
behind each of our attempt to extract meaning out of empirical data and to
communicate this knowledge to others. As such, it must apply also to the
account of measurement arrangements and to the outcome in quantum experiments.
On the other hand, however, if quantum mechanics is universally valid it should
be possible to give a purely quantum mechanical description of objects of
increasingly large sizes, eventually of the measurement devices themselves. It
is suggested to resolve this dilemma by using the method of von Weizsaecker's
circular and consistent movement in a reconstruction (Kreisgang) in which it is
legitimate to recover the elements with which one started the reconstruction.
The parameters entering the complex amplitudes of a quantum state have an
operational meaning as parameters that specify the configuration of macroscopic
instruments by which the state is prepared and measured. This classical aspect
in each quantum description is at the "beginning" of the Kreisgang. The
Kreisgang is "closed" by showing that under the every-day conditions of
coarse-grained measurements a description of macroscopic instruments emerges in
terminology of classical physics and the three-dimensional ordinary space from
within quantum theory.
