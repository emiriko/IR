A generic transformation of XML data into the Resource Description Framework
(RDF) and its implementation by XSLT transformations is presented. It was
developed by the grid integration project for robotic telescopes of AstroGrid-D
to provide network communication through the Remote Telescope Markup Language
(RTML) to its RDF based information service. The transformation's generality is
explained by this example. It automates the transformation of XML data into RDF
and thus solves this problem of semantic computing. Its design also permits the
inverse transformation but this is not yet implemented.
