In these proceedings, pair correlations between high pT final-state particles
in central and mid-central Au+Au are presented as a function of trigger-angle
with respect to the reaction plane. Jet tomography results like these add
another dimension of experimental discrimination to energy loss calculations
and initial state geometric descriptions. The observed increasing away-side
suppression with respect to the nuclear overlap demonstrate that back-to-back
production at high pT in mid-central collisions is not dominated by unmodified
production produced tangentially to the nuclear overlap. Furthermore, these
results present a challenge to theories that predict only a weak variation due
to angle with respect to the reaction plane.
