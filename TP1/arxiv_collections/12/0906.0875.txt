The KLOE experiment at the upgraded DAFNE e+e- collider in Frascati (KLOE-2)
is going to start a new data taking at the beginning of 2010 with its detector
upgraded with a tagging system for the identification of gamma-gamma
interactions. The tagging stations for low-energy e+e- will consist in two
calorimeters The calorimeter used to detect low-energy e+e- will be placed
between the beam-pipe outer support structure and the inner wall of the KLOE
drift chamber. This calorimeter will be made of LYSO crystals readout by
Silicon Photomultipliers, to achieve an energy resolution better than 8% at 200
MeV.
