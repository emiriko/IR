The M\"obius domain wall action \cite{Brower:2004xi} is a generalization of
Shamir's action, which gives exactly the same overlap fermion lattice action as
the separation ($L_s$) between the domain walls is taken to infinity. The
performance advantages of the algorithm are presented for small ensembles of
quenched, full QCD domain wall and Gap domain wall lattices
\cite{Vranas:2006zk}. In particular, it is shown that at the larger lattice
spacings relevant to current dynamical simulations M\"obius fermions work well
together with GapDWF, reducing $L_s$ by more than a factor of two. It is noted
that there is a precise map between the domain wall and effective overlap
action at finite quark mass including finite $L_s$ chiral violations so that
the Ward-Takahashi identities for the axial and vector currents are exactly
equivalent in the two formulations.
