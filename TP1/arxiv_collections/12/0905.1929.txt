We present atom-interferometer tests of the local Lorentz invariance of
post-Newtonian gravity. An experiment probing for anomalous vertical gravity on
Earth, which has already been performed by us, uses the highest-resolution
atomic gravimeter so far. The influence of Lorentz violation in electrodynamics
is also taken into account, resulting in combined bounds on Lorentz violation
in gravity and electrodynamics. Expressed within the standard model extension
or Nordtvedt's anisotropic universe model, we limit twelve linear combinations
of seven coefficients for Lorentz violation at the part per billion level, from
which we derive limits on six coefficients (and seven when taking into account
additional data from lunar laser ranging). We also discuss the use of
horizontal interferometers, including atom-chip or guided-atom devices, which
potentially allow the use of longer coherence times in order to achieve higher
sensitivity.
