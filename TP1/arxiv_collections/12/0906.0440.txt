We define a notion of depth for an inclusion of multimatrix algebras B < A
based on a comparison of powers of the induction-restriction table M (and its
transpose matrix). This notion of depth coincides with the depth from [Kadison,
2008]. In particular depth 2 extensions coincides with normal extensions as
introduced by Rieffel in 1979. For a group extension H < G a necessary depth n
condition is given in terms of the core of H in G. We prove that the subgroup
depth of symmetric groups S_n < S_{n+1} is 2n-1. An appendix by S. Danz and B.
Kuelshammer determines the subgroup depth of alternating groups A_n < A_{n+1}
as well as dihedral groups.
