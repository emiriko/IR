When heavy ions with high energy collide, a hot and dense matter is produced.
As the matter expands, the matter undergoes cross-over phase transition from
partonic matter to hadronic matter. Jets are created by high pT partons in the
early phase of the collisions. Leptons and photons can penetrate the matter
without strong interaction. For that reason, jets, leptons and photons are good
probes to study the partonic matter in the early phase of the collisions. We
report about two probes associated with photon and their results for PHENIX.
