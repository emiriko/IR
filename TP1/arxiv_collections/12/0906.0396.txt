The dynamics of a cosmological model fueled by scalar field dark matter with
a cosh-like potential plus a cosmological constant is investigated in detail.
It is revealed that the late-time attractor is always the de Sitter solution,
and that, depending on the values of the free parameters, the oscillating
solution of the scalar field -- modeling cold dark matter -- mediates between
some early stage (say, the radiation-dominated solution) and the accelerating
de Sitter attractor.
