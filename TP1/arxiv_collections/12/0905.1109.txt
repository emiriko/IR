The Tevatron experiments, CDF and D0, have produced a wealth of new B-physics
results since the start of Run II in 2001. We've observed new B-hadrons, seen
new effects, and increased many-fold the precision with which we know the
properties of b-quark systems. In these proceedings, we will discuss two of the
most fruitful areas in the Tevatron B-physics program: lifetimes and mixing.
We'll examine the experimental issues driving these analyses, present a summary
of the latest results, and discuss prospects for the future.
