The objective of this article is to highlight certain features of a number of
coefficients that appear in models of phenomena of transport in anisotropic
porous media, especially the coefficient of dispersion, the 2nd rank tensor
D_{ij}, and the dispersivity coefficient, the 4th rank tensor a_{ijkl}, that
appear in models of solute transport. Although we shall focus on the transport
of mass of a dissolved chemical species in a fluid phase that occupies the void
space, or part of it, the same discussion is also applicable to transport
coefficients that appear in models that describe the advective mass flux of a
fluid and the diffusive transport of other extensive quantities, like heat. The
case of coupled processes, e.g. the simultaneous transport of heat and mass of
a chemical species, are also considered. The entire discussion will be at the
macroscopic level, at which a porous medium domain is visualized as homogenized
continuum.
