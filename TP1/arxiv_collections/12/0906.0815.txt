In an electron system coupled with anharmonic phonons, i.e., {\it rattling},
inverse isotope effect on the Kondo temperature $T_{\rm K}$ is found to occur
by the numerical evaluation of the Sommerfeld constant $\gamma$ of the
Anderson-Holstein model. For the anharmonic potential of an oscillator with
mass $M$ in which large $\gamma$ has been found to be almost independent of an
applied magnetic field, $\gamma$ is significantly suppressed when $M$ is
increased, i.e., $T_{\rm K}$ is enhanced due to the relation of
$\gamma$$\sim$$T_{\rm K}^{-1}$ in the Kondo problem, leading to the inverse
isotope effect on $T_{\rm K}$. Since this phenomenon does not occur for
harmonic phonons, it can be a key experiment to prove the relevance of rattling
to magnetically robust heavy electron state.
