CP violation of the charged lepton sector has not been found yet. Tau is a
unique charged lepton which can decay into hadrons. In this talk, we argue what
kind of new physics can be studied with CP violation of tau lepton decays. We
also disucuss how to handle hadronic final state interactions for a prediction
of the direct CP violation.
