We discuss the quantum phases of hard-core bosons on a two-dimensional square
lattice interacting via repulsive dipole-dipole interactions, as realizable
with polar molecules trapped in optical lattices. In the limit of small
tunneling, we find evidence for a devil's staircase, where solid phases appear
at all rational fillings of the underlying lattice. For finite tunneling, we
establish the existence of extended regions of parameters where the groundstate
is a supersolid, obtained by doping the solids either with particles or
vacancies. Here the solid-superfluid quantum melting transition consists of two
consecutive second-order transitions, with a supersolid as the intermediate
phase. The effects of finite temperature and confining potentials relevant to
experiments are discussed.
