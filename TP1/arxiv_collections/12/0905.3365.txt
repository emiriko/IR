A tiny hypermagnetic field generated before the electroweak phase transition
(EWPT) associated to the generation of elementary particle masses can polarize
the early Universe hot plasma at huge redshifts z > 10^15. The anomalous
violation of the right-handed electron current characteristic of the EWPT
converts the lepton asymmetry into a baryon asymmetry. Under reasonable
approximations, the magnetic field strength inferred by requiring such
"leptogenic" origin for the observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe matches
the large-scale cosmological magnetic field strengths estimated from current
astronomical observations.
