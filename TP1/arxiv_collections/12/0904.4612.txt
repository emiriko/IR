An insulating optical lattice with double-well sites is considered. In the
case of the unity filling factor, an effective Hamiltonian in the pseudospin
representation is derived. A method is suggested for manipulating the
properties of the system by varying the shape of the double-well potential. In
particular, it is shown that the atomic imbalance can be varied at will and a
kind of the Morse-alphabet sequences can be created.
