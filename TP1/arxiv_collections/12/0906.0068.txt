We recognize the need for the characterization of exoplanets in reflected
light in the visible and in the IR termal emission. But for the thermal
infrared we also recognize the difficulty of an interferometric nuller We
nevertheless endorse the need for future interferometers. We propose a new,
realistic, pathway to satisfy both goals, thermal infrared studies and
interferometric architectures.
