Ultra-high energy photons (UHE, E > 10^19 eV) are inevitably produced during
the propagation of 10^20 eV protons in extragalactic space. Their short
interaction lengths (<20 Mpc) at these energies, combined with the impressive
sensitivity of the Pierre Auger Observatory detector to these particles, makes
them an ideal probe of nearby ultra-high-energy cosmic ray (UHECR) sources. We
here discuss the particular case of photons from a single nearby (within 30
Mpc) source in light of the possibility that such an object might be
responsible for several of the UHECR events published by the Auger
collaboration. We demonstrate that the photon signal accompanying a cluster of
a few > 6x10^19 eV UHECRs from such a source should be detectable by Auger in
the near future. The detection of these photons would also be a signature of a
light composition of the UHECRs from the nearby source.
