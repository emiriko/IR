An important challenge in theoretical ecology is to find good, coarse-grained
representations of complex food webs. Here we use the approach of generalized
modeling to show that it may be possible to formulate a coarse-graining
algorithm that conserves the local dynamics of the model exactly. We show
examples of food webs with a different number of species that have exactly
identical local bifurcation diagrams. Based on these observations, we formulate
a conjecture governing which populations of complex food webs can be grouped
together into a single variable without changing the local dynamics. As an
illustration we use this conjecture to show that chaotic regions generically
exist in the parameter space of a class of food webs with more than three
trophic levels. While our conjecture is at present only applicable to
relatively special cases we believe that its applicability could be greatly
extended if a more sophisticated mapping of parameters were used in the model
reduction.
