We explore the dark matter detection prospects in the Minimal Supersymmetric
Standard Model in the scenario where the scalar partners of the fermions and
the Higgs particles (except for the Standard-Model-like one) are assumed to be
very heavy and are removed from the low-energy spectrum. We analyse the
neutralino LSP ($\chi_1^0$) in scenarios where the gaugino mass parameters are
universal at the GUT scale and also the case where they are non-universal. This
analysis is carried out in the framework of a Xenon-like 100 kg experiment. In
general, an important fraction of the parameter space giving rise to the dark
matter relic density measured by WMAP can be probed and excluded in the case of
not detecting any WIMP. In the opposite case, once a WIMP signal has been
found, we show that for a light $\chi_1^0$ which is a higgsino-gaugino mixture
it is possible to reconstruct efficiently the mass and the scattering
cross-section of the neutralino LSP. Moreover, we show that it is also feasible
to put strong constraints over some of the parameters of the Lagrangian, e.g.
the higgsino and the gaugino mass parameters.
