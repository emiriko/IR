In this paper we construct a parametrix for the forward fundamental solution
of the wave and Klein-Gordon equations on asymptotically de Sitter spaces
without caustics. We use this parametrix to obtain asymptotic expansions for
solutions of the inhomogeneous equation and to obtain a uniform L^p estimate
for a family of bump functions traveling to infinity.
