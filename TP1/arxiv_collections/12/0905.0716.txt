The full stellar population of NGC 6334, one of the most spectacular regions
of massive star formation in the nearby Galaxy, have not been well-sampled in
past studies. We analyze here a mosaic of two Chandra X-ray Observatory images
of the region using sensitive data analysis methods, giving a list of 1607
faint X-ray sources with arcsecond positions and approximate line-of-sight
absorption. About 95 percent of these are expected to be cluster members, most
lower mass pre-main sequence stars. Extrapolating to low X-ray levels, the
total stellar population is estimated to be 20-30,000 pre-main sequence stars.
The X-ray sources show a complicated spatial pattern with about 10 distinct
star clusters. The heavily-obscured clusters are mostly associated with
previously known far-infrared sources and radio HII regions. The
lightly-obscured clusters are mostly newly identified in the X-ray images.
Dozens of likely OB stars are found, both in clusters and dispersed throughout
the region, suggesting that star formation in the complex has proceeded over
millions of years. A number of extraordinarily heavily absorbed X-ray sources
are associated with the active regions of star formation.
