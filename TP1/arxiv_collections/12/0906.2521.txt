We classify the complexity of the satisfiability problem for extensions of
CTL and UB. The extensions we consider are Boolean combinations of path
formulas, fairness properties, past modalities, and forgettable past. Our main
result shows that satisfiability for CTL with all these extensions is still in
2-EXPTIME, which strongly contrasts with the nonelementary complexity of CTL*
with forgettable past. We give a complete classification of combinations of
these extensions, yielding a dichotomy between extensions with
2-EXPTIME-complete and those with EXPTIME-complete complexity. In particular,
we show that satisfiability for the extension of UB with forgettable past is
complete for 2-EXPTIME, contradicting a claim for a stronger logic in the
literature. The upper bounds are established with the help of a new kind of
pebble automata.
