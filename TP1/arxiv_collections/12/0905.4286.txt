We present a direct comparison of the recently-proposed valence bond
entanglement entropy and the von Neumann entanglement entropy on spin 1/2
Heisenberg systems using quantum Monte Carlo and density-matrix renormalization
group simulations. For one-dimensional chains we show that the valence bond
entropy can be either less or greater than the von Neumann entropy, hence it
cannot provide a bound on the latter. On ladder geometries, simulations with up
to seven legs are sufficient to indicate that the von Neumann entropy in two
dimensions obeys an area law, even though the valence bond entanglement entropy
has a multiplicative logarithmic correction.
