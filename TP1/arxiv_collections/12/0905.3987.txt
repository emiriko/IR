A weak photon interaction with the hidden sector of the Universe, introduced
recently to realize a "photonic portal", (to such a hypothetic sector
responsible for cold dark matter), is conjectured to be embedded in a more
extended weak interaction displaying electroweak symmetry spontaneously broken
by the Standard-Model Higgs mechanism. This is a hypothetic new weak
interaction between hidden and Standard-Model sectors of the Universe,
appearing in our model in addition to the conventional electroweak interaction
acting in the Standard-Model sector.
