The fluid-dynamical model of a self-gravitating mass of viscous liquid with
singular density at the center vibrating in fundamental mode is considered in
juxtaposition with that for Kelvin fundamental mode in a homogeneous heavy mass
of incompressible inviscid liquid. Particular attention is given to the
difference between spectral formulae for the frequency and lifetime of $f$-mode
in the singular and homogeneous models. The newly obtained results are
discussed in the context of theoretical asteroseismology of pre-white dwarf
stage of red giants and stellar cocoons -- spherical gas-dust clouds with dense
star-forming core at the center.
