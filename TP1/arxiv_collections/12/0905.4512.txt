We study pulse propagation in one-dimensional tapered chains of spherical
granules. Analytic results for the pulse velocity and other pulse features are
obtained using a binary collision approximation. Comparisons with numerical
results show that the binary collision approximation provides quantitatively
accurate analytic results for these chains.
