In this paper, the total payoff of each agent is regulated to reduce the
heterogeneity of the distribution of the total payoffs. It is found there is an
optimal regulation strength where the fraction of cooperation is prominently
promoted, too weak or too strong of the strength will have little effects or
result in the disappearance of the cooperators. It is also found that most of
the cooperators are not distributed in isolation but form the cooperator
clusters, and to promote the cooperation the only way is to enlarge the size of
the cooperator clusters. Finally, we try to explain the emergence of larger
clusters and prove the existence of the optimal regulation strength. Our works
provide insight into the understanding of the relations between the
distribution of payoffs and the cooperative behaviors.
