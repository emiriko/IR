We calculate the binding energy, root-mean-square radius and quadrupole
deformation parameter for the recent, possibly discovered superheavey element
Z=122, using the axially deformed relativistic mean field (RMF) and
non-relativistic Skyrme Hartree-Fock (SHF) formalisms. The calculation is
extended to include various isotopes of Z=122 element, strarting from A=282 to
A=320. We predict highly deformed structures in the ground state for all the
isotopes. A shape transition appears at about A=290 from a highly oblate to a
large prolate shape, which may be considered as the superdeformed and
hyperdeformed structures of Z=122 nucleus in the mean field approaches. The
most stable isotope (largest binding energy per nucleon) is found to be
$^{302}$122, instead of the experimentally observed $^{292}$122.
