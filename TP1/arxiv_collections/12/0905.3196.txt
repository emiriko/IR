Real data are constrained to finite sampling rates, which calls for a
suitable mathematical description of the corrections to the finite-time
estimations of the dynamic equations. Often in the literature, lower order
discrete time approximations of the modeling diffusion processes are
considered. On the other hand, there is a lack of simple estimating procedures
based on higher order approximations. For standard diffusion models, that
include additive and multiplicative noise components, we obtain the exact
corrections to the empirical finite-time drift and diffusion coefficients,
based on It\^o-Taylor expansions. These results allow to reconstruct the real
hidden coefficients from the empirical estimates. We also derive higher-order
finite-time expressions for the third and fourth conditional moments, that
furnish extra theoretical checks for that class of diffusive models. The
theoretical predictions are compared with the numerical outcomes of some
representative artificial time-series.
