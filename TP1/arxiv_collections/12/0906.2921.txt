Here is presented a concept of centrogeometry which can be seen as a
combination of the concept of point-like observer with an idea of
Poincar\'{e}'s that different geometries are principally equivalent. As it is
to be shown later, all centrogeometries are obtained from each other by general
deformation (i.e. active coordinate transformations). Isometries of
centrogeometries are equivalent to those of the Euclidean centrogeometry as
described by common diffeomorphisms of the Euclidean spheres. There are
discussed physical aspects of centrogeometry in the context of chronogeometry,
mechanics and cosmology.
