The ESO Distant Cluster Survey (EDisCS, P.I. Simon D.M. White, LP 166.A-0162)
is an ESO large programme aimed at studying clusters and cluster galaxies at
z=0.4-1. How different is the evolution of the star formation activity in
clusters, in groups and in the field? Does it depend on cluster mass and/or the
local galaxy density? How relevant are starburst and post-starburst galaxies in
the different environments? Is there an evolution in the galaxies' structures,
and if so, is this related to the changes in their star formation activity?
These are some of the main questions that have been investigated using the
EDisCS dataset.
