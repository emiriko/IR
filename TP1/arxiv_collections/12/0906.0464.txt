We present light transmission measurements and frequency-delay reflectometry
maps for GaAs photonic crystal membranes, which show the transition from
propagation with a well defined group velocity to a regime completely dominated
by disorder-induced coherent scattering. Employing a self-consistent optical
scattering theory, with only statistical functions to describe the structural
disorder, we obtain an excellent agreement with the experiments using no
fitting parameters. Our experiments and theory together provide clear physical
insight into naturally occurring light localization and multiple
coherent-scattering phenomena in slow-light waveguides.
