Transport through a molecular device coupled to a vibrational mode is
studied. By mapping it to the Yu-Anderson model in the large contact broadening
limit, the zero bias electric and heat conductances are evaluated
non-perturbatively. These exhibit a step from their T=0 value to half of its
value as T increases due to the opening of the inelastic scattering channel.
The spectral function exhibits the Franck-Condon suppressed multiphonon steps.
The Wiedemann-Franz law is satisfied at low and high temperatures, but is
violated in between. Relations to experiments are discussed.
