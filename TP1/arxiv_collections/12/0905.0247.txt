Metric $f(R)$ gravity theories are conformally equivalent to models of
quintessence in which matter is coupled to dark energy. We derive a condition
for stable tracker solution for metric $f(R)$ gravity in the Einstein frame. We
find that tracker solutions with $-0.361<\omega_{\varphi}<1$ exist if
$0<\Gamma<0.217$ and $\frac{d}{dt} \ln f'(\tilde{R})>0$, where
$\Gamma=\frac{V_{\varphi\varphi}V}{V_{\varphi}^{2}}$ is dimensionless function,
$\omega_{\varphi}$ is the equation of state parameter of the scalar field and
$\tilde{R}$ refers to Jordan frame's curvature scalar. Also, we show that there
exists $f(\tilde{R})$ gravity models which have tracking behavior in the
Einstein frame and so the curvature of space time is decreasing with time while
they lead to the solutions in the Jordan frame that the curvature of space time
can be increasing with time.
