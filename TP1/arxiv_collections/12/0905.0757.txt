The conserved Manna model with a planar absorbing boundary is studied in
various space dimensions. We present a heuristic argument that allows one to
compute the surface critical exponent in one dimension analytically. Moreover,
we discuss the mean field limit that is expected to be valid in d>4 space
dimensions and demonstrate how the corresponding partial differential equations
can be solved.
