We use the results from a constrained, cosmological MHD simulation of the
Local Universe to predict the radio halo and the gamma-ray flux from the Coma
cluster and compare it to current observations. The simulated magnetic field
within the Coma cluster is the result of turbulent amplification of the
magnetic field during build-up of the cluster. The magnetic seed field
originates from star-burst driven, galactic outflows. The synchrotron emission
is calculated assuming a hadronic model. We follow four approaches with
different distributions for the cosmic-ray proton (CRp) population within
galaxy clusters. The radial profile the radio halo can only be reproduced with
a radially increasing energy fraction within the cosmic ray proton population,
reaching $>$100% of the thermal energy content at $\approx$ 1Mpc, e.g. the edge
of the radio emitting region. Additionally the spectral steepening of the
observed radio halo in Coma cannot be reproduced, even when accounting for the
negative flux from the thermal SZ effect at high frequencies. Therefore the
hadronic models are disfavored from present analysis. The emission of
$\gamma$-rays expected from our simulated coma is still below the current
observational limits (by a factor of $\sim$6) but would be detectable in the
near future.
