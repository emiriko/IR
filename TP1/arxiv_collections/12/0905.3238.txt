We consider the possible existence of a common channel of evolution of binary
systems, which results in a gamma-ray burst during the formation of a black
hole or the birth of a magnetar during the formation of a neutron star. We
assume that the rapid rotation of the core of a collapsing star can be
explained by tidal synchronization in a very close binary. The calculated rate
of formation of rapidly rotating neutron stars is qualitatively consistent with
estimates of the formation rate of magnetars. However, our analysis of the
binarity of newly-born compact objects with short rotational periods indicates
that the fraction of binaries among them substantially exceeds the
observational estimates. To bring this fraction into agreement with the
statistics for magnetars, the additional velocity acquired by a magnetar during
its formation must be primarily perpendicular to the orbital plane before the
supernova explosion, and be large.
