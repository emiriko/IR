Let us consider the set of all joint probabilities generated by local binary
measurements on two separated quantum systems of a given local dimension d. We
address the question of whether the shape of this quantum body is convex or
not. We construct a point in the space of joint probabilities, which is on the
convex hull of the local polytope, but still cannot be attained by measuring
d-dimensional quantum systems, if the number of measurement settings is large
enough. From this it follows that this body is not convex. We also show that
for finite d the quantum body with POVM allowed may contain points that can not
be achieved with only projective measurements.
