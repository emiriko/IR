In this short review, I draw attention to new developments in the theory of
fault tolerance in quantum computation that may give concrete direction to
future work in the development of superconducting qubit systems. The basics of
quantum error correction codes, which I will briefly review, have not
significantly changed since their introduction fifteen years ago. But an
interesting picture has emerged of an efficient use of these codes that may put
fault tolerant operation within reach. It is now understood that two
dimensional surface codes, close relatives of the original toric code of
Kitaev, can be adapted to effectively perform logical gate operations in a very
simple planar architecture, with error thresholds for fault tolerant operation
simulated to be 0.75%. This architecture uses topological ideas in its
functioning, but it is not 'topological quantum computation' -- there are no
non-abelian anyons in sight. I offer some speculations on the crucial pieces of
superconducting hardware that could be demonstrated in the next couple of years
that would be clear stepping stones towards this surface-code architecture.
