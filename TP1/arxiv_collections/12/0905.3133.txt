Selective area growth of InN nanorods by plasma assisted molecular beam
epitaxy is demonstrated. Molybdenum is found to be a suitable mask material at
the low substrate temperature of 475 C needed for the growth of InN
nanocolumns. The growth of arrays of single nanorods on a Si(111) substrate has
been achieved with a thin molybdenum mask lithographically patterned with holes
smaller than 60 nm.
