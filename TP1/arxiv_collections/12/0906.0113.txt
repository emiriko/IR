This paper provides general matrix formulas for computing the score function,
the (expected and observed) Fisher information and the $\Delta$ matrices
(required for the assessment of local influence) for a quite general model
which includes the one proposed by Russo et al. (2009). Additionally, we also
present an expression for the generalized leverage. The matrix formulation has
a considerable advantage, since although the complexity of the postulated
model, all general formulas are compact, clear and have nice forms.
