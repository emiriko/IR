Spectroscopy of the centrosymmetric magnetic semiconductors EuTe and EuSe
reveals spin-induced optical second harmonic generation (SHG) in the band gap
vicinity at 2.1-2.4eV. The magnetic field and temperature dependence
demonstrates that the SHG arises from the bulk of the materials due to a novel
type of nonlinear optical susceptibility caused by the magnetic dipole
contribution combined with spontaneous or induced magnetization. This
spin-induced susceptibility opens access to a wide class of centrosymmetric
systems by harmonics generation spectroscopy.
