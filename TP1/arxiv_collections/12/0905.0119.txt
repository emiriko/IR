We review the idea, due to Einstein, Eddington, Hoyle and Ballard, that time
is a subjective label, whose primary purpose is to order events, perhaps in a
higher-dimensional universe. In this approach, all moments in time exist
simultaneously, but they are ordered to create the illusion of an unfolding
experience by some physical mechanism. This, in the language of relativity, may
be connected to a hypersurface in a world that extends beyond spacetime. Death
in such a scenario may be merely a phase change.
