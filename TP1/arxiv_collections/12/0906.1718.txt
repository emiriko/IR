This article focuses on techniques for acoustic noise reduction, signal
filters and source reconstruction. For noise reduction, bandpass filters and
cross correlations are found to be efficient and fast ways to improve the
signal to noise ratio and identify a possible neutrino-induced acoustic signal.
The reconstruction of the position of an acoustic point source in the sea is
performed by using small-volume clusters of hydrophones (about 1 cubic meter)
for direction reconstruction by a beamforming algorithm. The directional
information from a number of such clusters allows for position reconstruction.
The algorithms for data filtering, direction and position reconstruction are
explained and demonstrated using simulated data.
