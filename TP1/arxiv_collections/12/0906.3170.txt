A set of molecular models for 78 pure substances from prior work is taken as
a basis for systematically studying vapor-liquid equilibria (VLE) in ternary
systems.All 33 ternary mixtures of these 78 components for which experimental
VLE data is available are studied by molecular simulation. The mixture models
are based on the modified Lorentz-Berthelot combining rule that contains one
binary interaction parameter which was adjusted to a single experimental binary
vapor pressure of each binary subsystem in prior work.No adjustment to ternary
data is carried out. The predictions from the molecular models of the 33
ternary mixtures are compared to the available experimental data.In almost all
cases, the molecular models give excellent predictions of the ternary mixture
properties.
