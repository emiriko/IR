An overview of the SuperB project and its physics programme is presented.
There are many new physics sensitive observables that can be measured at a high
luminosity e+e- collider operating near a centre of mass energy of ~10 GeV, and
many new physics scenarios to test in the literature. Together these form a
golden matrix of observables versus scenarios. Each scenario has its it's own
golden channel(s) and the pattern of deviations from Standard Model behaviour
that will be measured by SuperB can be used to home in on the new physics
scenario describing nature at high energies.
