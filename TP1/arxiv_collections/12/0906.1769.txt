The Effective One Body (EOB) formalism is an analytical approach which aims
at providing an accurate description of the motion and radiation of coalescing
binary black holes with arbitrary mass ratio. We review the basic elements of
this formalism and discuss its aptitude at providing accurate template
waveforms to be used for gravitational wave data analysis purposes.
