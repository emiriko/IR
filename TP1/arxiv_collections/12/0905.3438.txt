In their recent SIAM J. Control Optim. paper from 2009, J. Eckstein and B.F.
Svaiter proposed a very general and flexible splitting framework for finding a
zero of the sum of finitely many maximal monotone operators. In this short
note, we provide a technical result that allows for the removal of Eckstein and
Svaiter's assumption that the sum of the operators be maximal monotone or that
the underlying Hilbert space be finite-dimensional.
