We propose a generalised induced gravity brane-world model where the brane
action contains an arbitrary f(R) term, R being the scalar curvature of the
brane. We show that the effect of the f(R)term on the dynamics of a homogeneous
and isotropic brane is twofold: (i) an evolving induced gravity parameter and
(ii) a shift on the energy density of the brane. This new shift term, which is
absent on the Dvali, Gabadadze and Porrati (DGP) model, plays a crucial role to
self-accelerate the generalised normal DGP branch of our model. We analyse as
well the stability of de Sitter self-accelerating solutions under homogeneous
perturbations and compare our results with the standard 4-dimensional one.
Finally, we obtain power law solutions which either correspond to conventional
acceleration or super-acceleration of the brane. In the latter case, no phantom
matter is invoked on the brane nor in the bulk.
