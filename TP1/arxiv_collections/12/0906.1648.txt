Primordial black holes are unique probes of cosmology, general relativity,
quantum gravity and non standard particle physics. They can be considered as
the ultimate particle accelerator in their last (explosive) moments since they
are supposed to reach, very briefly, the Planck temperature. Upper limits on
the primordial black hole number density of mass $M_{\star} = 5 10^{14}$ g, the
Hawking mass (born in the big-bang terminating their life presently), is
determined comparing their predicted cumulative $\gamma$-ray emission,
galaxy-wise, to the one observed by the EGRET satellite, once corrected for non
thermal $\gamma$-ray background emission induced by cosmic ray protons and
electrons interacting with light and matter in the Milky Way. A model with free
gas emissivities is used to map the Galaxy in the 100 MeV photon range, where
the peak of the primordial black hole emission is expected. The best gas
emissivities and additional model parameters are obtained by fitting the EGRET
data and are used to derive the maximum emission of the primordial black hole
of the Hawking mass, assuming that they are distributed like the dark matter in
the Galactic halo. The bounds we obtain, depending on the dark matter
distribution, extrapolated to the whole Universe ($\Omega_{PBH}(M_{\star}) =
2.4 10^{-10}$ to $2.6 10^{-9}$ are more stringent than the previous ones
derived from extragalactic $\gamma$-ray background and antiprotons fluxes,
though less model dependent and based on more robust data. These new limits
have interesting consequences on the theory of the formation of small
structures in the Universe, since they are the only constraint on very small
scale density fluctuations left by inflation.
