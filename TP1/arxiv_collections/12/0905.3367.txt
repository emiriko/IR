Kerr black holes are energetically similar to spinning tops accompanied by
frame dragging in the surrounding spacetime. Frame dragging is shown herein to
be a universal causal agent for producing multi-messenger emissions. We discuss
high energy emissions produced by gravitational spin-orbit coupling along the
axis of rotation and low energy emissions from surrounding matter via a torus
magnetosphere. Model results point to ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs)
from supermassive black holes at about the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin (GZK) energy
threshold from low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGN), and to high-energy
photon emissions from stellar mass black holes in ultra-relativistic capillary
jets. The former compares favorably with recent results by the Pierre Auger
Observatory (PAO). The latter compares favorably with gamma-ray burst data from
the High Energy Transient Exporer (HETE) II, {\em Swift} and the Burst and
Transient Source Experiment (BATSE), wherein a finite lifetime of black hole
spin is found to improve the correlation between peak energies and true
energies in gamma-rays. Matched filtering applied to 600 light curves of long
GRBs identifies a process of viscous spin down against matter at the inner most
stable circular orbit. We conclude that long GRBs are spin powered, not
accretion powered, from core-collapse supernovae and merger events such as
GRB060614. Contemporaneous low energy emissions are expected from surrounding
matter in gravitational waves by a pressure driven Papaloizou-Pringle
instability, and more so than in accompanying MeV-neutrinos and magnetic winds.
The latter powers aspherical radio-loud supernovae in collapsars and long
duration extragalactic radio bursts from GRB060614 type events. This outlook is
of interest to emerging multi-messenger surveys.
