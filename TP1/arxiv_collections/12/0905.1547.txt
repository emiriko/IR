We study a gauged CP(1) Chern-Simons system. Using the equations of motion we
find, for a static field configuration, that the divergence of the electric
field is related to the electric and the CP(1) topological charge densities .
We discuss this relation in terms of an ansatz for the fields and use it to
show that the CP(1) topological charge is a bound of the energy.
