Atomic parity violation has been observed in the 6s^2 1S0 - 5d6s 3D1 408-nm
forbidden transition of ytterbium. The parity-violating amplitude is found to
be two orders of magnitude larger than in cesium, where the most precise
experiments to date have been performed. This is in accordance with theoretical
predictions and constitutes the largest atomic parity-violating amplitude yet
observed. This also opens the way to future measurements of neutron skins and
anapole moments by comparing parity-violating amplitudes for various isotopes
and hyperfine components of the transition.
