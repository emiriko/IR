A significant percentage of online content is now published and consumed via
the mechanism of crowdsourcing. While any user can contribute to these forums,
a disproportionately large percentage of the content is submitted by very
active and devoted users, whose continuing participation is key to the sites'
success. As we show, people's propensity to keep participating increases the
more they contribute, suggesting motivating factors which increase over time.
This paper demonstrates that submitters who stop receiving attention tend to
stop contributing, while prolific contributors attract an ever increasing
number of followers and their attention in a feedback loop. We demonstrate that
this mechanism leads to the observed power law in the number of contributions
per user and support our assertions by an analysis of hundreds of millions of
contributions to top content sharing websites Digg.com and Youtube.com.
