The nonequilibrium effective potential is computed for the Frank model of
spontaneous mirror symmetry breaking (SMSB) in chemistry in which external
noise is introduced to account for random environmental effects. When these
fluctuations exceed a critical magnitude, mirror symmetry is restored. The
competition between ambient noise and the chiral bias due to physical fields
and polarized radiation can be explored with this potential.
