We derive the four-point vector correlators in QCD from AdS/QCD
correspondence. It is shown that meson poles are correctly reproduced. The
final expression also suggests a nonzero amplitude in the limit of zero
virtuality of two longitudinal gluons. This fact does not mean that one can
produce, absorb or scatter real longitudinal gluons.
