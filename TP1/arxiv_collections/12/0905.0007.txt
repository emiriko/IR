The triple-\alpha reaction rate is re-evaluated by directly solving the
three-body Schr\"odinger equation. The resonant and nonresonant processes are
treated on the same footing using the continuum-discretized coupled-channels
method for three-body scattering. Accurate description of the \alpha-\alpha
nonresonant states significantly quenches the Coulomb barrier between the
two-\alpha's and the third \alpha particle. Consequently, the \alpha-\alpha
nonresonant continuum states below the resonance at 92.04 keV, i.e., the ground
state of 8Be, give markedly larger contribution at low temperatures than in
foregoing studies. We show that Nomoto's method for three-body nonresonant
capture processes, which is adopted in the NACRE compilation and many other
studies, is a crude approximation of the accurate quantum three-body model
calculation. We find about 20 orders-of-magnitude enhancement of the
triple-\alpha reaction rate around 10^7 K compared to the rate of NACRE.
