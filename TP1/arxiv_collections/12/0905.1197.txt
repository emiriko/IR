We consider how to measure collective spin states of an atomic ensemble based
on the recent multi-pass approaches for quantum interface between light and
atoms. We find that a scheme with two passages of a light pulse through the
atomic ensemble is efficient to implement the homodyne tomography of the spin
state. Thereby, we propose to utilize optical pulses as a phase-shifter that
rotates the quadrature of the spins. This method substantially simplifies the
geometry of experimental schemes.
