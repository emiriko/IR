The thermochemistry of linear and branched alkanes with up to eight carbons
has been reexamined by means of W4, W3.2lite and W1h theories. `Quasi-W4'
atomization energies have been obtained via isodesmic and hypohomodesmotic
reactions. Our best atomization energies at 0 K (in kcal/mol) are: 1220.04
n-butane, 1497.01 n-pentane, 1774.15 n-hexane, 2051.17 n-heptane, 2328.30
n-octane, 1221.73 isobutane, 1498.27 isopentane, 1501.01 neopentane, 1775.22
isohexane, 1774.61 3-methylpentane, 1775.67 diisopropyl, 1777.27 neohexane,
2052.43 isoheptane, 2054.41 neoheptane, 2330.67 isooctane, and 2330.81
hexamethylethane. Our best estimates for $\Delta H^\circ_{f,298K}$ are: -30.00
n-butane, -34.84 n-pentane, -39.84 n-hexane, -44.74 n-heptane, -49.71 n-octane,
-32.01 isobutane, -36.49 isopentane, -39.69 neopentane, -41.42 isohexane,
-40.72 3-methylpentane, -42.08 diisopropyl, -43.77 neohexane, -46.43
isoheptane, -48.84 neoheptane, -53.29 isooctane, and -53.68 hexamethylethane.
These are in excellent agreement (typically better than 1 kJ/mol) with the
experimental heats of formation at 298 K obtained from the CCCBDB and/or NIST
Chemistry WebBook databases. However, at 0 K a large discrepancy between theory
and experiment (1.1 kcal/mol) is observed for only neopentane. This deviation
is mainly due to the erroneous heat content function for neopentane used in
calculating the 0 K CCCBDB value. The thermochemistry of these systems,
especially of the larger alkanes, is an extremely difficult test for density
functional methods. A posteriori corrections for dispersion are essential.
Particularly for the atomization energies, the B2GP-PLYP and B2K-PLYP
double-hybrids, and the PW6B95 hybrid-meta GGA clearly outperform other DFT
functionals.
