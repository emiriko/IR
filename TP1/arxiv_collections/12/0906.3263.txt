We review an approach, developed over the past few years, to describe
hadronic matter at finite density and temperature, whose underlying theoretical
framework is the Skyrme model, an effective low energy theory rooted in large
$N_c$ QCD. In this approach matter is described by various crystal structures
of skyrmions, classical topological solitons carrying baryon number, from which
conventional baryons appear by quantization. Chiral and scale symmetries play a
crucial role in the dynamics as described by pion, dilaton and vector meson
degrees of freedom. When compressed or heated skyrmion matter describes a rich
phase diagram which has strong connections with the confinement/deconfinement
phase transition.
