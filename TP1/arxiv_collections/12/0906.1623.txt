We present MONTAGE, a post-processing nucleosynthesis code that combines a
traditional network for isotopes lighter than calcium with a rapid algorithm
for calculating the s-process nucleosynthesis of the heavier isotopes. The
separation of those parts of the network where only neutron-capture and
beta-decay reactions are significant provides a substantial advantage in
computational efficiency. We present the yields for a complete set of s-process
isotopes for a 3 Mo, Z = 0.02 stellar model, as a demonstration of the utility
of the approach. Future work will include a large grid of models suitable for
use in calculations of Galactic chemical evolution.
