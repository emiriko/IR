We calculate the ground state energy of cold and dense spin polarized quark
matter with corrections due to correlation energy $(E_{corr})$. Expressions for
$E_{corr}$ both in the non-relativistic and ultra-relativistic regimes have
been derived and compared with the exchange and kinetic term present in the
perturbation series. It is observed that the inclusion of correlation energy
does not rule out the possibility of the ferromagnetic phase transition at low
density within the model proposed by Tatsumi\cite{tatsumi00}. We also derive
the spin stiffness constant in the high density limit of such a spin polarized
matter.
