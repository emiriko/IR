We derive the generalized Green-Kubo relation and an integral form of the
fluctuation theorem that apply to uniformly sheared granular systems in which
microscopic time-reversal symmetry is broken. The former relation provides an
exact representation of nonequilibrium steady-state properties as the integral
of the time-correlation function describing transient dynamics from an initial
quiescent towards a final sheared steady state. We also investigate
implications of the integral fluctuation theorem on the approach towards the
steady state and on the possible form of the steady-state distribution function
in terms of the excess thermodynamic function.
