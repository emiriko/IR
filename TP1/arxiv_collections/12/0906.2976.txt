Saturation models -- colour glass condensate and string percolation -- impose
a strict relation between the average transverse momentum, <P_T>, and the
rapidity particle densities, dn/dy. By combining this relation with an
appropriate evolution equation for dn/dy, and imposing energy-momentum
conservation, we obtain a fair description of data, for generic AB collisions
(hadron-hadron, hadron-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus) at all rapidities and
(high) energies. Predictions are given for the LHC.
