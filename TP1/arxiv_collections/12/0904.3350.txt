Generalizing the notion of Newton polytope, we define the Newton-Okounkov
body, respectively, for semigroups of integral points, graded algebras, and
linear series on varieties. We prove that any semigroup in the lattice Z^n is
asymptotically approximated by the semigroup of all the points in a sublattice
and lying in a convex cone. Applying this we obtain several results: we show
that for a large class of graded algebras, the Hilbert functions have
polynomial growth and their growth coefficients satisfy a Brunn-Minkowski type
inequality. We prove analogues of Fujita approximation theorem for semigroups
of integral points and graded algebras, which imply a generalization of this
theorem for arbitrary linear series. Applications to intersection theory
include a far-reaching generalization of the Kushnirenko theorem (from Newton
polytope theory) and a new version of the Hodge inequality. We also give
elementary proofs of the Alexandrov-Fenchel inequality in convex geometry and
its analogue in algebraic geometry.
