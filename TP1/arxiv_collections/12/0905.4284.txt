We show that it is possible to formulate the classical Einstein-Maxwell-Dirac
theory of spinors interacting with the gravitational and electromagnetic fields
as the Einstein-Cartan-Kibble-Sciama theory with the Ricci scalar of the
traceless torsion, describing gravity, and the torsion trace acting as the
electromagnetic potential.
