We experimentally investigate the extraordinary optical transmission of
doughnut light through a bull's eye structure. Since the intensity is vanished
in the center of the beam, almost all the energy reaches the circular
corrugations (not on the hole), excite surface plasmons which propagate through
the hole and reradiate photons. The transmitted energy is about 57 times of the
input energy on the hole area. It is also interesting that the transmitted
light has a similar spatial shape with the input light although the diameter of
the hole is much smaller than the wavelength of light.
