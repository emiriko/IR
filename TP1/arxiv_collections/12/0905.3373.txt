We apply quantum control techniques to control a large spin chain by only
acting on two qubits at one of its ends, thereby implementing universal quantum
computation by a combination of quantum gates on the latter and swap operations
across the chain. It is shown that the control sequences can be computed and
implemented efficiently. We discuss the application of these ideas to physical
systems such as superconducting qubits in which full control of long chains is
challenging.
