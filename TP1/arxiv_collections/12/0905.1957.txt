A new surface treatment technique for niobium (Nb) Superconducting Radio
Frequency (SRF) cavities called Buffered Electropolishing (BEP) has been
developed at JLab. It was found that BEP could produce the smoothest surface
finish on Nb samples ever reported in the literature. Experimental results
revealed that the Nb removal rate of BEP could reach as high as 4.09 um/min.
This is significantly faster1 than that of the conventional electropolishing
technique employing an acid mixture of HF and H2SO4. An investigation is
underway to determine the optimum values for all relevant BEP parameters so
that the high quality of surface finish achieved on samples can be realized
within the geometry of an elliptical RF cavity. Toward this end, single cell Nb
cavities are being electropolished with BEP electrolyte at both CEA-Saclay and
JLAB. These cavities will be RF tested and the results will be reported through
this presentation.
