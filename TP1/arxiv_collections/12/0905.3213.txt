We present a model to describe complex phases observed at mesoscopic scales
in ultrathin magnetic films. The model is based on the interaction between
dipolar as well as quadrupolar magnetic moments. In the special case of strong
perpendicular crystal anisotropy, we show that quadrupolar degrees of freedom
associated with orientation of domain walls are essential in order to correctly
describe the observed phenomenology of domain formation. A nematic phase
characterized by orientational order of domain walls (stripe-like) but without
translational order is predicted. This isotropic-nematic transition belongs to
the Kosterlitz-Thouless type in the thermodynamic limit. However, we found that
in actual experimental scales, the fluctuations of the nematic order parameter
are regularized by the sample size, and orientational long range order, as
predicted by mean field, should be observable. The transition may be completely
characterized experimentally from measurements of the magnetic structure factor
as well as from the non-linear in-plane magnetic susceptibility.
