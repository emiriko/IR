This paper describes a 50 MHz system being developed for GMRT to provide
imaging capability in the frequency range 30-90MHz. Due to its larger
collecting area and higher antenna efficiency, the low frequency GMRT system
will be several times more sensitive than the present 74 MHz VLA system and is
likely to remain a competitive instrument in this frequency band. In the first
phase of this project, receiver systems consisting of V-dipole feeds and
front-ends have been installed on four of the thirty GMRT antennas. Test
observations were carried out on a number of bright 3C sources. The initial
results are encouraging. This paper will also describe results of simultaneous
observations carried out using the existing GMRT correlator, the new GMRT
software correlator and a system employing digitization and direct recording of
signals at two antenna bases.
