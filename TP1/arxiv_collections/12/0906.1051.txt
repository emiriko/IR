We propose a new monotonically convergent algorithm which can enforce
spectral constraints on the control field (and extends to arbitrary filters).
The procedure differs from standard algorithms in that at each iteration the
control field is taken as a linear combination of the control field (computed
by the standard algorithm) and the filtered field. The parameter of the linear
combination is chosen to respect the monotonic behavior of the algorithm and to
be as close to the filtered field as possible. We test the efficiency of this
method on molecular alignment. Using band-pass filters, we show how to select
particular rotational transitions to reach high alignment efficiency. We also
consider spectral constraints corresponding to experimental conditions using
pulse shaping techniques. We determine an optimal solution that could be
implemented experimentally with this technique.
