We calculate the first passage time distribution for diffusion through a
cylindrical pore with sticky walls. A particle diffusively explores the
interior of the pore through a series of binding and unbinding events with the
cylinder wall. Through a diagrammatic expansion we obtain first passage time
statistics for the particle's exit from the pore. Connections between the model
and nucleocytoplasmic transport in cells are discussed.
