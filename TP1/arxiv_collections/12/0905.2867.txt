We present an approximate analytic solution of the Klein-Gordon equation in
the presence of equal scalar and vector generalized deformed hyperbolic
potential functions by means of parameteric generalization of the
Nikiforov-Uvarov method. We obtain the approximate bound state
rotational-vibrational (ro-vibrational) energy levels and the corresponding
normalized wave functions expressed in terms of the Jacobi polynomial for a
spin-zero particle in a closed form. Special cases are studied including the
non-relativistic solutions obtained by appropriate choice of parameters and
also the s-wave solutions.
