If we find a light Higgs boson at the LHC, there should be many observable
channels which we can exploit to measure the relevant parameters in the Higgs
sector. We use the SFitter framework to map these measurements on the parameter
space of a general weak-scale effective theory with a light Higgs state of mass
120 GeV. Our analysis benefits from the parameter determination tools and the
error treatment used in new--physics searches, to study individual parameters
and their error bars as well as parameter correlations.
