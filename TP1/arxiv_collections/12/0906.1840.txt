We study the diameter of $C_1$, the largest component of the
Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph $G(n,p)$ in the emerging supercritical phase,
i.e., for $p = \frac{1+\epsilon}n$ where $\epsilon^3 n \to \infty$ and
$\epsilon=o(1)$. This parameter was extensively studied for fixed $\epsilon >
0$, yet results for $\epsilon=o(1)$ outside the critical window were only
obtained very recently. Prior to this work, Riordan and Wormald gave precise
estimates on the diameter, however these did not cover the entire supercritical
regime (namely, when $\epsilon^3 n\to\infty$ arbitrarily slowly). {\L}uczak and
Seierstad estimated its order throughout this regime, yet their upper and lower
bounds differed by a factor of $1000/7$.
  We show that throughout the emerging supercritical phase, i.e. for any
$\epsilon=o(1)$ with $\epsilon^3 n \to \infty$, the diameter of $C_1$ is with
high probability asymptotic to $D(\epsilon,n)=(3/\epsilon)\log(\epsilon^3 n)$.
This constitutes the first proof of the asymptotics of the diameter valid
throughout this phase. The proof relies on a recent structure result for the
supercritical giant component, which reduces the problem of estimating
distances between its vertices to the study of passage times in first-passage
percolation. The main advantage of our method is its flexibility. It also
implies that in the emerging supercritical phase the diameter of the 2-core of
$C_1$ is w.h.p. asymptotic to $(2/3)D(\epsilon,n)$, and the maximal distance in
$C_1$ between any pair of kernel vertices is w.h.p. asymptotic to
$(5/9)D(\epsilon,n)$.
