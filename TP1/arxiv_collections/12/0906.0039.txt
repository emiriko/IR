We propose a spintronic device to generate spin polarization in a mesoscopic
region by purely electric means. We show that the spin Hall effect in
combination with the stirring effect are sufficient to induce measurable spin
polarization in a closed geometry. Our device structure does not require the
application of magnetic fields, external radiation or ferromagnetic leads, and
can be implemented in standard semiconducting materials.
