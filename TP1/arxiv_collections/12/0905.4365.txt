We present computations of nucleosynthesis in red giants and asymptotic giant
branch stars of Population I experiencing extended mixing. The assumed physical
cause for mass transport is the buoyancy of magnetized structures, according to
recent suggestions. The peculiar property of such a mechanism is to allow for
both fast and slow mixing phenomena, as required for reproducing the spread in
Li abundances displayed by red giants and as discussed in an accompanying
paper. We explore here the effects of this kind of mass transport on CNO and
intermediatemass nuclei and compare the results with the available evidence
from evolved red giants and from the isotopic composition of presolar grains of
AGB origin. It is found that a good general accord exists between predictions
and measurements; in this framework we also show which type of observational
data best constrains the various parameters. We conclude that magnetic
buoyancy, allowing for mixing at rather different speeds, can be an interesting
scenario to explore for explaining together the abundances of CNO nuclei and of
Li.
