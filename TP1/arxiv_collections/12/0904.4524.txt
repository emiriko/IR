We study slow dynamics of particles moving in a matrix of immobile obstacles
using molecular dynamics simulations. The glass transition point decreases
drastically as the obstacle density increases. At higher obstacle densities,
the dynamics of mobile particles changes qualitatively from glass-like to a
Lorentz-gas-like relaxation. This crossover is studied by density correlation
functions, nonergodic parameters, mean square displacement, and nonlinear
dynamic susceptibility. Our finding is qualitatively consistent with the
results of recent numerical and theoretical studies on various spatially
heterogeneous systems. Furthermore, we show that slow dynamics is surprisingly
rich and sensitive to obstacle configurations. Especially, the reentrant
transition is observed for a particular configuration, although its origin is
not directly linked to the similar prediction based on mode-coupling theory.
