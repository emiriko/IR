We describe a model of inelastic and elastic collisional dynamics of atoms in
an optical dipole trap that utilizes numerical evaluation of statistical
mechanical quantities and numerical solution of equations for the evolution of
number and temperature of trapped atoms. It can be used for traps that possess
little spatial symmetry and when the ratio of trap depth to sample temperature
is relatively small. We compare simulation results with experiments on
$^{88}$Sr and $^{84}$Sr, which have well-characterized collisional properties.
