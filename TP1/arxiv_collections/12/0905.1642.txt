We present a randomized algorithm that on input a finite field $K$ with $q$
elements and a positive integer $d$ outputs a degree $d$ irreducible polynomial
in $K[x]$. The running time is $d^{1+\epsilon(d)} \times (\log
q)^{5+\epsilon(q)}$ elementary operations. The function $\epsilon$ in this
expression is a real positive function belonging to the class $o(1)$,
especially, the complexity is quasi-linear in the degree $d$.
  Once given such an irreducible polynomial of degree $d$, we can compute
random irreducible polynomials of degree $d$ at the expense of
$d^{1+\epsilon(d)} \times (\log q)^{1+\epsilon(q)}$ elementary operations only.
