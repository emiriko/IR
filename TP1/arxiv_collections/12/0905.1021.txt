An overview of selected experimental results in the field of
$D^0$-$\bar{D}^0$ oscillations is presented. The average results for the mixing
parameters, $x=(0.89\pm{0.26\atop 0.27})%$ and $y=(0.75\pm{0.17\atop 0.18})%$,
exclude the no-mixing hypothesis at the level of 6.7 standard deviations. No
sign of CP violation in the $D^0$ system is observed. The measurements impose
constraints on the parameter space of many New Physics models.
