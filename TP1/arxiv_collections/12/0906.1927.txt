The effects of a zero-range tensor component of the effective interaction on
nuclear response functions are determined in the so-called RPA approach.
Explicit formula in the case of symmetric homogeneous isotropic nuclear matter
are given for each spin-isospin excitation channel. It is shown for a typical
interaction with tensor couplings that the effects are quantitatively
important, mainly in vector channels.
