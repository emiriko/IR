I review the recent progress in lattice QCD, which will be useful in heavy
quark physics in the near future. Reviewing the theoretical developments in
lattice QCD first, I focus our recent unquenched QCD with dynamical overlap
fermion as implemented by JLQCD collaboration. I also introduce some of our
recent studies on the B^*B\pi coupling and on the determination of |V_{ub}|
through the dispersive bound.
