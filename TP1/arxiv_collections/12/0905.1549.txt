Models of relativistic rotating neutron star composed of hyperon rich matter
is constructed in the framework of an effective field theory in the mean-field
approach. The gross properties of compact star is calculated at both static and
the mass-shedding limit in the axially symmetric basis. The effect of
appearance and abundance of hyperons on equation of state of dense matter and
stellar properties is lineated with particular emphasis on the underlying
nuclear interactions. We find that the models can explain fast rotations, which
supports the existence of millisecond pulsars. An important offshoot of the
present investigation is that, irrespective of the model parameters and
interaction taken, the star seems to sustain faster rotations (an increase in
rotational frequency up to $\approx$ 50%) without any further deformation.
