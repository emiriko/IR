The UT{\it{fit}} Collaboration has produced several analyses in the context
of flavour physics both within and beyond the Standard Model. In this paper we
present updated results for the Standard Model analysis of the Unitarity
Triangle using the latest experimental and lattice QCD inputs, as well as an
update of the Unitarity Triangle analysis in a scenario beyond the Standard
Model. Combining all available experimental and theoretical information on
$\Delta F=2$ processes and using a model-independent parameterization, we
extract the allowed New Physics contributions in the $K^0$, $D^0$, $B_d$, and
$B_s$ sectors. We observe a departure of the $B_s$ mixing phase from the
Standard Model expectation with a significance of about $3\sigma$.
