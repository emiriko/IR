A black hole casts a shadow as an optical appearance because of its strong
gravitational field. We study how to determine the spin parameter and the
inclination angle by observing the apparent shape of the shadow, which is
distorted mainly by those two parameters. Defining some observables
characterizing the apparent shape (its radius and distortion parameter), we
find that the spin parameter and inclination angle of a Kerr black hole can be
determined by the observation. This technique is also extended to the case of a
Kerr naked singularity.
