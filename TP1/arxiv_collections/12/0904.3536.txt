This study focuses on the automatic generation by the software EXGAS of
kinetic models for the oxidation of large methyl esters using a single set of
kinetic parameters. The obtained models allow to well reproduce the oxidation
of n-decane / methyl palmitate mixture in a jet-stirred reactor. This paper
also presents the construction and a comparison of models for methyl esters
from C7 up to C17 in terms f conversion in a jet-stirred reactor and of
ignition delay time in a shock tube. This comparison study showed that methyl
esters larger than methyl octanoate behave similarly and have very close
reactivities.
