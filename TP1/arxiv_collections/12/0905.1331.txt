Imagine to discover a new fourth family of leptons at the Large Hadron
Collider (LHC) but no signs of an associated fourth family of quarks. What
would that imply? An intriguing possibility is that the new fermions needed to
compensate for the new leptons gauge anomalies simultaneously address the big
hierarchy problem of the Standard Model. A natural way to accomplish such a
scenario is to have the Higgs itself be composite of these new fermions. This
is the setup we are going to investigate in this paper using as a template
Minimal Walking Technicolor. We analyze a general heavy neutrino mass structure
with and without mixing with the Standard Model families. We also analyze the
LHC potential to observe the fourth lepton family in tandem with the new
composite Higgs dynamics. We finally introduce a model uniting the fourth
lepton family and the technifermion sector at higher energies.
