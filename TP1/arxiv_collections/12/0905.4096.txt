Three measures of clumpiness of complex networks are introduced. The measures
quantify how most central nodes of a network are clumped together. The
assortativity coefficient defined in a previous study measures a similar
characteristic, but accounts only for the clumpiness of the central nodes that
are directly connected to each other. The clumpiness coefficient defined in the
present paper also takes into account the cases where central nodes are
separated by a few links. The definition is based on the node degrees and the
distances between pairs of nodes. The clumpiness coefficient together with the
assortativity coefficient can define four classes of network. Numerical
calculations demonstrate that the classification scheme successfully
categorizes 30 real-world networks into the four classes: clumped assortative,
clumped disassortative, loose assortative and loose disassortative networks.
The clumpiness coefficient also differentiates the Erdos-Renyi model from the
Barabasi-Albert model, which the assortativity coefficient could not
differentiate. In addition, the bounds of the clumpiness coefficient as well as
the relationships between the three measures of clumpiness are discussed.
