We present a systematic survey for satellites of Venus using the
Baade-Magellan 6.5 meter telescope and IMACS wide-field CCD imager at Las
Campanas observatory in Chile. In the outer portions of the Hill sphere the
search was sensitive to a limiting red magnitude of about 20.4, which
corresponds to satellites with radii of a few hundred meters when assuming an
albedo of 0.1. In the very inner portions of the Hill sphere scattered light
from Venus limited the detection to satellites of about a kilometer or larger.
Although several main belt asteroids were found, no satellites (moons) of Venus
were detected.
