A new infinite family of examples of finite non-bicolorable configurations of
rays in Hilbert space is described. Such configurations appear in the analysis
of quantum mechanics in terms of Bell's inequalities and Kochen-Specker theorem
and illustrate that there is no measurable space in the background of the
probability model of a quantum system. The mentioned examples are naturally
parametrized by a positive integer divisible by four and by several
complex-valued parameters, whose number depends on this integer. In order to
compare two configurations with the same number of rays, a notion of
deformation of a configuration is introduced. The constructed examples are then
interpreted as obtained by way of deformations.
