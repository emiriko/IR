We study Horava-Lifshitz gravity in the presence of a scalar field. When the
detailed balance condition is implemented, a new term in the gravitational
sector is added in order to maintain ultraviolet stability. The
four-dimensional theory is of a scalar-tensor type with a positive cosmological
constant and gravity is nonminimally coupled with the scalar and its gradient
terms. The scalar field has a double-well potential and, if required to play
the role of the inflation, can produce a scale-invariant spectrum. The total
action is rather complicated and there is no analog of the Einstein frame where
Lorentz invariance is recovered in the infrared. For these reasons it may be
necessary to abandon detailed balance. We comment on open problems and future
directions in anisotropic critical models of gravity.
