We develop a 5d model for ElectroWeak physics based on a non compact warped
extra dimension of finite length, known as the soft wall scenario, where all
the dynamical degrees of freedom propagate in the 5d bulk. We solve the
equations of motion and find the allowed spectra, showing that the mass of the
lightest fermionic mode behaves as a power law of the effective 4d Yukawa
coupling constant, with the exponent being the corresponding fermionic 5d bulk
mass. Precisely this non universal behavior allows us to reproduce the
hierarchy between the Standard Model (SM) fermion masses (from neutrinos to the
top quark) with non-hierarchical fermionic bulk masses.
