The origin of the Moreton wave observed in the chromosphere and the EIT wave
observed in the corona during the eruption remains being an active research
subject for a while. We investigate numerically in this work the evolutionary
features of the magnetic configuration that includes a current-carrying flux
rope, which is used to model the filament, after the loss of equilibrium in the
system takes place in a catastrophic fashion. Rapid motions of the flux rope
following the catastrophe invokes the velocity vortices behind the rope, and
may invoke as well slow and fast mode shocks in front of the rope. The velocity
vortices at each side of the flux rope propagate roughly horizontally away from
the area where it is produced, and both shocks expand toward the flank of the
flux rope. The fast one may eventually reach the bottom boundary and produces
two echoes moving back into the corona, but the slow one and the vortices
totally decay somewhere in the lower corona before arriving the bottom
boundary. The interaction of the fast shock with the boundary leads to
disturbance that accounts for the Moreton wave observed in Halpha, and the
disturbance in the corona caused by the slow shock and the velocity vortices
should account for the EIT wave whose speed is about 40% that of the Moreton
wave. Implication of these results to the observed correlation of the type II
radio burst to the fast and the slow mode shocks, and that of EIT waves to CMEs
and flares have also been discussed.
