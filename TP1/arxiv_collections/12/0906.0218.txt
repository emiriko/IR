Geometrically frustrated magnetic molecules have attracted a lot of interest
in the field of molecular magnetism as well as frustrated Heisenberg
antiferromagnets. In this article we demonstrate how an approximate
diagonalization scheme can be used in order to obtain thermodynamic and
spectroscopic information about frustrated magnetic molecules. To this end we
theoretically investigate an antiferromagnetically coupled spin system with
cuboctahedral structure modeled by an isotropic Heisenberg Hamiltonian.
