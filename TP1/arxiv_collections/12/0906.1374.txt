We consider distributions on a closed compact manifold $M$ as maps on
smoothing operators. Thus spaces of certain maps between $\Psi^{-\infty}(M)\to
\mathcal{C}^{\infty}(M)$ are considered as generalized functions. For any
collection of regularizing processes we produce an algebra of generalized
functions and a diffeomorphism equivariant embedding of distributions into this
algebra. We provide examples invariant under certain group actions. The
regularity for such generalized functions is provided in terms of a certain
tameness of maps between graded Frech\'et spaces. This notion of regularity
implies the regularity in Colombeau algebras in the $\maG^{\infty}$ sense.
