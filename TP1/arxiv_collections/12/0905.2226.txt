J. W. Moffat and V. T. Toth submitted recently a comment (arXiv:0903.5291) on
our latest paper "Modified scalar-tensor-vector gravity theory and the
constraint on its parameters" [Deng, et al., Phys. Rev. D 79, 044014 (2009);
arXiv:0901.3730 ]. We reply to each of their comments and justify our work and
conclusions. Especially, their general STVG (MOG) theory has to be modified to
fit the modern precision experiments.
