The lightest neutral scalar in the Inert Higgs Doublet Model is a natural
candidate for WIMP dark matter. In this paper, we analyzed the dark matter
relic density in the Inert Higgs Doublet model. Various theoretical and
experimental constraints are taken into account. We found that there are five
distinctive regions that could provide the right amount of the relic density in
the Universe. Four out of those five regions have a light particle spectrum
which could be studied at the Large Hadron Collider.
