An approach is proposed which allows to self-consistently calculate the
structural and thermodynamic properties of highly charged aqueous colloidal
suspensions. The method is based on the renormalized Jellium model with the
background charge distribution related to the colloid-colloid correlation
function. The theory is used to calculate the correlation functions and the
effective colloidal charges for suspension containing additional monovalent
electrolyte. The predictions of the theory are in excellent agreement with the
Monte Carlo simulations.
