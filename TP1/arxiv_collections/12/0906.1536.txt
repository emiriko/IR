The short pulse equation (SPE) is considered as an initial-boundary value
problem. It is found that the solutions of the SPE must satisfy an integral
relation otherwise the temporal derivative exhibits discontinuities. This
integral relation is not necessary for a solution to exist. An infinite number
of such constraints can be dynamically generated by the evolution equation.
