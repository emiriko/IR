Quantum phase slippage (QPS) in a superconducting nanowire is a new candidate
for developing a quantum bit. It has also been theoretically predicted that the
occurrence of QPS significantly changes the current-phase relationship (CPR) of
the wire due to the tunneling between topologically different metastable
states. We present studies on the microwave response of the superconducting
nanowires to reveal their CPRs. First, we demonstrate a simple nanowire
fabrication technique, based on commercially available adhesive tapes, which
allows making thin superconducting wire from different metals. We compare the
resistance vs. temperature curves of Mo$_{76}$Ge$_{24}$ and Al nanowires to the
classical and quantum models of phase slips. In order to describe the
experimentally observed microwave responses of these nanowires, we use the
McCumber-Stewart model, which is generalized to include either classical or
quantum CPR.
