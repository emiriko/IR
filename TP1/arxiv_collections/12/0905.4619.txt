The proton spin puzzle has challenged our understanding of QCD for the last
20 years. New measurements of polarized glue, valence and sea quark
polarization, including strange quark polarization, are available. What is new
and exciting in the data, and what might this tell us about the structure of
the proton ? The proton spin puzzle seems to be telling us about the interplay
of valence quarks with the complex vacuum structure of QCD.
