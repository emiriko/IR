A proposal for applying non-adiabatic geometric phases to quantum computing,
called the double-loop method [S.-L. Zhu and Z. D. Wang, Phys. Rev. A {\bf 67},
022319 (2003)], is demonstrated in a liquid state NMR quantum computer. Using a
spin echo technique, the original method is modified so that quantum gates are
implemented in a standard high-precision NMR system for chemical analysis. We
show that the dynamical phase is successfully eliminated and a one-qubit
quantum gate is realized, although the fidelity is not so high.
