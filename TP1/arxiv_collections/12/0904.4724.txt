We present a measurement of the B0 --> Lambda-bar p pi- branching fraction
performed using the BaBar detector at the PEP-II asymmetric e+e- collider.
Based on a sample of 467 million BB-bar pairs we measure B(B0 --> Lambda-bar p
pi-) = [3.07 pm 0.31 (stat.) pm 0.23 (syst.)] x 10^{-6}. The measured
differential spectrum as a function of the dibaryon invariant mass m(Lambda p)
shows a near-threshold enhancement similar to that observed in other baryonic B
decays. We study the Lambda-bar polarization as a function of Lambda-bar energy
in the B0 rest frame (E*_Lambda) and compare it with theoretical expectations
of fully longitudinally right-polarized Lambda-bar at large E*_Lambda.
