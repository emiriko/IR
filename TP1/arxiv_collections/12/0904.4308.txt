We propose an efficient method to realize a large-scale one-way quantum
computer in a two-dimensional (2D) array of coupled cavities, based on coherent
displacements of an arbitrary state of cavity fields in a closed phase space.
Due to the nontrivial geometric phase shifts accumulating only between the
qubits in nearest-neighbor cavities, a large-scale 2D cluster state can be
created within a short time. We discuss the feasibility of our method for scale
solid-state quantum computation
