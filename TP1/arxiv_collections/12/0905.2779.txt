A high-resolution dielectric and calorimetric study of the isotropic (I) to
nematic (N) phase transition of carbon nanotube (CNT) dispersed liquid crystal
(LC) functional composites as a function of CNT concentration is reported. The
evolution of the I-N phase transition, the temperature dependence of local
nematic ordering formed by dispersed CNTs in the LC media and the transition
enthalpy were coherently monitored. Anisotropic CNTs induce local deformation
to the nematic director of LC and form lyotropic pseudo-nematic phase in the LC
media. Results clearly indicate the dramatic impact of dispersed CNTs on both
the isotropic and nematic phases of the composite.
