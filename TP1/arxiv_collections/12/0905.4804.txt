In this article we discuss six degrees of separation, which has been
suggested by Milgram's famous experiment\cite{Milg},\cite{Milg2}, from a
theoretical point of view again. Though Milgram's experiment was partly
inspired to Pool and Kochen's study \cite{Pool} that was made from a
theoretical point of view. At the time numerically detailed study could not be
made because computers and important concepts, such as the clustering
coefficient, needed for a network analysis nowadays, have not yet developed. In
this article we devote deep study to the six degrees of separation based on
some models proposed by Pool and Kochen by using a computer, numerically.
Moreover we estimate the clustering coefficient along the method developed by
us \cite{Toyota1} and extend our analysis of the subject through marrying Pool
and Kochen's models to our method.
