Recent investigations show insertion-deletion systems of small size that are
not complete and cannot generate all recursively enumerable languages. However,
if additional computational distribution mechanisms like P systems are added,
then the computational completeness is achieved in some cases. In this article
we take two insertion-deletion systems that are not computationally complete,
consider them in the framework of P systems and show that the computational
power is strictly increased by proving that any recursively enumerable language
can be generated. At the end some open problems are presented.
