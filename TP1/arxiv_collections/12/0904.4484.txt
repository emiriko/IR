Under a particular choice of the Ernst potential, we solve analytically the
Einstein-Maxwell equations to derive a new exact solution depending on five
parameters: the mass, the angular-momentum (per unit mass), the
electromagnetic-field strength, k, the parameter-p and the Kerr-NUT parameter,
l. This (Petrov Type D) solution is cylindrically-symmetric and represents the
curved background around a charged, rotating cosmic string, surrounded by
gravitational and electromagnetic waves, under the influence of the Kerr-NUT
parameter. A C-energy study in the radiation zone suggests that both the
incoming and the outgoing radiation is gravitational, strongly focused around
the null direction and preserving its profile. In this case, the absence of the
k-parameter from the C-energy implies that, away from the linear defect the
electromagnetic field is too weak to contribute to the energy-content of the
cylindrically-symmetric space-time under consideration. In order to explain
this result, we have evaluated the Weyl and the Maxwell scalars near the axis
of the linear defect and at the spatial infinity. Accordingly, we have found
that the electromagnetic field is concentrated (mainly) in the vicinity of the
axis, while falling-off prominently at large radial distances. However, as long
as k differs from unity, the non-zero Kerr-NUT parameter enhances those
scalars, both near the axis and at the spatial infinity, introducing some sort
of gravitomagnetic contribution.
