We study transport through a triple quantum dot in a triangular geometry with
applied bias such that both singly- and doubly- charged states participate. We
describe the formation of electronic dark states -- coherent superpositions
that block current flow -- in the system, and focus on the formation of a
two-electron dark state. We discuss the conditions under which such a state
forms and describe the signatures that it leaves in transport properties such
as the differential conductance and shotnoise.
