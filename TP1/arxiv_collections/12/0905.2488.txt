In the global fit of the Standard Model using Gfitter, electroweak precision
observables as well as constraints from direct Higgs searches have been
compared with state-of-the-art electroweak predictions. We use the most recent
results for direct Higgs searches at LEP and Tevatron and the latest
measurements of m_t and M_W. Example results are an estimation of the mass of
the Higgs boson (M_H=116.3 +15.6 -1.3 GeV) and a forth-order result for the
strong coupling constant (alpha_S(M_Z^2)=0.1193 +-0.0028(exp) +-0.0001(theo)).
A fit of the oblique parameters (STU) to the electroweak data is performed, in
order to constrain physics beyond the Standard Model. For instance, the
parameter space of the Littlest Higgs Model with T-parity can be restricted via
the oblique parameters. In addition, fit results for a model with an extended
Higgs sector (2HDM) using mainly observables from the B and K physics are
presented.
