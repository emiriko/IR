We study anisotropic cosmology in Ho\v{r}ava's gravity theory and obtain
Kasner type solutions, valid for any number d of spatial dimensions. The
corresponding exponents satisfy two relations, one involving the marginal
coupling \lambda. Also, Ho\v{r}ava's (super)renormalisable theory predicts
(super)stiff matter whose equation of state is p = w \rho with w \ge 1. We
discuss briefly the implications of these results for the nature of
cosmological collapse.
