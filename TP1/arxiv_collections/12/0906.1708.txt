Optical tweezers and AFM cantilevers are often calibrated by fitting their
experimental powerspectra of Brownian motion. We demonstrate here that if this
is done with typical weighted least-squares methods the result is a bias of
relative size between -2/n and +1/n on the value of the fitted diffusion
coefficient. Here n is the number of power-spectra averaged over, so typical
calibrations contain 10-20% bias. Both the sign and the size of the bias
depends on the weighting scheme applied. Hence, so do length-scale calibrations
based on the diffusion coefficient. The fitted value for the characteristic
frequency is not affected by this bias. For the AFM then, force measurements
are not affected provided an independent length-scale calibration is available.
For optical-tweezers there is no such luck, since the spring constant is found
as the ratio of the characteristic frequency and the diffusion coefficient. We
give analytical results for the weight-dependent bias for the wide class of
systems whose dynamics is described by a linear (integro-)differential equation
with additive noise, white or colored. Examples are optical tweezers with
hydrodynamic self-interaction and aliasing, calibration of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
models in finance, models for cell-migration in biology, etc. Because the bias
takes the form of a simple multiplicative factor on the fitted amplitude (e.g.
the diffusion coefficient) it is straightforward to remove, and the user will
need minimal modifications to his or her favorite least-square fitting
programs. Results are demonstrated and illustrated using synthetic data, so we
can compare fits with known true values. We also fit some commonly occurring
power spectra once-and-for-all in the sense that we give their parameter values
and associated error-bars as explicit functions of experimental power-spectral
values.
