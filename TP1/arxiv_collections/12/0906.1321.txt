Working towards an algebra for operators of strongly interacting quantum
fields, a nonassociative decomposition of field operators is proposed. In the
demonstrated case, quantum corrections appear from the possible bracket
permutations. A similarity of these corrections, as compared to corrections
from dimensional transmutation, is considered.
