This article reviews the present status of the technology and instrumentation
for the joint ESA/NASA gravitational wave detector LISA. It briefly describes
the measurement principle and the mission architecture including the resulting
sensitivity before focussing on a description of the main payload items, such
as the interferomtric measurement system, comprising the optical system with
the optical bench and the telescope, the laser system, and the phase
measurement system; and the disturbance reduction system with the inertial
sensor, the charge control system, and the micropropulsion system. The article
touches upon the requirements for the different subsystems that need to be
fulfilled to obtain the overall sensitivity.
