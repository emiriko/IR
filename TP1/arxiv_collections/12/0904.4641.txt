Thanks to their past history on the main sequence phase, supergiant massive
stars develop a convective shell around the helium core. This intermediate
convective zone (ICZ) plays an essential role in governing which g-modes are
excited. Indeed a strong radiative damping occurs in the high density radiative
core but the ICZ acts as a barrier preventing the propagation of some g-modes
into the core. These g-modes can thus be excited in supergiant stars by the
kappa-mechanism in the superficial layers due to the opacity bump of iron, at
log T=5.2. However massive stars are submitted to various complex phenomena
such as rotation, magnetic fields, semiconvection, mass loss, overshooting.
Each of these phenomena exerts a significant effect on the evolution and some
of them could prevent the onset of the convective zone. We develop a numerical
method which allows us to select the reflected, thus the potentially excited,
modes only. We study different cases in order to show that mass loss and
overshooting, in a large enough amount, reduce the extent of the ICZ and are
unfavourable to the excitation of g-modes.
