We reassess the method of the linear delta expansion for the calculation of
effective potentials in superspace, by adopting the improved version of the
super-Feynman rules in the framework of the O'Raifeartaigh model for
spontaneous supersymmetry breaking. The effective potential is calculated using
both the fastest apparent convergence and the principle of minimal sensitivity
criteria and the consistency and efficacy of the method are checked in deriving
the Coleman-Weinberg potential.
