To trace the source of the unique 13, 19.5, and 28 $\mu$m emission features
in the spectra of oxygen-rich circumstellar shells around AGB stars, we have
compared dust extinction spectra obtained by aerosol measurements. We have
measured the extinction spectra for 19 oxide powder samples of eight different
types, such as Ti-compounds (TiO, TiO$_2$, Ti$_2$O$_3$, Ti$_3$O$_5$,
Al$_2$TiO$_5$, CaTiO$_3$), $\alpha$-, $\gamma$-,
$\chi$-$\delta$-$\kappa$-Al$_2$O$_3$, and MgAl$_2$O$_4$ in the infrared region
(10 - 50 $\mu$m) paying special attention to the morphological (size, shape,
and agglomeration) effects and the differences in crystal structure. Anatase
(TiO$_2$) particles with rounded edges are the possible 13, 19.5 and 28 $\mu$m
band carriers as the main contributor in the spectra of AGB stars, and
spherically shaped nano-sized spinel and Al$_2$TiO$_5$ dust grains are possibly
associated with the anatase, enhancing the prominence of the 13 $\mu$m feature
and providing additional features at 28 $\mu$m. The extinction data sets
obtained by the aerosol and CsI pellet measurements have been made available
