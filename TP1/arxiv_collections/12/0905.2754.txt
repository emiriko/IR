To model isotropic homogeneous quantum turbulence in superfluid helium, we
have performed Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) of two fluids (the normal
fluid and the superfluid) coupled by mutual friction. We have found evidence of
strong locking of superfluid and normal fluid along the turbulent cascade, from
the large scale structures where only one fluid is forced down to the vorticity
structures at small scales. We have determined the residual slip velocity
between the two fluids, and, for each fluid, the relative balance of inertial,
viscous and friction forces along the scales. Our calculations show that the
classical relation between energy injection and dissipation scale is not valid
in quantum turbulence, but we have been able to derive a temperature--dependent
superfluid analogous relation. Finally, we discuss our DNS results in terms of
the current understanding of quantum turbulence, including the value of the
effective kinematic viscosity.
