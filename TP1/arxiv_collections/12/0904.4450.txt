If the canonical seesaw mechanism alone is responsible for neutrino mass,
i.e. m_nu = -m_D^2/m_N, it can neither be proved nor disproved at the TeV
energy scale. A new verifiable mechanism of neutrino mass is proposed, using
the "inverse" seesaw, with new physics at the TeV scale, such that m_nu = m_D^2
epsilon_L/m_N^2, where epsilon_L is a two-loop effect. Dark-matter candidates
also appear naturally.
