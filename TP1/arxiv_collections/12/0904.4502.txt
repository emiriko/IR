Previous studies of the host galaxy of Haro 11 have suggested an extreme red
color of V-K=4.2+-0.8 which cannot be reconciled with any normal stellar
population of reasonable metallicity. We present the deepest V and K band data
to date of the blue compact galaxy (BCG) Haro 11 and derive a new V-K color for
the host. Our new data suggest a much more modest value of V-K=2.3+-0.2, which
is in the same range as V-K colors measured for several other BCGs. The new
Haro 11 color is not abnormally red and can be attributed to an old metal-poor
stellar population with a Salpeter initial mass function.
