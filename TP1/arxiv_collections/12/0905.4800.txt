MiMac is a project of micro-TPC matrix of gaseous (He3, CF4) chambers for
direct detection of non-baryonic dark matter. Measurement of both track and
ionization energy will allow the electron-recoil discrimination, while access
to the directionnality of the tracks will open a unique way to distinguish a
geniune WIMP signal from any background. First reconstructed tracks of 5.9 keV
electrons are presented as a proof of concept.
