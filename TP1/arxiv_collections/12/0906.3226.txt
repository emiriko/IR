We extend our approach to incorporate the proton-proton (pp) Coulomb force
into the three-nucleon (3N) Faddeev calculations from elastic proton-deuteron
(pd) scattering to the breakup process. The main new ingredient is a
3-dimensional screened pp Coulomb t-matrix obtained by a numerical solution of
the 3-dimensional Lippmann-Schwinger equation. We demonstrate numerically that
the proton-deuteron breakup observables can be determined from the resulting
on-shell 3N amplitudes increasing the screening radius. However, contrary to
the pd elastic scattering, the screening limit exists only after
renormalisation of the pp t-matrices.
