HESS J0632+057 is one of only two unidentified very-high-energy gamma-ray
sources which appear to be point-like within experimental resolution. It is
possibly associated with the massive Be star MWC 148 and has been suggested to
resemble known TeV binary systems like LS I +61 303 or LS 5039. HESS J0632+057
was observed by VERITAS for 31 hours in 2006, 2008 and 2009. During these
observations, no significant signal in gamma rays with energies above 1 TeV was
detected from the direction of HESS J0632+057. A flux upper limit corresponding
to 1.1% of the flux of the Crab Nebula has been derived from the VERITAS data.
The non-detection by VERITAS excludes with a probability of 99.993% that HESS
J0632+057 is a steady gamma-ray emitter. Contemporaneous X-ray observations
with Swift XRT reveal a factor of 1.8+-0.4 higher flux in the 1-10 keV range
than earlier X-ray observations of HESS J0632+057. The variability in the
gamma-ray and X-ray fluxes supports interpretation of the ob ject as a
gamma-ray emitting binary.
