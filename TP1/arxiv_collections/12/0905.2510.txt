The relationship between fuzzy algebras and semirings is explored with fuzzy
algebra operators replacing the arithmetic operators of semirings. A new class
of fuzzy structures which are similar to semirings is defined. Results of
partial ordering on fuzzy algebras are shown. The zero-sum free property of
semirings on fuzzy structures is shown. The semiring property of homomorphism
is mapped to fuzzy structures and results like order- and operator-preservation
are described.
