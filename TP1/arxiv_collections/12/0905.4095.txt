As a model which displays a picture of the symmetry energy as an energy of
rotation in isospace of a Cooper pair condensate, a Hamiltonian with a pairing
force and an interaction of isospins is analyzed in the Hartree-Bogolyubov (HB)
plus Random Phase (RPA) approximation. The HB energy minus Lagrangian
multiplier terms is shown to be locally minimized by a product of neutron and
proton Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer states. Nambu-Goldstone RPA solutions appear
due to global gauge invariance and isobaric invariance. In an idealized case of
infinitely many equidistant single-nucleon levels, the symmetry energy is
composed of contributions from the single-nucleon and isospin interaction
energies and the RPA correlation energy. The contribution of the latter is
dominated by a neutron-proton Nambu-Goldstone solution, which makes the total
symmetry energy nearly proportional to T(T+1). Observations reported from
Skyrme force calculations are discussed in the light of these results.
Calculations with deformed Woods-Saxon single-nucleon levels give results
similar to those of the idealized case, whereas a somewhat different behavior
is found with spherical Woods-Saxon levels. The calculations with Woods-Saxon
single-nucleon levels reproduce surprisingly well the empirical symmetry
energy.
