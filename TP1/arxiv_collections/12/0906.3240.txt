We present two exact implementations of efficient output-sensitive algorithms
that compute Minkowski sums of two convex polyhedra in 3D. We do not assume
general position. Namely, we handle degenerate input, and produce exact
results. We provide a tight bound on the exact maximum complexity of Minkowski
sums of polytopes in 3D in terms of the number of facets of the summand
polytopes. The algorithms employ variants of a data structure that represents
arrangements embedded on two-dimensional parametric surfaces in 3D, and they
make use of many operations applied to arrangements in these representations.
We have developed software components that support the arrangement
data-structure variants and the operations applied to them. These software
components are generic, as they can be instantiated with any number type.
However, our algorithms require only (exact) rational arithmetic. These
software components together with exact rational-arithmetic enable a robust,
efficient, and elegant implementation of the Minkowski-sum constructions and
the related applications. These software components are provided through a
package of the Computational Geometry Algorithm Library (CGAL) called
Arrangement_on_surface_2. We also present exact implementations of other
applications that exploit arrangements of arcs of great circles embedded on the
sphere. We use them as basic blocks in an exact implementation of an efficient
algorithm that partitions an assembly of polyhedra in 3D with two hands using
infinite translations. This application distinctly shows the importance of
exact computation, as imprecise computation might result with dismissal of
valid partitioning-motions.
