The determination of the supernova (SN) rate is based not only on the number
of detected events, but also on the properties of the parent galaxy population.
This is the first paper of a series aimed at obtaining new, refined, SN rates
from a set of five SN surveys, by making use of a joint analysis of
near-infrared (NIR) data. We describe the properties of the 3838 galaxies that
were monitored for SNe events, including newly determined morphologies and
their DENIS and POSS-II/UKST I, 2MASS and DENIS J and Ks and 2MASS H
magnitudes. We have compared 2MASS, DENIS and POSS-II/UKST IJK magnitudes in
order to find possible systematic photometric shifts in the measurements. The
DENIS and POSS-II/UKST I band magnitudes show large discrepancies (mean
absolute difference of 0.4 mag), mostly due to different spectral responses of
the two instruments, with an important contribution (0.33 mag rms) from the
large uncertainties in the photometric calibration of the POSS-II and UKST
photographic plates. In the other wavebands, the limiting near infrared
magnitude, morphology and inclination of the galaxies are the most influential
factors which affect the determination of photometry of the galaxies.
Nevertheless, no significant systematic differences have been found between of
any pair of NIR magnitude measurements, except for a few percent of galaxies
showing large discrepancies. This allows us to combine DENIS and 2MASS data for
the J and Ks filters.
