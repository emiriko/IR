We address the Gross--Pitaevskii (GP) equation with a periodic linear
potential and a periodic sign-varying nonlinearity coefficient. Contrary to the
claims in the previous works of Abdullaev {\em et al.} [PRE {\bf 77}, 016604
(2008)] and Smerzi & Trombettoni [PRA {\bf 68}, 023613 (2003)], we show that
the intersite cubic nonlinear terms in the discrete nonlinear Schr\"odinger
(DNLS) equation appear beyond the applicability of assumptions of the
tight-binding approximation. Instead of these terms, for an even linear
potential and an odd nonlinearity coefficient, the DNLS equation and other
reduced equations for the semi-infinite gap have the quintic nonlinear term,
which correctly describes bifurcation of gap solitons.
