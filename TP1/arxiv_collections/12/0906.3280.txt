Jet energy loss, photon production and photon-hadron correlations are studied
together at high transverse momentum in relativistic heavy-ion collisions at
RHIC energies. The modification of hard jets traversing a hot and dense nuclear
medium is evaluated by consistently taking into account induced gluon radiation
and elastic collisions. The production of high transverse momentum photons in
Au+Au collisions at RHIC is calculated by incorporating a complete set of
photon-production channels. Comparison with experimental photon production and
photon-hadron correlation data is performed, using a (3+1)-dimensional
relativistic hydrodynamic description of the thermalized medium created in
these collisions. Our results demonstrate that the interaction between the hard
jets and the soft medium is important for the study of photon production and of
photon-hadron correlation at RHIC.
