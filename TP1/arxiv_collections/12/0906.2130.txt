The spin-singlet superconductivity without phonons is examined in
consideration of correlations on an extended Hubbard model. It is shown that
the superconductivity requires not only the total correlation should be strong
enough but also the density of state around Fermi energy should be large
enough, which shows that the high temperature superconductivity could only be
found in the metallic region near the Mott metal insulator transition (MIT).
Other properties of superconductors are also discussed on these conclusions.
