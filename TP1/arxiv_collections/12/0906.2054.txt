The movement of the electrons under the simultaneous influence of a scalar
periodic potential and of a uniform transversal magnetic field is described by
the well-known second order discrete Harper equation. This equation originates
from a two-dimensional energy dispersion law under the minimal substitution.
Here one deals with the Harper model under the additional influence of the
discretized spin orbit interaction. Converting the spin-orbit interaction in
terms of discrete derivatives opens the way for analytical and numerical
studies. One finds coupled equations for the spin dependent wave functions,
which leads to an appreciable alteration of the nested energy subbands
characterizing the self-similar structure of the usual Harper spectrum. To this
aim the transfer matrix method has been applied to selected spin-up and
spin-down wavefunctions. Accordingly, very manifestations of spinfiltering and
of spin correlations are accounted for. Our energy-bands calculations show that
the splitting effect implemented by such wavefunctions is appreciable.
