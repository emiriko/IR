We give an idea and the order-of-magnitude estimations to explain the
recently reported secular increase of the Astronomical Unit (AU) by Krasinsky
and Brumberg (2004). The idea proposed is analogous to the tidal acceleration
in the Earth-Moon system, which is based on the conservation of the total
angular momentum and we apply this scenario to the Sun-planets system. Assuming
the existence of some tidal interactions that transfer the rotational angular
momentum of the Sun and using reported value of the positive secular trend in
the astronomical unit, $\frac{d}{dt}{AU} = 15 \pm 4 {(m/cy)}$, the suggested
change in the period of rotation of the Sun is about $21 {ms/cy}$ in the case
that the orbits of the eight planets have the same "expansion rate." This value
is sufficiently small, and at present it seems there are no observational data
which exclude this possibility. Effects of the change in the Sun's moment of
inertia is also investigated. It is pointed out that the change in the moment
of inertia due to the radiative mass loss by the Sun may be responsible for the
secular increase of AU, if the orbital "expansion" is happening only in the
inner planets system. Although the existence of some tidal interactions is
assumed between the Sun and planets, concrete mechanisms of the angular
momentum transfer are not discussed in this paper, which remain to be done as
future investigations.
