A closed system of equations for the local Bloch vectors and spin correlation
functions of three magnetic qudits, which are in an arbitrary, time-dependent,
external magnetic field, is obtained using decomplexification of the
Liouville-von Neumann equation. The algorithm of the derivation of the dynamic
equations is presented. In the basis convenient for the important physical
applications structure constants of algebra su(2S+1) are calculated.
