We extend previous studies on orbital-selective Mott transitions in the
paramagnetic state of the half-filled degenerate two-band Hubbard model to the
general doped case, using a high-precision quantum Monte Carlo dynamical
mean-field theory solver. For sufficiently strong interactions,
orbital-selective Mott transitions as a function of total band filling are
clearly visible in the band-specific fillings, quasiparticle weights, double
occupancies, and spectra. The results are contrasted with those of single-band
models for similar correlation strengths.
