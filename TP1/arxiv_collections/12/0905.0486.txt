The aim of this paper is two-fold. First, we give a fully geometric
description of the HOMFLYPT homology of Khovanov-Rozansky. Our method is to
construct this invariant in terms of the cohomology of various sheaves on
certain algebraic groups, in the same spirit as the authors' previous work on
Soergel bimodules. All the differentials and gradings which appear in the
construction of HOMFLYPT homology are given a geometric interpretation.
  In fact, with only minor modifications, we can extend this construction to
give a categorification of the colored HOMFLYPT polynomial, colored HOMFLYPT
homology. We show that it is in fact a knot invariant categorifying the colored
HOMFLYPT polynomial and that this coincides with the categorification proposed
by Mackaay, Stosic and Vaz.
