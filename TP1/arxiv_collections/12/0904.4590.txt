The rigorous quantum mechanical definition of a resonance requires
determining the pole position in the second Riemann sheet of the analytically
continued partial wave scattering amplitude in the complex Mandelstam
s-variable plane. For meson resonances we investigate the alternative
Breit-Wigner (BW) definition within the large Nc expansion. By assuming that
the pole position is ${\cal O} (N_C^{0})$ and exploiting unitarity, we show
that the BW determination of the resonance mass differs from the pole position
by ${\cal O} (N_C^{-2})$ terms, which can be extracted from pi-pi scattering
data. For the case of the f0(600) pole, the BW scalar mass is predicted to
occur at about 700 MeV while the true value is located at about 800 MeV.
