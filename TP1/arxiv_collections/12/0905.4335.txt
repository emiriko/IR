This paper discusses the thermodynamics of a black hole with respect to
Hawking radiation and the entropy. We look at a unified picture of black hole
entropy and curvature and how this can lead to the usual black hole luminosity
due to Hawking radiation. It is also shown how the volume inside the horizon,
apart from surface area, can play a role in understanding the Hawking flux. In
addition holography also implies a phase space associated with the interior
volume and this happens to be just a quantum of phase space, filled with just
one photon. Generalised uncertainty principle can be incorporated in this
analysis. These results hold for all black hole masses in any dimensions.
