We propose a scheme for quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol with
dual-rail displaced photon states. Displaced single photon states carry bit
value of code which may be extracted while coherent states carry nothing and
they only provide inconclusive outcome. Developed QKD protocol works with
experimental attendant noise to observe presence of malicious Eve. Pulses with
large amplitudes unlike conventional QKD relying on faint laser pulses are used
that may approximate it to standard telecommunication communication and may
show resistance to eavesdropping even in settings with high attenuation.
Information leakage to the eavesdropper is determined from comparison of output
distribution of the outcomes with ideal one that is defined by two additional
inaccessible to nobody, saving for who sends the pulses, parameters. Robustness
to some possible eavesdropping attacks is shown.
