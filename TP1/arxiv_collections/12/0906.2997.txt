Given a random distribution of impurities on a periodic crystal, an
equivalent uniquely ergodic tiling space is built, made of aperiodic,
repetitive tilings with finite local complexity, and with configurational
entropy close to the entropy of the impurity distribution. The construction is
the tiling analog of the Jewett-Kreger theorem.
