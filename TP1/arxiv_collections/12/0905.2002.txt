A systematic comparison is conducted for pairing properties of finite systems
at nonzero temperature as predicted by the exact solutions of the pairing
problem embedded in three principal statistical ensembles, as well as the
unprojected (FTBCS1+SCQRPA) and Lipkin-Nogami projected (FTLN1+SCQRPA) theories
that include the quasiparticle number fluctuation and coupling to pair
vibrations within the self-consistent quasiparticle random-phase approximation.
The numerical calculations are performed for the pairing gap, total energy,
heat capacity, entropy, and microcanonical temperature within the doubly-folded
equidistant multilevel pairing model. The FTLN1+SCQRPA predictions agree best
with the exact grand-canonical results. In general, all approaches clearly show
that the superfluid-normal phase transition is smoothed out in finite systems.
A novel formula is suggested for extracting the empirical pairing gap in
reasonable agreement with the exact canonical results.
