We analyze various models with an extra U(1) gauge symmetry in addition to
the Standard Model (SM) gauge group at low energies, and impose limits on the
mass of the neutral Z' boson, M_Z', predicted in all such models, and on the
Z-Z' mixing angle, theta_ZZ'. The precision electroweak data strongly constrain
theta_ZZ' to very small values and for most models we find lower limits on M_Z'
of order 1 TeV. In one case we obtain a somewhat better fit than in the SM
(although this is only marginally statistically significant) and here we find a
weak upper limit at the 90% C.L.
