We study theoretically the collective modes of a two-component Fermi gas with
attractive interactions in a quasi-one-dimensional harmonic trap. We focus on
an imbalanced gas in the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) phase. Using a
mean-field theory, we study the response of the ground state to time-dependent
potentials. For potentials with short wavelengths, we find dramatic signatures
in the large-scale response of the gas which are characteristic of the FFLO
phase. This response provides an effective way to detect the FFLO state in
experiments.
