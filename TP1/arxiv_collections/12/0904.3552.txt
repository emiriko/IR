This paper presents various access ways to Internet for home users, both for
those who are low consumers (consumed time online or traffic monthly value), or
large consumers (unlimited connection). The main purpose of the work consists
in making a comparison between the situation of the Internet in Romania and
other countries in Europe such as Hungary (more western than Romania, so a
little more developed, still an Eastern country comparing to the more developed
countries in Western Europe and others well developed such as England, Italy,
France, and to those in development such as Poland, and at the periphery of
Europe such as Ukraine.
