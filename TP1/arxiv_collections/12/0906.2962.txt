A gamma-ray burst (GRB) optical photometric follow-up system at the Xinglong
Observatory of National Astronomical Observatories of China (NAOC) has been
constructed. It uses the 0.8-m Tsinghua-NAOC Telescope (TNT) and the 1-m EST
telescope, and can automatically respond to GRB Coordinates Network
(GCN)alerts. Both telescopes slew relatively fast, being able to point to a new
target field within about 1 min upon a request. Whenever available, the 2.16-m
NAOC telescope is also used. In 2006, the system responded to 15 GRBs and
detected seven early afterglows. In 2007, six GRBs have been detected among 18
follow-up observations. TNT observations of the second most distant GRB 060927
(z=5.5) are shown, which started as early as 91s after the GRB trigger. The
afterglow was detected in the combined image of first 19x20s unfiltered
exposures. This GRB follow-up system has joined the East-Asia GRB Follow-up
Observation Network (EAFON).
