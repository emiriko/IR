We study decaying magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) turbulence stemming from the
evolution of the Taylor-Green (TG) flow generalized recently to MHD, with equal
viscosity and magnetic resistivity and up to equivalent grid resolutions of
2048^3 points. A pseudo-spectral code is used in which the symmetries of the
velocity and magnetic fields have been implemented, allowing for sizable
savings in both computer time and usage of memory at a given Reynolds number.
The flow is non-helical, and at initial time the kinetic and magnetic energies
are taken to be equal and concentrated in the large scales. After testing the
validity of the method on grids of 512^3 points, we analyze the data on the
large grids up to Taylor Reynolds numbers of ~2200. We find that the global
temporal evolution is accelerated in MHD, compared to the corresponding neutral
fluid case. We also observe an interval of time when such configurations have
quasi-constant total dissipation, time during which statistical properties are
determined after averaging over of the order of two turn-over times. A weak
turbulence spectrum obtains which is also given in terms of its anisotropic
components. Finally, we contrast the development of small-scale eddies with two
other initial conditions for the magnetic field and briefly discuss the
structures that develop, and which display a complex array of current and
vorticity sheets with clear rolling-up and folding.
