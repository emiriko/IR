In the hot, dense plasma of solar and stellar interiors, Coulomb potentials
are screened, resulting in increased nuclear reaction rates. Although
Salpeter's approximation for static screening is widely accepted and used in
stellar modeling, the question of screening in nuclear reactions has been
revisited. In particular the issue of dynamic effects has been raised by Shaviv
and Shaviv who apply the techniques of molecular dynamics to the conditions in
the Sun's core in order to numerically determine the effect of screening. By
directly calculating the motion of ions and electrons due to Coulomb
interactions, the simulations are used to compute the effect of screening
without the mean-field assumption inherent in Salpeter's approximation. In this
paper we reproduce their numerical analysis of the screening energy in the
plasma of the solar core and conclude that the effects of dynamic screening are
relevant and should be included when stellar nuclear reaction rates are
computed.
