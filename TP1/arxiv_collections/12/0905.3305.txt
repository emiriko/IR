We report a de Haas-van Alphen effect study of the Fermi surface of CaFe2P2
using low temperature torque magnetometry up to 45 T. This system is a close
structural analogue of the collapsed tetragonal non-magnetic phase of CaFe2As2.
We find the Fermi surface of CaFe2P2 to differ from other related ternary
phosphides in that its topology is highly dispersive in the c-axis, being
three-dimensional in character and with identical mass enhancement on both
electron and hole pockets (~1.5). The dramatic change in topology of the Fermi
surface suggests that in a state with reduced (c/a) ratio, when bonding between
pnictogen layers becomes important, the Fermi surface sheets are unlikely to be
nested.
