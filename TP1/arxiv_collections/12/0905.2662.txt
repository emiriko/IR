This paper is devoted to explore tilted kinematic self-similar solutions of
the the general cylindrical symmetric spacetimes. These solutions are of the
first, zeroth, second and infinite kinds for the perfect fluid and dust cases.
Three different equations of state are used to obtain these solutions. We
obtain a total of five independent solutions. The correspondence of these
solutions with those already available in the literature is also given.
