The first practical method to evolve many-body nuclear forces to softened
form using the Similarity Renormalization Group (SRG) in a harmonic oscillator
basis is demonstrated. When applied to He4 calculations, the two- and
three-body oscillator matrix elements yield rapid convergence of the
ground-state energy with a small net contribution of the induced four-body
force.
