In an attempt to understand why the dominating magnetic field observed in the
von-K\'arm\'an-Sodium (VKS) dynamo experiment is axisymmetric, we investigate
in the present paper the ability of mean field models to generate axisymmetric
eigenmodes in cylindrical geometries. An $\alpha$-effect is added to the
induction equation and we identify reasonable and necessary properties of the
$\alpha$ distribution so that axisymmetric eigenmodes are generated. The
parametric study is done with two different simulation codes. We find that
simple distributions of $\alpha$-effect, either concentrated in the disk
neighbourhood or occupying the bulk of the flow, require unrealistically large
values of the parameter $\alpha$ to explain the VKS observations.
