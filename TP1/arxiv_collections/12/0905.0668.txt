In this paper we deal with the issue of performing accurate small-sample
inference in the Birnbaum-Saunders regression model, which can be useful for
modeling lifetime or reliability data. We derive a Bartlett-type correction for
the score test and numerically compare the corrected test with the usual score
test, the likelihood ratio test and its Bartlett-corrected version. Our
simulation results suggest that the corrected test we propose is more reliable
than the other tests.
