Using archival Chandra and XMM-Newton data on 35 galaxy clusters, we measured
average temperature and metallicity profiles for clusters based separated by
temperature, cooling time, and redshift. Our results show no evidence for
significant changes in the metallicity or temperature profiles with redshift
once these selection effects are taken into account.
