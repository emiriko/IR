We construct the inequivalent irreducible representations (IIR's) of the CPT
groups of the Dirac field operator \hat{\psi} and the electromagnetic quantum
potential \hat{A}_\mu. The results are valid both for free and interacting
(QED) fields. Also, and for the sake of completeness, we construct the IIR's of
the CPT group of the Dirac equation.
