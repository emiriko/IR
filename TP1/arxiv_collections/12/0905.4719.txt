Temperature and ozone volume mixing ratio profiles obtained from the Halogen
  Occultation Experiment (HALOE) aboard the Upper Atmospheric Research
Satellite
  (UARS) over India and over the open ocean to the south during the period
1991-2001 are analyzed to study the characteristic features of the Mesospheric
Inversion Layer (MIL) at 70 to 85 km altitude and its relation with the ozone
mixing ratio at this altitude. We have also analyzed both the number of
lightning flashes measured by the Optical Transient Detector (OTD) onboard the
MicroLab-1 satellite for the period April 1995 - March 2000 and ground-based
thunderstorm data collected from 78 widespread Indian observatories for the
same period to show that the MIL amplitude and thunderstorm activity are
correlated. All the data sets examined exhibit a semiannual variation. The
seasonal variation of MIL amplitude and the frequency of occurrence of the
temperature inversion indicate a fairly good correlation with the seasonal
variation of thunderstorms and the average ozone volume mixing ratio across the
inversion layer. The observed correlation between local thunderstorm activity,
MIL amplitude and mesospheric ozone volume mixing ratio are explained by the
generation, upward propagation and mesospheric absorption of gravity waves
produced by thunderstorms.
