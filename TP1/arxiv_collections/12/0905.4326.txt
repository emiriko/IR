We solve a renormalized Wheeler-DeWitt equation for Einstein gravity in D+1
dimensions with D= odd in the strong coupling limit, which is expected to be
suited to probe quantum geometry at short distances, in order to test Horava's
idea that quantum gravity at short distances will be described by a
nonrelativistic system with dynamical critical exponent z>1. Our results
support the idea and show that the Wheeler-DeWitt equation possesses a solution
associated with a z=2 Lifshitz point but no other z>2 solutions to leading
order of the strong coupling expansion.
