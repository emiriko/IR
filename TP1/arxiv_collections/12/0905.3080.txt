We present a theoretical variational approach, based on the effective mass
approximation (EMA), to study the quantum-confinement Stark effects for
spherical semiconducting quantum dots in the strong confinement regime of
interactive electron-hole pair and limiting weak electric field. The respective
roles of the Coulomb potential and the polarization energy are investigated in
details. Under reasonable physical assumptions, analytical calculations can be
performed. They clearly indicate that the Stark shift is a quadratic function
of the electric field amplitude in the regime of study. The resulting numerical
values are found to be in good agreement with experimental data over a
significant domain of validity.
