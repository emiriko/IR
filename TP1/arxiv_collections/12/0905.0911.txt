We show that the first structures that form in the universe should
spontaneously generate magnetic fields. No primordial seed field is required
for this "first dynamo".
  Although the first dynamo starts with kinetic plasma instabilities, we argue
that an adequate magnetohydrodynamic description might be possible via a simple
trick. This should allow a numerical study of the effect of the first magnetic
fields on the first baryonic objects.
