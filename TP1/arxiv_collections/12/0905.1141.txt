We extend an effective theory framework developped in Refs. [1,2] to sum
electroweak Sudakov logarithms in high energy processes to also include massive
gauge bosons in the final state. The calculations require an additional
regulator on top of dimensional regularization to tame the collinear
singularities. We propose to use the Delta regulator, which respects
soft-collinear factorization.
