We investigate the single top quark production with the exchange of
unparticles through high energy photon-photon collision $\gamma \gamma\to t
\bar c$. The effects of unparticles on the scattering cross sections for
different polarization configurations, and for various values of the scaling
dimension $d, 1<d<2$ are analysed. It is shown that the $(+-)$ polarisation
configuration is more preferable searching for unparticle physics signatures.
