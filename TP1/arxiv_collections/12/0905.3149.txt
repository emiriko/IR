We describe two algorithms for finding representatives of the nilpotent
orbits of a theta-group. The algorithms have been implemented in the computer
algebra system GAP (inside the package SLA). We comment on their performance.
We apply the algorithms to study the nilpotent orbits of theta-groups, where
theta is an N-regular automorphism of a simple Lie algebra of exceptional type.
