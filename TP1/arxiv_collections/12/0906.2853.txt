R. Fehlmann and M. Vuorinen proved in 1988 that Mori's constant $M(n,K)$ for
$K$-quasiconformal maps of the unit ball in $\mathbf{R}^n$ onto itself keeping
the origin fixed satisfies $M(n,K) \to 1$ when $K\to 1 .$ We give here an
alternative proof of this fact, with a quantitative upper bound for the
constant in terms of elementary functions. Our proof is based on a refinement
of a method due to G.D. Anderson and M. K. Vamanamurthy. We also give an
explicit version of the Schwarz lemma for quasiconformal self-maps of the unit
disk. Some experimental results are provided to compare the various bounds for
the Mori constant when $n=2 .$
