We propose a quantum feedback scheme for the preparation and protection of
photon number states of light trapped in a high-Q microwave cavity. A quantum
non-demolition measurement of the cavity field provides information on the
photon number distribution. The feedback loop is closed by injecting into the
cavity a coherent pulse adjusted to increase the probability of the target
photon number. The efficiency and reliability of the closed-loop state
stabilization is assessed by quantum Monte-Carlo simulations. We show that, in
realistic experimental conditions, Fock states are efficiently produced and
protected against decoherence.
