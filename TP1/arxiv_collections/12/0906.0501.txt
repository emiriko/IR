The computational cost of a Monte Carlo algorithm can only be meaningfully
discussed when taking into account the magnitude of the resulting statistical
error. Aiming for a fixed error per particle, we study the scaling behavior of
the diffusion Monte Carlo method for large quantum systems. We identify the
correlation within the population of walkers as the dominant scaling factor for
large systems. While this factor is negligible for small and medium sized
systems that are typically studied, it ultimately shows exponential scaling.
The scaling factor can be estimated straightforwardly for each specific system
and we find that is typically only becomes relevant for systems containing more
than several hundred atoms.
