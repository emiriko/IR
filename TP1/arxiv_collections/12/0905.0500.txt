We present an explanation of recently observed giant magnetic moment and
room-temperature ferromagnetism in the dielectric GaN doped with Gd. Our
approach uses the polarization mechanism of exchange interaction, which occurs
if the d-level of Gd appears in the bandgap close to the valence band edge.
Calculated ferromagnetic critical temperature and the value of the magnetic
moment well correspond to experimental findings.
