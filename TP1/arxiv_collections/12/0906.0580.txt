Fixed-target experiments are ideally suited for discovering new MeV-GeV mass
U(1) gauge bosons through their kinetic mixing with the photon. In this paper,
we identify the production and decay properties of new light gauge bosons that
dictate fixed-target search strategies. We summarize existing limits and
suggest five new experimental approaches that we anticipate can cover most of
the natural parameter space, using currently operating GeV-energy beams and
well-established detection methods. Such experiments are particularly timely in
light of recent terrestrial and astrophysical anomalies (PAMELA, FERMI,
DAMA/LIBRA, etc.) consistent with dark matter charged under a new gauge force.
