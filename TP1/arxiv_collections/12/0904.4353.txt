In the solar atmosphere the twist parameter $\alpha$ has the same sign as
magnetic helicity. It has been observed using photospheric vector magnetograms
that negative/positive helicity is dominant in the northern/southern hemisphere
of the Sun. Chromospheric features show dextral/sinistral dominance in the
northern/southern hemisphere and sigmoids observed in X-rays also have a
dominant sense of reverse-S/forward-S in the northern/southern hemisphere. It
is of interest whether individual features have one-to-one correspondence in
terms of helicity at different atmospheric heights. We use UBF \Halpha images
from the Dunn Solar Telescope (DST) and other \Halpha data from Udaipur Solar
Observatory and Big Bear Solar Observatory. Near-simultaneous vector
magnetograms from the DST are used to establish one-to-one correspondence of
helicity at photospheric and chromospheric heights. We plan to extend this
investigation with more data including coronal intensities.
