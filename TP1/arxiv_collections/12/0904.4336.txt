The study of how to generate high-dimensional quantum states (qudits) is
justified by the advantages that they can bring for the field of quantum
information. However, to have some real practical potential for quantum
communication, these states must be also of simple manipulation. Spatial qudits
states, which are generated by engineering the transverse momentum of the
parametric down-converted photons, have been until now considered of hard
manipulation. Nevertheless, we show in this work a simple technique for
modifying these states. This technique is based on the use of programmable
diffractive optical devices, that can act as spatial light modulators, to
define the Hilbert space of these photons instead of pre-fabricated
multi-slits.
