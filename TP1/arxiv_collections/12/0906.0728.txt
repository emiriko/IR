Recently there has been much interest in the use of single-jet mass and jet
substructure to identify boosted particles decaying hadronically at the LHC. We
develop these ideas to address the challenging case of a neutralino decaying to
three quarks in models with baryonic violation of R-parity. These decays have
previously been found to be swamped by QCD backgrounds. We demonstrate for the
first time that such a decay might be observed directly at the LHC with high
significance, by exploiting characteristics of the scales at which its
composite jet breaks up into subjets.
