The screening effect due to a scanning tunneling microscope tip which is
placed in the vicinity of an interacting quantum wire is considered. With the
help of a bosonization procedure, we are able to determine non perturbatively
the Green's functions of the quantum wire in the presence of both electrostatic
screening by the tip and Coulomb interactions in the wire. In our approach we
justify that the working Hamiltonian of the whole system is quadratic when
$K_c>1/2$ and can be solved by integration over the degrees of freedom of the
tip. Once the Green's functions are known, we calculate the spectral
properties. We show that the spectral function, as well as the tunnel density
of states, is affected by the screening and that the local density of states
strongly deviates from its unscreened value when the tip gets close to the
wire. Moreover, we observe that the spatial extension of the deviation of the
local density of states is related to both the Coulomb interactions parameter
and the screening strength.
