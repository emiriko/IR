In this paper we introduce a general framework for defining the depth of a
sequence with respect to a class of observers. We show that our general
framework captures all depth notions introduced in complexity theory so far. We
review most such notions, show how they are particular cases of our general
depth framework, and review some classical results about the different depth
notions.
