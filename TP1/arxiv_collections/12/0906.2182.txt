A nonclassical light source is used to demonstrate experimentally the
absolute efficiency calibration of a photon-number-resolving detector. The
photon-pair detector calibration method developed by Klyshko for single-photon
detectors is generalized to take advantage of the higher dynamic range and
additional information provided by photon-number-resolving detectors. This
enables the use of brighter twin-beam sources including amplified pulse pumped
sources, which increases the relevant signal and provides measurement
redundancy, making the calibration more robust.
