By studying the autocorrelation function of the optoelectronic feedback
semiconductor laser output we establish that the signatures of time delays can
be erased in systems incorporating modulated feedback time delays. This
property is of importance for the suitability of such laser systems for secure
chaos-based communication systems. We also make the first report on chaos
synchronization in both unidirectionally and bidirectionally coupled multiple
time delay chaotic semiconductor lasers with modulated optoelectronic
feedbacks.
