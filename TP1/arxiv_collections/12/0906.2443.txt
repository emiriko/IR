Hydrogenation from C60 to C60H60 has been studied by unrestricted broken spin
symmetry Hartree-Fock approach implemented in semiempirical codes based on AM1
technique. The calculations were focused on sequential addition of hydrogen
molecules to the fullerene cage following the indication of the cage target
atoms by the highest atomic chemical susceptibility calculated at each step.
The obtained results are analyzed from energetic, symmetry, and the composition
abundance viewpoints.
