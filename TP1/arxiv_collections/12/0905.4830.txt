Space momentum entangled photon pairs are generated from type II parametric
down conversion in a beta barium borate crystal. The correlations in the
positions of photons in the near field and far field planes with regard to the
generating crystal are observed in both transverse dimensions using scanning
fiber probes. The space-momentum correlation is characterized using a
covariance description for a bivariate normal distribution and tested for
non-separability with Mancini's criterion. The role of higher order spatial
modes to observe spatial entanglement between the two photons is discussed.
