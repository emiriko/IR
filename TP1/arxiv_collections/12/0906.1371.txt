We discuss the electronic properties of graphene and graphene nanoribbons
including "pseudo-Rashba" spin-orbit coupling. After summarizing the bulk
properties, we first analyze the scattering behavior close to an infinite mass
and zigzag boundary. For low energies, we observe strong deviations from the
usual spin-conserving behavior at high energies such as reflection acting as
spin polarizer or switch. This results in a spin polarization along the
direction of the boundary due to the appearance of evanescent modes in the case
of non-equilibrium or when there is no coherence between the two one-particle
branches. We then discuss the spin and density distribution of graphene
nanoribbons.
