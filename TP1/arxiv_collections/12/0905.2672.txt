Using Monte Carlo simulations, we study the evolution of contigent
cooperation and ethnocentrism in the one-move game. Interactions and
reproduction among computational agents are simulated on {\it undirected} and
{\it directed} Barab\'asi-Albert (BA) networks. We first replicate the
Hammond-Axelrod model of in-group favoritism on a square lattice and then
generalize this model on {\it undirected} and {\it directed} BA networks for
both asexual and sexual reproduction cases. Our simulations demonstrate that
irrespective of the mode of reproduction, ethnocentric strategy becomes common
even though cooperation is individually costly and mechanisms such as
reciprocity or conformity are absent. Moreover, our results indicate that the
spread of favoritism toward similar others highly depends on the network
topology and the associated heterogeneity of the studied population.
