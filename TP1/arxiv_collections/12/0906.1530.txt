We experimentally generate and characterize a six-photon polarization
entangled state, which is usually called "Psi 6 +". This is realized with a
filtering procedure of triple emissions of entangled photon pairs from a single
source, which does not use any interferometric overlaps. The setup is very
stable and we observe the six-photon state with high fidelity. The observed
state can be used for demonstrations of telecloning and secret sharing
protocols.
