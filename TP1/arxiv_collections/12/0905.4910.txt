Heralded single photons are prepared at a rate of ~100 kHz via conditional
measurements on polarization-nondegenerate biphotons produced in a periodically
poled KTP crystal. The single-photon Fock state is characterized using high
frequency pulsed optical homodyne tomography with a fidelity of (57.6 +- 0.1)%.
The state preparation and detection rates allowed us to perform on-the-fly
alignment of the apparatus based on real-time analysis of the quadrature
measurement statistics.
