Black hole accretion and jet production are areas of intensive study in
astrophysics. Recent work has found a relation between radio luminosity, X-ray
luminosity, and black hole mass. With the assumption that radio and X-ray
luminosity are suitable proxies for jet power and accretion power,
respectively, a broad fundamental connection between accretion and jet
production is implied. In an effort to refine these links and enhance their
power, we have explored the above relations exclusively among black holes with
direct, dynamical mass-measurements. This approach not only eliminates
systematic errors incurred through the use of secondary mass measurements, but
also effectively restricts the range of distances considered to a
volume-limited sample. Further, we have exclusively used archival data from the
Chandra X-ray Observatory to best isolate nuclear sources. We find log(L_R) =
(4.80 +/- 0.24) + (0.78 +/- 0.27) log(M_BH) + (0.67 +/- 0.12) log(L_X), in
broad agreement with prior efforts. Owing to the nature of our sample, the
plane can be turned into an effective mass predictor. When the full sample is
considered, masses are predicted less accurately than with the well-known
M-sigma relation. If obscured AGN are excluded, the plane is potentially a
better predictor than other scaling measures.
