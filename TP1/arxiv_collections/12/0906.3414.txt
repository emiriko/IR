We present results from a search for additional transiting planets in 24
systems already known to contain a transiting planet. We model the transits due
to the known planet in each system and subtract these models from lightcurves
obtained with the SuperWASP survey instruments. These residual lightcurves are
then searched for evidence of additional periodic transit events. Although we
do not find any evidence for additional planets in any of the planetary systems
studied, we are able to characterise our ability to find such planets by means
of Monte Carlo simulations. Artificially generated transit signals
corresponding to planets with a range of sizes and orbital periods were
injected into the SuperWASP photometry and the resulting lightcurves searched
for planets. As a result, the detection efficiency as a function of both the
radius and orbital period of any second planet, is calculated. We determine
that there is a good (> 50 per cent) chance of detecting additional,
Saturn-sized planets in P ~ 10 d orbits around planet-hosting stars that have
several seasons of SuperWASP photometry. Additionally, we confirm previous
evidence of the rotational stellar variability of WASP-10, and refine the
period of rotation. We find that the period of the rotation is 11.91 \pm 0.05
d, and the false alarm probability for this period is extremely low (~
10^{-13}).
