Recently Horava proposed a model for gravity which is described by the
Einstein action in the infrared, but lacks the Lorentz invariance in the
high-energy region where it experiences the anisotropic scaling. We test this
proposal using two condensed matter examples of emergent gravity: acoustic
gravity and gravity emerging in the fermionic systems with Fermi points. We
suggest that quantum hydrodynamics, which together with the quantum gravity is
the non-renormalizable theory, may exhibit the anisotropic scaling in agreement
with the proposal. The Fermi point scenario of emergent general relativity
demonstrates that under general conditions, the infrared Einstein action may be
distorted, i.e. the Horava parameter $\lambda$ is not necessarily equal 1 even
in the low energy limit. The consistent theory requires special hierarchy of
the ultra-violet energy scales and the fine-tuning mechanism for the Newton
constant.
