We calculate the inclusive and diffractive photoproduction of heavy quarks in
proton-proton collisions at Tevatron and LHC energies, where the photon reaches
energies larger than those ones accessible at DESY-HERA. The integrated cross
section and the rapidity distributions for charm and bottom production are
computed within the color dipole picture employing three phenomenological
saturation models based on the Color Glass Condensate formalism. Our results
demonstrate that the experimental analyzes of these reactions is feasible and
that the cross sections are sensitive to the underlying parton dynamics.
