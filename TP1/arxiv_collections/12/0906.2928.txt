In this study, four different techniques are presented. 1 Rectangular
waveguide measurement technique for normal microwave materials microwave
properties such as permeability and permittivity. This technique removed guess
parameter and dispersive effect issues of the old waveguide measurement
techniques. It projects a new route for determination of any microwave
materials magnetic and dielectric properties without using any guesses. 2
Coaxial probe measurement technique for the liquid and biological tissues
dielectric permittivity. This coaxial probe technique has an advantage which is
to attain the highest reflected signal from the coaxial probe tip, so that it
is a fast and very sensitive technique to differentiate lossy materials
dielectric permittivity. This technique could be useful non destructive
detections for tumors in hospital and non destructive detections for chemical
liquids as well. 3 A microstripline measurement technique for oxides microwave
measurement at low frequency spectra where the waveguide technique becomes
robot and cumbersome. 4 A new methodology is presented for the rectangular
waveguide technique to determine microwave metamaterials refractive index,
permeability and permittivity using the rectangular waveguide. In summary, the
presented techniques are capable enough to determine magnetic and non magnetic
solid state materials, liquids, powders and biological tissues microwave
properties from the broad microwave frequencies spectra between 1 GHz to 50
GHz. Lastly, a special ferrites microwave properties are also presented since
the negative refractive index from the insulator ferrite could be an
interesting subject.
