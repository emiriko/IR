We discuss a feedback mechanism between electronic states in a double quantum
dot and the underlying nuclear spin bath. We analyze two pumping cycles for
which this feedback provides a force for the Overhauser fields of the two dots
to either equilibrate or diverge. Which of these effects is favored depends on
the g-factor and Overhauser coupling constant A of the material. The strength
of the effect increases with A/V_x, where V_x is the exchange matrix element,
and also increases as the external magnetic field B_{ext} decreases.
