We extend the massless dipole formalism of Catani and Seymour, as well as its
massive version as developed by Catani, Dittmaier, Seymour and Trocsanyi, to
arbitrary helicity eigenstates of the external partons. We modify the real
radiation subtraction terms only, the primary aim being an improved efficiency
of the numerical Monte Carlo integration of this contribution as part of a
complete next-to-leading order calculation. In consequence, our extension is
only applicable to unpolarized scattering. Upon summation over the helicities
of the emitter pairs, our formulae trivially reduce to their original form. We
implement our extension within the framework of Helac-Phegas, and give some
examples of results pertinent to recent studies of backgrounds for the LHC. The
code is publicly available. Since the integrated dipole contributions do not
require any modifications, we do not discuss them, but they are implemented in
the software.
