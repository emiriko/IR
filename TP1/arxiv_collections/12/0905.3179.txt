Here we report on the VLBI discovery of solar-like extended streamers
anchored on the two weak-line T Tauri stars of the binary system V773 Tau A.
Covering the interbinary distance the 20 stellar radii extended streamers enter
in collision during each stellar rotation with consequent occurrence of
magnetic reconnection. Thermal electrons confined in the streamers become
accelerated to relativistic speeds and emit synchrotron emission in the radio
band making the magnetic streamers "visible" in the VLBI images. This is
different from the solar case where the emission from the streamers is just
scattered photospheric light that would never be observable in distant objects.
Evidence of extended solar-like streamers in T Tauri stars, thought to be fully
convective, or nearly fully convective objects, indicates that the tachoclinal
layer, in this case either not existing at all or buried very deeply, is not
relevant for the formation of such solar-like magnetic structures.
