We propose a simple classical dynamical model of a thermoelectric (or
thermochemical) heat engine based on a pair of ideal gas containers connected
by two unequal scattering channels. The model is solved analytically and it is
shown that a suitable combination of parameters can be chosen such that the
engine operates at Carnot's efficiency.
