Any quantum system interacting with a complex environment undergoes
decoherence. Empty space is filled with vacuum energy due to matter fields in
their ground state and represents an underlying environment that any quantum
particle has to cope with. In particular quantum gravity vacuum fluctuations
should represent a universal source of decoherence. To study this problem we
employ a stochastic approach that models spacetime fluctuations close to the
Planck scale by means of a classical, randomly fluctuating metric (random
gravity framework). We enrich the classical scheme for metric perturbations
over a curved background by also including matter fields and metric conformal
fluctuations. We show in general that a conformally modulated metric induces
dephasing as a result of an effective nonlinear newtonian potential obtained in
the appropriate nonrelativistic limit of a minimally coupled Klein-Gordon
field. The special case of vacuum fluctuations is considered and a quantitative
estimate of the expected effect deduced. Secondly we address the question of
how conformal fluctuations could physically arise. By applying the random
gravity framework we first show that standard GR seems to forbid spontaneous
conformal metric modulations. Finally we argue that a different result follows
within scalar-tensor theories of gravity such as e.g. Brans-Dicke theory. In
this case a conformal modulation of the metric arises naturally as a result of
the fluctuations in the Brans-Dicke field and quantum dephasing of a test
particle is expected to occur. For large negative values of the coupling
parameter the conformal fluctuations may also contribute to alleviate the well
known problem of the large zero point energy due to quantum matter fields.
