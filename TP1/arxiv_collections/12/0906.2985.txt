In this paper, we study the problem of minimizing the first eigenvalue of the
$p-$Laplacian plus a potential with weights, when the potential and the weight
are allowed to vary in the class of rearrangements of a given fixed potential
$V_0$ and weight $g_0$. Our results generalized those obtained in [9] and [5].
