Application of the Hyperspherical Adiabatic expansion to describe three-body
scattering states suffers the problem of a very slow convergence. Contrary to
what happens for bound states, a huge number of hyperradial equations has to be
solved, and even if done, the extraction of the scattering amplitude is
problematic. In this paper we show how to obtain accurate scattering phase
shifts using the Hyperspherical Adiabatic expansion. To this aim two integral
relations, derived from the Kohn Variational Principle, are used. The
convergence of this procedure is as fast as for bound states.
