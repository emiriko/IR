In the present article we determine and characterize completely the support
genus, the binding number and the norm of a page of an open book under the
following restrictions: M is a rational homology sphere which can be realized
as the link of a surface singularity. Moreover, we restrict ourselves to the
collection of those open book decompositions which can be realized as Milnor
fibrations determined by some analytic germ (the so-called Milnor open books).
