We study the vector magnetic field of a filament observed over a compact
Active Region Neutral Line. Spectropolarimetric data acquired with TIP-II (VTT,
Tenerife, Spain) of the 10830 \AA spectral region provide full Stokes vectors
which were analyzed using three different methods: magnetograph analysis,
Milne-Eddington inversions and PCA-based atomic polarization inversions. The
inferred magnetic field strengths in the filament are of the order of 600 - 700
G by all these three methods. Longitudinal fields are found in the range of 100
- 200 G whereas the transverse components become dominant, with fields as large
as 500 - 600 G. We find strong transverse fields near the Neutral Line also at
photospheric levels. Our analysis indicates that strong (higher than 500 G, but
below kG) transverse magnetic fields are present in Active Region filaments.
This corresponds to the highest field strengths reliably measured in these
structures. The profiles of the Helium 10830 \AA lines observed in this Active
Region filament are dominated by the Zeeman effect.
