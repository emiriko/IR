We report on a search of relations valid at order $p^6$ in Chiral
Perturbation Theory. We have found relations between $\pi\pi$, $\pi K$
scattering, $K_{\ell4}$ decays, masses and decay constants and scalar and
vector form factors. In this paper we give the relations and a first numerical
check of them.
