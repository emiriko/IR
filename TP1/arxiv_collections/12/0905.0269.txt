The ability to determine the structure of matter in three dimensions has
profoundly advanced our understanding of nature. Traditionally, the most widely
used schemes for 3D structure determination of an object are implemented by
acquiring multiple measurements over various sample orientations, as in the
case of crystallography and tomography (1,2), or by scanning a series of thin
sections through the sample, as in confocal microscopy (3). Here we present a
3D imaging modality, termed ankylography (derived from the Greek words ankylos
meaning 'curved' and graphein meaning 'writing'), which enables complete 3D
structure determination from a single exposure using a monochromatic incident
beam. We demonstrate that when the diffraction pattern of a finite object is
sampled at a sufficiently fine scale on the Ewald sphere, the 3D structure of
the object is determined by the 2D spherical pattern. We confirm the
theoretical analysis by performing 3D numerical reconstructions of a sodium
silicate glass structure at 2 Angstrom resolution and a single poliovirus at 2
- 3 nm resolution from 2D spherical diffraction patterns alone. Using
diffraction data from a soft X-ray laser, we demonstrate that ankylography is
experimentally feasible by obtaining a 3D image of a test object from a single
2D diffraction pattern. This approach of obtaining complete 3D structure
information from a single view is anticipated to find broad applications in the
physical and life sciences. As X-ray free electron lasers (X-FEL) and other
coherent X-ray sources are under rapid development worldwide, ankylography
potentially opens a door to determining the 3D structure of a biological
specimen in a single pulse and allowing for time-resolved 3D structure
determination of disordered materials.
