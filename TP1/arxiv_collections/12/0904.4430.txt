We present a simple model of firm rating evolution. We consider two sources
of defaults: individual dynamics of economic development and Potts-like
interactions between firms. We show that such a defined model leads to phase
transition, which results in collective defaults. The existence of the
collective phase depends on the mean interaction strength. For small
interaction strength parameters, there are many independent bankruptcies of
individual companies. For large parameters, there are giant collective defaults
of firm clusters. In the case when the individual firm dynamics favors dumping
of rating changes, there is an optimal strength of the firm's interactions from
the systemic risk point of view.
