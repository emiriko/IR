Combining the definition of Schwarzian derivative for conformal mappings
between Riemannian manifolds given by Osgood and Stowe with that for
parametrized curves in Euclidean space given by Ahlfors, we establish
injectivity criteria for holomorphic curves $\phi:\mathbb{D}\to\mathbb{C}^n$.
The result can be considered a generalization of a classical condition for
univalence of Nehari.
