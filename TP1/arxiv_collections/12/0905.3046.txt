In order to explain discrepancies between theoretical predictions and
experimental data for the helium fine structure, we check and recalculate all
theoretical contributions up to orders m\alpha^7 and m^2/M\alpha^6. The
previous result for the m\alpha^7 correction is improved by a much more
accurate calculation of relativistic corrections to the Bethe logarithm. The
theoretical values of the 2^3P_0-2^3P_1 and 2^3P_1-2^3P_2 fine structure
intervals in helium are, correspondingly, \nu_{01} = 29616946.2(1.6) kHz and
\nu_{12} = 2291177.3(1.6) kHz, with the uncertanties being due to higher-order
effects. For the small interval \nu_{12}, the theoretical value agrees with the
experimental data, whereas for the large interval \nu_{01}, a discrepancy of
about 3 standard deviations is present.
