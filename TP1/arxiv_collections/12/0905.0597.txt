In the framework of the left-right twin Higgs model, we study pair production
of the neutral Higgs bosons at the International Linear Collider ($ILC$) and
the $CERN$ $LHC$. We find that the production cross section of the process
$e^{+}e^{-}\to \phi^{0}h$ are at the level of several tens $fb$ at the $ILC$,
the production cross section of the $\phi^{0}\phi^{0}$ pair and $\phi^{0}h$
pair are at the level of several hundreds $fb$ at the $LHC$. As long as the
neutral Higgs boson $\phi^{0}$ is not too heavy, we conclude that its pair
production might be used to test for the left-right twin Higgs model at the
$LHC$ experiment or in the future $ILC$ experiment.
