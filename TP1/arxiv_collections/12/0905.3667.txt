We describe the theory of few Coulomb-correlated electrons in a magnetic
quantum dot formed in graphene. While the corresponding nonrelativistic
(Schr\"odinger) problem is well understood, a naive generalization to
graphene's "relativistic" (Dirac-Weyl) spectrum encounters divergencies and is
ill-defined. We employ Sucher's projection formalism to overcome these
problems. Exact diagonalization results for the two-electron quantum dot, i.e.,
the artificial helium atom in graphene, are presented.
