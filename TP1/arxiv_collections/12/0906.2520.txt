Recent experiments have successfully tested Einstein's general theory of
relativity to remarkable precision. We discuss recent progress in the tests of
relativistic gravity in the solar system and present motivations for the new
generation of high-accuracy gravitational experiments. We especially focus on
the concepts aiming to probe parametrized-post-Newtonian parameter $\gamma$ and
evaluate the discovery potential of the recently proposed experiments.
