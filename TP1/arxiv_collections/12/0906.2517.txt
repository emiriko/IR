In cosmology an important role is played by homogeneous and isotropic
solutions of the Einstein-Euler equations and linearized perturbations of
these. This paper proves results on the asymptotic behaviour of scalar
perturbations both in the approach to the initial singularity of the background
model and at late times. The main equation of interest is a linear hyperbolic
equation whose coefficients depend only on time. Expansions for the solutions
are obtained in both asymptotic regimes. In both cases it is shown how general
solutions with a linear equation of state can be parametrized by certain
functions which are coefficients in the asymptotic expansion. For some
nonlinear equations of state it is found that the late-time asymptotic
behaviour is qualitatively different from that in the linear case.
