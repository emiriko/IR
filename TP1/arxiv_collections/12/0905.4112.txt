We present a numerical study of the diffusion of energy at high temperature
in strongly disordered chains of interacting classical spins evolving
deterministically. We find that quenched randomness strongly suppresses
transport, with the diffusion constant becoming reduced by several orders of
magnitude upon the introduction of moderate disorder. We have also looked for
but not found signs of a classical many-body localization transition at any
nonzero strength of the spin-spin interactions.
