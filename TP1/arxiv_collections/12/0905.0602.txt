Haplotyping is the bioinformatics problem of predicting likely haplotypes
based on given genotypes. It can be approached using Gusfield's perfect
phylogeny haplotyping (PPH) method for which polynomial and linear time
algorithms exist. These algorithm use sophisticated data structures or do a
stepwise transformation of the genotype data into haplotype data and,
therefore, need a linear amount of space. We are interested in the exact
computational complexity of PPH and show that it can be solved
space-efficiently by an algorithm that needs only a logarithmic amount of
space. Together with the recently proved L-hardness of PPH, we establish
L-completeness. Our algorithm relies on a new characterization for PPH in terms
of bipartite graphs, which can be used both to decide and construct perfect
phylogenies for genotypes efficiently.
