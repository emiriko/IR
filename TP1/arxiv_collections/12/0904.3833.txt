The possible inhomogeneity of superconductivity has been investigated by
means of bulk-sensitive probes, using La_2-x_Sr_x_CuO_4_ (LSCO) single crystals
from the underdoped to optimally doped regime. Measurements of the magnetic
susceptibility, chi, on field cooling and specific heat have revealed that both
the absolute value of chi at 2 K, regarded as corresponding to the
superconducting (SC) volume fraction in a sample, and the Sommerfeld constant,
reflecting the density of states of quasiparticles at the Fermi level, exhibit
significant dependence on x, namely, on the hole concentration. This is the
first experimental work strongly suggesting that a phase separation into SC and
normal-state regions takes place in the underodped regime of LSCO as well as in
the overdoped regime.
