One of the standard generalized-gradient approximations (GGAs) in use in
modern electronic-structure theory, PBE, and a recently proposed modification
designed specifically for solids, PBEsol, are identified as particular members
of a family of functionals taking their parameters from different properties of
homogeneous or inhomogeneous electron liquids. Three further members of this
family are constructed and tested, together with the original PBE and PBEsol,
for atoms, molecules and solids. We find that PBE, in spite of its popularity
in solid-state physics and quantum chemistry, is not always the best performing
member of the family, and that PBEsol, in spite of having been constructed
specifically for solids, is not the best for solids. The performance of GGAs
for finite systems is found to sensitively depend on the choice of constraints
steaming from infinite systems. Guidelines both for users and for developers of
density functionals emerge from this work.
