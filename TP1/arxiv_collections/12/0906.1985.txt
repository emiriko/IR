We present a fully {\it ab initio}, non-perturbative, time-dependent approach
to describe single and double ionization of helium by proton and antiproton
impact. A flexible and accurate finite-element discrete-variable-representation
is applied to discretize the problem on the radial grid in spherical
coordinates. Good agreement with the most recent experimental data for absolute
angle-integrated cross sections is obtained over a wide range of incident
projectile energies between 3 keV and 6 MeV. Furthermore, angle-differential
cross sections for two-electron ejection are predicted for a proton impact
energy of 6 MeV. Finally, the time evaluation of the ionization process is
portrayed by displaying the electron density as a function of the projectile
location.
