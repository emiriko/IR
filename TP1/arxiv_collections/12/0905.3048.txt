In different passages of his dialogues, Plato showed deep
mathematically-based physical insights. Regrettably most readers overlooked the
respective statements, or they utterly did not understand those hints since
they were full of philological fallacious terms. Respectable translators
misinterpreted such statements and therefore Plato's respective remarks were
not recognized as substantial knowledge. Furthermore, Plato often supplemented
such basic remarks by diffusely veiled and varied allusions that were often
ironically hidden somewhere in his dialogues by inconspicuous double meanings.
However, this mode of intentionally coded discrete communication was generally
not understood because such irony is not to everyone's taste. However, the
attempts to reconstruct Plato's system on the basis of admittedly individually
interpreted double meanings lead to a conclusive mathematical-physical cyclical
system of dimensions. Additionally it was possible to assign Plato's system of
philosophical ideas analogously to this cyclical system. Plato took the
verifiability of the mathematical-physical results as proof of the system of
his ideas and finally as proof of his ethical creed, the unconditional trust in
the 'all surmounting Good.'
