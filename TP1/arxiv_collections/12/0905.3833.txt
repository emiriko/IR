The fundamental theorem of Riemannian geometry is inverted for analytic
Christoffel symbols. The inversion formula, henceforth dubbed Ricardo's
formula, is obtained without ancillary assumptions. Even though Ricardo's
formula can mathematically give the full answer, it is argued that the solution
should be taken only up to a constant conformal factor. A procedure to obtain
the Christoffel symbols out of unparameterized geodesics is sketched. Thus, a
complete framework to obtain the metric out of measurements is presented. The
framework is suitable for analysis of experiments testing the geometrical
nature of gravity.
