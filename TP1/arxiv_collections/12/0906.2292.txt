Hydrogenation reactions of CO in inter- and circumstellar ices are regarded
as an important starting point in the formation of more complex species.
Previous laboratory measurements by two groups on the hydrogenation of CO ices
resulted in controversial results on the formation rate of methanol. Our aim is
to resolve this controversy by an independent investigation of the reaction
scheme for a range of H-atom fluxes and different ice temperatures and
thicknesses. Reaction rates are determined by using a state-of-the-art ultra
high vacuum experimental setup to bombard an interstellar CO ice analog with
room temperature H atoms. The reaction of CO + H into H2CO and subsequently
CH3OH is monitored by a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer in a reflection
absorption mode. In addition, after each completed measurement a temperature
programmed desorption experiment is performed to identify the produced species.
Different H-atom fluxes, morphologies, and ice thicknesses are tested. The
formation of both formaldehyde and methanol via CO hydrogenation is confirmed
at low temperature (12-20 K). We confirm, as proposed by Hidaka et al., that
the discrepancy between the two Japanese studies is mainly due to a difference
in the applied hydrogen atom flux. The production rate of formaldehyde is found
to decrease and the penetration column to increase with temperature. In order
to fully understand the laboratory data, the experimental results are
interpreted using Monte Carlo simulations. This technique takes into account
the layered structure of CO ice. Temperature-dependent reaction barriers and
diffusion rates are inferred using this model. The model is extended to
interstellar conditions to compare with observational H2CO/CH3OH data.
