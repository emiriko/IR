Age constraints are most often placed on globular clusters by comparing their
CMDs with theoretical isochrones. The recent discoveries of detached, eclipsing
binaries in such systems by the Cluster AgeS Experiment (CASE) provide new
insights into their ages and, at the same time, much needed tests of stellar
evolution models. We describe efforts to model the properties of the detached,
eclipsing binary V69 in 47 Tuc and compare age constraints derived from stellar
evolution models of V69A and B with ages obtained from fitting isochrones to
the cluster CMD. We determine, under reasonable assumptions of distance,
reddening, and metallicity, the extent to which it is possible to
simultaneously constrain the age and He content of 47 Tuc.
