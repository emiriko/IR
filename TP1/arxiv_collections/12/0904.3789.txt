A Forensic Lucid intensional programming language has been proposed for
intensional cyberforensic analysis. In large part, the language is based on
various predecessor and codecessor Lucid dialects bound by the higher-order
intensional logic (HOIL) that is behind them. This work formally specifies the
operational aspects of the Forensic Lucid language and compiles a theory of its
constructs using Isabelle, a proof assistant system.
