It is pointed out that electron thermal fluctuations can couple with the ion
acoustic mode in an inhomogeneous plasma to generate a low frequency ion time
scale electromagnetic wave. This electromagnetic wave can become unstable if
the temperature and density gradients are parallel to each other which can be
the case in laser-plasmas similar to stellar cores. The comparisons of the
present theoretical model with the previous investigations are also presented.
The final result is applied to a classical laser induced plasma for
illustration.
