At the previous Venice meeting NO-VE 2008, we discussed possible hints in
favor of a nonzero value for the unknown neutrino mixing angle theta(13),
emerging from the combination of solar and long-baseline reactor data, as well
as from the combination of atmospheric, CHOOZ and long-baseline accelerator
nu_mu->nu_mu data. Recent MINOS 2009 results in the nu_mu->nu_e appearance
channel also seem to support such hints. A combination of all current
oscillation data provides, as preferred range, sin^2 theta(13) = 0.02 +- 0.01
(1\sigma). We review several issues raised by such hints in the last year, and
comment on their possible near-future improvements and tests.
