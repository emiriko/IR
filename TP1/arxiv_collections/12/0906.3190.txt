A scheme for getting a tunable ultranarrow linewidth of a cavity due to an
embedded four-level atomic medium with double-dark resonances is proposed. It
is shown that the steep dispersion induced by double-dark resonances in the
transparency window leads to the ultranarrow transmission peak. Compared with
the case of a single-dark-resonance system, the linewidth can be narrowed even
by one order under proper conditions. Furthermore, the position of the
ultranarrow peak can be engineered by varying the intensity and detuning of the
control field.
