We present evidence for the first observation of electromagnetically bound
$\pi^\pm K^\mp$-pairs ($\pi K$-atoms) with the DIRAC experiment at the CERN-PS.
The $\pi K$-atoms are produced by the 24 GeV/c proton beam in a thin Pt-target
and the $\pi^\pm$ and $K^\mp$-mesons from the atom dissociation are analyzed in
a two-arm magnetic spectrometer. The observed enhancement at low relative
momentum corresponds to the production of 173 $\pm$ 54 $\pi K$-atoms. The mean
life of $\pi K$-atoms is related to the s-wave $\pi K$-scattering lengths, the
measurement of which is the goal of the experiment. From these first data we
derive a lower limit for the mean life of 0.8 fs at 90% confidence level.
