Inspired by Hofstadter's Coffee-House Conversation (1982) and by the science
fiction short story SAM by Schattschneider (1988), we propose and discuss
criteria for non-mechanical intelligence. Firstly, we emphasize the practical
need for such tests in view of massively multiuser online role-playing games
(MMORPGs) and virtual reality systems like Second Life. Secondly, we
demonstrate Second Life as a useful framework for implementing (some iterations
of) that test.
