The temperature dependence of the ac susceptibility for single-crystalline
Fe1.02Se has been measured at high pressures to 6.7 GPa. The superconducting
transition temperature Tc displays a large increase from 7 K to 30 K in the
two-phase region at 0.5 - 1 GPa. Further increase in pressure results in the
decrease of Tc. The destruction of superconductivity near 7 GPa is presumably
related to a structural transition from orthorhombic to hexagonal. .
