The production of vector bosons in association with jets contains at least
two unrelated scales. The first is the mass of the vector boson m_V and the
second is the hard interaction scale giving rise to large transverse momenta of
the produced jets. The production cross sections depend logarithmically on the
ratio of these scales, which can lead to a poor convergence in fixed order
perturbation theory. We illustrate how to resum all leading logarithmic terms
using effective theory methods, and show that they can be resummed by a simple
choice of the factorization scale. Implementing this scale choice we show that
the large discrepancies between next-to-leading calculations and leading order
calculations using more traditional choices of scales disappear.
