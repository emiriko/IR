The Littlewood-Richardson (LR) coefficient counts among many other things the
LR tableaux of a given shape and a given content. We prove, that the number of
LR tableaux weakly increases if one adds to the shape and the content the shape
and the content of another LR tableau. We also investigate the behaviour of the
number of LR tableaux, if one repeatedly adds to the shape another shape with
either fixed or arbitrary content. This is a generalisation of the stretched LR
coefficients, where one repeatedly adds the same shape and content to itself.
