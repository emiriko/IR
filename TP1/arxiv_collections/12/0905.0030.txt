This paper deals with the problem of astrometric determination of the orbital
elements of the outer planets, in particular by assessing the ability of
astrometric observations to detect perturbations of the sort expected from the
Pioneer effect or other small perturbations to gravity. We also show that while
using simplified models of the dynamics can lead to some insights, one must be
careful to not over-simplify the issues involved lest one be misled by the
analysis onto false paths. Specifically, we show that the current ephemeris of
Pluto does not preclude the existence of the Pioneer effect. We show that the
orbit of Pluto is simply not well enough characterized at present to make such
an assertion. A number of misunderstandings related to these topics have now
propagated through the literature and have been used as a basis for drawing
conclusions about the dynamics of the solar system. Thus, the objective of this
paper is to address these issues. Finally, we offer some comments dealing with
the complex topic of model selection and comparison.
