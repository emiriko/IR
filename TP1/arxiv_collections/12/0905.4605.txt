The goal of the presented work is to illustrate a method by which the data
exchange between a standalone computer software and a shared database server
can be protected of unauthorized interceptation of the traffic in Internet
network, a transport network for data managed by those two systems,
interceptation by which an attacker could gain illegetimate access to the
database, threatening this way the data integrity and compromising the
database.
