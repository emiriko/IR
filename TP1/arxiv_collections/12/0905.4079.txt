Polarized structure functions at low $Q^2$ have the physical interpretation
of (generalized) spin polarizabilities. At high $Q^2$, the polarized parton
distribution $g_2(x)$ provides access to quark-gluon correlations in the
nucleon. We discuss the interpretation of the $x^2$ moment of $\bar{g}_2(x)$ as
an average transverse force on quarks in deep-inelastic scattering from a
transversely polarized target. Qualitative connections with generalized parton
distributions are emphasized. The $x^2$ moment of the chirally-odd twist-3
parton distribution $e(x)$ provides information on the dependence of the
average transverse force on the transversity of the quark.
