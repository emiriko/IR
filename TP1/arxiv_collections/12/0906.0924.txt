Graphene nanoribbon interconnects are fabricated, and the extracted
resistivity is compared to that of Cu. It is found that the average resistivity
at a given line-width (18nm<W<52nm) is about 3X that of a Cu wire, whereas the
best GNR has a resistivity comparable to that of Cu. The conductivity is found
to be limited by impurity scattering as well as LER scattering; as a result,
the best reported GNR resistivity is 3X the limit imposed by substrate phonon
scattering. This study reveals that even moderate-quality graphene nanowires
have the potential to outperform Cu for use as on-chip interconnects.
