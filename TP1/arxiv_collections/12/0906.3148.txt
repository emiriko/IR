The calculation of a statistical measure of complexity and the Fisher-Shannon
information in nuclei is carried out in this work. We use the nuclear shell
model in order to obtain the fractional occupation probabilities of nuclear
orbitals. The increasing of both magnitudes, the statistical complexity and the
Fisher-Shannon information, with the number of nucleons is observed. The shell
structure is reflected by the behavior of the statistical complexity. The magic
numbers are revealed by the Fisher-Shannon information.
