The hypothesis of the existence of a secluded gauge sector with
manifestations at low energies can be tested at low and medium energy e+e-
colliders, such as DAFNE.Some signatures are very straightforward and can be
relatively easily isolated against background. Therefore KLOE, with its 2.5
fb-1 of data, and KLOE-2 with its proposed detector's upgrades and larger data
sample are and will be able to test this hypothesis in deep detail
