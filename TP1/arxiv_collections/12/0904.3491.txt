Pseudo-scalar and scalar $D$ mesons are considered within the QCD sum rule
approach. We present an analysis of the mass splitting of the pseudo-scalar D -
D-bar mesons and the relation to QCD condensates. Weinberg type sum rules are
derived for chiral partners which highlight the role of the chiral condensate.
