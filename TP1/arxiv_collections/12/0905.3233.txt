We derive a quantum master equation from first principles to describe
friction in one dimensional, collisional Brownian motion. We are the first to
avoid an ill-defined square of the Dirac delta function by using localized wave
packets rather than plane waves. Solving the Schr\"odinger equation for two
colliding particles, we discover that the previously found position diffusion
is not a physical process, but an artifact of the approximation of a coarse
grained time scale, which in turn is needed to find Markkovian dynamics.
