We employ both top-down and bottom-up holographic dual models of QCD to
calculate vertex functions and couplings that are induced by the five
dimensional Chern-Simons term. We use these couplings to study the
photoproduction of $f_1$ mesons. The Chern-Simons-term-induced interaction
leads to a simple relation between the polarization of the incoming photon and
the final state $f_1$ meson which should allow a clear separation of this
interaction from competing processes.
