We present Coulomb blockade measurements in a graphene double dot system. The
coupling of the dots to the leads and between the dots can be tuned by graphene
in-plane gates. The coupling is a non-monotonic function of the gate voltage.
Using a purely capacitive model, we extract all relevant energy scales of the
double dot system.
