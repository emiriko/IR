In this work we combine the large per-photon optical gradient force with the
sensitive feedback of a high quality factor whispering-gallery microcavity. The
cavity geometry, consisting of a pair of silica disks separated by a nanoscale
gap, shows extremely strong dynamical backaction, powerful enough to excite
giant coherent oscillations even under heavily damped conditions (mechanical
Q=4). In vacuum, the threshold for regenerative mechanical oscillation is
lowered to an optical input power of only 270-nanoWatts, or roughly 1000 stored
cavity photons, and efficient cooling of the mechanical motion is obtained with
a temperature compression factor of 13-dB for 4-microWatts of dropped optical
input power.
