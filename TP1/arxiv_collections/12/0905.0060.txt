We have investigated crystalline magnetic anisotropy in the electric field
(EF) for the Fe-Pt surface which have a large perpendicular anisotropy, by
means of the first-principles approach. The anisotropy is reduced linearly with
respect to the inward EF, associated with the induced spin density around the
Fe layer. Although the magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE) density reveals the
large variation around the atoms, the intrinsic contribution to the MAE is
found to mainly come from the Fe layer.
