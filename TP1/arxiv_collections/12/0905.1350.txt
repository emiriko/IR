We study the effect of a veto on additional jets in the rapidity region
between a pair of high transverse momentum jets at the LHC. We aim to sum the
most important logarithms in the ratio of the jet transverse momentum to the
veto scale and to that end we attempt to assess the significance of the
super-leading logarithms that appear at high orders in the perturbative
expansion. We also compare our results to those of HERWIG++, in an attempt to
ascertain the accuracy of the angular ordered parton shower. We find that there
are large corrections that arise for large enough jet transverse momenta as a
consequence of Coulomb gluon exchanges.
