We propose some channels for the possible observation of anomalous
interactions of the fourth standard model generation quarks at the Large Hadron
Collider based ep and gamma-p colliders. Namely, u_4 (d_4) -> q gamma and u_4
(d_4) -> q Z -> q l^+ l^- decay processes are considered. Signatures for
signals and corresponding standard model backgrounds are investigated at both
colliders comperatively. The lowest necessary luminosities to observe these
processes and the achievable values of the anomalous coupling strengths are
determined. It is shown that the gamma-p collider is advantageous compare to
the ep collider.
