In the standard protocol for quantum teleportation, one assumes that Bob is
able to perform ideal operations on his qubit. Here, we analyze the case in
which some of these operations are more reliable than others. Moreover, we
consider the channel shared by Alice and Bob as non-maximally entangled. In
this context, the average fidelity of teleportation can be maximized by
properly choosing the basis in which Alice performs her two-qubit measurement.
