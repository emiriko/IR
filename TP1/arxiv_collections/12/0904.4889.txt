We present results for the electronic structure of plutonium by using a
recently developed quasiparticle self-consistent $GW$ method (\qsgw). We
consider a paramagnetic solution without spin-orbit interaction as a function
of volume for the face-centered cubic (fcc) unit cell. We span unit-cell
volumes ranging from 10% greater than the equilibrium volume of the $\delta$
phase to 90 % of the equivalent for the $\alpha$ phase of Pu. The
self-consistent $GW$ quasiparticle energies are compared to those obtained
within the Local Density Approximation (LDA). The goal of the calculations is
to understand systematic trends in the effects of electronic correlations on
the quasiparticle energy bands of Pu as a function of the localization of the
$f$ orbitals. We show that correlation effects narrow the $f$ bands in two
significantly different ways. Besides the expected narrowing of individual $f$
bands (flatter dispersion), we find that an even more significant effect on the
$f$ bands is a decrease in the crystal-field splitting of the different bands.
