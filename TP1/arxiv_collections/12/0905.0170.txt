We summarize the development of visible-sensitive gaseous photomultipliers,
combining a semitransparent bi-alkali photocathode with a state-of-the-art
cascaded electron multiplier. The latter has high photoelectron collection
efficiency and a record ion blocking capability. We describe in details the
system and methods of photocathode production and characterization, their
coupling with the electron multiplier and the gaseous-photomultiplier operation
and characterization in a continuous mode. We present results on the properties
of laboratory-produced K$_2$CsSb, Cs$_3$Sb and Na$_2$KSb photocathodes and
report on their stability and QE in gas; K$_2$CsSb photocathodes yielded QE
values in Ar/CH$_4$(95/5) above 30% at wavelengths of 360-400 nm. The novel
gaseous photomultiplier yielded stable operation at gains of 10$^5$, in
continuous operation mode, in 700 Torr of this gas; its sensitivity to single
photons was demonstrated. Other properties are described. The successful
detection of visible light with this gas-photomultiplier pave ways towards
further development of large-area sealed imaging detectors, of flat geometry,
insensitive to magnetic fields, which might have significant impact on light
detection in numerous fields.
