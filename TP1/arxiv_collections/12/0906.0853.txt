Navier-Stokes turbulence subject to solid-body rotation is studied by
high-resolution direct numerical simulations (DNS) of freely decaying and
stationary flows. Setups characterized by different Rossby numbers are
considered. In agreement with experimental results strong rotation is found to
lead to anisotropy of the direct nonlinear energy flux, which is attenuated
primarily in the direction of the rotation axis. In decaying turbulence the
evolution of kinetic energy follows an approximate power law with a distinct
dependence of the decay exponent on the rotation frequency. A simple
phenomenological relation between exponent and rotation rate reproduces this
observation. Stationary turbulence driven by large-scale forcing exhibits
$k_\perp^{-2}$-scaling in the rotation-dominated inertial range of the
one-dimensional energy spectrum taken perpendicularly to the rotation axis. The
self-similar scaling is shown to be the cumulative result of individual
spectral contributions which, for low rotation rate, display
$k_\perp^{-3}$-scaling near the $k_\parallel=0$ plane. A phenomenology which
incorporates the modification of the energy cascade by rotation is proposed. In
the observed regime the nonlinear turbulent interactions are strongly
influenced by rotation but not suppressed. {Longitudinal two-point velocity
structure functions taken perpendicularly to the axis of rotation indicate weak
intermittency of the $k_\parallel=0$ (2D) component of the flow while the
intermittent scaling of $k_\parallel\neq 0$ (3D) fluctuations is well captured
by a modified She-L\'ev\^eque intermittency model which yields the expression
$\zeta_p=p/6 + 2(1-(2/3)^{p/2})$ for the structure function scaling exponents.
