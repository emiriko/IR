Non-degenerate U-empirical Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests are studied and their
large deviation asymptotics under the null-hypothesis is described. Several
examples of such statistics used for testing goodness-of-fit and symmetry are
considered. It is shown how to calculate their local Bahadur efficiency.
