We study critical properties of the continuous Abelian sandpile model with
anisotropies in toppling rules that produce ordered patterns on it. Also we
consider the continuous directed sandpile model perturbed by a weak quenched
randomness and study critical behavior of the model using perturbative
conformal field theory and show the model has a new random fixed point.
