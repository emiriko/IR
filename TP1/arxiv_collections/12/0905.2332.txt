We investigate the energy relaxation (T1) process of a qubit coupled to a
bath of dissipative two-level fluctuators (TLF). We consider the fluctuators
strongly coupled to the qubit both in the limit of spectrally separated single
TLF's as well as in the limit of spectrally dense TLF's. We conclude that the
avoided level crossings, usually attributed to very strongly coupled single
TLF's, could also be caused by many weakly coupled spectrally dense
fluctuators.
