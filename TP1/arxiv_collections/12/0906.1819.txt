Three-dimensional warped anti-de Sitter space in topologically massive
gravity with a negative cosmological constant has been proposed to be
holographically dual to a two-dimensional conformal field theory. We extend
this proposal to both positive and vanishing values of the cosmological
constant where stretched warped anti-de Sitter space is found to be a solution.
For positive cosmological constant, another class of warped solutions is
obtained by a spacelike (timelike) line fibration over Lorentzian (Euclidean)
two-dimensional de Sitter space. These solutions exhibit a cosmological horizon
and Hawking temperature much like de Sitter space. Global identifications of
this warped de Sitter space may contain a horizon in addition to the
cosmological one. At a degenerate point, warped de Sitter space becomes a
fibration over two-dimensional flat space. Finally, we study scalar waves in
these backgrounds. Scalars in stretched warped anti-de Sitter space exhibit
superradiance which can be interpreted as Schwinger pair production of charged
particles in two-dimensional anti-de Sitter space.
