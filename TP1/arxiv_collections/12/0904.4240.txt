We discuss a parameter free scaling relation that yields a complete data
collapse for large classes of nonequilibrium growth processes. We illustrate
the power of this new scaling relation through various growth models, as for
example the competitive growth model RD/RDSR (random deposition/random
deposition with surface diffusion) and the RSOS (restricted solid-on-solid)
model with different nearest-neighbor height differences, as well as through a
new deposition model with temperature dependent diffusion. The new scaling
relation is compared to the familiar Family-Vicsek relation and the limitations
of the latter are highlighted.
