We present a scheme for creating and measuring entanglement between two
double quantum dot charge qubits in a transport set-up in which voltage pulses
can modify system parameters. Detection of entanglement is performed via the
construction of a Bell inequality with current correlation measurements. An
essential feature is the use of the internal dynamics of the qubits as the
constituent electrons tunnel into the leads to give the single-particle
rotations necessary for the Bell measurement.
