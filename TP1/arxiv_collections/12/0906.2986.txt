We study the entanglement dynamics in a two-spin system governed by a
bilinear Hamiltonian and assisted by phase kicks. It is found that the
application of instant kicks to both spins at some specific moments leads to
enhancement of entanglement. This procedure also improves the transient
character of entanglement leading, for large spins, to a formation of a plateau
for the I-concurrence. We have numerically investigated the spin-spin dynamics
for several values of spins and observed a substantial enhancement of
entanglement in comparison to the evolution without kicks.
