We examine the possibility of static wormhole solutions in the vacuum
Brans-Dicke theory both in the original (Jordan) frame and in the conformally
rescaled (Einstein) frame. It turns out that, in the former frame, wormholes
exist only in a very narrow interval of the coupling parameter, viz.,
-3/2<omega<-4/3. It is shown that these wormholes are not traversable in
practice. In the latter frame, wormhole solutions do not exist at all unless
energy conditions are violated by hand.
