The time resolved Magnetooptical Kerr effect in the substrate-strain-induced
insulating ferromagnetic phase in (Pr$_{0.6}$Ca$_{0.4}$)MnO$_3$ thin films on
two different substrates was measured in a magnetic field up to 1.1T. The
photoinduced Kerr rotation and ellipticity show remarkably different
magnetic-field dependence. From the comparison of the magnetic field
dependencies of the photoinduced and static Kerr rotation and ellipticity we
conclude that a transient ferromagnetic metallic phase, embedded within the
insulating ferromagnetic phase, is created upon the photoexcitation at low
temperatures. A comparison of temporal dependence of the photoinduced Kerr
signals with the photoinduced reflectivity indicates the change of the
fractions of the phases takes place on a timescale of ten picoseconds
independent of the substrate.
