The latest version of the planetary ephemerides developed at the Paris
Observatory and at the Besancon Observatory is presented here. INPOP08 is a
4-dimension ephemeris since it provides to users positions and velocities of
planets and the relation between TT and TDB. Investigations leading to improve
the modeling of asteroids are described as well as the new sets of observations
used for the fit of INPOP08. New observations provided by the European Space
Agency (ESA) deduced from the tracking of the Mars Express (MEX) and Venus
Express (VEX) missions are presented as well as the normal point deduced from
the Cassini mission. We show the huge impact brought by these observations in
the fit of INPOP08, especially in terms of Venus, Saturn and Earth-Moon
barycenter orbits.
