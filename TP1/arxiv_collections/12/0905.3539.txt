We strengthen the connection between Information Theory and
quantum-mechanical systems using a recently developed dequantization procedure
whereby quantum fluctuations latent in the quantum momentum are suppressed. The
dequantization procedure results in a decomposition of the quantum kinetic
energy as the sum of a classical term and a purely quantum term. The purely
quantum term, which results from the quantum fluctuations, is essentially
identical to the Fisher information. The classical term is complementary to the
Fisher information and, in this sense, it plays a role analogous to that of the
Shannon entropy. We demonstrate the kinetic energy decomposition for both
stationary and nonstationary states and employ it to shed light on the nature
of kinetic-energy functionals.
