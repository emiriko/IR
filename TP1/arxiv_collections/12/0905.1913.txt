The anisotropy of temperature is studied here in a strong two-dimensional
shockwave, simulated with conventional molecular dynamics. Several forms of the
kinetic temperature are considered, corresponding to different choices for the
local instantaneous stream velocity. A local particle-based definition omitting
any "self" contribution to the stream velocity gives the best results. The
configurational temperature is not useful for this shockwave problem.
Configurational temperature is subject to a shear instability and can give
local negative temperatures in the vicinity of the shock front. The decay of
sinusoidal shockfront perturbations shows that strong two-dimensional planar
shockwaves are stable to such perturbations.
