We present the analytical solution in closed form for the semiclassical limit
of the quantum mechanical Coulomb Green function in position space in n
dimensions. We utilize a projection method which has its roots in Lambert's
theorem and which allows us to treat the system as an essentially one
dimensional problem. The semiclassical result assumes a simple analytical form
and is well suited for a numerical evaluation. The method can also be extended
to classically forbidden space regions. Already for moderately large principal
quantum numbers nu >= 5, the semiclassical Green function is found to be an
excellent approximation to the quantum mechanical Green function.
