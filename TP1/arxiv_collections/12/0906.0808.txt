The CDF and D0 experiments have produced a wealth of heavy flavour physics
results since the beginning of Run II of the Fermilab Tevatron. We review
recent measurements of B hadron states including excited B states (B^{**},
B_s^{**}) and the Bc+ meson. We also summarize the discoveries of the Sigma_b
baryon states and the Xi_b baryon.
