Reaction paths and classical and quantum trajectories are studied within a
generalized Hamilton-Jacobi framework, which allows to put on equal footing
topology and dynamics in chemical reactivity problems. In doing so, we show how
high-dimensional problems could be dealt with by means of Caratheodory plots or
how trajectory-based quantum-classical analyses reveal unexpected
discrepancies. As a working model, we consider the reaction dynamics associated
with a Mueller-Brown potential energy surface, where we focus on the
relationship between reaction paths and trajectories as well as on reaction
probability calculations from classical and quantum trajectories.
