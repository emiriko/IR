Counting problems, determining the number of possible states of a large
system under certain constraints, play an important role in many areas of
science. They naturally arise for complex disordered systems in physics and
chemistry, in mathematical graph theory, and in computer science. Counting
problems, however, are among the hardest problems to access computationally.
Here, we suggest a novel method to access a benchmark counting problem, finding
chromatic polynomials of graphs. We develop a vertex-oriented symbolic pattern
matching algorithm that exploits the equivalence between the chromatic
polynomial and the zero-temperature partition function of the Potts
antiferromagnet on the same graph. Implementing this bottom-up algorithm using
appropriate computer algebra, the new method outperforms standard top-down
methods by several orders of magnitude, already for moderately sized graphs. As
a first application, we compute chromatic polynomials of samples of the simple
cubic lattice, for the first time computationally accessing three-dimensional
lattices of physical relevance. The method offers straightforward
generalizations to several other counting problems.
