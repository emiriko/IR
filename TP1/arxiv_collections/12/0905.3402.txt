Pumping characteristics were studied of the hybrid
normal-metal/superconductor single-electron transistor embedded in a high-ohmic
environment. Two 3 micrometer-long microstrip resistors of CrOx with a sum
resistance R=80kOhm were placed adjacent to this hybrid device. Substantial
improvement of pumping and reduction of the subgap leakage were observed in the
low-MHz range. At higher frequencies 0.1-1GHz, a slowdown of tunneling due to
the enhanced damping and electron heating negatively affected the pumping, as
compared to the reference bare devices.
