We study thermal neutralino dark matter in an effective field theory
extension of the MSSM, called "Beyond the MSSM" (BMSSM) in Dine, Seiberg and
Thomas (2007). In this class of effective field theories, the field content of
the MSSM is unchanged, but the little hierarchy problem is alleviated by
allowing small corrections to the Higgs/higgsino part of the Lagrangian. We
perform parameter scans and compute the dark matter relic density. The light
Higgsino LSP scenario is modified the most; we find new regions of parameter
space compared to the standard MSSM. This involves interesting interplay
between the WMAP dark matter bounds and the LEP chargino bound. We also find
some changes for gaugino LSPs, partly due to annihilation through a Higgs
resonance, and partly due to coannihilation with light stops in models that are
ruled in by the new effective terms.
