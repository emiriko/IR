We simulate the effect of latitudinal variations in the location of star
spots, as well as their magnetic field strength, on stellar angular momentum
loss to the stellar wind. We use the Michigan solar corona global
MagnetoHydroDynamic model, which incorporates realistic relation between the
magnetic field topology and the wind distribution. We find that the spots
location significantly affects the stellar wind structure, and as a result, the
total mass loss rate and angular momentum loss rate. In particular, we find
that the angular momentum loss rate is controlled by the mass flux when spots
are located at low latitudes but is controlled by an increased plasma density
between the stellar surface and the Alfven surface when spots are located at
high latitudes. Our results suggest that there might be a feedback mechanism
between the magnetic field distribution, wind distribution, angular momentum
loss through the wind, and the motions at the convection zone that generate the
magnetic field. This feedback might explain the role of coronal magnetic fields
in stellar dynamos.
