While the phase of a coherent light field can be precisely known, the phase
of the individual photons that create this field, considered individually,
cannot. Phase changes within single-photon wave packets, however, have
observable effects. In fact, actively controlling the phase of individual
photons has been identified as a powerful resource for quantum communication
protocols. Here we demonstrate the arbitrary phase control of a single photon.
The phase modulation is applied without affecting the photon's amplitude
profile and is verified via a two-photon quantum interference measurement,
which can result in the fermionic spatial behaviour of photon pairs. Combined
with previously demonstrated control of a single photon's amplitude, frequency,
and polarisation, the fully deterministic phase shaping presented here allows
for the complete control of single-photon wave packets.
