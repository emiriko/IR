The postulation of Dark energy and Dark matter on the basis of observational
results does not end the mystery of their existence. Theoretically new insights
into dark matter have been achieved analyzing recent experimental data from the
cosmic ray physics. It has been shown that, if the dark matter is a hidden
scalar field, then it is not only possible to explain the ATIC/PPB BETS excess
but also the observed dark matter abundance naturally and simultaneously. Being
motivated, mainly by the assumption of hidden scalar field and some associated
works, we consider the Modified Chaplygin Gas for some thermodynamical
analysis. The point that if the scalar field is assumed to oscillate before the
reheating was not completed, i.e., T_R <= 10^10 GeV, the abundance of dark
matter would be diluted by the entropy production during reheating indicates
the importance of thermodynamical analysis. We, assuming the properties of
Modified Chaplygin Gas, derive an expression for the second law of
thermodynamics. It is observed that it also sheds some new lights on
Generalised Second Law.
