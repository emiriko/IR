In order to explore the possible existence of the exotic $0^{--}$ state, we
have constructed the tetraquark interpolating operators systematically. As a
byproduct, we notice the $0^{+-}$ tetraquark operators without derivatives do
not exist. The special Lorentz structure of the $0^{--}$ currents forbids the
four-quark correction to the spectral density. Now the gluon condensate is the
dominant power correction. Within the framework of the finite energy sum rule,
none of the seven interpolating currents supports a resonant signal. Therefore
we conclude that the exotic $0^{--}$ state does not exist below 2 GeV, which is
consistent with the current experimental observations.
