We report results from a 2003 FUSE observation, and reanalysis of a 1996 HST
observation of the unusual X-ray transient Narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy WPVS
007. The HST FOS spectrum revealed mini-BALs with V_max ~ 900 km s^-1 and FWHM
~ 550 km s^-1. The FUSE spectrum showed that an additional BAL outflow with
V_max ~ 6000 km s^-1 and FWHM ~ 3400 km s^-1 had appeared. WPVS 007 is a
low-luminosity object in which such a high velocity outflow is not expected;
therefore, it is an outlier on the M_V/V_max relationship. Template spectral
fitting yielded apparent ionic columns, and a Cloudy analysis showed that the
presence of PV requires a high ionization parameter log(U) >= 0 and high column
density log(N_H) >= 23 assuming solar abundances and a nominal SED for
low-luminosity NLS1s with alpha_ox=-1.28. A recent long Swift observation
revealed the first hard X-ray detection and an intrinsic (unabsorbed) alpha_ox
~ -1.9$. Using this SED in our analysis yielded lower column density
constraints (log(N_H) >= 22.2 for Z=1, or log(N_H) >= 21.6 if Z=5). The X-ray
weak continuum, combined with X-ray absorption consistent with the UV lines,
provides the best explanation for the observed Swift X-ray spectrum. The large
column densities and velocities implied by the UV data in any of these
scenarios could be problematic for radiative acceleration. We also point out
that since the observed PV absorption can be explained by lower total column
densities using an intrinsically X-ray weak spectrum, we might expect to find
PV absorption preferentially more often (or stronger) in quasars that are
intrinsically X-ray weak.
