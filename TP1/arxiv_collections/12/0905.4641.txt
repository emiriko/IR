Conway and Kochen have presented a "free will theorem" (Notices of the AMS
56, pgs. 226-232 (2009)) which they claim shows that "if indeed we humans have
free will, then [so do] elementary particles." In a more precise fashion, they
claim it shows that for certain quantum experiments in which the experimenters
can choose between several options, no deterministic or stochastic model can
account for the observed outcomes without violating a condition "MIN" motivated
by relativistic symmetry. We point out that for stochastic models this
conclusion is not correct, while for deterministic models it is not new.
