The loop-current state discovered in the pseudogap phase of cuprates breaks
time reversal symmetry and lowers the point group symmetry of the crystal. The
order parameter and the magnetic structure within each unit cell which is
associated with it can be described by a toroidal moment parallel to the
copper-oxide planes. We discuss lattice point group symmetry of the magnetic
structure. As an application, we discuss a few effects that necessarily
accompany order parameter in the pseudogap phase. The magnitude estimated for
these specific effects makes them hard to observe because they rely on the
small magnetic fields associated with the order parameter. Effects, associated
with the electronic energies are much larger. Some of them have already been
discussed.
