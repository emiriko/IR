We study the neutron electric dipole moment (EDM) in a five dimensional SU(3)
gauge-Higgs unification compactified on M^4 \times S^1/Z_2 space-time including
a massive fermion. We point out that to realize the CP violation is a
non-trivial task in the gauge-Higgs unification scenario and argue how the CP
symmetry is broken spontaneously by the VEV of the Higgs, the extra space
component of the gauge field. We emphasize the importance of the interplay
between the VEV of the Higgs and the Z_2-odd bulk mass term to get physically
the CP violation. We then calculate the one-loop contributions to the neutron
EDM as the typical example of the CP violating observable and find that the EDM
appears already at the one-loop level, without invoking to the three generation
scheme. We then derive a lower bound for the compactification scale, which is
around 2.6 TeV, by comparing the contribution due to the nonzero Kaluza-Klein
modes with the experimental data.
