A Heisenberg model over the square lattice recently introduced by Si and
Abrahams to describe local-moment magnetism in the new class of Fe-As high-Tc
superconductors is analyzed in the classical limit and on a small cluster by
exact diagonalization. In the case of spin-1 iron atoms, large enough
Heisenberg exchange interactions between neighboring spin-1/2 moments on
different iron 3d orbitals that frustrate true magnetic order lead to hidden
magnetic order that violates Hund's rule. It accounts for the low ordered
magnetic moment observed by elastic neutron diffraction in an undoped parent
compound to Fe-As superconductors. We predict that low-energy spin-wave
excitations exist at wavenumbers corresponding to either hidden Neel or hidden
ferromagnetic order.
