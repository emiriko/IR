By building on our earlier work, we establish uncertainty principles in terms
of Heisenberg inequalities and of the ambiguity functions associated with
magnetic structures on certain coadjoint orbits of infinite-dimensional Lie
groups. These infinite-dimensional Lie groups are semidirect products of
nilpotent Lie groups and invariant function spaces thereon. The recently
developed magnetic Weyl calculus is recovered in the special case of function
spaces on abelian Lie groups.
