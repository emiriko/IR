We consider the quark and antiquark transversity distributions inside a
polarized proton and we study how they are expected to be related to the
corresponding helicity distributions, both in sign and magnitude. Our
considerations lead to simple predictions in good agreement with their first
determination for light quarks from experimental data. We also give our
predictions for the light antiquarks transversity distributions, so far
unknown.
