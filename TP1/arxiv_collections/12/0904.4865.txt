We question the notion of line element in some quantum spaces that are
expected to play a role in quantum gravity, namely non-commutative deformations
of Minkowski spaces. We recall how the implementation of the Leibniz rule
forbids to see some of the infinitesimal deformed Poincare transformations as
good candidates for Noether symmetries. Then we recall the more fundamental
view on the line element proposed in noncommutative geometry, and re-interprete
at this light some previous results on Connes' distance formula.
