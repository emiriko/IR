Massive multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) are very popular in
past few years. The profit of an MMORPG company is proportional to how many
users registered, and the instant number of online avatars is a key factor to
assess how popular an MMORPG is. We use the on-off-line logs on an MMORPG
server to reconstruct the instant number of online avatars per second and
investigate its statistical properties. We find that the online avatar number
exhibits one-day periodic behavior and clear intraday pattern, the fluctuation
distribution of the online avatar numbers has a leptokurtic non-Gaussian shape
with power-law tails, and the increments of online avatar numbers after
removing the intraday pattern are uncorrelated and the associated absolute
values have long-term correlation. In addition, both time series exhibit
multifractal nature.
