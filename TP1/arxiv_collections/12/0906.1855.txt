Whispering Gallery modes in bulk cylindrical Gallium Arsenide and Gallium
Phosphide samples have been examined both in darkness and under white light at
50 K. In both samples we observed change in permittivity under light and dark
conditions. This results from a change in the polarization state of the
semiconductor, which is consistent with a free electron-hole
creation/recombination process. The permittivity of the semiconductor is
modified by free photocarriers in the surface layers of the sample which is the
region sampled by Whispering Gallery modes.
