Dynamic coupling of cavities to a quantum network is of major interest to
distributed quantum information processing schemes based on cavity quantum
electrodynamics. This can be achieved by active tuning a mediating atom-cavity
system. In particular, we consider the dynamic coupling between two coupled
cavities, each interacting with a two-level atom, realized by tuning one of the
atoms. One atom-field system can be controlled to become maximally and
minimally coupled with its counterpart, allowing high fidelity excitation
confinement, Q-switching and reversible state transport. As an application, we
first show that simple tuning can lead to emission of near-Gaussian
single-photon pulses that is significantly different from the usual exponential
decay in a passive cavity-based system. The influences of cavity loss and
atomic spontaneous emission are studied in detailed numerical simulations,
showing the practicality of these schemes within the reach of current
experimental technology in solid-state environment. We then show that when the
technique is employed to an extended coupled-cavity scheme involving a
multi-level atom, arbitrary temporal superposition of single photons can be
engineered in a deterministic way.
