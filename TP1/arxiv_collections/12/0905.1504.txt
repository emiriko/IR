In this article, a time-domain calibration procedure is proposed for pulsed
Terahertz Integrated Circuits (TIC) used in on-chip applications, where the
conventional calibration methods are not applicable. The proposed
post-detection method removes the unwanted linear distortions, such as
interfering echoes and frequency dispersion, by using only one single-port
measurement. The method employs a wave-transfer model for analysis of the TIC,
and the model parameters are obtained by a proposed blind estimation algorithm.
  A complete implementation of the method is demonstrated for a fabricated TIC,
when used in an on-chip sensing application. The features of interest in the
measured signal, such as absorption lines, can be masked or weakened by the
distortion of the THz signal happening in a TIC. The proposed signal recovery
approach improves the detection of those otherwise hidden features, and can
significantly enhance the performance of existing TICs. To show the
effectiveness of the proposed de-embedding method, numerical results are
presented for simulated and measured signals. The method presented in this
article is enabling for accurate TIC applications, and can be utilized to
optimally design novel TIC structures for specific purposes.
