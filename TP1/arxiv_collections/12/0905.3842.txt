We study the effect of an electrostatic coupling between a scanning tunneling
microscope tip and a Luttinger liquid wire on the tunneling current and noise
between the two. Solving the Dyson equations non perturbatively for a local
interaction potential, we derive the Green's functions associated to the wire
and to the tip. Interestingly, the electrostatic coupling leads to the
existence of new correlators, which we call mixed Green's functions, which are
correlators between the bosonic fields of the wire and the tip. Next, we
calculate the transport properties up to second order with the amplitude of the
tunnel transfer: the tunnel current is strongly reduced by the presence of
screening. The zero-frequency noise is modified in a similar way, but the Fano
factor remains unchanged. We also consider the effect of the screening on the
asymmetry of the finite-frequency non-symmetrized noise and on the conductance.
