'Forbidden' Bragg reflections of iron orthoborate Fe3BO6 were studied
theoretically and experimentally in the vicinity of the iron K edge. Their
energy spectra are explained as resulting from the interference of x-rays
scattered from two inequivalent crystallographic sites occupied by iron ions.
This particular structure property gives rise to complex azimuthal dependences
of the reflection intensities in the pre-edge region as they result from the
interplay of site specific dipole-quadrupole and quadrupole-quadrupole resonant
scattering. Also evidenced is an isotropic character of the absorption
spectrum. Self-absorption correction to the diffraction data, as well as
possible contributions of thermal vibrations and magnetic order, are discussed.
Particular care is given to extracting clean spectra from the data, and it is
demonstrated that excellent results can be obtained even from measurements that
appear corrupted by several effects such as poor crystal quality and multiple
scattering.
