We study two simple mesoscopic models of interacting two electrons; first one
consists of two quantum coherent parallel conductors with long-range Coulomb
interaction in some localized region and the other is of an interacting quantum
dot (QD) side-coupled to a noninteracting quantum wire. We evaluate exact
two-particle scattering matrix as well as two-particle current which are
relevant in a two-particle scattering experiment in these models. Finally we
show that the on-site repulsive interaction in the QD filters out the
spin-singlet two-electron state from the mixed two-electron input states in the
side-coupled QD model.
