We consider a piecewise analytic expanding map f: [0,1]-> [0,1] of degree d
which preserves orientation, and an analytic positive potential g: [0,1] -> R.
  We address the analysis of the following problem: for a given analytic
potential beta log g, where beta is a real constant, it is well known that
there exists a real analytic (with a complex analytic extension to a small
complex neighborhood of [0,1]) eigenfunction phi_beta for the Ruelle operator.
One can ask: what happen with the function phi_beta, when beta goes to
infinity. The domain of analyticity can change with beta. The correct question
should be: is 1/ beta log phi_beta analytic in the limit, when beta goes to
infinity ? Under a uniqueness assumption, this limit, when beta goes to
infinity, is in fact a calibrated subaction V (see bellow definition). We show
here that under certain conditions and for a certain class of generic
potentials this continuous function is piecewise analytic (but not analytic).
In a few examples one can get that the subaction is analytic (we need at least
to assume that the maximizing probability has support in a unique fixed point).
