This paper concerns instruction sequences that contain probabilistic
instructions, i.e. instructions that are themselves probabilistic by nature. We
propose several kinds of probabilistic instructions, provide an informal
operational meaning for each of them, and discuss related work. On purpose, we
refrain from providing an ad hoc formal meaning for the proposed kinds of
instructions. We also discuss the approach of projection semantics, which was
introduced in earlier work on instruction sequences, in the light of
probabilistic instruction sequences.
