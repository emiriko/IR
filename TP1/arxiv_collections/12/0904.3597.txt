The influences of long range Coulomb interaction (LRCI) on Mach-Zehnder
interferometer (MZI) constructed on quantum Hall edge states is studied
employing bosonization method. The interaction of interchannel zero-modes is
shown to give rise to a characteristic energy scale which is of the order of
the period of experimentally observed lobe pattern of visibility. The
nonmonotonic behavior of visibility as found Chalker \textit{et al.} is
understood analytically using asymptotic analysis.
