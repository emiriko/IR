We demonstrate that the Evans-Rosenquist formulation of the optical
mechanical analogy, so successful in the application to classical problems,
also describes the motion of massless particles in the Schwarzschild field of
general relativity. It is possible to obtain the well known equations for light
orbit and radar echo delay which account for two exclusive tests of Einstein's
field equations. Some remarks including suggestions for future work are also
added.
