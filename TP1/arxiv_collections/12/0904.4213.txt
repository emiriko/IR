We present an explicit averaging formula in lowest order. Besides an
arbitrary smearing function it contains two integrals of this function. This is
necessary in order to achieve covariance. There is no need to solve any
equations. In three dimensions the same averaging formula yields a covariant
averaging of the Einstein tensor and thus of the field equations. We also
present a simple extension to static perturbations in four dimensions. Various
further extensions of the formalism appear possible.
