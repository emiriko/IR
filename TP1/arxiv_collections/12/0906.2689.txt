We determine the symmetry groups under which the charged-lepton and the
Majorana-neutrino mass terms are invariant. We note that those two groups
always exist trivially, i.e. independently of the presence of any symmetries in
the Lagrangian, and that they always have the same form. Using this insight, we
re-evaluate the recent claim that, whenever lepton mixing is tri-bimaximal, S_4
is the minimal unique horizontal-symmetry group of the Lagrangian of the lepton
sector, with S_4 being determined by the symmetries of the lepton mass
matrices. We discuss two models for tri-bimaximal mixing which serve as
counterexamples to this claim. With these two models and some group-theoretical
arguments we illustrate that there is no compelling reason for the uniqueness
of S_4.
