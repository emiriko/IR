The system of subdwarfs G89-14 is one of the most metal-poor multiple stars
with an atmospheric metal abundance $\mathrm{[m/H]}=-1.9$. Speckle
interferometry at the 6-m BTA telescope has revealed that G89-14 consists of
four components. Measurements of the magnitude difference between the
components and published data have allowed their masses to be estimated:
$M_{A}\approx0.67 M_{\odot}$, $M_{B}\approx0.24 M_{\odot}$, $M_{C}\approx0.33
M_{\odot}$, and $M_{D}\approx0.22 M_{\odot}$. The ratio of the orbital periods
of the subsystems has been obtained, 0.52 yr : 3 000 yr : 650 000 yr
(1:5769:1250000), indicative of a high degree of hierarchy of G89-14 and its
internal dynamical stability. The calculated Galactic orbital elements and the
low metallicity of the quadruple system suggest that it belongs to the Galactic
halo.
