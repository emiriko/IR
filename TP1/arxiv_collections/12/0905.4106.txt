A quantum mechanical observer might be describable as having a reference
system that is a superposition of classical inertial reference frames. The
present paper suggests a possible weighting function in such superpositions,
determined by the product of the observer's wavefunction and the Fourier
transform of the wavefunction at each point in phase space. This suggestion is
made because each of these factors has a simple interpretation as a probability
density amplitude. Other forms for the weighting function may well be possible.
