The strength of the non-adiabatic spin torque is currently under strong
debate, as its value differs by orders of magnitude as well in theoretical
predictions as in measurements. Here, a measurement scheme is presented that
allows to determine the strength of the non-adiabatic spin torque accurately
and directly. Analytical and numerical calculations show that the scheme allows
to separate the displacement due to the Oersted field and is robust against
uncertainties of the exact current direction.
