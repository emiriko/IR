We show that for any minuscule or cominuscule homogeneous space X, the
Gromov-Witten varieties of degree d curves passing through three general points
of X are rational or empty for any d. Applying techniques of A. Buch and L.
Mihalcea to constructions of the authors together with L. Manivel, we deduce
that the equivariant K-theoretic three points Gromov-Witten invariants are
equal to classical equivariant K-theoretic invariants on auxilliary spaces.
