he segment minimization problem consists of finding the smallest set of
integer matrices that sum to a given intensity matrix, such that each summand
has only one non-zero value, and the non-zeroes in each row are consecutive.
This has direct applications in intensity-modulated radiation therapy, an
effective form of cancer treatment. We develop three approximation algorithms
for matrices with arbitrarily many rows. Our first two algorithms improve the
approximation factor from the previous best of $1+\log_2 h $ to (roughly) $3/2
\cdot (1+\log_3 h)$ and $11/6\cdot(1+\log_4{h})$, respectively, where $h$ is
the largest entry in the intensity matrix. We illustrate the limitations of the
specific approach used to obtain these two algorithms by proving a lower bound
of $\frac{(2b-2)}{b}\cdot\log_b{h} + \frac{1}{b}$ on the approximation
guarantee. Our third algorithm improves the approximation factor from $2 \cdot
(\log D+1)$ to $24/13 \cdot (\log D+1)$, where $D$ is (roughly) the largest
difference between consecutive elements of a row of the intensity matrix.
Finally, experimentation with these algorithms shows that they perform well
with respect to the optimum and outperform other approximation algorithms on
77% of the 122 test cases we consider, which include both real world and
synthetic data.
