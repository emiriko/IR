I discuss (ontologies_and_ontological_knowledge_bases /
formal_methods_and_theories) duality and its category theory extensions as a

on the example of the design of elements of ontologies and ontological
knowledge bases of next three electronic courses: Foundations of Research
Activities, Virtual Modeling of Complex Systems and Introduction to String
Theory.
