A method for the full three-dimensional (3-D) reconstruction of the
trajectories of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) using Solar TErrestrial RElations
Observatory (STEREO) data is presented. Four CMEs that were simultaneously
observed by the inner and outer coronagraphs (COR1 and 2) of the Ahead and
Behind STEREO satellites were analysed. These observations were used to derive
CME trajectories in 3-D out to ~15Rsun. The reconstructions using COR1/2 data
support a radial propagation model. Assuming pseudo-radial propagation at large
distances from the Sun (15-240Rsun), the CME positions were extrapolated into
the Heliospheric Imager (HI) field-of-view. We estimated the CME velocities in
the different fields-of-view. It was found that CMEs slower than the solar wind
were accelerated, while CMEs faster than the solar wind were decelerated, with
both tending to the solar wind velocity.
