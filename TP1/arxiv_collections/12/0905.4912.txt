We use techniques from network science to study correlations in the foreign
exchange (FX) market over the period 1991--2008. We consider an FX market
network in which each node represents an exchange rate and each weighted edge
represents a time-dependent correlation between the rates. To provide insights
into the clustering of the exchange rate time series, we investigate dynamic
communities in the network. We show that there is a relationship between an
exchange rate's functional role within the market and its position within its
community and use a node-centric community analysis to track the time dynamics
of this role. This reveals which exchange rates dominate the market at
particular times and also identifies exchange rates that experienced
significant changes in market role. We also use the community dynamics to
uncover major structural changes that occurred in the FX market. Our techniques
are general and will be similarly useful for investigating correlations in
other markets.
