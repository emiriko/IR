Different characteristic of matter influencing the evolution of the Universe
has been simulated by means of a nonlinear spinor field. Exploiting the spinor
description of perfect fluid and dark energy evolution of the Universe given by
an anisotropic Bianchi type-I (BI) or isotropic Friedmann-Robertson-Walker
(FRW) one has been studied.
