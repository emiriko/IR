We investigate the transport of Brownian particles in a two-dimensional
potential under the action of a uniform external force. The potential is
periodic in one direction and confines the particle to a narrow channel of
varying cross-section in the other direction. We apply the standard long-wave
asymptotic analysis in the narrow dimension and show that the leading order
term is equivalent to that obtained previously from a direct extension of the
Fick-Jacobs approximation. We also show that the confining potential has
similar effects on the transport of Brownian particles to those induced by a
solid channel. Finally, we compare the analytical results with Brownian
dynamics simulations in the case of a sinusoidal variation of the width of the
parabolic potential in the cross-section. We obtain excellent agreement for the
marginal probability distribution, the average velocity of the Brownian
particles and the asymptotic dispersion coefficient, over a wide range of
Peclet numbers.
