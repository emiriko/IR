We study the existence and stability of multisite discrete breathers in two
prototypical non-square Klein-Gordon lattices, namely a honeycomb and a
hexagonal one. In the honeycomb case we consider six-site configurations and
find that for soft potential and positive coupling the out-of-phase breather
configuration and the charge-two vortex breather are linearly stable, while the
in-phase and charge-one vortex states are unstable. In the hexagonal lattice,
we first consider three-site configurations. In the case of soft potential and
positive coupling, the in-phase configuration is unstable and the charge-one
vortex is linearly stable. The out-of-phase configuration here is found to
always be linearly unstable. We then turn to six-site configurations in the
hexagonal lattice. The stability results in this case are the same as in the
six-site configurations in the honeycomb lattice. For all configurations in
both lattices, the stability results are reversed in the setting of either hard
potential or negative coupling. The study is complemented by numerical
simulations which are in very good agreement with the theoretical predictions.
Since neither the form of the on-site potential nor the sign of the coupling
parameter involved have been prescribed, this description can accommodate
inverse-dispersive systems (e.g., supporting backward waves) such as transverse
dust-lattice oscillations in dusty plasma (Debye) crystals or analogous modes
in molecular chains.
