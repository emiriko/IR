If the observed dark energy is a cosmological constant, the canonical state
of the universe is de Sitter spacetime. In such a spacetime, quantum
fluctuations that violate the null energy condition will create islands of
matter that, if large enough, may resemble our observable universe.
Phenomenological approaches to calculating density fluctuations yield a scale
invariant spectrum with suitable amplitude. With time, the island of matter
that is our observable universe, re-enters the cosmological constant sea.
