A discrete-state model of the F1-ATPase molecular motor is developed which
describes not only the dependences of the rotation and ATP consumption rates on
the chemical concentrations of ATP, ADP, and inorganic phosphate, but also on
mechanical control parameters such as the friction coefficient and the external
torque. The dependence on these mechanical parameters is given to the
discrete-state model by fitting its transition rates to the continuous-angle
model of P. Gaspard and E. Gerritsma [J. Theor. Biol. 247 (2007) 672-686]. This
discrete-state model describes the behavior of the F1 motor in the regime of
tight coupling between mechanical motion and chemical reaction. In this way,
kinetic and thermodynamic properties of the F1 motor are obtained such as the
Michaelis-Menten dependence of the rotation and ATP consumption rates on ATP
concentration and its extension in the presence of ADP and Pi, their
dependences on friction and external torque, as well as the chemical and
mechanical thermodynamic efficiencies.
