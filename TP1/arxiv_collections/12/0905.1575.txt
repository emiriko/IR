We investigate the spatial and temporal features of dense contaminant plumes
dynamics in porous materials. Our analysis is supported by novel experimental
results concerning pollutant concentration profiles inside a vertical column
setup. We describe the experimental methods and elucidate the salient outcomes
of the measurements, with focus on miscible fluids in homogeneous saturated
media. By resorting to a finite elements approach, we numerically solve the
equations that rule the pollutants migration and compare the simulation results
with the experimental data. Finally, we qualitatively explore the interfacial
dynamics behavior between the dense contaminant plume and the lighter resident
fluid that saturates the column.
