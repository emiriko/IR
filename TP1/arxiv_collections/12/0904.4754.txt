We point out that the {\em spacetime void} inferred by Castro[J. Math. Phys.
49, 042501, (2008)] results from his choice of a discontinuous radial gauge.
Further since the integration constant $\alpha_0 = 2M_0$ ($G=c=1$) occurring in
the vacuum Hilbert/Schwarzschild solution of a neutral "point mass" is zero
[Arnowitt et al., in Gravitation: An Introduction to Current Research, ed. L.
Witten, Wiley, Chap. 7, p.227; also Phys. Rev. Lett., 4, 375, (1960)]; A.
Mitra, Adv. Sp. Res., 38, 2917 (2006)] Castro's gauge reduces to the well
behaved and physical Hilbert gauge. Physically this means that true
Hilbert/Schwarzschild black holes have unique gravitational mass M=0.
Accordingly, the unphysical {\em spacetime viod} inferred by Castro is actually
non-existent.
