We investigate the dependence of several galaxy properties on the environment
and cluster identification techniques. We select clusters of galaxies from two
catalogues based on the SDSS: the ROSAT-SDSS Galaxy Cluster Survey, and the
MaxBCG Catalogue. Based on a volume limited sample of galaxies drawn from the
spectroscopic DR5 SDSS, we constructed sub-samples of clusters of galaxies with
more than ten members. Scaling relations as well as segregation of galaxy
properties as a function of the normalized clustocentric radii are analyzed.
The properties of galaxies in clusters are compared with those of field
galaxies. Galaxies in X-ray and MaxBCG selected clusters show similar
size-luminosity relations. At equal luminosity, late type galaxies in the field
have sizes smaller than cluster galaxies of the same morphological type. The
Faber-Jackson relation for early-type galaxies in clusters is also the same for
X-ray selected and MaxBCG clusters. We found clear differences between the
dynamical properties of galaxies in clusters, the brightest cluster galaxies
($BCG_s$) and field galaxies. Using several criteria to classify galaxies into
morphological types, we reproduce the well know morphological segregation. The
correlation is up to $r/r_{200} \sim 1$. For the whole range of clustocentric
distances, X-ray selected clusters present a higher fraction of early type
galaxies than MaxBCG clusters. We also found that bright galaxies
preferentially inhabit the cluster centers. Median sizes of galaxies, such as
the radius that enclose 50% of petrosian flux $r_{50}$, present a behaviour
that also depends on the cluster selection criteria. The resultsare discussed
in terms of the different processes that affect the evolution of galaxies in
different environments.
