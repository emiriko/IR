We describe a scheme for probing a gas of ultracold atoms trapped in an
optical lattice and moving in the presence of an external potential. The probe
is non-destructive and uses the existing lattice fields as the measurement
device. Two counter-propagating cavity fields simultaneously set up a
conservative lattice potential and a weak quantum probe of the atomic motion.
Balanced heterodyne detection of the probe field at the cavity output along
with integration in time and across the atomic cloud yield information about
the atomic dynamics in a single run. The scheme is applied to a measurement of
the Bloch oscillation frequency for atoms moving in the presence of the local
gravitational potential. Signal-to-noise ratios are estimated to be as high as
$10^4$.
