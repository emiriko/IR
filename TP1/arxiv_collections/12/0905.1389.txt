We study spin-state transition and phase separation involving this transition
based on the milti-orbital Hubbard model. Multiple spin states are realized by
changing the energy separation between the two orbitals and the on-site Hund
coupling. By utilizing the variational Monte-Carlo simulation, we analyze the
electronic and magnetic structures in hole doped and undoped states. Electronic
phase separation occurs between the low-spin band insulating state and the
high-spin ferromagnetic metallic one. Difference of the band widths in the two
orbitals is of prime importance for the spin-state transition and the phase
separation.
