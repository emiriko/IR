In the reversible Schrodinger-Newton equation a complex Newton coupling
G*exp(-i*alpha) is proposed in place of G. The equation becomes irreversible
and all initial one-body states are expected to converge to solitonic
stationary states. This feature is verified numerically. For two-body solutions
we point out that an effective Newtonian interaction is induced by the
imaginary mean-fields as if they were real. The effective strength of such
induced gravity depends on the local wave functions of the participating
distant bodies.
