Top plus jets production at hadron collider allows us to study the couplings
of the top quark. In the Standard Model, two single top processes contribute to
the top-jets final state. Beyond the Standard Model, additional direct top
production can occur. All three processes probe top gauge couplings including
flavor mixing. The structure of accompanying QCD jets allows us to separate the
direct top signal from the QCD backgrounds as well as to disentangle the three
top plus jets production mechanisms orthogonally to the usual bottom tags.
