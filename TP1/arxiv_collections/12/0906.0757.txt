For decades, the nuclear starburst has taken all the limelight in M82 with
very little discussion on M82 as a galaxy. The situation is changing over the
last decade, with the publication of some important results on the morphology
and stellar content of its disk and halo. In this review, we discuss these
recent findings in the framework of M82 as a galaxy. It is known for almost
half a century that M82 as a galaxy doesn't follow the trends expected for
normal galaxies that had prompted the morphologists to introduce a separate
morphological type under the name Irr II or amorphous. It is now being
understood that the main reasons behind its apparently distinct morphological
appearance are its peculiar star formation history, radial distribution of gas
density and the form of the rotation curve. The disk formed almost all of its
stars through a burst mode around 500 Myr ago, with the disk star formation
completely quenched around 100 Myr ago. The fossil record of the disk-wide
burst lies in the form of hundreds of compact star clusters, similar in mass to
that of the globular clusters in the Milky Way, but an order of magnitude
younger. The present star formation is restricted entirely to the central 500
pc zone, that contains more than 200 young compact star clusters. The disk
contains a non-star-forming spiral arm, hidden from the optical view by a
combination of extinction and high inclination to the line of sight. The halo
of M82 is also unusual in its stellar content, with evidence for star
formation, albeit at low levels, occurring continuously for over a gigayear. We
carefully examine each of the observed abnormality to investigate the overall
effect of interaction on the evolution of M82.
