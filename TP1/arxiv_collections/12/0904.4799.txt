We try to use scale-invariance and the large-N limit to find a non-trivial 4d
O(N) scalar field model with controlled UV behavior and naturally light scalar
excitations. The principle is to fix interactions by requiring the effective
action for space-time dependent background fields to be finite and
scale-invariant when regulators are removed. We find a line of non-trivial UV
fixed-points in the large-N limit, parameterized by a dimensionless coupling.
They reduce to classical la phi^4 theory when hbar -> 0. For hbar non-zero,
neither action nor measure is scale-invariant, but the effective action is.
Scale invariance makes it natural to set a mass deformation to zero. The model
has phases where O(N) invariance is unbroken or spontaneously broken. Masses of
the lightest excitations above the unbroken vacuum are found. We derive a
non-linear equation for oscillations about the broken vacuum. The interaction
potential is shown to have a locality property at large-N. In 3d, our
construction reduces to the line of large-N fixed-points in |phi|^6 theory.
