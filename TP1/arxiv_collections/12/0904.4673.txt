We examine the phase diagram of the half-filled one-dimensional extended
Hubbard model using quantum information entropies within the density-matrix
renormalization group. It is well known that there is a charge-density-wave
phase at large nearest-neighbor and small on-site Coloumb repulsion and a
spin-density-wave at small nearest-neighbor and large on-site Coloumb
repulsion. At intermediate Coulomb interaction strength, we find an additional
narrow region of a bond-order phase between these two phases. The phase
transition line for the transition out of the charge-density-wave phase changes
from first-order at strong coupling to second-order in a parameter regime where
all three phases are present. We present evidence that the additional
phase-transition line between the spin-density-wave and bond-order phases is
infinite order. While these results are in agreement with recent numerical
work, our study provides an independent, unbiased means of determining the
phase boundaries by using quantum information analysis, yields values for the
location of some of the phase boundaries that differ from those previously
found, and provides insight into the limitations of numerical methods in
determining phase boundaries, especially those of infinite-order transitions.
