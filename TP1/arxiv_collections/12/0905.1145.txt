The so-called STIT tessellations form the class of homogeneous (spatially
stationary) tessellations of $\mathbb{R}^d$ which are stable under the
nesting/iteration operation. In this paper, we establish the strong mixing
property for these tessellations and give the optimal form of the rate of decay
for the quantity $|\mathbb{P}({A}\cap Y=\emptyset,T_h B \cap
Y=\emptyset)-\mathbb{P}({A}\cap Y=\emptyset)\mathbb{P}({B}\cap Y=\emptyset)|$
when $A$ and $B$ are two compact sets, $h$ a vector of $\mathbb{R}^d$, $T_{h}$
the corresponding translation operator and $Y$ a STIT Tessellation.
