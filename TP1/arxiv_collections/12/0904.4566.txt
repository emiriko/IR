Chromatin organization and dynamics is studied in this work at scales ranging
from single nucleosome to nucleosomal array by using a unique combination of
biochemical assays, single molecule imaging technique and numerical modeling.
We demonstrate that a subtle modification in the nucleosome structure induced
by the histone variant H2A.Bbd drastically modifies the higher order
organization of the nucleosomal arrays. Importantly, as directly visualized by
AFM, conventional H2A nucleosomal arrays exhibit specific local organization,
in contrast to H2A.Bbd arrays, which show "beads on a string" structure. The
combination of systematic image analysis and theoretical modeling allows a
quantitative description relating the observed gross structural changes of the
arrays to their local organization. Our results strongly suggest that
higher-order organization of H1-free nucleosomal arrays is mainly determined by
the fluctuation properties of individual nucleosomes. Moreover, numerical
simulations suggest the existence of attractive interactions between
nucleosomes to provide the degree of compaction observed for conventional
chromatin fibers.
