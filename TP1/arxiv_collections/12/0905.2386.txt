Let $|A|$ denote the cardinality of a finite set $A$. For any real number $x$
define $t(x)=x$ if $x\geq1$ and 1 otherwise. For any finite sets $A,B$ let
$\delta(A,B)$ $=$ $\log_{2}(t(|B\cap\bar{A}||A|))$. We define {This appears as

$\max\{\delta(A,B),\delta(B,A)\} $ which may be applied to measure the distance
between binary strings of different lengths. The distance is based on a
classical combinatorial notion of information introduced by Kolmogorov.
