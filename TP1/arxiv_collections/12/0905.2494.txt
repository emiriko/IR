Experimental data on the onset of a so-called anomalous J/psi suppression in
PbPb collisions at the SPS are considered in the framework of string
percolation model. This onset is observed at a certain collision centrality,
characterized by the number of nucleons-participants (Npart) related to the
impact-parameter. Modified Bjorken formula calculations are performed for the
local energy densities in AA collisions at different impact-parameters and with
detailed account of the latest data available on the charged particles
densities at midrapidity. Finally we compare variations of mean local energy
and of string densities and match the occurrence of the critical percolation
phenomenon with the critical energy density value, considering them at the same
values of Npart. Similar analysis was performed for recent RHIC data and the
results are discussed.
