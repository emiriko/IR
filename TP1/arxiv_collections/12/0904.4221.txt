This article is about my memories from the discovery that the Veneziano model
describes in fact interacting strings. I came to the understanding of that the
dual or Veneziano model is really a model of strings independently of L.
Susskind and Y. Nambu. A characteristic feature of my approach was that I used
thinking of very high order "fishnet" or planar Feynman diagrams as the way of
at first describing the development of the strings. A chain of constituents
leads to planar diagrams dominating when only neighbours on the chain interact
significantly. The article also mentions the works of Ziro Koba and mine about
extending the Veneziano model first to five external particles - as Bardakci
and Ruegg, Chan Tsou, and Goebel and Sakita also did - and subsequently to an
arbitrary number n of external mesons.
