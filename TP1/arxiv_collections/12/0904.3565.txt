We advocate support of research aimed at developing alternatives to the
photomultiplier tube for photon detection in large astroparticle experiments
such as gamma-ray and neutrino astronomy, and direct dark matter detectors.
Specifically, we discuss the development of large area photocathode
microchannel plate photomultipliers and silicon photomultipliers. Both
technologies have the potential to exhibit improved photon detection efficiency
compared to existing glass vacuum photomultiplier tubes.
