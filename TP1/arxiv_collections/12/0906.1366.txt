In Newtonian gravitational theory, a tidal Love number relates the mass
multipole moment created by tidal forces on a spherical body to the applied
tidal field. The Love number is dimensionless, and it encodes information about
the body's internal structure. We present a relativistic theory of Love
numbers, which applies to compact bodies with strong internal gravities; the
theory extends and completes a recent work by Flanagan and Hinderer, which
revealed that the tidal Love number of a neutron star can be measured by
Earth-based gravitational-wave detectors. We consider a spherical body deformed
by an external tidal field, and provide precise and meaningful definitions for
electric-type and magnetic-type Love numbers; and these are computed for
polytropic equations of state. The theory applies to black holes as well, and
we find that the relativistic Love numbers of a nonrotating black hole are all
zero.
