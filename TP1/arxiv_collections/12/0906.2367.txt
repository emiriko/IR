We prove that the only four dimensional, stationary, rotating, asymptotically
flat (analytic) vacuum black hole with a single degenerate horizon is given by
the extremal Kerr solution. We also prove a similar uniqueness theorem for the
extremal Kerr-Newman solution. This closes a longstanding gap in the black hole
uniqueness theorems.
