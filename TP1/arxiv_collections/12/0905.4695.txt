The current flowing from a superconductor to a two-terminal setup describing
a nanostructure connected to normal-metal leads is studied. We provide an
example of scattering matrix giving ideal splitting off electrons from a Cooper
pair by means of Cauchy-Bunyakovsky-Schwarz inequality. The proposal of the
junction and its possible variants are discussed in a context of possible
experiments.
