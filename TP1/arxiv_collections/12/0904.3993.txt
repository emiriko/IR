Leon Rosenfeld published in 1930 the first systematic Hamiltonian approach to
Lagrangian models that possess a local gauge symmetry. The application of this
formalism to theories with local internal symmetries, such as electromagnetism
in interaction with charged matter fields, is valid and complete, and predates
by two decades the work by Dirac and Bergmann. Although he provided a
group-theoretical justification for gauge fixing procedures that had just been
implemented in the first expositions of quantum electrodynamics by Heisenberg
and Pauli, and also by Fermi, his contribution went largely unnoticed. This
lack of impact seems to be related to a generalized disenchantment with second
quantization in the 1930's and 1940's.
