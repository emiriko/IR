We investigate the statistical properties of the photon-subtractions from the
two-mode squeezed vacuum state and its decoherence in a thermal environment. It
is found that the state can be considered as a squeezed two-variable Hermite
polynomial excitation vacuum and the normalization of this state is the Jacobi
polynomial of the squeezing parameter. The compact expression for Wigner
function (WF) is also derived analytically by using the Weyl ordered operators'
invariance under similar transformations. Especially, the nonclassicality is
discussed in terms of the negativity of WF. The effect of decoherence on this
state is then discussed by deriving the analytical time evolution results of
WF. It is shown that the WF is always positive for any squeezing parameter and
photon-subtraction number if the decay time exceeds an upper bound (}$\kappa
t>{1/2}\ln \frac{2\bar{n}+2}{2\bar{n}+1}).
