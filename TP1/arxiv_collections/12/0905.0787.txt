We propose a mesoscopic circuit in the quantum Hall effect regime comprising
two uncorrelated single-particle sources and two distant Mach-Zehnder
interferometers with magnetic fluxes, which allows in a controllable way to
produce orbitally entangled electrons. Two-particle correlations appear as a
consequence of erasing of which path information due to collisions taking place
at distant interferometers and in general at different times. The two-particle
correlations manifest themselves as an Aharonov-Bohm effect in noise while the
current is insensitive to magnetic fluxes. In an appropriate time-interval the
concurrence reaches a maximum and a Bell inequality is violated.
