We investigate the mechanism of weak measurement by using an interferometric
framework. In order to appropriately elucidate the interference effect that
occurs in weak measurement, we introduce an interferometer for particles with
internal degrees of freedom. It serves as a framework common to quantum eraser
and weak measurement. We demonstrate that the geometric phase, particularly the
Pancharatnam phase, results from the post-selection of the internal state, and
thereby the interference pattern is changed. It is revealed that the
extraordinary displacement of the probe wavepackets in weak measurement is
achieved owing to the Pancharatnam phase associated with post-selection.
