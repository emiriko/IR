CDF Run II data for the underlying event associated with Drell-Yan lepton
pair production are examined as a function of the lepton-pair transverse
momentum. The data are compared with a previous analysis on the behavior of the
underlying event in high transverse momentum jet production and also with
several other QCD Monte-Carlo models. The goal is to provide data that can be
used to tune and improve the QCD Monte-Carlo models of the underlying event,
which is especially important now in view of the LHC startup.
