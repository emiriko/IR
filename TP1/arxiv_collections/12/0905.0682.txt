We present the performance of Multi-gap timing RPCs under irradiation by
fully stripped relativistic ions (gamma*beta=2.7, Z=1-6). A time resolution of
80 ps at high efficiency has been obtained by just using standard `off the
shelf' 4-gap timing RPCs from the new HADES ToF wall. The resolution worsened
to 100 ps for ~ 1 kHz/cm2 proton flux and for ~ 100 Hz/cm2 Carbon flux. The
chambers were operated at a standard field of E=100 kV/cm and showed a high
stability during the experiment, supporting the fact that RPCs are a convenient
choice when accommodating a very broad range of ionizing particles is needed.
  The data provides insight in the region of very highly ionizing particles (up
to x 36 mips) and can be used to constrain the existing avalanche and
Space-Charge models far from the usual `mip valley'. The implications of these
results for the general case of detection based on secondary processes (n,
gamma) resulting in highly ionizing particles with characteristic energy
distributions will be discussed, together with the nature of the time-charge
correlation curve.
