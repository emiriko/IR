Present ultra-fast laser optics is at the frontier between atto- and
zeptosecond photon pulses, giving rise to unprecedented applications. We show
that high-energetic photon pulses down to the yoctosecond timescale can be
produced in heavy ion collisions. We focus on photons produced during the
initial phase of the expanding quark-gluon plasma. We study how the time
evolution and properties of the plasma may influence the duration and shape of
the photon pulse. Prospects for achieving double peak structures suitable for
pump-probe experiments at the yoctosecond timescale are discussed.
