We report the discovery of oscillations in the hot subdwarf B star JL 166
from time-series photometry using the Goodman Spectrograph on the 4.1-m
Southern Astrophysical Research Telescope. Previous spectroscopic and
photometric observations place the star near the hot end of the empirical sdB
instability strip and imply the presence of a cool companion. Amplitude spectra
of the stellar light curve reveal at least 10 independent pulsation modes with
periods ranging from 97 to 178 s and amplitudes from 0.9 to 4 mma. We adopt
atmospheric parameters of T_eff = 34350 K and log g = 5.75 from a model
atmosphere analysis of our time-averaged, medium-resolution spectrum.
