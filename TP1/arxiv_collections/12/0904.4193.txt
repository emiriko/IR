In many settings the power of truthful mechanisms is severely bounded. In
this paper we use randomization to overcome this problem. In particular, we
construct an FPTAS for multi-unit auctions that is truthful in expectation,
whereas there is evidence that no polynomial-time truthful deterministic
mechanism provides an approximation ratio better than 2.
  We also show for the first time that truthful in expectation polynomial-time
mechanisms are \emph{provably} stronger than polynomial-time universally
truthful mechanisms. Specifically, we show that there is a setting in which:
(1) there is a non-polynomial time truthful mechanism that always outputs the
optimal solution, and that (2) no universally truthful randomized mechanism can
provide an approximation ratio better than 2 in polynomial time, but (3) an
FPTAS that is truthful in expectation exists.
