Single crystals of Fe$_{1/4}$TaS$_{2}$ have been studied by using
magneto-optical (MO) imaging and radio-frequency (rf) magnetic susceptibility,
$\chi$. Real time MO images reveal unusual, slow dynamics of dendritic domain
formation, the details of which are strongly dependent upon magnetic and
thermal history. Measurements of $\chi(T)$ show well-defined, local moment
ferromagnetic transition at $T\approx 155$ K as well as thermal hysteresis for
50 K$<T<$60 K. This temperature range corresponds to the domain formation
temperature as determined by MO. Together these observations provide strong
evidence for local moment ferromagnetism in Fe$_{1/4}$TaS$_{2}$ crystals with
large, temperature dependent magnetic anisotropy.
