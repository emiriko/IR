The properties of the neutrino in the early universe have been investigated
incorporating a small inhomogeneity in the mass density of the early universe.
Dependence on this factor is found in studying mean free path and mass bound of
neutrinos. The oscillations of neutrinos flavours have been studied by assuming
a free wave packet to represent the time progression of the neutrino yielding
interesting results.
