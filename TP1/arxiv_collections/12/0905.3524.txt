Meissner type superconductivity extending up to 13 - 18 degrees Celsius was
confirmed in the composite material consisting of metallic particles Ag5Pb2O6
dispersed in an insulating CuO matrix, and superconductivity mechanism is based
upon inter particle interaction acting in the quantum tunnelling regime.
