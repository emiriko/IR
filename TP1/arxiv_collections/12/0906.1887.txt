Modern graphics processing units (GPUs) are inexpensive commodity hardware
that offer Tflop/s theoretical computing capacity. GPUs are well suited to many
compute-intensive tasks including digital signal processing.
  We describe the implementation and performance of a GPU-based digital
correlator for radio astronomy. The correlator is implemented using the NVIDIA
CUDA development environment. We evaluate three design options on two
generations of NVIDIA hardware. The different designs utilize the internal
registers, shared memory and multiprocessors in different ways. We find that
optimal performance is achieved with the design that minimizes global memory
reads on recent generations of hardware.
  The GPU-based correlator outperforms a single-threaded CPU equivalent by a
factor of 60 for a 32 antenna array, and runs on commodity PC hardware. The
extra compute capability provided by the GPU maximises the correlation
capability of a PC while retaining the fast development time associated with
using standard hardware, networking and programming languages. In this way, a
GPU-based correlation system represents a middle ground in design space between
high performance, custom built hardware and pure CPU-based software
correlation.
  The correlator was deployed at the Murchison Widefield Array 32 antenna
prototype system where it ran in real-time for extended periods. We briefly
describe the data capture, streaming and correlation system for the prototype
array.
