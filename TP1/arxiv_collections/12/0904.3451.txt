The construction of the Zhang-Rice singlet is revisited in the light of
recent understanding of high-temperature superconductors at optimal doping. A
minimal local model is derived which contains the physical regime found
relevant for ARPES experiments, characterized by significant direct
oxygen-oxygen hopping. For the values of orbital parameters indicated by
experiment, the Zhang-Rice singlet is strongly mixed with a pure oxygen singlet
of the same symmetry. The destabilization of the Zhang-Rice ground state is due
to the oxygen singlet having twice as large a coherence factor with respect to
oxygen-oxygen hopping. An analogous quantum phase transition is identified in
the t-t'-J model. The orbital-antisymmetric copper-oxygen singlet is confirmed
to be irrelevant, as found originally. The usual symmetry analysis is extended
to include dynamical symmetries.
