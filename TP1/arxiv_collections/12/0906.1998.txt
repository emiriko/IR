We discuss the dynamical system approach applied to Higher Order Theories of
Gravity. We show that once the theory of gravity has been specified, the
cosmological equations can be written as a first-order autonomous system and we
give several examples which illustrate the utility of our method. We also
discuss a number of results which have appeared recently in the literature.
