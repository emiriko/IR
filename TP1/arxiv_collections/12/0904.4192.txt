Dynamic space-times, especially those manifesting horizons, provide useful
laboratories for examining how macroscopic quantum behaviors consistently
co-generate gravitational phenomena. For this reason, the behaviors and
large-scale causal structures of spatially coherent dynamic black holes will be
explored in this presentation. Geodesic motions on an evaporating black hole
will also be presented. Research recently completed with Beth Brown, including
her final Penrose diagram for an accreting black hole, will be presented.
