We present $u'g'R$ optical images taken with the MMT/Megacam and the
Subaru/Suprime of the Extended Groth Strip survey. The total survey covers an
area of about $\sim 1$ degree$^2$, including four sub-fields and is optimized
for the study of galaxies at $z\sim3$. Our methods for photometric calibration
in AB magnitudes, the limiting magnitude and the galaxy number count are
described. A sample of 1642 photometrically selected candidate LBGs to an
apparent $R_{AB}$ magnitude limit of 25.0 is present. The average sky surface
density of our LBGs sample is $\sim$ 1.0 arcmin$^{-2}$, slightly higher than
the previous finding.
