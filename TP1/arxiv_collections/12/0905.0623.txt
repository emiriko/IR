The FINUDA experiment performed a systematic study of the charged mesonic
weak decay channel of $p$-shell $\Lambda$-hypernuclei. Negatively charged pion
spectra from mesonic decay were measured with magnetic analysis for the first
time for ${^{7}_{\Lambda}Li}$, ${^{9}_{\Lambda}Be}$, ${^{11}_{\Lambda}B}$ and
${^{15}_{\Lambda}N}$. The shape of the $\pi^{-}$ spectra was interpreted
through a comparison with pion distorted wave calculations that take into
account the structure of both hypernucleus and daughter nucleus. Branching
ratios $\Gamma_{\pi^{-}}/\Gamma_{tot}$ were derived from the measured spectra
and converted to $\pi^{-}$ decay rates $\Gamma_{\pi^{-}}$ by means of known or
extrapolated total decay widths $\Gamma_{tot}$ of $p$-shell
$\Lambda$-hypernuclei. Based on these measurements, the spin-parity assignment
$1/2^+$ for ${^{7}_{\Lambda}Li}$ and $5/2^+$ for ${^{11}_{\Lambda}B}$
ground-state are confirmed and a spin-parity $3/2^+$ for ${^{15}_{\Lambda}N}$
ground-state is assigned for the first time.
