Despite decades of extensive research, the large-scale analysis of membrane
proteins remains a difficult task. This is due to the fact that membrane
proteins require a carefully balanced hydrophilic and lipophilic environment,
which optimum varies with different proteins, while most protein chemistry
methods work mainly, if not only, in water-based media. Taking this review
[Santoni, Molloy and Rabilloud, Membrane proteins and proteomics: un amour
impossible? Electrophoresis 2000, 21, 1054-1070] as a pivotal paper, the
current paper analyzes how the field of membrane proteomics exacerbated the
trend in proteomics, i.e. developing alternate methods to the historical
two-dimensional electrophoresis, and thus putting more and more pressure on the
mass spectrometry side. However, in the case of membrane proteins, the
incentive in doing so is due to the poor solubility of membrane proteins. This
review also shows that in some situations, where this solubility problem is
less acute, two-dimensional electrophoresis remains a method of choice. Last
but not least, this review also critically examines the alternate approaches
that have been used for the proteomic analysis of membrane proteins.
