We calculate properties like equilibrium lattice parameter, bulk modulus and
monovacancy formation energy for nickel (Ni), iron (Fe) and chromium (Cr) using
Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT). We compare relative performance of
local density approximation (LDA) and generalized gradient approximation (GGA)
for predicting such physical properties for these metals. We also make a
relative study between two different flavors of GGA exchange correlation
functional, namely, PW91 and PBE. These calculations show that there is a
discrepancy between DFT calculations and experimental data. In order to
understand this discrepancy in the calculation of vacancy formation energy, we
introduce a correction for the surface intrinsic error corresponding to an
exchange correlation functional using the scheme implemented by Mattsson et al.
[Phys. Rev. B 73, 195123 (2006)] and compare the effectiveness of the
correction scheme for Al and the 3d-transition metals.
