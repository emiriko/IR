We report on preliminary identified particle ratios from Au+Au collisions at
$\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 62.4$ GeV in different centrality classes, measured with the
BRAHMS spectrometer. Results from Cu+Cu and p+p collisions at mid-rapidity at
the same energy are also included. The average transverse momenta of particle
spectra, anti-particle to particle ratios and $K/\pi$ ratios dependence on
centrality and rapidity are shown and discussed.
