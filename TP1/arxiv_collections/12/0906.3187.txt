We study the Gamma Ray Burst (GRB) environment and intervening absorbers by
analyzing the optical absorption features produced by gas surrounding the GRB
or along its line of sight. We analyzed high resolution spectroscopic
observations (R=40000, S/N=3 - 6) of the optical afterglow of GRB080330, taken
with UVES at the VLT ~ 1.5 hours after the GRB trigger. The spectrum
illustrates the complexity of the ISM of the GRB host galaxy at z = 1.51 which
has at least four components in the main absorption system. We detect strong
FeII, SiII, and NiII excited absorption lines associated with the bluemost
component only. In addition to the host galaxy, at least two more absorbers
lying along the line of sight to the afterglow have been detected in the
redshift range 0.8 < z < 1.1, each exhibiting MgII absorption. For the bluemost
component in the host galaxy, we derive information about its distance from the
site of the GRB explosion. We do so by assuming that the excited absorption
lines are produced by indirect UV pumping, and compare the data with a time
dependent photo-excitation code. The distance of this component is found to be
280+40-50 pc, which is lower than found for other GRBs (1 - 6 kpc). We identify
two additional MgII absorbers, one of them with a rest frame equivalent width
larger than 1A. The distance between the GRB and the absorber measured in this
paper confirms that the power of the GRB radiation can influence the conditions
of the interstellar medium up to a distance of at least several hundred pc. For
the intervening absorbers, we confirm the trend that on average one strong
intervening system is found per afterglow, as has been noted in studies
exhibiting an excess of strong MgII absorbers along GRB sightlines compared to
quasars.
