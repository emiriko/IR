The global in time existence of solutions of a system describing the
interaction of gravitationally attracting particles with a general diffusion
term and fixed energy is proved. The presented theory covers the case of the
model with diffusion that obeys Fermi-Dirac statistics. Some of the results
apply to the dissipative polytropic case as well.
