We introduce a general range of science drivers for using the Virtual
Observatory (VO) and identify some common aspects to these as well as the
advantages of VO data access. We then illustrate the use of existing VO tools
to tackle multi wavelength science problems. We demonstrate the ease of multi
mission data access using the VOExplorer resource browser, as provided by
AstroGrid (http://www.astrogrid.org) and show how to pass the various results
into any VO enabled tool such as TopCat for catalogue correlation. VOExplorer
offers a powerful data-centric visualisation for browsing and filtering the
entire VO registry using an iTunes type interface. This allows the user to
bookmark their own personalised lists of resources and to run tasks on the
selected resources as desired. We introduce an example of how more advanced
querying can be performed to access existing X-ray cluster of galaxies
catalogues and then select extended only X-ray sources as candidate clusters of
galaxies in the 2XMMi catalogue. Finally we introduce scripted access to VO
resources using python with AstroGrid and demonstrate how the user can pass on
the results of such a search and correlate with e.g. optical datasets such as
Sloan. Hence we illustrate the power of enabling large scale data mining of
multi wavelength resources in an easily reproducible way using the VO.
