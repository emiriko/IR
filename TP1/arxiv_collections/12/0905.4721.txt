We analyze the Tevatron reach for neutral Higgs bosons in the Minimal
Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM), using current exclusion limits on the
Standard Model Higgs. We study four common benchmark scenarios for the soft
supersymmetry-breaking parameters of the MSSM, including cases where the Higgs
decays differ significantly from the Standard Model, and provide projections
for the improvements in luminosity and efficiency required for the Tevatron to
probe sizeable regions of the $(m_A, \tan\beta)$ plane.
