The discovery of atomic nucleus by E. Rutherford, at the beginning of the
twentieth century, was the Nuclear Physics original landmark. From then, a
series of experiments in which beams of particles composed of neutrons, protons
and others, brought to collide with a nucleus in order to unravel its structure
or produce artificial elements through nuclear transmutation, were triggered.
With the development of experimental equipment, a number of other nuclear
phenomena have been observed, such as beta decay, nuclear fission and fusion,
M\"oesbauer effect, etc. In view of the global political and economic landscape
and the contemporary educational trends, this work suggest alternative topics
in nuclear physics that can be discussed at the conceptual level in high school
teaching, where the main focus lies in the historical and technological
importance of such phenomena in society.
