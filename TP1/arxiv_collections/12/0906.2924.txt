A line L is a transversal to a family F of convex objects in R^d if it
intersects every member of F. In this paper we show that for every integer d>2
there exists a family of 2d-1 pairwise disjoint unit balls in R^d with the
property that every subfamily of size 2d-2 admits a transversal, yet any line
misses at least one member of the family. This answers a question of Danzer
from 1957.
