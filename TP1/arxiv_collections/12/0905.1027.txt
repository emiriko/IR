We develop two methods to calculate the momentum distribution of the
insulating (Mott and charge-density-wave) phases of the extended Bose-Hubbard
model with on-site and nearest-neighbor boson-boson repulsions on
$d$-dimensional hypercubic lattices. First we construct the random phase
approximation result, which corresponds to the exact solution for the
infinite-dimensional limit. Then we perform a power-series expansion in the
hopping $t$ via strong-coupling perturbation theory, to evaluate the momentum
distribution in two and three dimensions; we also use the strong-coupling
theory to verify the random phase approximation solution in infinite
dimensions. Finally, we briefly discuss possible implications of our results in
the context of ultracold dipolar Bose gases with dipole-dipole interactions
loaded into optical lattices.
