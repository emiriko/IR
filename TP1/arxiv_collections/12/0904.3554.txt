We study the Kitaev model on a ladder network and find the complete spectrum
of the Hamiltonian in closed form. Closed and manageable forms for all
eigenvalues and eigenvectors, allow us to calculate the partition function and
averages of non-local operators in addition to the reduced density matrices of
different subsystems at arbitrary temperatures. It is also briefly discussed
how these considerations can be generalized to more general lattices, including
three-leg ladders and two dimensional square lattices.
