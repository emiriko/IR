The difficulty in producing precisely timed and controlled quantum gates is a
significant source of error in many physical implementations of quantum
computers. Here we introduce a simple universal primitive, adiabatic gate
teleportation, which is robust to timing errors and many control errors and
maintains a constant energy gap throughout the computation above a degenerate
ground state space. Notably this construction allows for geometric robustness
based upon the control of two independent qubit interactions. Further, our
piecewise adiabatic evolution easily relates to the quantum circuit model,
enabling the use of standard methods from fault-tolerance theory for
establishing thresholds.
