In this paper we examine some aspects of the field of a scalar point charge
in curved spacetimes. First we find the closed form solution for the scalar
field due to a point charge in Schwarzschild spacetime. Then we expand it
locally in powers of r (coordinate distance from the charge) and compare it to
Quinn's local expansion for the field of scalar charge. We show a term by term
match, except for a mismatch in one term arising due to an error in a Riemann
tensor term in Quinn's expression. We show the correct expression, the detailed
derivation of which will be subject of a later paper.
