Originally designed for CP violation studies in the B meson system, the
B-Factories recently showed an exciting capability for improving our
experimental knowledge in the field of hadron spectroscopy. Here I will present
some of the most recent BABAR results concerning bottomonium spectroscopy. In
particular, I will report the first observation of the ground state eta_b in
Y(nS) gamma eta_b and the results of an energy scan in the range of 10.54 to
11.20 GeV, that produced a new measurement of the e+e- -> bb cross section in
the region of the Y(4S) and candidate Y(5S) and Y(6S) resonances, with an
integrated luminosity 30 times larger than the previous scans.
