The major aim of nucleus-nucleus collisions at the LHC is to study the
physics of strongly interacting matter and the quark gluon plasma (QGP), formed
in extreme conditions of temperature and energy density. We give a brief
overview of the experimental program and discuss the signatures and observables
for a detailed study of QGP matter.
