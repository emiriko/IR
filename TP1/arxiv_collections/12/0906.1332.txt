Explicit results for various quantum thermodynamic function (QTF) of a
charged magneto-oscillator coupled to a heat bath at arbitrary temperature are
demonstrated in this paper. Discernible expressions for different QTF in the
two limits of very low and very high temperatures are presented for three
popular heat bath models : Ohmic, single relaxation time and blackbody
radiation. The central result is that the effect of magnetic field turns out to
be important at low temperatures yet crucial at high temperatures. It is
observed that the dissipation parameter, $\gamma$, and the cyclotron frequency,
$\omega_c$, affect the decaying or rising behaviour of various QTF in just the
opposite way to each other at low temperatures. In the high temperature regime,
the effect of $\gamma$ is much pronounced than that of $\omega_c$.
