The thermally activated behavior of the gate defined narrow Hall bars is
studied by analyzing the existence of the incompressible strips within a
Hartree-type approximation. We perform self-consistent calculations considering
the linear response regime, supported by a local conductivity model. We
investigate the variation of the activation energy depending on the width of
samples in the range of $2d\sim [1-10] \mu m$. We show that the largest
activation energy of high-mobility narrow samples, is at the low field edge of
Hall filling factor 2 plateau (exceeding half of the cyclotron energy), whereas
for relatively wide samples the higher activation energy is obtained at the
high field edge of Hall plateau. In contrast to the single-particle theories
based on the localization of electronic states, we found that the activation
energy is almost independent of the properties of the density of states.
