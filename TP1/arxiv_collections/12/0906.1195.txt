To measure the energy spread of a energy electron beam up to $5 GeV$ in a
single shoot measurement the possible applications of an existing magnet as
spectrometer has been discussed. For distinguishing the energy resolution and
an optimal experimental setup numerical simulation, based on the measured
magnetic field, have been performed.
