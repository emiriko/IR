We compute the radial distributions of the vector and axial charge density as
well as of the matter density in the heavy-light mesons on the lattice. The
results for the lowest lying static heavy-light mesons and their first excited
counterparts are obtained with Nf=2 dynamical quarks of Wilson (Clover) type
and with the various improved static heavy quark actions. From these
distributions we were able to compute the corresponding charges and slopes of
the form factors (i.e. <r^2>). Those results are also presented, and briefly
discussed too.
