A non-cosmological origin for the CMB quadrupole moment is suggested in this
paper. Geometric distortions to an otherwise isotropic CMB could be imprinted
on the CMB radiation as it propagates through the asymmetric termination shock
formed at the boundary of the solar wind and the local interstellar medium. In
addition to this boundary distortion, the Voyager spacecraft observed abrupt
changes in plasma properties and rapidly fluctuating magnetic and electric
fields as they recently crossed the termination shock and entered the
heliosheath. Several mechanisms are discussed which could potentially imprint
the termination shock distortion on the CMB. Temporal variations of this
distortion due to solar wind pressure wind changes could manifest in the
multipole moments of the CMB. Speculations are presented for the effect of
heliosheath radiative and dynamical processes on the observed small-scale
angular power spectrum of the CMB.
