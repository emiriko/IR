The coalgebra approach to the construction of classical integrable systems
from Poisson coalgebras is reviewed, and the essential role played by
symplectic realizations in this framework is emphasized. Many examples of
Hamiltonians with either undeformed or q-deformed coalgebra symmetry are given,
and their Liouville superintegrability is discussed. Among them,
(quasi-maximally) superintegrable systems on N-dimensional curved spaces of
nonconstant curvature are analysed in detail. Further generalizations of the
coalgebra approach that make use of comodule and loop algebras are presented.
The generalization of such a coalgebra symmetry framework to quantum mechanical
systems is straightforward.
