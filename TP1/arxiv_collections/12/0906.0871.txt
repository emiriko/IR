The debiting process of the remarkable properties materials can be managed
through unconventional technologies as the complex electrical erosion. We
present the modeling of the previous experimental results to obtain a
mathematical dependence of the output parameters (processing time, surface
quality) on the input parameters (voltage or current). All the experimental
data are memorized on a database and for each particular debiting process a new
dependence is built. Because all the experiments applied in the Romanian
laboratories or practical applications of the nonconventional technological
processes in the factories were based on the particular conditions of one
activity, this papers presents the technical implementation of a computer-aided
solution that keeps all previous experimental data, optimizes the processing
conditions and eventual manage the driving gear. The flow-chart we present in
this paper offers a solution for practitioners to reduce the electrical
consumption while a technological processing of special materials is necessary.
The computer program and the database can be easily adapted to any
technological processes (conventional or not).
