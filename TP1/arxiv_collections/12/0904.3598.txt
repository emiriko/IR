The new experimental data of kaon photoproduction on the nucleon, gamma p ->
K+ Lambda, have been analyzed by means of a multipoles model. Different from
the previous models, in this analysis the resonance decay widths are
constrained to the values given by the Particle Data Group (PDG). The result
indicates that constraining these parameters to the PDG values could
dramatically change the conclusion of the important resonances in this reaction
found in the previous studies.
