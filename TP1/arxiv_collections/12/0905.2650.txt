We show that the set R(w_0) of reduced expressions for the longest element in
the hyperoctahedral group exhibits the cyclic sieving phenomenon. More
specifically, R(w_0) possesses a natural cyclic action given by moving the
first letter of a word to the end, and we show that the orbit structure of this
action is encoded by the generating function for the major index on R(w_0).
