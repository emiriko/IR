Classical field theory is adequately formulated as Lagrangian theory on fibre
bundles and graded manifolds. One however observes that non-trivial higher
stage Noether identities and gauge symmetries of a generic reducible degenerate
Lagrangian field theory fail to be defined. Therefore, such a field theory can
not be quantized.
