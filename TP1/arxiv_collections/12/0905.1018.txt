Dalitz analyses in charm give access to both magnitudes and phases of the
charm decay amplitudes. They play a significant role in charm-mixing
measurements, in the measurement of the CP-violating phase gamma in B decays to
charm, and in the analysis of light meson resonances. We review recent results
in all three categories.
