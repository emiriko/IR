We consider a thin accretion disc warped due to the Bardeen-Petterson effect,
presenting both analytical and numerical solutions for the situation that the
two viscosity coefficients vary with radius as power law, with the two power
law indices not necessarily equal. The analytical solutions are compared with
numerical ones, showing that our new analytical solution is more accurate than
previous one, which overestimates the inclination changing in the outer disc.
Our new analytical solution is appropriate for moderately warped discs, while
for extremely misaligned disc, only numerical solution is appropriate.
