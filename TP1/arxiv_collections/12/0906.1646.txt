We study a simple extension of the standard model to simultaneously explain
neutrino masses, dark matter and the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the
Universe. In our model, the baryon asymmetry is achieved by the leptogenesis
mechanism, while the decaying dark matter with the lifetime of O(10^26 s)
provides a natural solution to the electron and positron excesses in Fermi and
PAMELA satellite experiments. In particular, we emphasize that our model is
sensitive to the structure at the endpoint around 1 TeV of the Fermi data. In
addition, some of new particles proposed in the model are within the reach at
the near future colliders, such as the Large Hadron Collider.
