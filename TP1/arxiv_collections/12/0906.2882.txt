We study the effects of an in-plane magnetic field on the ground state
properties of both gapless and gapped graphene sheets within Random Phase
Approximation. The critical magnetic field which leads to a fully spin
polarized phase increases by decreasing the carrier density at zero gap
indicating that no spontaneous magnetic phase transition occurs. However, at
large energy gap values it decreases by decreasing the density. We find a
continuous quantum magnetic phase transition (Stoner phase) for Dirac fermions
in a doped graphene sheet. Novel in-plane magnetic field dependence of the
charge and spin susceptibilities are uncovered.
