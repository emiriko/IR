We have studied the nature of classical work ($W_{c}$) and thermodynamic work
($W$) fluctuations in systems driven out of equilibrium both in transient and
time periodic steady state. As the observation time of trajectory increases, we
show that the number of trajectories which exhibit excursions away from the
typical behaviour i.e., $W_{c}<0$, $W<\Delta F$ and dissipated heat $Q<0$
decreases as anticipated for macroscopic time scales. Analytical expressions
for such trajectories are obtained. Trajectory for which $W_{c}<0$ may not
correspond to $W<\Delta F$ or $Q<0$. The applicability of steady state
fluctuation theorems are discussed in our linear as well as nonlinear models.
