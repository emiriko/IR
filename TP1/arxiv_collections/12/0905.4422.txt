Screening of Coulomb field of test charge in plasma with Bose condensate of
electrically charged scalar field is considered. It is found that the screened
potential contains several different terms: one decreases as a power of
distance (in contrast to the usual exponential Debye screening), some other
oscillate with an exponentially decreasing envelope. Similar phenomenon exists
for fermions (Friedel oscillations), but fermionic and bosonic systems have
quite different features. Several limiting cases and values of the parameters
are considered and the resulting potentials are presented.
