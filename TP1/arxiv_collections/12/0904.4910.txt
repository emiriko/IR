We present an all-sky search for gravitational waves in the frequency range 1
to 6 kHz during the first calendar year of LIGO's fifth science run. This is
the first untriggered LIGO burst analysis to be conducted above 3 kHz. We
discuss the unique properties of interferometric data in this regime. 161.3
days of triple-coincident data were analyzed. No gravitational events above
threshold were observed and a frequentist upper limit of 5.4 events per year on
the rate of strong gravitational wave bursts was placed at a 90% confidence
level. Implications for specific theoretical models of gravitational wave
emission are also discussed.
