We propose a new scheme for parallel spatially multimode quantum memory for
light. The scheme is based on counter-propagating quantum signal wave and
strong classical reference wave, like in a classical volume hologram, and
therefore can be called a quantum volume hologram. The medium for the hologram
consists of a spatially extended ensemble of atoms placed in a magnetic field.
The write-in and read-out of this quantum hologram is as simple as that of its
classical counterpart and consists of a single pass illumination. In addition
we show that the present scheme for a quantum hologram is less sensitive to
diffraction and therefore is capable of achieving higher density of storage of
spatial modes as compared to previous proposals. A quantum hologram capable of
storing entangled images can become an important ingredient in quantum
information processing and quantum imaging.
