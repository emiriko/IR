I study the limit of a large random economy, where a set of consumers invests
in financial instruments engineered by banks, in order to optimize their future
consumption. This exercise shows that, even in the ideal case of perfect
competition, where full information is available to all market participants,
the equilibrium develops a marked vulnerability (or susceptibility) to market
imperfections, as markets approach completeness and transaction costs vanish.
The decrease in transaction costs arises because financial institutions exploit
trading instruments to hedge other instruments. This entails trading volumes in
the interbank market which diverge in the limit of complete markets.
  These results suggest that the proliferation of financial instruments
exacerbates the effects of market imperfections, calling for theories of market
as interacting systems. From a different perspective, in order to prevent an
escalation of perverse effects, markets may necessitate institutional
structures which are more and more conspicuous as their complexity expands.
