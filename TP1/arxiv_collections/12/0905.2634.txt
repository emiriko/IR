Motivated by the bad metal behavior of the iron pnictides, we study a
multi-orbital $\mathrm{t-J_1-J_2}$ model and investigate possible singlet
superconducting pairings. Magnetic frustration by itself leads to a large
degeneracy in the pairing states. The kinetic energy breaks this into a
quasi-degeneracy among a reduced set of pairing states. For small electron and
hole Fermi pockets, an $A_{1g}$ state dominates over the phase diagram but a
$B_{1g}$ state has close-by energy. In addition to the nodeless $A_{1g}$
$s_{x^2y^2}$ channel, the nodal $A_{1g}$ $s_{x^2+y^2}$ and $B_{1g}$
$d_{x^2-y^2}$ channels are also competitive in the magnetically frustrated $J_1
\sim J_2$ parameter regime. An $A_{1g}+i B_{1g}$ state, which breaks
time-reversal symmetry, occurs at low temperatures in part of the phase
diagram. Implications for the experiments in the iron pnictides are discussed.
