In an attempt to find minimal scenarios we study the implications of Dirac
and Majorana mass matrices with texture zeros within the type I seesaw
mechanism. For the Dirac mass matrices we consider 5 zero textures which we
show to be the most minimal form that can successfully account for low energy
phenomenology if the Majorana mass matrices are chosen minimal as well. For
those, we consider both diagonal and even more minimal non-diagonal forms. The
latter can be motivated e.g. by simple U(1) flavour symmetries and have two
degenerate eigenvalues. We classify the allowed textures and discuss the
ramifications for leptogenesis and lepton flavour violation.
