We study the strong-coupling (SC) interaction between two like-charged
membranes of finite thickness embedded in a medium of higher dielectric
constant. A generalized SC theory is applied along with extensive Monte-Carlo
simulations to study the image charge effects induced by multiple dielectric
discontinuities in this system. These effects lead to strong counterion
crowding in the central region of the inter-surface space upon increasing the
solvent/membrane dielectric mismatch and change the membrane interactions from
attractive to repulsive at small separations. These features agree
quantitatively with the SC theory at elevated couplings or dielectric mismatch
where the correlation hole around counterions is larger than the thickness of
the central counterion layer.
