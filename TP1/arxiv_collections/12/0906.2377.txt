We construct Abelian brane models with metastable vacua which are obtained
from deformations of ${\cal N}=2$ supersymmetric brane configurations. One such
model lives on a D4 brane stretched between two displaced and rotated NS5
branes. Another one lives on a D5 brane wrapped on a deformed and fibered $A_2$
singularity.
