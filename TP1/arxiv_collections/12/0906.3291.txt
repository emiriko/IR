We show that there is a low metallicity tidal stream that runs along l=143
deg. in the South Galactic Cap, about 34 kpc from the Sun, discovered from
SEGUE stellar velocities. Since the most concentrated detections are in the
Cetus constellation, and the orbital path is nearly polar, we name it the Cetus
Polar Stream (CPS). Although it is spatially coincident with the Sgr dwarf
trailing tidal tail at b=-70 deg., the metallicities ([Fe/H] = -2.1), ratio of
blue straggler to blue horizontal branch stars, and velocities of the CPS stars
differ from Sgr. Some CPS stars may contaminate previous samples of Sgr dwarf
tidal debris. The unusual globular cluster NGC 5824 is located along an orbit
fit to the CPS, with the correct radial velocity.
