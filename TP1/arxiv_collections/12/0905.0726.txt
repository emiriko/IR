Using the effective potential method, we computed one-loop corrections to the
mass matrix of neutral Higgs bosons of the Non-Holomorphic Supersymmetric
Standard Model (NHSSM) with explicit CP violation, where the radiative
corrections due to the quarks and squarks of the third generation were taken
into account. We observed that the non-holomorphic trilinear couplings can
compete with the holomorphic ones in CP violating issues for the mass and
mixing of the neutral Higgs bosons.
