A new method for determining the hyperfine anomaly, without knowing the
nuclear magnetic moment, is used for the first time on a series of unstable
isotopes. The relative large number of experimental data in Eu makes it
possible to determine the hyperfine anomaly for a number of unstable isotopes.
Calculations of the Bohr-Weisskopf effect and hence the hyperfine anomaly has
been performed using the particle-rotor formalism. The result from the
calculations and experiments is compared with other theoretical calculations
and the empirical Moskowitz-Lombardi formula.
