Bilayer graphene (BLG) has recently attracted a great deal of attention
because of its electrically tunable energy gaps and its unusual electronic
structure. In this Letter we present analytical and semi-analytical
expressions, based on the four-band continuum model, for the layer-sum and
layer-difference density response functions of neutral and doped BLG. These
results demonstrate that BLG density-fluctuations can exhibit either
single-component massive-chiral character or standard two-layer character,
depending on energy and doping.
