We present a stochastic agent-based model for the distribution of personal
incomes in a developing economy. We start with the assumption that incomes are
determined both by individual labour and by stochastic effects of trading and
investment. The income from personal effort alone is distributed about a mean,
while the income from trade, which may be positive or negative, is proportional
to the trader's income. These assumptions lead to a Langevin model with
multiplicative noise, from which we derive a Fokker-Planck (FP) equation for
the income probability density function (IPDF) and its variation in time. We
find that high earners have a power-law income distribution while the low
income groups have a Levy IPDF. Comparing our analysis with the Indian survey
data (obtained from the world bank website) taken over many years we obtain a
near-perfect data collapse onto our model's equilibrium IPDF. The theory
quantifies the economic notion of "given other things". Using survey data to
relate the IPDF to actual food consumption we define a poverty index, which is
consistent with traditional indices, but independent of an arbitrarily chosen
"poverty line" and therefore less susceptible to manipulation.
