Bhabha's scientific research contributions are descibed in the context of his
life and contemporary science. During the Cambridge period(1927-1939),he worked
in Positron theory(Bhabha scattering),Cosmic rays (Bhabha- Heitler theory of
cosmic ray showers,prediction of heavier electrons) and Meson theory.In
Bangalore during 1939-1945, he worked on classical relativistic spinning
particles (Bhabha-Corben equations),meson theory and initiated experimental
work in cosmic rays in India.He then founded Tata Institute of Fundamental
Research in1945 at Bombay and moved there. Here he started work on relativistic
wave equations (Bhabha eqns.).He also initiated India's nuclear energy
programme in 1948 and this was his main preoccupation later.
