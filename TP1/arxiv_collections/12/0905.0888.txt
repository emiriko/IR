Although several existing and upcoming telescopes have imaging as their
primary mode, they also have a sensitive phased-array mode with a multiple-beam
forming capability enabling high time resolution studies of several types of
objects, including pulsars. For example, the potentially wide coverage in
frequency, combined with its collecting area, makes the MWA-LFD a unique
instrument for low-frequency detection and studies of pulsars and transients. A
software data-processing pipeline is being developed by the Raman Research
Institute for this purpose. We describe the various issues relevant to the
detection strategies, illustrated with real data at low radio frequencies.
