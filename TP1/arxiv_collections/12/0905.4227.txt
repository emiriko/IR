The 2008 NRDA conference introduced the Numerical INJection Analysis project
(NINJA), a new collaborative effort between the numerical relativity community
and the data analysis community. NINJA focuses on modeling and searching for
gravitational wave signatures from the coalescence of binary system of compact
objects. We review the scope of this collaboration and the components of the
first NINJA project, where numerical relativity groups shared waveforms and
data analysis teams applied various techniques to detect them when embedded in
colored Gaussian noise.
