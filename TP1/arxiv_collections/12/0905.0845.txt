We present results of three-dimensional nonlinear MHD simulations of a
large-scale magnetic field and its evolution inside a barred galaxy with the
back reaction of the magnetic field on the gas. The model does not consider the
dynamo process. To compare our modeling results with observations, we construct
maps of the high-frequency (Faraday-rotation-free) polarized radio emission on
the basis of simulated magnetic fields. The model accounts for the effects of
projection and the limited resolution of real observations. We performed 3D MHD
numerical simulations of barred galaxies and polarization maps. The main result
is that the modeled magnetic field configurations resemble maps of the
polarized intensity observed in barred galaxies. They exhibit polarization
vectors along the bar and arms forming coherent structures similar to the
observed ones. In the paper, we also explain the previously unsolved issue of
discrepancy between the velocity and magnetic field configurations in this type
of galaxies. The dynamical influence of the bar causes gas to form spiral waves
that travel outwards. Each gaseous spiral arm is accompanied by a magnetic
counterpart, which separates and survives in the inter-arm region. Because of a
strong compression, shear of non-axisymmetric bar flows and differential
rotation, the total energy of modeled magnetic field grows constantly, while
the azimuthal flux grows slightly until $0.05\Gyr$ and then saturates.
