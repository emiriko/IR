We shall revisit the conventional adiabatic or Markov approximation, which
--contrary to the semiclassical case-- does not preserve the positive-definite
character of the corresponding density matrix, thus leading to highly
non-physical results. To overcome this serious limitation, originally pointed
out and partially solved by Davies and co-workers almost three decades ago, we
shall propose an alternative more general adiabatic procedure, which (i) is
physically justified under the same validity restrictions of the conventional
Markov approach, (ii) in the semiclassical limit reduces to the standard
Fermi's golden rule, and (iii) describes a genuine Lindblad evolution, thus
providing a reliable/robust treatment of energy-dissipation and dephasing
processes in electronic quantum devices. Unlike standard master-equation
formulations, the dependence of our approximation on the specific choice of the
subsystem (that include the common partial trace reduction) does not threaten
positivity, and quantum scattering rates are well defined even in case the
subsystem is infinitely extended/has continuous spectrum.
