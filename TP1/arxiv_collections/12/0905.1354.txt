For main-sequence stars beyond spectral type M5 the characteristics of
magnetic activity common to warmer solar-like stars change into the brown-dwarf
domain: the surface magnetic field becomes more dipolar and the evolution of
the field patterns slows, the photospheric plasma is increasingly neutral and
decoupled from the magnetic field, chromospheric and coronal emissions weaken
markedly, and the efficiency of rotational braking rapidly decreases. Yet,
radio emission persists, and has been argued to be dominated by
electron-cyclotron maser emission instead of the gyrosynchrotron emission from
warmer stars. These properties may signal a transition in the stellar extended
atmosphere. Stars warmer than about M5 have a solar-like corona and
wind-sustained heliosphere in which the atmospheric activity is powered by
convective motions that move the magnetic field. Stars cooler than early-L, in
contrast, may have a jovian-like rotation-dominated magnetosphere powered by
the star's rotation in a scaled-up analog of the magnetospheres of Jupiter and
Saturn. A dimensional scaling relationship for rotation-dominated
magnetospheres by Fan et al. (1982) is consistent with this hypothesis.
