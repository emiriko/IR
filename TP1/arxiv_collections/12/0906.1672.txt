A permutation can be locally classified according to the four local types:
peaks, valleys, double rises and double falls. The corresponding classification
of binary increasing trees uses four different types of nodes. Flajolet
demonstrated the continued fraction representation of the generating function
of local types, using a classical bijection between permutations, binary
increasing trees, and suitably defined path diagrams induced by Motzkin paths.
  The aim of this article is to extend the notion of local types from
permutations to $k$-Stirling permutations (also known as
$k$-multipermutations). We establish a bijection of these local types to node
types of $(k+1)$-ary increasing trees. We present a branched continued fraction
representation of the generating function of these local types through a
bijection with path diagrams induced by \L ukasiewicz paths, generalizing the
results from permutations to arbitrary $k$-Stirling permutations.
  We further show that the generating function of ordinary Stirling permutation
has at least three branched continued fraction representations, using
correspondences between non-standard increasing trees, $k$-Stirling
permutations and path diagrams.
