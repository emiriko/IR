The imminent availability of large arrays of large light collectors deployed
to exploit atmospheric Cherenkov radiation for gamma-ray astronomy at more than
100GeV, motivates the growing interest in application of intensity
interferometry in astronomy. Indeed, planned arrays numbering up to one hundred
telescopes will offer close to 5,000 baselines, ranging from less than 50m to
more than 1000m. Recent and continuing signal processing technology
developments reinforce this interest. Revisiting Stellar Intensity
Interferometry for imaging is well motivated scientifically. It will fill the
short wavelength (B/V bands) and high angular resolution (< 0.1mas) gap left
open by amplitude interferometers. It would also constitute a first and
important step toward exploiting quantum optics for astronomical observations,
thus leading the way for future observatories. In this paper we outline science
cases, technical approaches and schedule for an intensity interferometer to be
constructed and operated in the visible using gamma-ray astronomy Air Cherenkov
Telescopes as receivers.
