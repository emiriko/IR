We discuss kinematic methods for determining the masses of the particles in
events at a hadron collider in which a pair of identical particles is produced
with each decaying via a series of on-shell intermediate beyond-the-SM (BSM)
particles to visible SM particles and an invisible particle (schematically, pp
-> ZZ + jets with Z -> Aa -> Bba -> Ccba -> ... -> cba... + N where a,b,c,...
are visible SM particles or groups of SM particles, A,B,C,... are on-shell BSM
particles and N is invisible). This topology arises in many models including
SUSY processes such as squark and gluino pair production and decay. We present
the detailed procedure for the case of Z -> 3 visible particles + N and
demonstrate that the masses obtained from the kinematic procedure are
independent of the model by comparing SUSY to UED.
