Measurements of $\pi^0$, identified charged hadrons, direct-single-$\gamma$,
direct single-$e^{\pm}$ and jets are expected to be important probes of the
Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) at LHC as they are at RHIC. Recent results from RHIC
will be presented, with implications, possibly grave, for LHC. Issues of
soft-physics, such as $E_T$ distributions, will be discussed with questions as
to: whether the soft multipicity or sum-transverse energy ($E_T$), may be the
only quantity at LHC to exhibit number of collision scaling? or whether the
anisotropic flow ($v_2$) will exceed the hydrodynamic limit?
