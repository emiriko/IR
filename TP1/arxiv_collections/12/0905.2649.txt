An immune system inspired Artificial Immune System (AIS) algorithm is
presented, and is used for the purposes of automated program verification.
Relevant immunological concepts are discussed and the field of AIS is briefly
reviewed. It is proposed to use this AIS algorithm for a specific automated
program verification task: that of predicting shape of program invariants. It
is shown that the algorithm correctly predicts program invariant shape for a
variety of benchmarked programs.
