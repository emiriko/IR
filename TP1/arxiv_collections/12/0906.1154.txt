Annihilation of the electron-positron pairs in macroscopic polyelectrons is
considered. It is shown that very fast collapse of the spatial area occupied by
macroscopic polyelectron (or dense electron-positron plasma) produces an
instant annihilation of a very large number of electron-positron pairs. This
phenomenon corresponds to the so-called annihilation explosion. Annihilation of
each electron-positron pair is a highly exothermic process. Therefore, in dense
electron-positron plasma one can observe a very interesting phenomenon of
photon detonation, i.e. a self-organized formation and propagation of the
detonation wave which coincides with the annihilation wave. The photon
detonation can be used in many applications, including many military and
astrophysical problems.
