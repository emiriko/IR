We theoretically investigate the quantum properties of nS, nP, and nD Rydberg
atoms in a magnetic Ioffe-Pritchard trap. In particular, it is demonstrated
that the two-body character of Rydberg atoms significantly alters the trapping
properties opposed to point-like particles with identical magnetic moment.
Approximate analytical expressions describing the resulting Rydberg trapping
potentials are derived and their validity is confirmed for experimentally
relevant field strengths by comparisons to numerical solutions of the
underlying Schroedinger equation. In addition to the electronic properties, the
center of mass dynamics of trapped Rydberg atoms is studied. In particular, we
analyze the influence of a short-time Rydberg excitation, as required by
certain quantum-information protocols, on the center of mass dynamics of
trapped ground state atoms. A corresponding heating rate is derived and the
implications for the purity of the density matrix of an encoded qubit are
investigated.
