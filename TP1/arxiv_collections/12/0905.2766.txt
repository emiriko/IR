We study the density of states in monolayer and bilayer graphene in the
presence of a random potential that breaks sublattice symmetries. While a
uniform symmetry-breaking potential opens a uniform gap, a random
symmetry-breaking potential also creates tails in the density of states. The
latter can close the gap again, preventing the system to become an insulator.
However, for a sufficiently large gap the tails contain localized states with
nonzero density of states. These localized states allow the system to conduct
at nonzero temperature via variable-range hopping. This result is in agreement
with recent experimental observations in graphane by Elias {\it et al.}.
