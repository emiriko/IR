We report on a study of dimuon events produced in $p\bar{p}$ collisions at
$\sqrt{s} = 1.96$ TeV, using 0.9fb$^{-1}$ of data recorded by the D0 experiment
during 2008. Using information from the inner-layer silicon tracking detector,
we observe $712 \pm 462 \pm 942$ events in which one or both muons are produced
in the range $1.6 < r \lesssim 10$ cm, which is expressed as a fraction $(0.40
\pm 0.26 \pm 0.53)%$ of the total dimuon sample. We therefore see no
significant excess of muons produced a few centimeters away from the
interaction point.
