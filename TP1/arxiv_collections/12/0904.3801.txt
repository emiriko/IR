Based on the boson realization, the ground state and phase structure are
investigated in a many-quark model with algebraic structure developed in our
previous paper, in which the two-body pairing and particle-hole type
interactions are active. The physical interpretation of the exact eigenstates
obtained in the boson realization in our previous paper is given in a
many-quark model with su(4) algebraic structure.
