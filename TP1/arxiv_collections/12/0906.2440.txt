Electronic band structure and energetic stability of two types of and
oriented silicon nanowires in beta-Sn phase with the surface terminated by
hydrogen atoms were studied using density functional theory. It was found that
beta-Sn nanowires are metastable with zero band gap against to alpha-diamond
nanowires. The relative energy of the studied wires tends to the energy of the
bulk silicon crystal in beta-Sn phase.
