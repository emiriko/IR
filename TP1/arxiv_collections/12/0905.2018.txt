The authors report on the crystallographic orientation dependence of the
Schottky properties for heterojunctions between a half-metallic ferromagnet
La$_0.6$Sr$_0.4$MnO$_3$ (LSMO) and Nb-doped SrTiO3 semiconductor. The Schottky
barrier height determined by in situ photoemission measurements is independent
for the substrate orientations (001) and (110), while the magnetic properties
of LSMO (110) films are more enhanced than for (001) films. These results
suggest that the performance of magnetic devices based on ferromagnetic
manganite is improved by using (110)-oriented substrates.
