We discuss a program suite for simulating Quantum Chromodynamics on a
4-dimensional space-time lattice. The basic Hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm is
introduced and a number of algorithmic improvements are explained. We then
discuss the implementations of these concepts as well as our parallelisation
strategy in the actual simulation code. Finally, we provide a user guide to
compile and run the program.
