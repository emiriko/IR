The canonical answer to the question posed is "Yes." -- tacitly assuming that
quantum theory and the concept of spacetime are to be unified by `quantizing' a
theory of gravitation. Yet, instead, one may ponder: Could quantum mechanics
arise as a coarse-grained reflection of the atomistic nature of spacetime? --
We speculate that this may indeed be the case. We recall the similarity between
evolution of classical and quantum mechanical ensembles, according to Liouville
and von Neumann equation, respectively. The classical and quantum mechanical
equations are indistinguishable for objects which are free or subject to
spatially constant but possibly time dependent, or harmonic forces, if
represented appropriately. This result suggests a way to incorporate anharmonic
interactions, including fluctuations which are tentatively related to the
underlying discreteness of spacetime. Being linear and local at the quantum
mechanical level, the model offers a decoherence and natural localization
mechanism. However, the relation to primordial deterministic degrees of freedom
is nonlocal.
