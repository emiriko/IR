We propose a simple extension of the minimal universal extra dimension
(UED)model by introducing a small curvature. The model is formulated as a small
anti-de Sitter curvature limit of the five-dimensional standard model (SM) in
the Randall-Sundrum background geometry. While the lightest Kaluza-Klein (KK)
particle can be thermal relic dark matter as usual in the UED model, the
KK-parity is explicitly broken in the presence of the small curvature and the
KK dark matter decays into the SM fermions with a long lifetime. Couplings of
the KK dark matter with SM fermion pairs in the five dimensional bulk are
controlled by fermion bulk masses. With a suitable choice of bulk masses for
leptons and quarks, the KK dark matter through its decay into leptons can
account for the cosmic-ray electron/positron excesses reported by the recent
PAMELA and FERMI satellite experiments, while suppressing the decay into
quarks.
