After a brief discussion on neutrino electromagnetic properties, we consider
the problem of neutrino energy spectra in different media. It is shown that in
two particular cases (i.e., neutrino propagation in a) transversally moving
with increasing speed medium and b) rotating medium) neutrino energies are
quantized. These phenomena can be important for astrophysical applications, for
instance, for physics of rotating neutron stars.
