Graph states are a special kind of multiparticle entangled state with great
potential for applications in quantum information technologies, especially in
measurement-based quantum computers. These states cause significant reductions
of the number of qubits needed for a given computation, leading to shorter
execution time. Here we propose a simple scheme for generating such graph
states by using special gate operations, i.e., control-phase and swap gate
operations, inherent in superconducting quantum nanocircuits.
