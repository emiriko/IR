It is shown that certain kinds of behavior, which hitherto were expected to
be characteristic for classical gravity and quantum field theory in curved
spacetime, as the infinite dimensional Bondi-Metzner-Sachs symmetry, holography
on event horizons and an area proportionality of entropy, have in fact an
unnoticed presence in Minkowski QFT. This casts new light on the fundamental
question whether the volume propotionality of heat bath entropy and the
(logarithmically corrected) dimensionless area law obeyed by
localization-induced thermal behavior are different geometric parametrizations
which share a common primordeal algebraic origin. Strong arguments are
presented that these two different thermal manifestations can be directly
related, this is in fact the main aim of this paper. It will be demonstrated
that QFT beyond the Lagrangian quantization setting receives crucial new
impulses from holography onto horizons. The present paper is part of a project
aimed at elucidating the enormous physical range of "modular localization". The
latter does not only extend from standard Hamitonian heat bath thermal states
to thermal aspects of causal- or event- horizons addressed in this paper. It
also includes the recent understanding of the crossing property of formfactors
whose intriguing similarity with thermal properties was, although sometimes
noticed, only sufficiently understood in the modular llocalization setting.
