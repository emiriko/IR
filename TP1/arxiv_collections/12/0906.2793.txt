Gemini North adaptive optics imaging spectroscopy is presented for the
Galactic ultra-compact HII (UCHII) region K3-50A. Data were obtained in the
K-band using the Near-infrared Integral Field Spectrograph (NIFS) behind the
facility adaptive optics module ALTAIR in natural guide star mode. The NIFS
data cube reveals a complex spatial morphology across the 0.1 pc scale of the
3'' UCHII region. Comparison of the nebular emission to Cloudy ionization
models shows that the central source must have an effective temperature between
about 37000 K and 45000 K with preferred values near 40000 K. Evidence is
presented for sharp density variations in the nebula which are interpreted as a
clearing of material nearest the central source. High excitation lines of FeIII
and SeIV show that the ionization of the nebula clearly changes with distance
from the central source. A double lobed kinematic signature (+/- 25 kms) is
evident in the Br gamma line map which may be related to the larger scale
ionized flow detailed in earlier investigations. This signature and the large
scale flow are not co-alighned, but they may still be related. Though clearly
resolved from the nebula, the central source itself remains buried, and the
NIFS spectrum shows no evidence of photospheric lines.
