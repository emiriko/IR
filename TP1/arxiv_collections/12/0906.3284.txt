The goal of this paper is to show why the framework of communication
complexity seems suitable for the study of cellular automata. Researchers have
tackled different algorithmic problems ranging from the complexity of
predicting to the decidability of different dynamical properties of cellular
automata. But the difference here is that we look for communication protocols
arising in the dynamics itself. Our work is guided by the following idea: if we
are able to give a protocol describing a cellular automaton, then we can
understand its behavior.
