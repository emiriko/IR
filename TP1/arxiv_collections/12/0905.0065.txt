Let H be a reductive subgroup of a reductive group G over an algebraically
closed field k. We consider the action of H on G^n, the n-fold Cartesian
product of G with itself, by simultaneous conjugation. We give a purely
algebraic characterization of the closed H-orbits in G^n, generalizing work of
Richardson which treats the case H = G.
  This characterization turns out to be a natural generalization of Serre's
notion of G-complete reducibility. This concept appears to be new, even in
characteristic zero. We discuss how to extend some key results on G-complete
reducibility in this framework. We also consider some rationality questions.
