In [1] it was shown how the flavor symmetry A4 (or S4) can arise if the three
fermion generations are taken to live on the fixed points of a specific
2-dimensional orbifold. The flavor symmetry is a remnant of the 6-dimensional
Poincare symmetry, after it is broken down to the 4-dimensional Poincare
symmetry through compactification via orbifolding. This raises the question if
there are further non-abelian discrete symmetries that can arise in a similar
setup. To this end, we generalize the discussion by considering all possible
2-dimensional orbifolds and the flavor symmetries that arise from them. The
symmetries we obtain from these orbifolds are, in addition to S4 and A4, the
groups D3, D4 and D6 \simeq D3 x Z2 which are all popular groups for flavored
model building.
