Results of regional climate modeling PRECIS with high spatial resolution (25
km) were used to investigate mesoscale features of atmospheric circulation in
the Black Sea Region for 30-yr period. Method based on Ocubo-Weiss criterion
was used to detect and track subsynoptic eddies. Several types of cyclonic eddy
were discovered and studied: winter Caucasian coastal, summer Caucasian
off-shore, ambient cyclonic eddies, and rare quasitropical cyclones. For
Caucasian eddies statistics of their life-time and intensity, as well as
histograms of diurnal and seasonal cycles, are presented.
