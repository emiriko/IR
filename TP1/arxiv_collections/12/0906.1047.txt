Cosmology might turn out to be the study of fluctuations around a "de Sitter
equilibrium" state. In this article I review the basic ideas and the attractive
features of this framework, and respond to a number common questions raised
about the de Sitter equilibrium picture. I show that this framework does not
suffer from the "Boltzmann Brain" problem, and relate this cosmological picture
to recent work on the "clock ambiguity".
