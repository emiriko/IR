We consider a one-dimensional chain consisting of an interacting area coupled
to non-interacting leads. Within the area, interaction is mediated by a local
on-site repulsion. Using real time evolution within the Density Matrix
Renormalisation Group (DMRG) scheme, we study the dynamics of wave packets in
this two-terminal transport setup. In contrast to previous works, where
excitations were created by adding potentials to the Hamiltonian, we explicitly
create left moving single particle excitations in the right lead as the
starting condition. Our simulations show that such a transport setup allows for
a clear detection of spin-charge separation using time-resolved spin-polarised
density measurements.
