We study the onset of dynamo action of the Riga and Karlsruhe experiments
with the addition of an external wall, the electro-magnetic properties of which
being different from those of the fluid in motion. We consider a wall of
different thickness, conductivity and permeability. We also consider the case
of a ferro-fluid in motion.
