We studied the quantum dynamics of six dimensional $\mathcal{N}=(2, 0)$
superconformal field theory (the QNG theory). We developed the spinor technique
for six-dimensional quantum field theories. By combining this technique with
the canonical quantization procedure, we can overcome the subtlety of the
chiral nature of $\mathcal{N}=(2, 0)$ free tensor multiplet and work out its
quantum mechanical theory. We then studied the $\mathbf{T}^2$ compactification
of the QNG theory and argued that the resulting four dimensional quantum field
theory is indeed the $\mathcal{N}=4$ super-Yang-Mills theory with the $SL(2,
\mathbf{Z})$ duality coming from the mapping class symmetries of
$\mathbf{T}^2$. We also investigated the BPS self-dual string excitations by
proposing a CFT description to their world sheet theory. At last, we
constructed the super-twistor space $\hat{\mathbb{PT}}$ that corresponded to
the superconformal group $U^*Sp(4|2, \mathbf{H})\subset OSp(8|4, \mathbb{C})$,
encoded the full free tensor multiplet into it and made some speculations on
the possible super-twistor formulation of the QNG theory.
