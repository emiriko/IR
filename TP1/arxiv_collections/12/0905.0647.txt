We show that the quasilocal mass defined by Wang and Yau is not well-defined
at spatial infinity. It approaches neither the ADM mass nor the ADM energy. We
suggest an alternative scheme which retains all the desirable characteristics
of the Wang-Yau mass and, in addition, asymptotes to the ADM energy at
infinity.
