A theory is presented for a nonequilibrium phase transition in the
two-dimensional Hubbard model coupled to electrodes. Nonequilibrium magnetic
and superconducting phase diagram is determined by the Keldysh method, where
the electron correlation is treated in the fluctuation exchange approximation.
The nonequilibrium distribution function in the presence of electron
correlation is evoked to capture a general feature in the phase diagram.
