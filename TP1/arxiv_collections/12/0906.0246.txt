The steady current-voltage characteristics of ferromagnet-silicon-ferromagnet
channels with tunable emitter and collector polarizations are investigated in
the presence of spin blockade generalizing the model developed by Pershin Yu V
and Di Ventra M (2008 {\it Phys. Rev.} B {\bf 77} 073301). The dependence of
the critical current on both collector and emitter polarizations is obtained
analytically. It is found that the current amplitude in the channel can be
effectively tuned by varying the difference between the collector and emitter
ferromagnet polarizations which allows to perform the magnetic manipulation of
the electrical current in wide class of both n- and p-doped, low- and
high-Ohmic semiconductor channels coupled to ferromagnetic leads.
