Fomalhaut and epsilon Eridani are two young, nearby stars that possess
extended debris disks whose structures suggest the presence of perturbing
planetary objects. With its high sensitivity and stable point spread function,
Spitzer/IRAC is uniquely capable of detecting cool, Jupiter-like planetary
companions whose peak emission is predicted to occur near 4.5 um. We report on
deep IRAC imaging of these two stars, taken at 3.6 and 4.5 um using subarray
mode and in all four channels in wider-field full array mode. Observations
acquired at two different telescope roll angles allowed faint surrounding
objects to be separated from the stellar diffraction pattern. No companion
candidates were detected at the reported position of Fomalhaut b with 3 sigma
model-dependent mass upper limits of 3 MJ (for an age of 200 Myr). Around
epsilon Eridani we instead set a limit of 4 and <1 MJ (1 Gyr model age) at the
inner and outer edge of the sub-millimeter debris ring, respectively. These
results are consistent with non-detections in recent near-infrared imaging
searches, and set the strongest limits to date on the presence of planets
outside epsilon Eridani sub-millimeter ring.
