The efficiency of bio-molecular motors stems from reversible interactions
$\sim$ $k_B T$; weak bonds stabilizing intermediate states (enabling $direct$
conversion of chemical into mechanical energy). For their (unknown) origins, we
suggest that a magnetically structured phase (MSP) formed via accretion of
super-paramagnetic particles (S-PPs) by magnetic rocks on the Hadean Ocean
floor had hosted motor-like diffusion of ligand-bound S-PPs through its
template-layers; its ramifications range from optical activity to quantum
coherence. A gentle flux gradient offers both detailed-balance breaking
non-equilibrium and $asymmetry$ to a magnetic dipole, undergoing infinitesimal
spin-alignment changes. Periodic perturbation of this background by local
H-fields of template-partners can lead to periodic high and low-template
affinity states, due to the dipole's magnetic degree of freedom. An
accompanying magnetocaloric effect allows interchange between system-entropy
and bath temperature. We speculate on a magnetic reproducer in a setting close
to the mound-scenario of Russell and coworkers that could evolve bio- ratchets.
