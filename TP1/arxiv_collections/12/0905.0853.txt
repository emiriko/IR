We study the response of the QCD vacuum to an external abelian chromomagnetic
field in the framework of a non local Nambu-Jona Lasinio model with the
Polyakov loop. We use the Lattice results on the deconfinement temperature of
the pure gauge theory to compute the same quantity in the presence of dynamical
quarks. We find a linear relationship between the deconfinement temperature
with quarks and the squared root of the applied field strength, $gH$, in
qualitative (and to some extent also quantitative) agreement with existing
Lattice calculations. On the other hand, we find a discrepancy on the
approximate chiral symmetry restoration: while Lattice results suggest the
deconfinement and the chiral restoration remain linked even at non-zero value
of $gH$, our results are consistent with a scenario in which the two
transitions are separated as $gH$ is increased.
