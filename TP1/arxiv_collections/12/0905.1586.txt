The population dynamics of dark and bright excitons in (In,Ga)As/GaAs quantum
dots is studied by two-color pump-probe spectroscopy in an external magnetic
field. With the field applied in Faraday geometry and at T<20 K, the dark
excitons decay on a ten nanoseconds time scale unless the magnetic field
induces a resonance with a bright exciton state. At these crossings their
effective lifetime is drastically shortened due to spin flips of either
electron or hole by which the dark excitons are converted into bright ones. Due
to the quasielastic character we attribute the origin of these flips to the
hyperfine interaction with the lattice nuclei. We compare the exciton spin
relaxation times in the two resonances and find that the spin flip involving an
electron is approximately 25 times faster than the one of the hole. A
temperature increase leads to a considerable, nonmonotonic decrease of the dark
exciton lifetime. Here phonon-mediated spin flips due to the spin-orbit
interaction gradually become more important.
