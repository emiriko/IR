We study a dissipative quantum mechanical model of the projective measurement
of a qubit. We demonstrate how a correspondence limit, damped quantum
oscillator can realise chaotic-like or periodic trajectories that emerge in
sympathy with the projection of the qubit state, providing a model of the
measurement process.
