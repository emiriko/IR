We construct a model of an unparticle sector consisting of a supersymmetric
SU(N) gauge theory with the number of flavors in the Seiberg conformal window.
We couple this sector to the MSSM via heavy messengers. The resulting low
energy theory has a Higgs coupling to unparticles. The Higgs vev drives the
hidden Seiberg sector to a new conformal fixed point. The coupling to the Higgs
mediates supersymmetry breaking to the Seiberg sector, and breaks conformal
invariance at a lower scale. The low energy theory contains light stable and
metastable mesons. Higgs decay into this sector gives signatures which are
similar to those of "hidden valley" models. Decays of the lightest superpartner
of standard model particles into the hidden sector reveal potentially
observable unparticle kinematics.
