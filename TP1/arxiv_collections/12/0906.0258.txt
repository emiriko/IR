We present an antiferromagnetic quantum spin-1/2 model on honeycomb lattice.
It has two parts, one of which is the usual nearest-neighbor Heisenberg model.
The other part is a certain multiple spin interaction term, introduced by us,
which is exactly solvable for the ground state. Without the Heisenberg part,
the model has an exact threefold degenerate dimer ground state. This exact
ground state is also noted to exist for the general spin-S case. For the
spin-1/2 case, we further carry out the triplon analysis in the ground state,
to study the competition between the Heisenberg and the multiple spin
interactions. This approximate calculation exhibits a continuous quantum phase
transition from the dimer order to N\'eel order.
