Ba3Mn2O8 is a hexagonally coordinated Mn5+ S=1 spin dimer system with small
uniaxial single-ion anisotropy. 135,137Ba NMR spectroscopy is used to establish
the lower critical field Hc1 of distinct field-induced phases for H parallel to
c,H perpendicular to c, and measure the longitudinal (Ml) and transverse (Mt)
magnetizations in the vicinity of the quantum critical point (QCP). Ml_parallel
(T, Hc1), Ml_perpendicular (T, Hc1) are reproduced by solving a low-energy
model for a dilute gas of interacting bosons. Ml_parallel(T goes to 0, H = Hc1)
(Ml_perpendicular(T goes to 0, H = Hc1)) follows the expectation for a BEC
(Ising-like) QCP.
