We report single-shot measurements of resistance versus time for thermally
assisted spin-torque-driven switching in magnetic tunnel junctions. We achieve
sufficient sensitivity to resolve the resistance signals leading up to
switching, including the variations between individual switching events.
Analyses of pre-switching thermal fluctuations allow detailed measurements of
coherence times and variations in magnetization precession amplitude. We find
that with a small in-plane hard-axis magnetic field the magnetization dynamics
are more spatially coherent than for the case of zero field.
