An (n,m,p) Random Access Code (RAC) allows to encode n bits in an m bit
message, in such a way that a receiver of the message can guess any of the
original $n$ bits with probability p, greater than 1/2. In Quantum RAC's
(QRACs) one transmits n qubits. The full set of primitive Entanglement Assisted
Random Access Codes (EARACs) is introduced, in which parties are allowed to
share a two-qubit singlet. It is shown that via a concatenation of these, one
can build for any n an (n,1,p) EARAC. QRAC's for n>3 exist only if parties
additionally share classical randomness (SR). We show that EARACs outperform
the best of known QRACs not only in the success probabilities but also in the
amount of communication needed in the preparatory stage of the protocol. Upper
bounds on the performance of EARACs are given, and shown to limit also QRACs.
