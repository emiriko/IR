We demonstrate how gradient ascent pulse engineering optimal control methods
can be implemented on donor electron spin qubits in Si semiconductors with an
architecture complementary to the original Kane's proposal. We focus on the
high-fidelity controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate and explicitly find its digitized
control sequences by optimizing its fidelity over the external controls of the
hyperfine A and exchange J interactions. This high-fidelity CNOT gate has an
error of about $10^{-6}$, below the error threshold required for fault-tolerant
quantum computation, and its operation time of 100ns is about 3 times faster
than 297ns of the proposed global control scheme. It also relaxes significantly
the stringent distance constraint of two neighboring donor atoms of 10~20nm as
reported in the original Kane's proposal to about 30nm in which surface A and J
gates may be built with current fabrication technology. The effects of the
control voltage fluctuations, the dipole-dipole interaction and the electron
spin decoherence on the CNOT gate fidelity are also discussed.
