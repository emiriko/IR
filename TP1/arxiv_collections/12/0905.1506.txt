We present a framework for the dynamics of causal sets and coupled matter
fields, which is a simplification and generalization of an approach we recently
proposed. Given a set of fields including the gravitational one, the main step
in implementing our proposal consists in writing their continuum-based action
using as variables for the spacetime geometry the causal order and volume
element. One then discretizes the resulting expression, with a procedure
designed to maintain covariance. After a discussion of the general framework,
we treat in detail the case of scalar fields, Yang-Mills gauge fields and the
gravitational field.
