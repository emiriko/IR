We analyze, on a random graph, a diffusive strategic dynamics with pairwise
interactions, where nor Glauber prescription, neither detailed balance hold. We
observe numerically that such a dynamics reaches a well defined steady state
that fulfills a shift property: the critical temperature of the canonical
ferromagnetic phase transition is higher with respect to the expected
equilibrium one, known both numerically via Glauber relaxation or Monte Carlo
simulations as well as analytically via cavity techniques or replica
approaches. We show how the relaxed states of this kind of dynamics can be
described by statistical mechanics equilibria of a diluted p-spin model, for a
suitable non-integer real p. Several implications from both theoretical physics
and quantitative sociology points of view are discussed.
