Autoignition delay times, ?, of methyl crotonate, methyl acrylate, ethyl
butanoate, ethyl crotonate, and ethyl acrylate were studied in shock tube
experiments. A series of mixtures diluted with argon, of varying fuel/oxygen
equivalence ratios (?=0.25, 0.4, 1.0, and 2.0), were measured behind reflected
shock waves over the temperature range of 1280-1930 K, pressure range of 7-9.65
atm, during which the logarithm of ? varies linearly as a function of the
inverse temperature for all equivalence ratios. The ignition delay time
decreases as temperature rises. The dependence of ? on temperature, and
reactant concentrations is given in an empirical correlation. The results
provide a database for the validation of small saturated and unsaturated esters
kinetic mechanisms at elevated temperatures and pressure combustion.
