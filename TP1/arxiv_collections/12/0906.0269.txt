A method for the study of the electronic transport in strongly coupled
electron-phonon systems is formalized and applied to a model of polyyne chains
biased through metallic Au leads. We derive a stationary non equilibrium
polaronic theory in the general framework of a variational formulation. The
numerical procedure we propose can be readily applied if the electron-phonon
interaction in the device hamiltonian can be approximated as an effective
single particle electron hamiltonian. Using this approach, we predict that
finite polyyne chains should manifest an insulator-metal transition driven by
the non-equilibrium charging which inhibits the Peierls instability
characterizing the equilibrium state.
