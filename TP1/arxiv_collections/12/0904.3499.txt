Since it was first observed about 40 years ago [1], the peak effect has been
the subject of numerous research mainly impelled by the desire to determine its
exact mechanisms. Despite these efforts, a consensus on this question has yet
to be reached. Experimentally, the peak effect indicates a transition from a
depinned vortex phase to a reentrant pinning phase at high magnetic field. To
study the effects of intrinsic pinning on the peak effect, we consider
Fe$_{x}$Ni$_{1-x}$Zr$_{2}$ superconducting metallic glasses in which the vortex
pinning force varies depending on the Fe content and in which a huge peak
effect is seen as a function of magnetic field. The results are mapped out as a
phase diagram in which it is readily seen that the peak effect becomes broader
with decreasing pinning force. Typically, pinning can be understood by
increased pinning centers, but here, we show that reentrant pinning is due to
the strengthening of interactions (while decreasing pinning strength). Our
results demonstrate the strengthening of the peak effect by collective effects.
