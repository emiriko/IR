A most interesting feature of certain fractional quantum Hall states is that
their quasiparticles obey non-Abelian fractional statistics.
  So far, candidate non-Abelian wave functions have been constructed from
conformal blocks in cleverly chosen conformal field theories. In this work we
present a hierarchy scheme by which we can construct daughter states by
condensing non-Abelian quasiparticles (as opposed to quasiholes) in a parent
state, and show that the daughters have a non-Abelian statistics that differ
from the parent. In particular, we discuss the daughter of the bosonic,
spin-polarized Moore-Read state at $\nu=4/3$ as an explicit example.
