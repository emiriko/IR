We implement for comparative purposes the Feynman algorithm within a
C++-based framework for two-layer uniform facet elastic object for real-time
softbody simulation based on physics modeling methods. To facilitate the
comparison, we implement initial timing measurements on the same hardware
against that of Euler integrator in the softbody framework by varying different
algorithm parameters. Due to a relatively large number of such variations we
implement a GLUI-based user-interface to allow for much more finer control over
the simulation process at real-time, which was lacking completely in the
previous versions of the framework. We show our currents results based on the
enhanced framework. The two-layered elastic object consists of inner and outer
elastic mass-spring surfaces and compressible internal pressure. The density of
the inner layer can be set differently from the density of the outer layer; the
motion of the inner layer can be opposite to the motion of the outer layer.
These special features, which cannot be achieved by a single layered object,
result in improved imitation of a soft body, such as tissue's liquid
non-uniform deformation. The inertial behavior of the elastic object is well
illustrated in environments with gravity and collisions with walls, ceiling,
and floor. The collision detection is defined by elastic collision penalty
method and the motion of the object is guided by the Ordinary Differential
Equation computation. Users can interact with the modeled objects, deform them,
and observe the response to their action in real-time and we provide an
extensible framework and its implementation for comparative studies of
different physical-based modeling and integration algorithm implementations.
