We study the Gilbert-Shannon-Reeds model for riffle shuffles and ask
  'How many times must a deck of cards be shuffled for the deck to be in close
to random order?'. In 1992, Bayer and Diaconis gave a solution which gives
exact and asymptotic results for all decks of practical interest, e.g. a deck
of 52 cards. But what if one only cares about the colors of the cards or
disregards the suits focusing solely on the ranks? More generally, how does the
rate of convergence of a Markov chain change if we are interested in only
certain features? Our exploration of this problem takes us through random walks
on groups and their cosets, discovering along the way exact formulas leading to
interesting combinatorics, an 'amazing matrix', and new analytic methods which
produce a completely general asymptotic solution that is remarkable accurate.
