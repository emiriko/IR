Large scale quantum information processing (QIP) and distributed quantum
computation require the ability to perform entangling operations on a large
number of qubits. We describe a new photonic module which prepares,
deterministically, photonic cluster states using an atom in a cavity as an
ancilla. Based on this module we design a network for constructing 2D cluster
states and then we extend the architecture to 3D topological cluster states.
Advantages of our design include a passive switching mechanism and the
possibility of using global control pulses for the atoms in the cavity. The
architecture described here is well suited for integrated photonic circuits on
a chip and could be used as a basis of a future quantum optical processor or in
a quantum repeater node.
