The rotation based transformation (RBT) for privacy preserving data mining
(PPDM) is vulnerable to the independent component analysis (ICA) attack. This
paper introduces a modified multiple rotation based transformation (MRBT)
technique for special mining applications mitigating the ICA attack while
maintaining the advantages of the RBT.
