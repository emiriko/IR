Skyalert.org is a web application to collect and disseminate observations
about time-critical astronomical transients, and to add annotations and
intelligent machine-learning to those observations. The information is "pushed"
to subscribers, who may be either humans (email, text message etc) or they may
be machines that control telescopes. Subscribers can prepare precise "trigger
rules" to decide which events should reach them and their robots, rules that
may be based on sky position, or on the specific vocabulary of parameters that
define a particular type of observation. Our twin thrusts are automation of
process, and discrimination of interesting events.
