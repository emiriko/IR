Eighty years after de Broglie's, and a little more than half a century after
Bohm's seminal papers, the de Broglie--Bohm theory (a.k.a. Bohmian mechanics),
which is presumably the simplest theory which explains the orthodox quantum
mechanics formalism, has reached an exemplary state of conceptual clarity and
mathematical integrity. No other theory of quantum mechanics comes even close.
Yet anyone curious enough to walk this road to quantum mechanics is soon being
confused by many misleading signposts that have been put up, and not just by
its detractors, but unfortunately enough also by some of its proponents.
  This paper outlines a road map to help navigate ones way.
