A large set of high precision full-Stokes spectropolarimetric observations of
the He-D3 line in spicules has been recorded with the ZIMPOL polarimeter at the
Gregory-Coude Telescope in Locarno. The observational technique allow us to
obtain measurements free from seeing induced spurious effects. The instrumental
polarization is well under control and taken into account in the data analysis.
The observed Stokes profiles are interpreted according to the quantum theory of
the Hanle and Zeeman effects with the aim of obtaining information on the
magnetic field vector. To this end, we make use of a suitable Stokes inversion
technique. The results are presented giving emphasis on a few particularly
interesting measurements which show clearly the operation of the Hanle and
Zeeman effects in solar chromospheric spicules.
