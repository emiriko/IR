By making use of the isospin conservation by strong interaction, the Fermi
$0\nu\beta\beta$ nuclear matrix element $M_{F}^{0\nu}$ is transformed to
acquire the form of an energy-weighted double Fermi transition matrix element.
This useful representation allows reconstruction of the total $M_{F}^{0\nu}$
provided a small isospin-breaking Fermi matrix element between the isobaric
analog state in the intermediate nucleus and the ground state of the daughter
nucleus could be measured, e.g. by charge-exchange reactions. Such a
measurement could set a scale for the $0\nu\beta\beta$ nuclear matrix elements
and help much to discriminate between different nuclear structure models in
which calculated $M_{F}^{0\nu}$ may differ by as much as the factor of 5.
