We have developed a simulation technique of multiscale Lagrangian fluid
dynamics to tackle hierarchical problems relating to historical dependency of
polymeric fluid. We investigate flow dynamics of dilute polymeric fluid by
using the multiscale simulation approach incorporating Lagrangian particle
fluid dynamics technique (the modified smoothed particle hydrodynamics) with
stochastic coarse-grained polymer simulators (the dumbbell model). We have
confirmed that our approach is nicely in agreement with the macroscopic results
obtained by a constitutive equation corresponding to the dumbbell model, and
observed microscopic thermal fluctuation appears in macroscopic fluid dynamics
as dispersion phenomena.
