A class of coordinate systems is found for Friedmann Cosmologies with local
gravity such that it is possible to formulate quantum theory over astronomical
and cosmological distances. When light from distance objects is treated as a
quantum motion, new predictions are found for cosmological redshift and
lensing. Good agreement is found between predictions and supernova redshifts
for a closed Friedmann Cosmology with no cosmological constant and expanding at
half the rate of the standard model. A previously unmodelled component of
cosmological redshift accounts for the anomalous Pioneer blueshift, and for the
flattening of galaxy rotation curves simulating a MONDian law. Distant lenses
have a quarter of the mass required by standard general relativity. Missing
mass can be accounted by a massive neutrino. CDM is not required.
