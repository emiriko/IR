Using chiral anomaly, we discuss the pair creation of massless fermions in an
electric flux tube $\vec{E}$ under homogeneous magnetic field $\vec{B}$
parallel to $\vec{E}$. The tube is axial symmetric and infinitely long in
longitudinal direction. In the limit $B\gg E$, we can analytically obtain the
spatial and temporal behaviors of the electric field and azimuthal magnetic
field generated by the produced fermions. We find that the life time $t_c$ of
the electric field is shorter as the width of the tube is narrower. Applying it
to the glasma in high-energy heavy-ion collisions, we find that color electric
field decays fast such as $t_c\simeq Q_s^{-1}$ with saturation momentum $Q_s$.
