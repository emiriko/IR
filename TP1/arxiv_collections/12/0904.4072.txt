A Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) network is an infrastructure capable of
performing long-distance and high-rate secret key agreement with
information-theoretic security. In this paper we study security properties of
QKD networks based on trusted repeater nodes. Such networks can already be
deployed, based on current technology. We present an example of a trusted
repeater QKD network, developed within the SECOQC project.
  The main focus is put on the study of secure key agreement over a trusted
repeater QKD network, when some nodes are corrupted. We propose an original
method, able to ensure the authenticity and privacy of the generated secret
keys.
