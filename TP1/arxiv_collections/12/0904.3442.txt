We report on an estimate of the bar pattern speed Omega_p for the low surface
brightness spiral galaxy UGC 628. We applied the Tremaine-Weinberg method to
high resolution Halpha velocity and integrated emission maps of this dark
matter dominated galaxy. Observations were made at the CFHT using the optical
Fabry-Perot interferometer, FaNTOmM. The Tremaine-Weinberg method estimates a
bar pattern speed of (11.3 +/- 2.0) km/s/kpc for UGC 628, which is among the
lowest values found for a spiral galaxy. The corotation radius Rc of the bar
and the gaseous disc is Rc = 9.8 (+2.9/-2.0) kpc, implying a ratio R = Rc/Ab of
2.0 (+0.5/-0.3), where Ab is the bar radius. The ratio is well beyond the usual
range of values, 1.0< R <1.4, found for fast bars of high surface brightness
barred galaxies. It implies that the bar in UGC 628 is slow. As shown through
the use of numerical simulations, fast bars survive when the inner mass
distribution of galaxies is dominated by the baryons over the dark matter. Our
result suggests that the presence of slow bars in galaxies is likely related to
the dominance of dark matter over the mass distribution.
