The Jacobi-Stirling numbers of the first and second kinds were introduced in
2006 in the spectral theory and are polynomial refinements of the
Legendre-Stirling numbers. Andrews and Littlejohn have recently given a
combinatorial interpretation for the second kind of the latter numbers.
Noticing that these numbers are very similar to the classical central factorial
numbers, we give combinatorial interpretations for the Jacobi-Stirling numbers
of both kinds, which provide a unified treatment of the combinatorial theories
for the two previous sequences and also for the Stirling numbers of both kinds.
