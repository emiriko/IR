We report an estimate $\nu = 2.593$ $[ {2.587,2.598} ]$ of the critical
exponent of the Chalker-Coddington model of the integer quantum Hall effect
that is significantly larger than previous numerical estimates and in
disagreement with experiment. We conclude that models of non-interacting
electrons cannot explain the critical phenomena of the integer quantum Hall
effect.
