We provide insight into the qubit measurement process involving a switching
type of detector. We study the switching-induced decoherence during escape
events. We present a simple method to obtain analytical results for the qubit
dephasing and bit-flip errors, which can be easily adapted to various systems.
Within this frame we investigate potential of switching detectors for a fast
but only weakly invasive type of detection. We show that the mechanism that
leads to strong dephasing, and thus fast measurement, inverts potential bit
flip errors due to an intrinsic approximate time reversal symmetry.
