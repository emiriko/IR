Superconducting persistent-current qubits are quantum-coherent artificial
atoms with multiple, tunable energy levels. In the presence of large-amplitude
harmonic excitation, the qubit state can be driven through one or more of the
constituent energy-level avoided crossings. The resulting
Landau-Zener-Stueckelberg (LZS) transitions mediate a rich array of
quantum-coherent phenomena. We review here three experimental works based on
LZS transitions: Mach-Zehnder-type interferometry between repeated LZS
transitions, microwave-induced cooling, and amplitude spectroscopy. These
experiments exhibit a remarkable agreement with theory, and are extensible to
other solid-state and atomic qubit modalities. We anticipate they will find
application to qubit state-preparation and control methods for quantum
information science and technology.
