Compact polyhedral surfaces (or, equivalently, compact Riemann surfaces with
conformal flat conical metrics) of an arbitrary genus are considered. After
giving a short self-contained survey of their basic spectral properties, we
study the zeta-regularized determinant of the Laplacian as a functional on the
moduli space of these surfaces. An explicit formula for this determinant is
obtained.
