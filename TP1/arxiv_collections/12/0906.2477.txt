We give an unique string representation, up to isomorphism, for initially
connected deterministic finite automata (ICDFAs) with n states over an alphabet
of k symbols. We show how to generate all these strings for each n and k, and
how its enumeration provides an alternative way to obtain the exact number of
ICDFAs.
