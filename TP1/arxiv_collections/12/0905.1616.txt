Since 1997, BL Lacertae has undergone a phase of high optical activity, with
the occurrence of several prominent outbursts. Starting from 1999, the Whole
Earth Blazar Telescope (WEBT) consortium has organized various multifrequency
campaigns on this blazar, collecting tens of thousands of data points. One of
the main issues in the study of this huge dataset has been the search for
correlations between the optical and radio flux variations, and for possible
periodicities in the light curves. The analysis of the data assembled during
the first four campaigns (comprising also archival data to cover the period
1968-2003) revealed a fair optical-radio correlation in 1994-2003, with a delay
of the hard radio events of ~100 days. Moreover, various statistical methods
suggested the existence of a radio periodicity of ~8 years. In 2004 the WEBT
started a new campaign to extend the dataset to the most recent observing
seasons, in order to possibly confirm and better understand the previous
results. In this campaign we have collected and assembled about 11000 new
optical observations from twenty telescopes, plus near-IR and radio data at
various frequencies. Here, we perform a correlation analysis on the long-term
R-band and radio light curves. In general, we confirm the ~100-day delay of the
hard radio events with respect to the optical ones, even if longer (~200-300
days) time lags are also found in particular periods. The radio
quasi-periodicity is confirmed too, but the "period" seems to progressively
lengthen from 7.4 to 9.3 years in the last three cycles. The optical and radio
behaviour in the last forty years suggests a scenario where geometric effects
play a major role. In particular, the alternation of enhanced and suppressed
optical activity (accompanied by hard and soft radio events, respectively) can
