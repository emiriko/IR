We present single-epoch multi-wavelength optical-NIR observations of the
"anomalous" lensed quasar SDSS J0924+0219, made using the Magellan 6.5-metre
Baade telescope at Las Campanas Observatory, Chile. The data clearly resolve
the anomalous bright image pair in the lensed system, and exhibit a strong
decrease in the anomalous flux ratio with decreasing wavelength. This is
interpreted as a result of microlensing of a source of decreasing size in the
core of the lensed quasar. We model the radius of the continuum emission
region, sigma, as a power-law in wavelength, sigma lambda^zeta. We place an
upper limit on the Gaussian radius of the u'-band emission region of 3.04E16
h70^{-1/2} (<M>/M_sun)^{1/2} cm, and constrain the size-wavelength power-law
index to zeta<1.34 at 95% confidence. These observations rule out an alpha-disc
prescription for the accretion disc in SDSS J0924+0219 with 94% confidence.
