In this paper, we construct a field theory unifying gravity and
electromagnetism in the context of Extended Absolute Parallelism (EAP-)
geometry. This geometry combines, within its structure, the geometric richness
of the tangent bundle and the mathematical simplicity of Absolute Parallelism
(AP-) geometry. The constructed field theory is a generalization of the
Generalized Field Theory (GFT) formulated by Mikhail and Wanas. The theory
obtained is purely geometric. The horizontal (resp. vertical) field equations
are derived by applying the Euler-Lagrange equations to an appropriate
horizontal (resp. vertical) scalar Lagrangian. The symmetric part of the
resulting horizontal (resp. vertical) field equations gives rise to a
generalized form of Einstein's field equations in which the horizontal (resp.
vertical) energy-momentum tensor is purely geometric. The skew-symmetric part
of the resulting horizontal (resp. vertical) field equations gives rise to a
generalized form of Maxwell equations in which the electromagnetic field is
purely geometric. Some interesting special cases, which reveal the role of the
nonlinear connection in the obtained field equations, are examined. Finally,
the condition under which our constructed field equations reduce to the GFT is
explicitly established.
