This paper proposes a new methodology to compute Value at Risk (VaR) for
quantifying losses in credit portfolios. We approximate the cumulative
distribution of the loss function by a finite combination of Haar wavelets
basis functions and calculate the coefficients of the approximation by
inverting its Laplace transform. In fact, we demonstrate that only a few
coefficients of the approximation are needed, so VaR can be reached quickly. To
test the methodology we consider the Vasicek one-factor portfolio credit loss
model as our model framework. The Haar wavelets method is fast, accurate and
robust to deal with small or concentrated portfolios, when the hypothesis of
the Basel II formulas are violated.
