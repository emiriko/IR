This article presents a new control approach and a dynamic model for
engineered flapping flight with many interacting degrees of freedom. This paper
explores the applications of neurobiologically inspired control systems in the
form of Central Pattern Generators (CPG) to control flapping flight dynamics. A
rigorous mathematical and control theoretic framework to design complex three
dimensional wing motions is presented based on phase synchronization of
nonlinear oscillators. In particular, we show the flapping flying dynamics
without a tail or traditional aerodynamic control surfaces can be effectively
controlled by a reduced set of CPG parameters that generate phase-synchronized
or symmetry-breaking oscillatory motions of two main wings. Furthermore, by
using Hopf bifurcation, we show that tailless aircraft alternating between
flapping and gliding can be effectively stabilized by smooth wing motions
driven by the CPG network. Results of numerical simulation with a full six
degree-of-freedom flight dynamic model validate the effectiveness of the
proposed neurobiologically inspired control approach.
