The spatial length of the Kondo screening is still a controversial issue
related to Kondo physics. While renormalization group and Bethe Anzats
solutions have provided detailed information about the thermodynamics of
magnetic impurities, they are insufficient to study the effect on the
surrounding electrons, i.e., the spatial range of the correlations created by
the Kondo effect between the localized magnetic moment and the conduction
electrons. The objective of this work is to present a quantitative way of
measuring the extension of these correlations by studying their effect directly
on the local density of states (LDOS) at arbitrary distances from the impurity.
The numerical techniques used, the Embedded Cluster Approximation, the Finite U
Slave Bosons, and Numerical Renormalization Group, calculate the Green
functions in real space. With this information, one can calculate how the local
density of states away from the impurity is modified by its presence, below and
above the Kondo temperature, and then estimate the range of the disturbances in
the non-interacting Fermi sea due to the Kondo effect, and how it changes with
the Kondo temperature $T_{\rm K}$. The results obtained agree with results
obtained through spin-spin correlations, showing that the LDOS captures the
phenomenology of the Kondo cloud as well. To the best of our knowledge, it is
the first time that the LDOS is used to estimate the extension of the Kondo
cloud.
