One of the major challenges in realizing antiferromagnetic and superfluid
phases in optical lattices is the ability to cool fermions. We determine
constraints on the entropy for observing these phases in two-dimensional
Hubbard models. We investigate antiferromagnetic correlations in the repulsive
model at half filling and superfluidity of s-wave pairs in the attractive case
away from half filling using determinantal quantum Monte Carlo simulations that
are free of the fermion sign problem. We find that an entropy per particle
~log(2) is sufficient to observe the charge gap in the repulsive Hubbard model
or the pairing pseudogap in the attractive case. Observing antiferromagnetic
correlations or superfluidity in 2D systems requires a further reduction in
entropy by a factor of three or more. In contrast to higher dimensions, we find
that adiabatic cooling is not useful to achieve the required low temperatures.
We also show that double occupancy measurements are useful for thermometry for
temperatures greater than the nearest-neighbor hopping.
