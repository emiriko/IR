We have examined the effect of the decoherence in the Ekert91 quantum
cryptographic protocol. In order to explore this issue we have introduced two
major decoherences, the depolarizing channel and the generalized amplitude
damping, between the singlet source and one of the legitimate users. It is
shown that the depolarizing channel disentangles the quantum channel more
easily than the generalized amplitude damping. This fact indicates that the
Ekert protocol is more robust to the generalized amplitude damping. We also
have computed the Bell inequality to check the robustness or weakness of the
Ekert91 protocol. Computation of the Bell inequality also confirms the
robustness of the Ekert91 protocol to the generalized amplitude damping
compared to the depolarizing channel.
