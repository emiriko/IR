Transport through a molecule sandwiched between two metallic electrodes and
coupled to a mesoscopic ring that threads a magnetic flux $\phi$ is studied. An
analytic approach for the electron transport through the molecular bridge
system is presented. Electronic transport properties are discussed in two
aspects: (a) presence of external magnetic filed and (b) strength of
molecule-to-electrode coupling.
