We show that the Sagittarius dwarf tidal stream can be traced with very red
K/M-giant stars selected from SDSS photometry. A subset of these stars are
spectroscopically confirmed with SEGUE and SDSS spectra, and the distance scale
of 2MASS and SDSS M giants is calibrated to the RR Lyrae distance scale. The
absolute g band magnitude of the K/M-giant stars at the tip of the giant branch
is M_g=-1.0. The line-of-sight velocities of the M giant and BHB stars that are
spatially coincident with the Sgr dwarf tidal stream are consistent with those
of previous authors, reinforcing the need for new models that can explain all
of the Sgr tidal debris stream observations. We estimate stellar densities
along the tidal tails that can be used to help constrain future models. The
K/M-giant, BHB, and F-turnoff stars in the lower surface brightness tidal
stream that is adjacent to the main leading Sgr dwarf tidal tail have
velocities and metallicities that are similar to those of the stars in the
leading tidal tail. The ratio of K/M giants to BHBs and BHBs to F-turnoff stars
are also similar for both branches of the leading tidal tail. We show that
there is an additional low-metallicity tidal stream near the Sgr trailing tidal
tail.
