Superpositions of paraxial Laguerre-Gauss laser beam modes to generate
optical potentials based on the optical dipole force are investigated
theoretically. Parabolic and other monomial potentials with even powers, in
cylindrical and spherical symmetry, with large diameters, can be synthesized.
This superposition approach promises to help with high quality atom cloud
manipulation and imaging.
