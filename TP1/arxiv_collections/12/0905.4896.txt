We report the growth of thin films of Sr1-xCaxRuO3 on SrTiO3 and MgO
substrates by metalorganic aerosol deposition. The structure and microstructure
is characterized by X-ray diffraction and room-temperature scanning tunnelling
microscopy (STM), respectively. STM indicates in-plane epitaxy and a small
surface roughness for films on SrTiO3. The high-quality of the films is
supported by large residual resistivity ratios up to 29.
