The aim of the present work is to study the overall mass distribution of the
galaxy clusters Abell 1351 and Abell 1995 using weak gravitational lensing.
These clusters have got a very different mass structure and dynamical state,
and are the two extremes from a larger sample of 38 X-ray luminous clusters of
similar size and redshift.
  We measure shear values of faint background galaxies and correct for PSF
anisotropies using the KSB+ method. Two-dimensional mass maps of the clusters
are created using a finite-field mass reconstruction algorithm, and verified
with aperture mass statistics. The masses inferred from the reconstructions are
compared to those obtained from fitting spherically symmetric SIS- and
NFW-models to the tangential shear profiles. We discuss the NFW concentration
parameters in detail.
  From the mass reconstructions we infer M200-masses of 11.7 +/- 3.1 * 10^14
h_70^-1 Msun and 10.5 +/- 2.7 * 10^14 h_70^-1 Msun for Abell 1351 and Abell
1995, respectively. About 3' north-east of the main mass peak of Abell 1351 we
detect a significant secondary peak in the mass reconstruction as well as by
aperture mass statistics. This feature is also traced by clusters members
selected by means of their V-I colour, and hence is likely a real sub-structure
of Abell 1351. From our fits to the tangential shear we infer masses on the
order of M200 ~ 8-9 * 10^14 h_70^-1 Msun (Abell 1351) and M200 ~ 5-6 * 10^14
h_70^-1 Msun (Abell 1995). The concentration parameters remain poorly
constrained by our weak lensing analysis.
