It is well known that jointly measurable observables cannot lead to a
violation of any Bell inequality - independent of the state and the
measurements chosen at the other site. In this letter we prove the converse:
every pair of incompatible quantum observables enables the violation of a Bell
inequality and therefore must remain incompatible within any other no-signaling
theory. While in the case of von Neumann measurements it is sufficient to use
the same pair of observables at both sites, general measurements can require
different choices. The main result is obtained by showing that for arbitrary
dimension the CHSH inequality provides the Lagrangian dual of the
characterization of joint measurability. This leads to a simple criterion for
joint measurability beyond the known qubit case.
