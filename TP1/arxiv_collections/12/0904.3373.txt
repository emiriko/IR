CeB6, a typical Gamma_8-quartet system, exhibits a mysterious
antiferroquadrupolar ordered phase in magnetic fields, which is considered as
originating from the T_{xyz}-type magnetic octupole moment induced by the
field. By resonant x-ray diffraction in magnetic fields, we have verified that
the T_{xyz}-type octupole is indeed induced in the 4f-orbital of Ce with a
propagation vector (1/2, 1/2, 1/2), thereby supporting the theory. We observed
an asymmetric field dependence of the intensity for an electric quadrupole (E2)
resonance when the field was reversed, and extracted a field dependence of the
octupole by utilizing the interference with an electric dipole (E1) resonance.
The result is in good agreement with that of the NMR-line splitting, which
reflects the transferred hyperfine field at the Boron nucleus from the
anisotropic spin distribution of Ce with an O_{xy}-type quadrupole. The
field-reversal method used in the present study opens up the possibility of
being widely applied to other multipole ordering systems such as NpO2,
Ce_{x}La_{1-x}B_{6}, SmRu_{4}P_{12}, and so on.
