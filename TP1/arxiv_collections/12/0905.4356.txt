In this paper we show that there are applications that transform the movement
of a pendulum into movements in $\mathbb{R}^3$. This can be done using Euler
top system of differential equations. On the constant level surfaces, Euler top
system reduces to the equation of a pendulum. Those properties are also
considered in the case of system of differential equations with delay argument
and in the fractional case. Another aspect presented here is stochastic Euler
top system of differential equations and stochastic pendulum.
