We use angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) to study the band
structure of BaFe2As2 and CaFe2As2, two of the parent compounds of the iron
arsenic high temperature superconductors. We find clear evidence for band back
folding and hybridization demonstrating that conduction electrons are strongly
affected by the emergence of magnetic order. Our high quality data revealed
that although the Fermi surface is strongly three-dimensional, it does indeed
have long parallel segments along the kz direction that can lead to the
emergence of magnetic order. More interestingly, we find very unusual
incommensurate nesting of the Fermi surface in the a-b plane that is present
only at low temperatures. We speculate that this is a signature of a failed
Charge Density Wave (CDW) state that was predicted by renormalization group
studies.
