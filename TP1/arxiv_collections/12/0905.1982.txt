We have measured the differential cross section for the inclusive production
of psi(2S) mesons decaying to mu^{+} mu^{-1} that were produced in prompt or
B-decay processes from ppbar collisions at 1.96 TeV. These measurements have
been made using a data set from an integrated luminosity of 1.1 fb^{-1}
collected by the CDF II detector at Fermilab. For events with transverse
momentum p_{T} (psi(2S)) > 2 GeV/c and rapidity |y(psi(2S))| < 0.6 we measure
the integrated inclusive cross section sigma(ppbar -> psi(2S)X) Br(psi(2S) ->
mu^{+} mu^{-}) to be 3.29 +- 0.04(stat.) +- 0.32(syst.) nb.
