We examine the majorization properties of general thermal-like mixed states
depending on a set of parameters. Sufficient conditions which ensure the
increase in mixedness, and hence of any associated entropic form, when these
parameters are varied, are identified. We then discuss those exhibiting a power
law distribution, showing that they can be characterized by two distinct mixing
parameters, one associated with temperature and the other with the
non-extensivity index q. Illustrative numerical results are also provided.
