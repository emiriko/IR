We report on band-dependent quasiparticle dynamics in
Ba$_{0.6}$K$_{0.4}$Fe$_2$As$_2$ ($T_c = 37 K$) measured using ultrafast
pump-probe spectroscopy. In the superconducting state, we observe two distinct
relaxation processes: a fast component whose decay rate increases linearly with
excitation density and a slow component with an excitation density independent
decay rate. We argue that these two components reflect the recombination of
quasiparticles in the two hole bands through intraband and interband processes.
We also find that the thermal recombination rate of quasiparticles increases
quadratically with temperature. The temperature and excitation density
dependence of the decays indicates fully gapped hole bands and nodal or very
anisotropic electron bands.
