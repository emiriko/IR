We present a review of black holes and black string solutions available in
the $d$-dimensional Einstein and Einstein-Maxwell model in the presence of a
cosmological constant. Due to the cosmological constant, the equations do not
admit explicit solutions for generic values of the parameters and numerical
methods are necessary to construct the solutions. Several new features of the
solutions are discussed, namely their stability and the occurrence of
non-uniform black strings which depend non-trivially on the co-dimension. Black
string solutions are further constructed for the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet model.
The influence of the Gauss-Bonnet term on the domain of existence of the black
strings is discussed in details.
