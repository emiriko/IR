Six-fold configurational anisotropy was studied in Permalloy triangles, in
which the shape symmetry order yields two energetically non-degenerate
micromagnetic configurations of the spins, the so-called "Y" and "buckle"
states. A twelve pointed switching astroid was measured using magneto-optical
experiments and successfully reproduced numerically, with different polar
quadrants identified as specific magnetic transitions, thereby giving a
comprehensive view of the magnetic reversal in these structures. A detailed
analysis highlighted the necessity to include the physical rounding of the
structures in the simulations to account for the instability of the Y state.
