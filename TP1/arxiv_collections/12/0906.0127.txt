In this paper we present mathematical and physical models to be used in the
analysis of the problem of intonation of musical instruments such as guitars,
mandolins and the like, i.e., we study how to improve the tuning on these
instruments. This analysis begins by designing the placement of frets on the
fingerboard according to mathematical rules and the assumption of an ideal
string, but becomes more complicated when one includes the effects of
deformation of the string and inharmonicity due to other string
characteristics. As a consequence of these factors, perfect intonation of all
the notes on the instrument can never be achieved, but complex compensation
procedures are introduced and studied to minimize the problem. To test the
validity of these compensation procedures, we have performed extensive
measurements using standard monochord sonometers and other basic acoustical
devices, confirming the correctness of our theoretical models. In particular,
these experimental activities can be easily integrated into standard acoustics
courses and labs, and can become a more advanced version of basic experiments
with monochords and sonometers.
