We report the observation of tunneling anisotropic magnetoresistance (TAMR)
in an organic spin-valve-like structure with only one ferromagnetic electrode.
The device is based on a new high mobility perylene diimide-based n-type
organic semiconductor. The effect originates from the tunneling injection from
the LSMO contact and can thus occur even for organic layers which are too thick
to support the assumption of tunneling through the layer. Magnetoresistance
measurements show a clear spin-valve signal, with the typical two step
switching pattern caused by the magnetocrystalline anisotropy of the epitaxial
magnetic electrode.
