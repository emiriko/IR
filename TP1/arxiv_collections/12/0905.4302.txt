We extract the positron and electron fluxes in the energy range 10 - 100 GeV
by combining the recent data from PAMELA and Fermi LAT. The {\it absolute
positron and electron} fluxes thus obtained are found to obey the power laws:
$E^{-2.65}$ and $E^{-3.06}$ respectively, which can be confirmed by the
upcoming data from PAMELA. The positron flux appears to indicate an excess at
energies $E\gsim 50$ GeV even if the uncertainty in the secondary positron flux
is added to the Galactic positron background. This leaves enough motivation for
considering new physics, such as annihilation or decay of dark matter, as the
origin of positron excess in the cosmic rays.
