The generalization of QCD to many colors is not unique; each distinct choice
corresponds to a distinct 1/N_c expansion. The familiar 't Hooft N_c -> \infty
limit places quarks in the fundamental representation of SU(N_c), while an
alternative approach places quarks in its two-index antisymmetric
representation. At N_c=3 these two 1/N_c expansions coincide. We compare their
predictions for certain observables in baryon spectroscopy, particularly mass
combinations organized according to SU(3) flavor breaking. Each large N_c limit
generates an emergent spin-flavor symmetry that leads to the vanishing of
particular linear combinations of baryon masses at specific orders in the
expansions. Experimental evidence shows that these relations hold at the
expected orders regardless of which large N_c limit one uses, suggesting the
validity of either limit in the study of baryons. We also consider a hybrid
large N_c limit in which one flavor is taken to transform in the two-index
antisymmetric representation and the rest of the flavors are in the fundamental
representation. While this hybrid large N_c limit is theoretically attractive,
we show that for a wide class of observables it faces some phenomenological
difficulties.
