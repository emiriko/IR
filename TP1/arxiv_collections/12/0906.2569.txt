Quantum ESPRESSO is an integrated suite of computer codes for
electronic-structure calculations and materials modeling, based on
density-functional theory, plane waves, and pseudopotentials (norm-conserving,
ultrasoft, and projector-augmented wave). Quantum ESPRESSO stands for "opEn
Source Package for Research in Electronic Structure, Simulation, and
Optimization". It is freely available to researchers around the world under the
terms of the GNU General Public License. Quantum ESPRESSO builds upon
newly-restructured electronic-structure codes that have been developed and
tested by some of the original authors of novel electronic-structure algorithms
and applied in the last twenty years by some of the leading materials modeling
groups worldwide. Innovation and efficiency are still its main focus, with
special attention paid to massively-parallel architectures, and a great effort
being devoted to user friendliness. Quantum ESPRESSO is evolving towards a
distribution of independent and inter-operable codes in the spirit of an
open-source project, where researchers active in the field of
electronic-structure calculations are encouraged to participate in the project
by contributing their own codes or by implementing their own ideas into
existing codes.
