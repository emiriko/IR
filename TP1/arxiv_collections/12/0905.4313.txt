The X(3872) and Z(4430) are candidates of tetraquark state with a ccbar pair.
We present results from Belle recently updated for the mass, branching
fractions etc. in different production/decay processes of the X(3872). Results
from a Dalitz analysis for B --> Z(4430) K --> psi' pi^+- K are also presented.
