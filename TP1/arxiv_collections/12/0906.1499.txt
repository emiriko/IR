We review some of the recent progress on the study of entropy of entanglement
in many-body quantum systems. Emphasis is placed on the scaling properties of
entropy for one-dimensional multi-partite models at quantum phase transitions
and, more generally, on the concept of area law. We also briefly describe the
relation between entanglement and the presence of impurities, the idea of
particle entanglement, the evolution of entanglement along renormalization
group trajectories, the dynamical evolution of entanglement and the fate of
entanglement along a quantum computation.
