We investigated experimentally the transport properties of a superconducting
cross-shaped aluminium microbridge fabricated on top of ferromagnetic BaFe12O19
single crystal. It was demonstrated that a one-dimensional domain structure in
the ferromagnetic substrate can induce the formation of superconducting
channels above magnetic domains. This leads to a giant anisotropy of
resistivity of the superconducting bridge, caused by the appearance of
continuous paths of supercurrents flowing along domain walls.
