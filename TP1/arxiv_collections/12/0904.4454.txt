It is generally believed that one cannot obtain a large Universe from quantum
cosmological models without an inflationary phase in the classical expanding
era because the typical size of the Universe after leaving the quantum regime
should be around the Planck length, and the standard decelerated classical
expansion after that is not sufficient to enlarge the Universe in the time
available. For instance, in many quantum minisuperspace bouncing models studied
in the literature, solutions where the Universe leave the quantum regime in the
expanding phase with appropriate size have negligible probability amplitude
with respect to solutions leaving this regime around the Planck length. In this
paper, I present a general class of moving gaussian solutions of the
Wheeler-DeWitt equation where the velocity of the wave in minisuperspace along
the scale factor axis, which is the new large parameter introduced in order to
circumvent the abovementioned problem, induces a large acceleration around the
quantum bounce, forcing the Universe to leave the quantum regime sufficiently
big to increase afterwards to the present size, without needing any classical
inflationary phase in between, and with reasonable relative probability
amplitudes with respect to models leaving the quantum regime around the Planck
scale. Furthermore, linear perturbations around this background model are free
of any transplanckian problem.
