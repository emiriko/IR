We have designed and carried out a statistical study to determine the optimal
cartridge dimensions for a Savage 10FLP law enforcement grade rifle. Optimal
performance is defined as minimal group diameter. A full factorial block design
with two main factors and one blocking factor was used. The two main factors
were bullet seating depth and powder charge. The experimental units were
individual shots taken from a bench-rest position and fired into separate
targets. Additionally, thirteen covariates describing various cartridge
dimensions were recorded. The data analysis includes ANOVA and ANCOVA. We will
describe the experiment, the analysis, and some results.
