The massive field theory approach in fixed space dimensions $d=3$ is applied
to investigate a dilute solution of long-flexible polymer chains in a good
solvent between two parallel repulsive walls, two inert walls and for the mixed
case of one inert and one repulsive wall. The well known correspondence between
the field theoretical $\phi^4$ O(n)-vector model in the limit $n\to 0$ and the
behavior of long-flexible polymer chains in a good solvent is used to calculate
the depletion interaction potential and the depletion force up to one-loop
order. Our investigations include modification of renormalization scheme for
the case of two inert walls. The obtained results confirm that the depletion
interaction potential and the resulting depletion force between two repulsive
walls are weaker for chains with excluded volume interaction (EVI) than for
ideal chains, because the EVI effectively reduces the depletion effect near the
walls. Our results are in qualitative agreement with previous theoretical
investigations, experimental results and with results of Monte Carlo
simulations.
