Electron and nuclear spins are very promising candidates to serve as quantum
bits (qubits) for proposed quantum computers, as the spin degrees of freedom
are relatively isolated from their surroundings, and can be coherently
manipulated e.g. through pulsed EPR and NMR. For solid state spin systems,
impurities in crystals based on carbon and silicon in various forms have been
suggested as qubits, and very long relaxation rates have been observed in such
systems. We have investigated a variety of these systems at high magnetic
fields in our multi-frequency pulsed EPR/ENDOR spectrometer. A high magnetic
field leads to large electron spin polarizations at helium temperatures giving
rise to various phenomena that are of interest with respect to quantum
computing. For example, it allows the initialization of the both the electron
spin as well as hyperfine-coupled nuclear spins in a well defined state by
combining millimeter and RF radiation; it can increase the T2 relaxation times
by eliminating decoherence due to dipolar interaction; and it can lead to new
mechanisms for the coherent electrical readout of electron spins. We will show
some examples of these and other effects in Si:P, SiC:N, and nitrogen-related
centers in diamond.
