In this paper, the changes of representations of a group are used in order to
describe its action as algebraic Galois group of an univariate polynomial on
the roots of factors of any Lagrange resolvent. By this way, the Galois group
of resolvent factors are pre-determinated. In follows, different applications
are exposed; in particular, some classical results of algebraic Galois theory.
