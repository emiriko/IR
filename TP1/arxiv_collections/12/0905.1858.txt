A succesful method to describe the asymptotic behavior of a discrete time
stochastic process governed by some recursive formula is to relate it to the
limit sets of a well chosen mean differential equation. Under an attainability
condition, convergence to a given attractor of the flow induced by this
dynamical system was proved to occur with positive probability (Bena\"im, 1999)
for a class of Robbins Monro algorithms. Bena\"im et al. (2005) generalised
this approach for stochastic approximation algorithms whose average behavior is
related to a differential inclusion instead. We pursue the analogy by extending
to this setting the result of convergence with positive probability to an
attractor.
