We present in this work a generalization of the solution of Gorenstein and
Yang to the inconsistency problem of thermodynamics for systems of
quasi-particles whose masses depend on both the temperature and the chemical
potential. We work out several solutions for an interacting system of quarks
and gluons and show that there is only one type of solution that reproduce both
perturbative and lattice QCD.
