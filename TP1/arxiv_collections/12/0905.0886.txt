The dynamics of vortex solitons in a BEC superfluid is studied. A quantum
lattice-gas algorithm (localization-based quantum computation) is employed to
examine the dynamical behavior of vortex soliton solutions of the
Gross-Pitaevskii equation (phi^4 interaction nonlinear Schroedinger equation).
Quantum turbulence is studied in large grid numerical simulations: Kolmogorov
spectrum associated with a Richardson energy cascade occurs on large flow
scales. At intermediate scales a k^{-6} power law emerges, in a
classical-quantum transition from vortex filament reconnections to Kelvin
wave-acoustic wave coupling. The spontaneous exchange of intermediate vortex
rings is observed. Finally, at very small spatial scales a k^{-3} power law
emerges, characterizing fluid dynamics occurring within the scale size of the
vortex cores themselves, a characteristic Kelvin wave cascade region. Poincare
recurrence is studied: in the free non-interacting system, a fast Poincare
recurrence occurs for regular arrays of line vortices. The recurrence period is
used to demarcate dynamics driving the nonlinear quantum fluid towards
turbulence, since fast recurrence is an approximate symmetry of the nonlinear
quantum fluid at early times. This class of quantum algorithms is useful for
studying BEC superfluid dynamics over a broad range of wave numbers, from
quantum flow to a pseudo-classical inviscid flow regime to a Kolmogorov
inertial subrange.
