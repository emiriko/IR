Jet fragmentation functions provide insight into jet structure and are
expected to be modified by the nuclear medium in A+A collisions with respect to
p+p reference measurements. If jet reconstruction is unbiased then a softening
of the fragmentation functions is expected and should be observed in Au+Au
collisions at RHIC. In these proceedings we present measurements of
fragmentation functions in p+p for charged particles for different jet finding
algorithms; these measurements are understood and therefore can be used as a
reference for comparison with Au+Au results. We report the effect of background
and its fluctuations on jet reconstruction in Au+Au collisions, estimated by
using the jet algorithms on simulated Pythia jets embedded in real Au+Au
events. Finally, measurements of fragmentation functions for jets reconstructed
in Au+Au events and their comparison to the p+p baseline are presented and
discussed.
