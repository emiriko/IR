Using numerical simulations of structure formation, we investigate multiple
methods of determining the strength of the proximity effect in the HI Lyalpha
forest. We analyze three high resolution (~10kpc) redshift snapshots
(z=4,3,2.25) of a Hydro-Particle-Mesh simulation to obtain realistic absorption
spectra of the HI Lyalpha forest. We begin our analysis investigating the
intrinsic biases thought to arise in the widely adopted standard technique of
combining multiple lines of sight when searching for the proximity effect. We
confirm the existence of this biases. We then concentrate on the analysis of
the proximity effect along individual lines of sight. We construct the
proximity effect strength distribution (PESD) and confirm that the PESD
inferred from a simple averaging technique accurately recovers the input
strength of the proximity effect at all redshifts. Moreover, the PESD closely
follows the behaviors found in observed samples of quasar spectra. However, the
PESD obtained from our new simulated sight lines presents some differences to
that of simple Monte Carlo simulations. After developing three new theoretical
methods of recovering the strength of the proximity effect on individual lines
of sight, we compare their accuracy to the PESD from the simple averaging
technique. All our new approaches are based on the maximization of the
likelihood function, albeit invoking some modifications. The new techniques
presented here fail to recover the input proximity effect in an un-biased way.
Thus, employing complex 3D simulations, we provide strong evidence in favor of
the proximity effect strength distribution obtained from the simple averaging
technique, as method of estimating the UV background intensity, free of any
biases.
