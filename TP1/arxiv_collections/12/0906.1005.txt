We review recent numerical work investigating the equilibrium phase diagram,
and the dynamics, of the cholesteric blue phases. In equilibrium numerical
results confirm the predictions of the classic analytical theories, and extend
them to incorporate different values of the elastic constants, or the effects
of an applied electric field. There is a striking increase in the stability of
blue phase I in systems where the cholesteric undergoes helical sense
inversion, and the anomalous electrostriction observed in this phase is
reproduced. Solving the equations of motion allows us to present results for
the phase transition kinetics of blue phase I under dielectric or flexoelectric
coupling to an applied electric field. We also present simulations of the blue
phases in a flow field, showing how the disclination network acts to oppose the
flow. The results are based on the Landau-de Gennes exapnsion of the liquid
crystal free energy: that such a simple and elegant theory can predict such
complex and subtle physical behaviour is remarkable.
