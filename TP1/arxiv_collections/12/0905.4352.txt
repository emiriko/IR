We discuss recent developments in the hydrodynamic description of strongly
coupled conformal field theories using the AdS/CFT correspondence. In
particular, we review aspects of the fluid-gravity correspondence which
provides a map between a class of inhomogeneous, dynamical, black hole
solutions in asymptotically AdS spacetimes and arbitrary fluid flows in the
strongly interacting boundary field theory. We explain how the geometric duals
to the fluid dynamics are constructed in a boundary derivative expansion and
use the construction to extract the hydrodynamic transport coefficients. In
addition we also describe the recent developments extending the correspondence
to incorporate matter fields and to non-relativistic systems. Based on lectures
given at the CERN Winter School on Supergravity, Strings and Gauge Theories,
Geneva, Switzerland (February 2009).
