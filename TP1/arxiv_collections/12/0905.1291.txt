We consider improving the sensitivity of future interferometric
gravitational-wave detectors by simultaneously injecting two squeezed vacuums
(light), filtered through a resonant Fabry-Perot cavity, into the dark port of
the interferometer.The same scheme with single squeezed vacuum was first
proposed and analyzed by Corbitt et al. Here we show that the extra squeezed
vacuum, together with an additional homodyne detection suggested previously by
one of the authors, allows reduction of quantum noise over the entire detection
band. To motivate future implementations, we take into account a realistic
technical noise budget for Advanced LIGO (AdvLIGO) and numerically optimize the
parameters of both the filter and the interferometer for detecting
gravitational-wave signals from two important astrophysics sources, namely
Neutron-Star--Neutron-Star (NSNS) binaries and Bursts. Assuming the optical
loss of the 30m filter cavity to be 10ppm per bounce and 10dB squeezing
injection, the corresponding quantum noise with optimal parameters lowers by a
factor of 10 at high frequencies and goes below the technical noise at low and
intermediate frequencies.
