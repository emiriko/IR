We present an upper limit of galactic diffuse gamma-ray flux, measured with
the GAMMA experiment at energy about 175 TeV. The results were obtained using
selection of muon poor extensive air showers at mountain level (700 g/cm^2, Mt.
Aragats, Armenia) for 5 GeV muon energy threshold. An upper limit for the
differential flux at energy E=175+/-25 TeV is equal to (5.8-7.0)x10^-12 [erg
m^2 s sr]^-1 for 95% confidence level.
