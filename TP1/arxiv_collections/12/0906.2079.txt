The proposed Large Hadron Electron Collider (LHeC) at CERN would bring
Deep-Inelastic scattering into the unexplored TeV regime. The LHeC rich physics
program, among other topics, includes both precision SM measurements to
complement LHC physics as well as studies of QCD in the high energy limit. The
present contribution reports on ongoing studies within the NNPDF framework
towards the LHeC CDR. We study the impact of LHeC simulated data on PDF
uncertainties, in particular the small-x gluon. We also assess the LHeC
potential to disentangle between various scenarios of small-x QCD, including
saturation models and small-x resummation. Finally, we explore how deviations
from DGLAP can be quantified in inclusive measurements.
