We discuss the use of two-dimensional $^{9}$Be$^{+}$ ion crystals for
experimental tests of quantum control techniques. Our primary qubit is the 124
GHz ground-state electron spin flip transition, which we drive using
microwaves. An ion crystal represents a spatial ensemble of qubits, but the
effects of inhomogeneities across a typical crystal are small, and as such we
treat the ensemble as a single effective spin. We are able to initialize the
qubits in a simple state and perform a projective measurement on the system. We
demonstrate full control of the qubit Bloch vector, performing arbitrary
high-fidelity rotations ($\tau_{\pi}\sim$200 $\mu$s). Randomized Benchmarking
demonstrates an error per gate (a Pauli-randomized $\pi/2$ and $\pi$ pulse
pair) of $8\pm1\times10^{-4}$. Ramsey interferometry and spin-locking
measurements are used to elucidate the limits of qubit coherence in the system,
yielding a typical free-induction decay coherence time of $T_{2}\sim$2 ms, and
a limiting $T_{1\rho}\sim$688 ms. These experimental specifications make ion
crystals in a Penning trap ideal candidates for novel experiments in quantum
control. As such, we briefly describe recent efforts aimed at studying the
error-suppressing capabilities of dynamical decoupling pulse sequences,
demonstrating an ability to extend qubit coherence and suppress phase errors.
We conclude with a discussion of future avenues for experimental exploration,
including the use of additional nuclear-spin-flip transitions for effective
multiqubit protocols, and the potential for Coulomb crystals to form a useful
testbed for studies of large-scale entanglement.
