We introduce a formal definition of Wolfram's notion of computational process
based on cellular automata, a physics-like model of computation. There is a
natural classification of these processes into decidable, intermediate and
complete. It is shown that in the context of standard finite injury priority
arguments one cannot establish the existence of an intermediate computational
process.
