This publication contains the conference summary of the Understanding
Lyman-alpha Emitters conference held at the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy
in Heidelberg October 6 - 10, 2008. The scope of the conference was to bring
together most of the scientists working in the field of Lyman-alpha emitters,
whether at low or high redshift, or on observational or theoretical aspects,
and to summarise how far the field of study of galaxies with Lyman-alpha
emission has come. An outlook towards the future of the field was also desired.
As part of the conference, two days were dedicated to in total six discussion
sessions. The topics were i) new methods and selection methods, ii) morphology,
iii) what can the local Universe observations tell us about the high redshift
Universe?, iv) clustering, v) SED fitting and vi) Ly-alpha blobs. The chairs of
those sessions were asked to summarise the discussions, as presented in these
proceedings.
