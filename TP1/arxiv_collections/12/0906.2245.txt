We present a new scheme for a laser cooled Raman optical fiber amplifier. The
heat generated in the process of stimulated Raman scattering is compensated for
with laser cooling provided by anti-Stokes fluorescence of ytterbium ions doped
in the core of the fiber. The device is pumped with two pump sources. One of
the pump sources provides Raman amplification of the signal and does not
interact with the ytterbium ions in the core of the fiber. The second pump
provides laser cooling of the fiber with anti-Stokes fluorescence of the Yb3+
ions. The proper arrangement of Yb3+distribution can provide athermal
performance of the device.
