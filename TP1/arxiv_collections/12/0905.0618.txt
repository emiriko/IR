We present results of an observation with Suzaku of the dipping, periodic
bursting low mass X-ray binary XB 1323-619. Using the energy band 0.8 - 70 keV,
we show that the source spectrum is well-described as the emission of an
extended accretion disk corona, plus a small contribution of blackbody emission
from the neutron star. The dip spectrum is well-fitted by the progressive
covering model in which the extended ADC is progressively overlapped by the
absorbing bulge of low ionization state in the outer accretion disk and that
dipping is basically due to photoelectric absorption in the bulge. An
energy-independent decrease of flux at high energies (20 - 70 keV) is shown to
be consistent with the level of Thomson scattering expected in the bulge. An
absorption feature at 6.67 keV (Fe XXV) is detected in the non-dip spectrum and
other possible weak features. In dipping, absorption lines of medium and highly
ionized states are seen suggestive of absorption in the ADC but there is no
evidence that the lines are stronger than in non-dip. We show that the
luminosity of the source has changed substantially since the Exosat observation
of 1985, increasing in luminosity between 1985 and 2003, then in 2003 - 2007
falling to the initial low value. X-ray bursting has again become periodic,
which it ceased to do in its highest luminosity state, and we find that the
X-ray bursts exhibit both the fast decay and later slow decay characteristic of
the rp burning process. We present arguments against the recent proposal that
the decrease of continuum flux in the dipping LMXB in general can be explained
as absorption in an ionized absorber rather than in the bulge in the outer disk
generally accepted to be the site of absorption.
