Finite-dimensional wave turbulence refers to the chaotic dynamics of
interacting wave `clusters' consisting of finite number of connected wave
triads with exact three-wave resonances. We examine this phenomenon using the
example of atmospheric planetary (Rossby) waves. It is shown that the dynamics
of the clusters is determined by the types of connections between neighboring
triads within a cluster; these correspond to substantially different scenarios
of energy flux between different triads. All the possible cases of the energy
cascade termination are classified. Free and forced chaotic dynamics in the
clusters are investigated: due to the huge fluctuations of the energy exchange
between resonant triads these two types of evolution have a lot in common. It
is confirmed that finite-dimensional wave turbulence in finite wave systems is
fundamentally different from kinetic wave turbulence in infinite systems; the
latter is described by wave kinetic equations that account for interactions
with overlapping quasi-resonances of finite amplitude waves. The present
results are directly applicable to finite-dimensional wave turbulence in any
wave system in finite domains with 3-mode interactions as encountered in
hydrodynamics, astronomy, plasma physics, chemistry, medicine, etc.
