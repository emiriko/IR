The parton yield, (pseudo)rapidity distribution, and transverse momentum
distribution in partonic matter assumed forming in the early stage of $pp$ and
nucleus-nucleus collisions at RHIC energy ($\sqrt{s_{{NN}}}$=200 GeV) and LHC
energy ($\sqrt{s_{{NN}}}$=5.5 TeV for nucleus-nucleus, 5.5 and/or 14 TeV for
$pp$) are comparatively investigated with parton and hadron cascade model
PACIAE. It turned out that the different parton and anti-parton spectra
approach to be similar with reaction energy increasing from RHIC to LHC. We
have argued that if the partonic matter forming in Au+Au collisions at RHIC
energy is strongly interacting quark-gluon plasma, the one forming in Pb+Pb
collisions at LHC energy might approach the real (free) quark-gluon plasma.
