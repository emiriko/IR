Context. Mathematical optimization can be used as a computational tool to
obtain the optimal solution to a given problem in a systematic and efficient
way. For example, in twice-differentiable functions and problems with no
constraints, the optimization consists of finding the points where the gradient
of the objective function is zero and using the Hessian matrix to classify the
type of each point. Sometimes, however it is impossible to compute these
derivatives and other type of techniques must be employed such as the steepest
descent/ascent method and more sophisticated methods such as those based on the
evolutionary algorithms. Aims. We present a simple algorithm based on the idea
of genetic algorithms (GA) for optimization. We refer to this algorithm as AGA
(Asexual Genetic Algorithm) and apply it to two kinds of problems: the
maximization of a function where classical methods fail and model fitting in
astronomy. For the latter case, we minimize the chi-square function to estimate
the parameters in two examples: the orbits of exoplanets by taking a set of
radial velocity data, and the spectral energy distribution (SED) observed
towards a YSO (Young Stellar Object). Methods. The algorithm AGA may also be
called genetic, although it differs from standard genetic algorithms in two
main aspects: a) the initial population is not encoded, and b) the new
generations are constructed by asexual reproduction. Results. Applying our
algorithm in optimizing some complicated functions, we find the global maxima
within a few iterations. For model fitting to the orbits of exoplanets and the
SED of a YSO, we estimate the parameters and their associated errors.
