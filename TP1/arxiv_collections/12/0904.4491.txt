Multi-wavelength spectroscopy can be used to constrain the dust and gas
properties in debris disks. Circumstellar dust absorbs and scatters incident
stellar light. The scattered light is sometimes resolved spatially at visual
and near-infrared wavelengths using high contrast imaging techniques that
suppress light from the central star. The thermal emission is inferred from
infrared through submillimeter excess emission that may be 1-2 orders of
magnitude brighter than the stellar photosphere alone. If the disk is not
spatially resolved, then the radial distribution of the dust can be inferred
from Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) modeling. If the grains are
sufficiently small and warm, then their composition can be determined from
mid-infrared spectroscopy. Otherwise, their composition may be determined from
reflectance and/or far-infrared spectroscopy. Atomic and molecular gas absorb
and resonantly scatter stellar light. Since the gas is believed to be
secondary, detailed analysis analysis of the gas distribution, kinematics, and
composition may also shed light on the dust composition and processing history.
