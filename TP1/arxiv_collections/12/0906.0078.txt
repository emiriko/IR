We report on a novel pressure ($P$)-induced evolution of magnetism and
superconductivity (SC) in a helical magnet CeRhIn$_5$ with an incommensurate
wave vector $Q_i=({1/2},{1/2},0.297)$ through the $^{115}$In nuclear quadrupole
resonance (NQR) measurements under $P$. Systematic measurements of the
$^{115}$In-NQR spectrum reveal that the commensurate antiferromagnetism (AFM)
with $Q_c=({1/2},{1/2},{1/2})$ is realized above $P_m \sim$ 1.7 GPa. An
important finding is that the size of SC gap and $T_c$ increase as the
magnitude of the AFM moment decreases in the $P$ region, where SC uniformly
coexists with the commensurate AFM. This result provides evidence of strong
coupling between the commensurate AFM order parameter (OP) and SC OP.
