Bi-presymplectic chains of one-forms of co-rank one are considered. The
conditions in which such chains represent some Liouville integrable systems and
the conditions in which there exist related bi-Hamiltonian chains of vector
fields are derived. To present the construction of bi-presymplectic chains, the
notion of dual Poisson-presymplectic pair is used and the concept of
d-compatibility of Poisson bivectors and d-compatibility of presymplectic forms
is introduced. It is shown that bi-presymplectic representation of related flow
leads directly to the construction of separation coordinates in purely
algorithmic way. As an illustration bi-presymplectic and bi-Hamiltonian chains
in ${\mathbb R}^3$ are considered in detail.
