We study the acoustic limit from the Boltzmann equation in the framework of
classical solutions. For a solution $F_\varepsilon=\mu +\varepsilon
\sqrt{\mu}f_\varepsilon$ to the rescaled Boltzmann equation in the acoustic
time scaling \partial_t F_\varepsilon +\vgrad F_\varepsilon
=\frac{1}{\varepsilon} \Q(F_\varepsilon,F_\varepsilon), inside a periodic box
$\mathbb{T}^3$, we establish the global-in-time uniform energy estimates of
$f_\varepsilon$ in $\varepsilon$ and prove that $f_\varepsilon$ converges
strongly to $f$ whose dynamics is governed by the acoustic system. The
collision kernel $\Q$ includes hard-sphere interaction and inverse-power law
with an angular cutoff.
