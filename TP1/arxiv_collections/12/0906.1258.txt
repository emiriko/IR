One-loop mass shifts to the classical masses of stable kinks arising in a
massive non-linear ${\mathbb S}^2$-sigma model are computed. Ultraviolet
divergences are controlled using the heat kernel/zeta function regularization
method. A comparison between the results achieved from exact and
high-temperature asymptotic heat traces is analyzed in depth.
