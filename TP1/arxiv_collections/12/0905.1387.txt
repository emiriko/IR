I report some progress that occurred since NO-VE08 in the field of
non-standard interactions (NSI) of neutrinos. After briefly reviewing
theoretical developments, I give a summary of the two works in which I was
involved. Firstly, we have formulated a perturbative framework to illuminate
the global features of neutrino oscillations with NSI, aiming at exploring
method for determination of the standard mixing and the NSI parameters. We have
recognized that the parameter degeneracy prevails with an extended form which
involves the NSI elements. Furthermore, a completely new type of degeneracy is
shown to exist. The nature of the former degeneracy is analyzed in detail in
the second work. The work is primarily devoted to analyze the problem of
discriminating the two CP violation, one due to the lepton Kobayashi-Maskawa
phase and the other by phases of the NSI elements. We have shown that the near
(3000 km)-far (7000 km) two detector setting in neutrino factory does have the
discrimination capability and is sensitivities to CP violation due to NSI to
|epsilon_{e\mu}| to \simeq several x 10^{-4} in most of the region of \delta
and \phi.
