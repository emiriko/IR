In computer science, various logical languages are defined to analyze
properties of systems. One way to pinpoint the essential differences between
those logics is to compare their expressivity in terms of distinguishing power
and expressive power. In this paper, we study those two concepts by regarding
the latter notion as the former lifted to classes of models. We show some
general results on lifting an invariance relation on models to one on classes
of models, such that when the former corresponds to the distinguishing power of
a logic, the latter corresponds to its expressive power, given certain
compactness requirements. In particular, we introduce the notion of class
bisimulation to capture the expressive power of modal logics. We demonstrate
the application of our results by revisiting modal definability with our new
insights.
