We show that a well-known result on solutions of the Maurer--Cartan equation
extends to arbitrary (inhomogeneous) odd forms: any such form with values in a
Lie superalgebra satisfying $d\o+\o^2=0$ is gauge-equivalent to a constant,
$$\o=gCg^{-1}-dg\,g^{-1}\,.$$ This follows from a non-Abelian version of a
chain homotopy formula making use of multiplicative integrals. An application
to Lie algebroids and their non-linear analogs is given.
  Constructions presented here generalize to an abstract setting of
differential Lie superalgebras where we arrive at the statement that odd
elements (not necessarily satisfying the Maurer--Cartan equation) are
homotopic\,---\,in a certain particular sense\,---\,if and only if they are
gauge-equivalent.
