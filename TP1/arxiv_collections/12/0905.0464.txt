We examine the influence of coupling between particle-hole and
particle-particle spin fluctuations on the inelastic neutron scattering
resonance (INSR) in cuprate superconductors in both weak and strong interaction
limits. For weak-interactions in the particle-hole channel, we find that the
interchannel coupling can eliminate the resonance. For strong interactions
which drive the system close to a $\bm{Q}=(\pi,\pi)$ magnetic instablity, the
resonance frequency always approaches zero but its value is influenced by the
interchannel coupling. We comment on constraints imposed on cuprate physics by
the INSR phenomenology, and a comparison between the cuprates and the
newly-discovered iron pnictide superconductors is discussed.
