Cosmic Microwave Background experiments must achieve very accurate
calibration of their polarization reference frame to avoid biasing the
cosmological parameters. In particular, a wrong or inaccurate calibration might
mimic the presence of a gravitational wave background, or a signal from
cosmological birefringence, a phenomenon characteristic of several
non-standard, symmetry breaking theories of electrodynamics that allow for
\textit{in vacuo} rotation if the polarization direction of the photon.
Noteworthly, several authors have claimed that the BOOMERanG 2003 (B2K)
published polarized power spectra of the CMB may hint at cosmological
birefringence. Such analyses, however, do not take into account the reported
calibration uncertainties of the BOOMERanG focal plane. We develop a formalism
to include this effect and apply it to the BOOMERanG dataset, finding a
cosmological rotation angle $\alpha=-4.3^\circ\pm4.1^\circ$. We also
investigate the expected performances of future space borne experiment, finding
that an overall miscalibration larger then $1^\circ$ for Planck and $0.2\circ$
for EPIC, if not properly taken into account, will produce a bias on the
constraints on the cosmological parameters and could misleadingly suggest the
presence of a GW background.
