We study the pumping current and the conductance in a Tomonaga-Luttinger
liquid in the presence of two time-dependent point like weak impurities, taking
into account finite-temperature effects. We investigate the different regimes
which can be established as function of the frequency, the temperature and the
separation between the impurity potentials. We show how the previous zero
temperature or single impurity results are distorted.
