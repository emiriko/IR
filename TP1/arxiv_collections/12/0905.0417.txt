We introduce the notion of two-level fingerprinting and traceability codes.
In this setting, the users are organized in a hierarchical manner by
classifying them into various groups; for instance, by dividing the
distribution area into several geographic regions, and collecting users from
the same region into one group. Two-level fingerprinting and traceability codes
have the following property: As in traditional (one-level) codes, when given an
illegal copy produced by a coalition of users, the decoder identifies one of
the guilty users if the coalition size is less than a certain threshold $t$.
Moreover, even when the coalition is of a larger size $s$ $(> t)$, the decoder
still provides partial information by tracing one of the groups containing a
guilty user.
  We establish sufficient conditions for a code to possess the two-level
traceability property. In addition, we also provide constructions for two-level
fingerprinting codes and characterize the corresponding set of achievable
rates.
