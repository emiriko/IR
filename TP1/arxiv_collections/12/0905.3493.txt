A version of the Green's functions theory of the Van der Waals forces which
can be conveniently used in the presence of spatial dispersion is presented.
The theory is based on the fluctuation-dissipation theorem and is valid for
interacting bodies, separated by vacuum. Objections against theories acounting
for the spatial dispersion are discussed.
