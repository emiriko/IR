Iron sesquioxide (Fe2O3) displays pressure and temperature induced spin and
structural transitions. Our calculations show that, density functional theory
(DFT), in the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) scheme, is capable of
capturing both the transitions. The ambient pressure corundum type phase
(hematite or alpha-Fe2O3), having R_3c symmetry, gets distorted by the
application of pressure and transforms to a distorted corundum type or
Rh2O3(II) phase with Pbcn symmetry, in agreement with recent experiments. GGA +
U calculations show the same trend but shift the transition pressures to higher
values. Experimentally, the onset of the structural transition begins in the
vicinity of the spin transition pressure and whether the system undergoes spin
transition in the corundum type (HP1) or in the Rh2O3(II) type (HP2) phase, is
still a controversial issue. With a relatively simple, but general, octahedral
structural parameter, Voct (the octahedral volume around iron ions), we show
that in order to acquire a low spin (LS) state from a high spin (HS) one, the
system does not necessarily need to change the crystal structure. Rather, the
spin transition is a phenomenon that concerns the cation octahedra and the spin
state of the system depends mainly on the value of Voct, which is governed by
two distinct equations of state, separated by a well defined volume gap, for
the HS and LS states respectively. Analysis of the results on the basis of
octahedral volume allows to sum up and bridge the gap between two experimental
results and thus provides a better description of the system in the region of
interest.
