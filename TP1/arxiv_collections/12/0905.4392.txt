Clusters of magnetic atoms lying on a metallic substrate can exhibit Kondo
effect due to the exchange interaction with mobile electrons in the metal,
which can be observed in STM measurements. The same interaction results in the
induced RKKY interaction between the magnetic moments in the cluster. For
different geometries of the cluster, it can enhance or suppress
Kondo-correlations. We calculate the tunneling density of states for trimer
clusters of different geometries and reveal the signatures of competition
between the Kondo effect and RKKY interaction that can be seen in STM
experiments.
