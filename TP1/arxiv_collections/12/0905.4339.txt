The relativistic four-quark equations are found in the framework of the
dispersion relation technique. The dynamical mixing of the four-quark
amplitudes and the glueball amplitudes is considered. The approximate solutions
of these equations using the method based on the extraction of leading
singularities of the amplitudes are obtained. The four-quark amplitudes of
exotic mesons including the quarks of three flavors (u, d, s) are calculated.
The poles of these amplitudes determine the masses of the exotic mesons.
