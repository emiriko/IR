The Kondo effect in the system consisting of a magnetic adatom on the
graphene is studied. By using the non-equilibrium Green function method with
the slave-boson mean field approximation, the local density of state (LDOS) and
the conductance are calculated. For a doped graphene, the Kondo phase is
present at all time. Surprisingly, two kinds of Kondo regimes are revealed. But
for the undoped graphene, the Kondo phase only exists if the adatom's energy
level is beyond a critical value. The conductance is similar to the LDOS, thus,
the Kondo peak in the LDOS can be observed with the scanning tunneling
spectroscopy. In addition, in the presence of a direct coupling between the STM
tip and the graphene, the conductance may be dramatically enhanced, depending
on the coupling site.
