We examine the past and current work on the star formation (SF) histories of
dwarf galaxies in cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. The results obtained
from different numerical methods are still somewhat mixed, but the differences
are understandable if we consider the numerical and resolution effects. It
remains a challenge to simulate the episodic nature of SF history in dwarf
galaxies at late times within the cosmological context of a cold dark matter
model. More work is needed to solve the mysteries of SF history of dwarf
galaxies employing large-scale hydrodynamic simulations on the next generation
of supercomputers.
