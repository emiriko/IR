In this paper using the third-order WKB approximation, a numerical method
devised by Schutz, Will and Iyer, we investigate the quasinormal frequencies of
the scalar field in the background of five-dimensional Lovelock black hole. We
find that the ultraviolet correction to Einstein theory in the Lovelock theory
makes the scalar field decay more slowly and makes the scalar field oscillate
more quickly, and the cosmological constant makes the scalar field decay more
slowly and makes the scalar field oscillate more slowly in Lovelock black hole
backgroud. On the other hand we also find that quasinormal frequencies depend
very weakly on the angular quantum number $l$.
