A new family of exact solutions of the Einstein-Maxwell equations for static
axially symmetric spacetimes is presented. The metric functions of the
solutions are explicitely computed and are simply written in terms of the
oblate spheroidal coordinates. The solutions, obtained by applying the Ernst
method of complex potentials, describe an infinite family of static charged
dust disks with an inner edge. The energy density, pressure and charge density
of all the disks of the family are everywhere well behaved, in such a way that
the energy-momentum tensor fully agrees with all the energy conditions.
