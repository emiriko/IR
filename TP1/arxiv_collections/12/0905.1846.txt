We report on observations of the eclipsing binary 2MASS 19090585+4911585 with
the 25 cm auxiliary telescope of the University Observatory Jena. We show that
a nearby brighter star (2MASS 19090783+4912085) was previously misclassified as
the eclipsing binary and find 2MASS 19090585+4911585 to be the true source of
variation. We present photometric analysis of VRI light curves. The system is
an overcontact binary of W UMa type with an orbital period of (0.288374 +/-
0.000010) d.
