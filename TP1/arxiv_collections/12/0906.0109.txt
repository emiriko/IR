Large values for the mass-to-light ratio (") in self-gravitating systems is
one of the most important evidences of dark matter. We propose a expression for
the mass-to-light ratio in spherical systems using MOND. Results for the COMA
cluster reveal that a modification of the gravity, as proposed by MOND, can
reduce significantly this value.
