Recently, the Shannon entropy, which was introduced originally as a measure
of information amount, has been widely used as a useful index of various
diversities such as biodiversity and geodiversity. In this work we have
evaluated the diversity of soil and land use, in both composition distributions
and spatial distributions, in terms of the Shanonn entropy. Moreover we have
also proposed how to estimate the connection between the diversity of soil and
land use in the spatial distribution using mutual entropy, and carried out the
estimation of its connection.
