We discuss a TeV scale model which would explain neutrino oscillation, dark
matter, and baryon asymmetry of the Universe simultaneously by the dynamics of
the extended Higgs sector and TeV-scale right-handed neutrinos with imposed an
exact $Z_2$ symmetry. Tiny neutrino masses are generated at the three loop
level, a singlet scalar field is a candidate of dark matter, and a strong first
order phase transition is realized for successful electroweak baryogenesis. The
model provides various discriminative predictions, so that it is testable at
the current and future experiments.
