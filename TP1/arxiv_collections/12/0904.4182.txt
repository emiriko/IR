We consider the asymmetric branes model of modified gravity, which can
produce late time acceleration of the universe and compare the cosmology of
this model to the standard $\Lambda$CDM model and to the DGP braneworld model.
We show how the asymmetric cosmology at relevant physical scales can be
regarded as a one-parameter extension of the DGP model, and investigate the
effect of this additional parameter on the expansion history of the universe.
