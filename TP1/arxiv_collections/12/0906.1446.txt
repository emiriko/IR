Since its early phases of operation, the AGILE satellite is observing Gamma
Ray Bursts (GRBs) over an energy range potentially spanning six orders of
magnitude. In the hard X-ray band the SuperAGILE imager provides localization
of about one GRB/month plus the detection of 1-2 GRBs per month out of its
field of view. The Mini-Calorimeter detects about one GRB/week in the 350keV -
100MeV energy range, plus several other transients at very short time scales.
In fact, the on-board MCAL trigger logic, implemented for the first time on
time windows as short as 300 microseconds, is particularly suitable for very
short bursts detection. The Gamma-Ray Imaging Detector (GRID), sensitive in the
30MeV - 30GeV range, firmly detected three GRBs (GRB080514B, GRB090401B and
GRB090510) plus some other candidates at a lower significance level. Moreover,
all GRBs localized by other spacecrafts inside the GRID field of view are
currently searched for possible detection, and upper limits are provided. In
this paper we review the status of the observation of GRBs with AGILE, with
particular emphasis on high energy and short time scales detections.
