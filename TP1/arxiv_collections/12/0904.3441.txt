We show that a particle, with positive orbital angular momentum, following an
outgoing null/timelike geodesic, shall never reach the closed timelike horizon
(CTH) present in the $(4+1)$-dimensional rotating G\"{o}del black hole
space-time. Therefore a large part of this space-time remains inaccessible to a
large class of geodesic observers, depending on the conserved quantities
associated with them. We discuss how this fact and the existence of the closed
timelike curves present in the asymptotic region make the quantum field
theoretic study of the Hawking radiation, where the asymptotic observer states
are a pre-requisite, unclear. However, the semiclassical approach provides an
alternative to verify the Smarr formula derived recently for the rotating
G\"{o}del black hole. We present a systematic analysis of particle emissions,
specifically for scalars, charged Dirac spinors and vectors, from this black
hole via the semiclassical complex path method.
