We have derived masses and radii for both components in five short-period
single-lined eclipsing binary stars discovered by the TrES wide-angle
photometric survey for transiting planets. All these systems consist of a
visible F-star primary and an unseen M-star secondary (M_A > 0.8 M_sun, M_B <
0.45 M_sun). The spectroscopic orbital solution combined with a high precision
transit light curve for each system gives sufficient information to calculate
the density of the primary star and the surface gravity of the secondary. The
masses of the primary stars were obtained using stellar evolution models. The
solutions were compared with results obtained by calculating the radius of the
primary stars under the assumption of rotational synchronization with the
orbital period and alignment between their spin axis and the axis of the orbit.
Four systems show an acceptable match between the two sets of results, but one
system shows a clear mismatch between the two solutions, which may indicate the
absence of synchronization or a misalignment between the rotational and orbital
axis. When compared to low-mass stellar evolution models, the derived masses
and radii of the unseen M dwarfs are inconsistent (three only marginally) with
the predicted values, with all of the radii being larger than expected for
their masses. These results confirm the discrepancy shown in previous work
between the predicted and observed radii on low-mass binary stars. This work
also shows that reliance on the assumption of synchronization to derive the
mass and radius of stars in eclipsing single--lined F+M binaries is a useful
tool, but may not always be warranted and should be carefully tested against
stellar evolution models.
