The primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG) in matter density perturbation is a very
powerful probe of the physics of the very early Universe. The local PNG can
induce a distinct scale-dependent bias on the large scale structure
distribution of galaxies and quasars, which could be used for constraining it.
We study the detection limits on PNG from the surveys of the LAMOST telescope.
The cases of the main galaxy survey, the luminous red galaxy (LRG) survey, and
the quasar survey of different magnitude limits are considered. We find that
the MAIN1 sample (i.e. the main galaxy survey with one magnitude deeper than
the SDSS main galaxy survey, or r<18.8) could only provide very weak constraint
on PNG. For the MAIN2 sample (r<19.8) and the LRG survey, the 2\sigma (95.5%)
limit on the PNG parameter f_{NL} are |f_{NL}|<145 and |f_{NL}|<114
respectively, comparable to the current limit from cosmic microwave background
(CMB) data. The quasar survey could provide much more stringent constraint, and
we find that the 2\sigma limit for |f_{NL}| is between 50 and 103, depending on
the magnitude limit of the survey. With Planck-like priors on cosmological
parameters, the quasar survey with g<21.65 would improve the constraints to
|f_{NL}|<43 (2\sigma). We also discuss the possibility of further tightening
the constraint by using the relative bias method proposed by Seljak(2008).
