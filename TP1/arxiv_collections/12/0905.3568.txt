The BaBar collaboration has accumulated over 400 million tau-pairs which can
be used to study charged leptonic and hadronic weak currents to unprecedented
precision. This note presents results on lepton universality, measurements of
|V_us|, and searches for tau decays which violate lepton flavour conservation,
or tau decays that proceed through a suppressed second class current.
