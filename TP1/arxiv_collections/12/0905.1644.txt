We present the GiBUU model for neutrino nucleus scattering: assuming impulse
approximation, this reaction is treated as a two step process. In the initial
state step, the neutrinos interact with bound nucleons. In the final state
step, the outgoing particles of the initial reaction are propagated through the
nucleus and undergo final state interactions. In this contribution, we focus on
the validation of the initial and final state interaction treatment in GiBUU
using experimental data for pion-nucleus, photon-nucleus and electron-nucleus
scattering.
