A Charge Transport (CT) mechanism has been proposed in several papers (e.g.,
Yavin, et al. PNAS, v102 3546 (2005)) to explain the localization of Base
Excision Repair (BER) enzymes to lesions on DNA. The CT mechanism relies on
redox reactions of iron-sulfur cofactors that modify the enzyme's binding
affinity. These redox reactions are mediated by the DNA strand and involve the
exchange of electrons between BER enzymes along DNA. We propose a mathematical
model that incorporates enzyme binding/unbinding, electron transport, and
enzyme diffusion along DNA. Analysis of our model within a range of parameter
values suggests that the redox reactions can increase desorption of BER enzymes
not already bound to their targets, allowing the enzymes to be recycled, thus
accelerating the overall search process. This acceleration mechanism is most
effective when enzyme copy numbers and enzyme diffusivity along the DNA are
small. Under such conditions, we find that CT BER enzymes find their targets
more quickly than simple "passive" enzymes that simply attach to the DNA
without desorbing.
