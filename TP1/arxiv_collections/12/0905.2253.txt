We present new results of searches for neutrino point sources in the northern
sky, using data recorded in 2007-08 with 22 strings of the IceCube detector
(approximately one-fourth of the planned total) and 275.7 days of livetime. The
final sample of 5114 neutrino candidate events agrees well with the expected
background of atmospheric muon neutrinos and a small component of atmospheric
muons. No evidence of a point source is found, with the most significant excess
of events in the sky at 2.2 sigma after accounting for all trials. The average
upper limit over the northern sky for point sources of muon-neutrinos with E^-2
spectrum is E^2 Phi_nu_mu < 1.4x10^-11 TeV cm^-2 s^-1, in the energy range from
3 TeV to 3 PeV, improving the previous best average upper limit by the
AMANDA-II detector by a factor of two.
