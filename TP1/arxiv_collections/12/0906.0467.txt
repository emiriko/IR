Using a recent result of Albini et al. to represent quantum homodyne
tomography in terms of a single observable (as a normalized positive operator
measure) we construct a generalized Markov kernel which transforms (the
measurement outcome statistics of) this observable into (the measurement
outcome statistics of) a covariant phase space observable. We also consider the
inverse question. Finally, we add some remarks on the quantum theoretical
justification of the experimental implementations of these observables in terms
of balanced homodyne and 8-port detection techniques, respectively.
