It is shown that in SO(10) models where the large solar and atmospheric
neutrino angles come from the charged-lepton mass being "lopsided", there is a
characteristic relation between the 13 mixing angle of the neutrinos and the
size of the Dirac CP- violating phase in the lepton sector. This is illustrated
in a recently proposed realistic and predictive model.
