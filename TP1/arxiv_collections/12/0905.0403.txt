pCVD diamond sensors are regularly used as beam loss monitors in accelerators
by measuring the ionization of the lost particles. In the past these beam loss
monitors showed sudden increases in the dark leakage current without beam
losses and these erratic leakage currents were found to decrease, if magnetic
fields were present. Here we report on a systematic study of leakage currents
inside a magnetic field. The decrease of erratic currents in a magnetic field
was confirmed. On the contrary, diamonds without erratic currents showed an
increase of the leakage current in a magnetic field perpendicular to the
electric field for fields up to 0.6T, for higher fields it decreases. A
preliminary model is introduced to explain the observations.
