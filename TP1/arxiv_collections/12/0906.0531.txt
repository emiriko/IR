Many existing medium access control (MAC) protocols utilize past information
(e.g., the results of transmission attempts) to adjust the transmission
parameters of users. This paper provides a general framework to express and
evaluate distributed MAC protocols utilizing a finite length of memory for a
given form of feedback information. We define protocols with memory in the
context of a slotted random access network with saturated arrivals. We
introduce two performance metrics, throughput and average delay, and formulate
the problem of finding an optimal protocol. We first show that a TDMA outcome,
which is the best outcome in the considered scenario, can be obtained after a
transient period by a protocol with (N-1)-slot memory, where N is the total
number of users. Next, we analyze the performance of protocols with 1-slot
memory using a Markov chain and numerical methods. Protocols with 1-slot memory
can achieve throughput arbitrarily close to 1 (i.e., 100% channel utilization)
at the expense of large average delay, by correlating successful users in two
consecutive slots. Finally, we apply our framework to wireless local area
networks.
