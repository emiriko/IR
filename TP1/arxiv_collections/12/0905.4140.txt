$SU(N_c)$ colour-singlet restriction, along with flavour and spin symmetry,
on thermal partonic ensemble is shown to recombine the partons with internal
colour structure into colour-singlet multi-quark clusters which can be
identified with various hadronic modes at a given temperature. This provides a
possible basis for recombination model for hadronization of quark-gluon plasma.
This also leads to a natural explanation for the ratio of (anti)protons to
pions and the quark number scaling of the elliptic flow coefficient in
relativistic heavy-ion collisions.
