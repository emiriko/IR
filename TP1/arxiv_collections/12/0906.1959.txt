This paper presents a combined numerical-theoretical study of the macroscopic
behavior and local field distributions in a special class of two-dimensional
periodic composites with viscoplastic phases. The emphasis is on strongly
nonlinear materials containing pores or rigid inclusions. Full-field numerical
simulations are carried out using a Fast-Fourier Transform algorithm [H.
Moulinec, P. Suquet, C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris II 318, 1417 (1994)], while the
theoretical results are obtained by means of the `second-order' nonlinear
homogenization method [P. Ponte Castaneda, J. Mech. Phys. Solids 50, 737
(2002)]. The effect of nonlinearity and inclusion concentration is investigated
in the context of power-law (with strain-rate sensitivity m) behavior for the
matrix phase under in-plane shear loadings. Overall, the `second-order'
estimates are found to be in good agreement with the numerical simulations,
with the best agreement for the rigidly reinforced materials. For the porous
systems, as the nonlinearity increases (m decreases), the strain field is found
to localize along shear bands passing through the voids (the strain
fluctuations becoming unbounded) and the effective stress exhibits a singular
behavior in the dilute limit. More specifically, for small porosities and fixed
nonlinearity m>0, the effective stress decreases linearly with increasing
porosity. However, for ideally plastic behavior (m = 0), the dependence on
porosity becomes non-analytic. On the other hand, for rigidly-reinforced
composites, the strain field adopts a tile pattern with bounded strain
fluctuations, and no singular behavior is observed (to leading order) in the
dilute limit.
