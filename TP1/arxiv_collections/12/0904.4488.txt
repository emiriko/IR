The temperature dependent electrical resistivity of single crystalline
SrFe2As2 and BaFe2As2 has been measured in a liquid medium, modified Bridgman
anvil cell for pressures in excess of 75 kbar. These data allow for the
determination of the pressure dependence of the higher temperature, structural
/ antiferromagnetic phase transitions as well as the lower temperature
superconducting phase transition. For both compounds the ambient pressure,
higher temperature structural / antiferromagnetic phase transition can be fully
suppressed with a dome-like region of zero resistivity found to be centered
about its critical pressure. Indeed, qualitatively, the temperature dependence
of the resistivity curves closest to the critical pressures are the closest to
linear, consistent with possible quantum criticality. For pressures
significantly higher than the critical pressure the zero resistivity state is
suppressed and the low temperature resistivity curves asymptotically approach a
universal, low temperature manifold. These results are consistent with the
hypothesis that correlations / fluctuations associated with the
ambient-pressure, high-temperature, tetragonal phase have to be brought to low
enough temperature to allow superconductivity, but if too fully suppressed can
lead to the loss of the superconducting state.
