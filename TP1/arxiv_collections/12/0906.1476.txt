Neutrino scattering at low energies is essential for a variety of timely
applications potentially having fundamental implications, e.g. unraveling
unknown neutrino properties, such as the third neutrino mixing angle, the
detection of the diffuse supernova neutrino background, or of cosmological
neutrinos and furnishing a new constraint to double-beta decay calculations.
Here we discuss some applications, the present status and the perspectives.
