Jordan-Wigner transformation and Bogolyubov transformation are the main steps
of the diagonalization of Hamiltonian and paly an important role in the
statistical mechanics calculations for one-dimensional Heisenberg spin chain
model. Many methods can be exploited as a tool to detect quantum phase
transition, regions of criticality and scaling behavior in the vicinity of a
quantum phase transition, such as geometric phase, fidelity susceptibility,
order parameter, and entanglement entropy, which have direct relation with
Bogolyubov transformation. We diagonalized the Hamiltonian in XY spin-chain
systems with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, the results shows that only
the energy spectrum but not the coefficients of the Bogolyubov transformation
depends on DM interaction. Therefore, the DM interaction may not influence the
critical magnetic field of quantum phase transitions and not induce new
critical regions in the XY spin model. Moreover, we further prove the ideas by
the methods of geometric phases in this model.
