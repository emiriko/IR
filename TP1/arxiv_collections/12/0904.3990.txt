The formalism developed in the first paper of the series [arXiv:0901.1060] is
applied to two thermodynamic systems: (i) of three global observables (the
energy, the total electron number and the spin number), (ii) of one global
observable (the internal electron energy) and two local (position-dependent)
observables (the total electron density and the spin density). The
two-component potential of the many-electron system of interest is constructed
of a scalar external potential and a collinear magnetic field (coupled only
with the spin operator). Various equilibrium characteristics of two systems are
defined and investigated. Conditions for the equivalence between two systems
(the same equilibrium density matrix demanded) are derived and thoroughly
discussed. The applicability of the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem is extended to the
thermodynamic spin-density functional theory. Obtained results provide a
rigorous mathematical foundation for future derivation of the zero-temperature
limit of this theory and determination of its chemical reactivity indices.
