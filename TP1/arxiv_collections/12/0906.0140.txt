We investigate dynamics of (4+1) and (5+1) dimensional flat anisotropic
Universe filled by a perfect fluid in the Gauss-Bonnet gravity. An analytical
solutions valid for particular values of the equation of state parameter
$w=1/3$ have been found. For other values of $w$ structure of cosmological
singularity have been studied numerically. We found that for $w > 1/3$ the
singularity is isotropic. Several important differences between (4+1) and (5+1)
dimensional cases are discussed.
