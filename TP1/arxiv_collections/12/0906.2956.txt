The thermal transport in partially trenched silicon nitride membranes has
been studied in the temperature range from 0.3 to 0.6 K, with the transition
edge sensor (TES), the sole source of membrane heating. The test configuration
consisted of Mo/Au TESs lithographically defined on silicon nitride membranes 1
micron thick and 6 mm^2 in size. Trenches with variable depth were incorporated
between the TES and the silicon frame in order to manage the thermal transport.
It was shown that sharp features in the membrane surface, such as trenches,
significantly impede the modes of phonon transport. A nonlinear dependence of
thermal resistance on trench depth was observed. Partial perforation of silicon
nitride membranes to control thermal transport could be useful in fabricating
mechanically robust detector devices.
