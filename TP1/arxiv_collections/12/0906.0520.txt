Using a positive semidefinite operator technique one deduces exact ground
states for a zig-zag hexagon chain described by a non-integrable Hubbard model
with on-site repulsion. Flat bands are not present in the bare band structure,
and the operators $\hat B^{\dagger}_{\mu,\sigma}$ introducing the electrons
into the ground state, are all extended operators and confined in the quasi 1D
chain structure of the system. Consequently, increasing the number of carriers,
the $\hat B^{\dagger}_{\mu,\sigma}$ operators become connected i.e. touch each
other on several lattice sites. Hence the spin projection of the carriers
becomes correlated in order to minimize the ground state energy by reducing as
much as possible the double occupancy leading to a ferromagnetic ground state.
This result demonstrates in exact terms in a many-body frame that the
conjecture made at two-particle level by G. Brocks et al.
[Phys.Rev.Lett.93,146405,(2004)] that the Coulomb interaction is expected to
stabilize correlated magnetic ground states in acenes is clearly viable, and
opens new directions in the search for routes in obtaining organic
ferromagnetism. Due to the itinerant nature of the obtained ferromagnetic
ground state, the systems under discussion may have also direct application
possibilities in spintronics.
