An impressive progress in measurements of the D-\bar D mixing parameters has
been made in recent years. We explore the implications of these measurements to
models of new physics, especially in view of recent upper bounds on the amount
of CP violation. We update the constraints on non-renormalizable four-quark
operators. We show that the experiments are close to probing minimally flavor
violating models with large tan beta. The data challenge models with a scale of
order TeV where the flavor violation in the down sector is suppressed by
alignment and, in particular, certain classes of supersymmetric models and of
warped extra dimension models.
