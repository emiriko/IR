The merger process of a binary black hole system can have a strong impact on
a circumbinary disk. In the present work we study the effect of both central
mass reduction (due to the energy loss through gravitational waves) and a
possible black hole recoil (due to asymmetric emission of gravitational
radiation). For the mass reduction case and recoil directed along the disk's
angular momentum, oscillations are induced in the disk which then modulate the
internal energy and bremsstrahlung luminosities. On the other hand, when the
recoil direction has a component orthogonal to the disk's angular momentum, the
disk's dynamics are strongly impacted, giving rise to relativistic shocks. The
shock heating leaves its signature in our proxies for radiation, the total
internal energy and bremsstrahlung luminosity. Interestingly, for cases where
the kick velocity is below the smallest orbital velocity in the disk (a likely
scenario in real AGN), we observe a common, characteristic pattern in the
internal energy of the disk. Variations in kick velocity simply provide a phase
offset in the characteristic pattern implying that observations of such a
signature could yield a measure of the kick velocity through electromagnetic
signals alone.
