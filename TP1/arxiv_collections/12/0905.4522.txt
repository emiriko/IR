We propose a device for the generation of valley polarized electronic current
in bilayer graphene. By analyzing the response of this material to intense
terahertz frequency light in the presence of a transverse electric field, we
demonstrate that dynamical states are induced in the gapped energy region, and
if the system parameters are properly tuned, these states exist only in one
valley. The valley polarized states can then be used to filter an arbitrary
electron current, so generating a valley polarized current.
