The temperature dependences of magnetization, electrical transport, and
thermal transport properties of antiperovskite compound SnCMn3 have been
investigated systematically. A positive magnetoresistance (~11%) is observed
around the ferrimagnetic-paramagnetic transition (TC ~ 280 K) in the field of
50 kOe, which can be attributed to the field-induced magnetic phase transition.
The abnormalities of resistivity, Seebeck coefficient, normal Hall effect and
thermal conductivity near TC are suggested to be associated with an abrupt
reconstruction of electronic structure. Further, our results indicate an
essential interaction among lattice, spin and charge degrees of freedom around
TC. Such an interaction among various degrees of freedom associated with sudden
phase transition is suggested to be characteristic of Mn-based antiperovskite
compounds.
