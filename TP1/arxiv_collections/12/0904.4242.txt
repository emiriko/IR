We have implemented an optical quantum eraser with the aim of studying this
phenomenon in the context of state discrimination. An interfering single photon
is entangled with another one serving as a which-path marker. As a consequence,
the visibility of the interference as well as the which-path information are
constrained by the overlap (measured by the inner product) between the
which-path marker states, which in a more general situation are non-orthogonal.
In order to perform which-path or quantum eraser measurements while analyzing
non-orthogonal states, we resort to a probabilistic method for the unambiguous
modification of the inner product between the two states of the which-path
marker in a discrimination-like process.
