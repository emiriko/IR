We report a demonstration and quantitative characterization of
one-dimensional cavity cooling of a single trapped 88Sr+ ion in the resolved
sideband regime. We measure the spectrum of cavity transitions, the rates of
cavity heating and cooling, and the steady-state cooling limit. The cavity
cooling dynamics and cooling limit of 22.5(3) motional quanta, limited by the
moderate coupling between the ion and the cavity, are consistent with a simple
model [Phys. Rev. A 64, 033405] without any free parameters, validating the
rate equation model for cavity cooling.
