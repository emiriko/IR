Negative superhumps in cataclysmic variable systems result when the accretion
disc is tilted with respect to the orbital plane. The line of nodes of the
tilted disc precesses slowly in the retrograde direction, resulting in a
photometric signal with a period slightly less than the orbital period. We use
the method of smoothed particle hydrodynamics to simulate a series of models of
differing mass ratio and effective viscosity to determine the retrograde
precession period and superhump period deficit $\varepsilon_-$ as a function of
system mass ratio $q$. We tabulate our results and present fits to both
$\varepsilon_-$ and $\varepsilon_+$ versus $q$, as well as compare the
numerical results with those compiled from the literature of negative superhump
observations. One surprising is that while we find negative superhumps most
clearly in simulations with an accretion stream present, we also find evidence
for negative superhumps in simulations in which we shut off the mass transfer
stream completely, indicating that the origin of the photometric signal is more
complicated than previously believed.
