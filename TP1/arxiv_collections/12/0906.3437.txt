This paper describes the design, realization and operation of a prototype
liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LAr TPC) detector dedicated to the
development of a novel online monitoring and calibration system exploiting UV
laser beams. In particular, the system is intended to measure the lifetime of
the primary ionization in LAr, in turn related to the LAr purity level. This
technique could be exploited by present and next generation large mass LAr TPCs
for which monitoring of the performance and calibration plays an important
role. Results from the first measurements are presented together with some
considerations and outlook.
