The temperature dependencies of the coupled superconducting gaps, observed in
Fe-As based superconducting compounds is calculated and a universal temperature
scaling observed which is only present if the coupled order parameters both
have s-wave symmetry. Predictions for possible isotope effects on the
transition temperature are made if phonons are involved in the pairing or
polaronic effects are of importance. Comparison to experimental data is given
where these are available.
