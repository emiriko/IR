Selection in a time-periodic environment is modeled via the two-player
replicator dynamics. For sufficiently fast environmental changes, this is
reduced to a multi-player replicator dynamics in a constant environment. The
two-player terms correspond to the time-averaged payoffs, while the three and
four-player terms arise from the adaptation of the morphs to their varying
environment. Such multi-player (adaptive) terms can induce a stable
polymorphism. The establishment of the polymorphism in partnership games
[genetic selection] is accompanied by decreasing mean fitness of the
population.
