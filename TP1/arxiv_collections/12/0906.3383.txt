Despite tremendous interest in the topic and decades of research, the origins
of the major losses of biodiversity in the history of life on Earth remain
elusive. A variety of possible causes for these mass-extinction events have
been investigated, including impacts of asteroids or comets, large-scale
volcanic eruptions, effects from changes in the distribution of continents
caused by plate tectonics, and biological factors, to name but a few. Many of
these suggested drivers involve or indeed require changes of the Earth's
climate, which then affect the biosphere of our planet causing a global
reduction in the diversity of biological species. It can be argued, therefore,
that a detailed understanding of these climatic variations and their effects on
ecosystems are prerequisites for a solution to the enigma of biological
extinctions. Apart from investigations of paleoclimate data of the time periods
of mass extinctions, climate-modelling experiments should be able to shed some
light on these dramatic events. Somewhat surprisingly, however, only few
comprehensive modelling studies of the climate changes associated with
extinction events have been undertaken. These studies will be reviewed in this
paper. Furthermore, the role of modelling in extinction research in general and
suggestions for future research are discussed.
