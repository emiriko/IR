A finite subgroup of $GL(n,\mathbb C)$ is involutory if the sum of the
dimensions of its irreducible complex representations is given by the number of
absolute involutions in the group. A uniform combinatorial model is constructed
for all non-exceptional irreducible complex reflection groups which are
involutory including, in particular, all infinite families of finite
irreducible Coxeter groups.
