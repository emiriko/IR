The monogamy inequality in terms of the concurrence, called the
Coffman-Kundu-Wootters inequality [Phys. Rev. A {\bf 61}, 052306 (2000)], and
its generalization [T.J. Osborne and F. Verstraete, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 96},
220503 (2006)] hold on general $n$-qubit states including mixed ones. In this
paper, we consider the monogamy inequalities in terms of the fully entangled
fraction and the teleportation fidelity. We show that the monogamy inequalities
do not hold on general mixed states, while the inequalities hold on $n$-qubit
pure states.
