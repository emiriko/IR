Forward-backward multiplicity correlation strengths have been measured with
the STAR detector for Au+Au and $\textit{p+p}$ collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ =
200 GeV. Strong short and long range correlations (LRC) are seen in central
Au+Au collisions. The magnitude of these correlations decrease with decreasing
centrality until only short range correlations are observed in peripheral Au+Au
collisions. Both the Dual Parton Model (DPM) and the Color Glass Condensate
(CGC) predict the existence of the long range correlations. In the DPM the
fluctuation in the number of elementary (parton) inelastic collisions produces
the LRC. In the CGC longitudinal color flux tubes generate the LRC. The data is
in qualitative agreement with the predictions from the DPM and indicates the
presence of multiple parton interactions.
