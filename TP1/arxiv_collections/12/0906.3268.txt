In this lecture a new formalism for constructing electromagnetic surface
sources for static axisymmetric electrovacs is presented. The electrostatic and
magnetostatic sources are derived from the discontinuities of the scalar
potentials. This formalism allows the inclusion of two kinds of dipole sources:
Sheets of dipoles and the dipole moment of a distribution of monopoles. It is a
generalization of a previous formalism in order to cope with asymptotically
monopolar electric fields.
