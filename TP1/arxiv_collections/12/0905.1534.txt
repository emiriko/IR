In this paper, we first discuss the detection of supernova neutrino on Earth.
Then we propose a possible method to acquire information about $\theta_{13}$
smaller than $1.5^\circ$ by detecting the ratio of the event numbers of
different flavor supernova neutrinos. Such an sensitivity cannot yet be
achieved by the Daya Bay reactor neutrino experiment.
