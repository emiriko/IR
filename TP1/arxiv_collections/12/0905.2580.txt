We investigate the stellar content of the starburst dwarf galaxy IC10 using
accurate and deep optical data collected with the Advanced Camera for Surveys
and with the Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 on board the Hubble Space Telescope.
The comparison between theory and observations indicates a clear change in age
distribution when moving from the center toward the external regions. Moreover,
empirical calibrators and evolutionary predictions suggest the presence of a
spread in heavy element abundance of the order of one-half dex. The comparison
between old and intermediate-age core He-burning models with a well defined
overdensity in the color-magnitude diagram indicates the presence of both
intermediate-age, red clump stars and of old, red horizontal branch stars.
