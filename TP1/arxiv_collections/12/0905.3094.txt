With the increasing number of experiments dedicated to the observation of the
Cosmic Microwave Background, interest on the detailed properties of the
foreground Galactic emission has risen. In particular the focus is shifting
towards polarized microwave emission with the goal of detecting signature from
primordial gravitational waves and inflation. This review describes the
Galactic polarized and unpolarized emissions in the microwave range :
free-free, synchrotron, thermal dust and anomalous emission.
