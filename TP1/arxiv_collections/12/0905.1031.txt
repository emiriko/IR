We comment a recent work titled "Direct evidence for hidden one-dimensional
Fermi surface of hexagonal K0.25WO3". In this paper the authors report
photoemission and theoretical results on the K0.25WO3 system which led them to
propose that a Charge Density Wave (CDW), associated with hidden
one-dimensional bands, was responsible for the well known resistivity anomaly
in such system.
  In the present comment we report the results of a first principles density
functional theory (DFT) study showing that there are no one-dimensional bands
as suggested by these authors.
