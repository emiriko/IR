Entanglement renormalization techniques are applied to numerically
investigate the ground state of the spin-1/2 Heisenberg model on a kagome
lattice. Lattices of N={36,144,inf} sites with periodic boundary conditions are
considered. For the infinite lattice, the best approximation to the ground
state is found to be a valence bond crystal (VBC) with a 36-site unit cell,
compatible with a previous proposal. Its energy per site, E=-0.43221, is an
exact upper bound and is lower than the energy of any previous (gapped or
algebraic) spin liquid candidate for the ground state.
