For a better modeling of the importance of the different channels leading to
the first aromatic ring, we have compared the structures of laminar rich
premixed methane flames doped with several unsaturated hydrocarbons: allene and
propyne, because they are precursors of propargyl radicals which are well known
as having an important role in forming benzene, 1,3-butadiene to put in
evidence a possible production of benzene due to reactions of C4 compounds,
and, finally, cyclopentene which is a source of cyclopentadienylmethylene
radicals which in turn are expected to easily isomerizes to give benzene. These
flames have been stabilized on a burner at a pressure of 6.7 kPa (50 Torr)
using argon as dilutant, for equivalence ratios (?) from 1.55 to 1.79. A unique
mechanism, including the formation and decomposition of benzene and toluene,
has been used to model the oxidation of allene, propyne, 1,3 butadiene and
cyclopentene. The main reaction pathways of aromatics formation have been
derived from reaction rate and sensitivity analyses and have been compared for
the three types of additives. These combined analyses and comparisons can only
been performed when a unique mechanism is available for all the studied
additives.
