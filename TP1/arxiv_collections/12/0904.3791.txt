We derive a renormalization method to calculate the spectral dimension
$\bar{d}$ of deterministic self-similar networks with arbitrary base units and
branching constants. The generality of the method allows the affect of a
multitude of microstructural details to be quantitatively investigated. In
addition to providing new models for physical networks, the results allow
precise tests of theories of diffusive transport. For example, the properties
of a class of non-recurrent trees ($\bar{d}>2$) with asymmetric elements and
branching violate the Alexander Orbach scaling law.
