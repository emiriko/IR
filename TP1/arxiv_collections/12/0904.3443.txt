The search for resonant absorption of the Primakoff solar axions by
$^{169}$Tm nuclei have been performed. Such an absorption should lead to the
excitation of low-lying nuclear energy level: $A+^{169}$Tm $\to ^{169}$Tm$^*$
$\to ^{169}$Tm$ + \gamma$ (8.41 keV). The Si(Li) detector and $^{169}$Tm target
placed inside the low-background setup were used for that purpose. As a result,
a new restriction on the axion-photon coupling and axion mass was obtained:
$g_{A\gamma}({GeV}^{-1})\cdot m_A(eV)\leq1.36\cdot10^{-5}$ (90% c.l.). In model
of hadronic axion this restriction corresponds to the upper limit on axion mass
- $m_A\leq$ 191 eV for 90% c.l.
