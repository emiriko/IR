We present a description of the design and usage of a new synoptic pipeline
and database model for time series photometry in the VISTA Data Flow System
(VDFS). All UKIRT-WFCAM data and most of the VISTA main survey data will be
processed and archived by the VDFS. Much of these data are multi-epoch, useful
for finding moving and variable objects. Our new database design allows the
users to easily find rare objects of these types amongst the huge volume of
data being produced by modern survey telescopes. Its effectiveness is
demonstrated through examples using Data Release 5 of the UKIDSS Deep
Extragalactic Survey (DXS) and the WFCAM standard star data. The synoptic
pipeline provides additional quality control and calibration to these data in
the process of generating accurate light-curves. We find that 0.6+-0.1% of
stars and 2.3+-0.6% of galaxies in the UKIDSS-DXS with K<15 mag are variable
with amplitudes \Delta K>0.015 mag
