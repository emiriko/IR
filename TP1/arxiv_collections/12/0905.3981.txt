The scope of this paper is to perform a detailed spectroscopic study of the
northern O-type supergiant HD 195592. We use a large sample of high quality
spectra in order to investigate its multiplicity, and to probe the line profile
variability. Our analysis reveals a clear spectroscopic binary signature in the
profile of the He {\sc i} $\lambda$ 6678 line, pointing to a probable O + B
system. We report on low amplitude radial velocity variations in every strong
absorption line in the blue spectrum of HD 195592. These variations are ruled
by two time-scales respectively of 5.063 and about 20 days. The former is
firmly established, whilst the latter is poorly constrained. We report also on
a very significant line profile variability of the H $\beta$ line, with time
scales strongly related to those of the radial velocities. Our results provide
significant evidence that HD 195592 is a binary system, with a period that
might be the variability time-scale of about 5 days. The second time scale may
be the signature of an additional star moving along a wider orbit provided its
mass is low enough, even though direct evidence for the presence of a third
star is still lacking. Alternatively, the second time-scale may be the
signature of a variability intrinsic to the stellar wind of the primary,
potentially related to the stellar rotation.
