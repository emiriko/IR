We review the accuracy of existing \ion{Fe}{17} X-ray line emission models by
comparing them with an extensive analysis of \textit{Chandra} high energy
transmission grating (HETG) observations of stellar coronae. We find
significant discrepancies between most theoretical predictions and observations
for at least some of the intensity ratios involving the six principal Fe XVII
lines, 3C (15.01 {\AA}), 3D (15.26 {\AA}), 3E (15.45 {\AA}), 3F (16.78 {\AA}),
3G (17.05 {\AA}), and M2 (17.10 {\AA}). We suggest that the main problem of
most previous theoretical studies to their inability to fully include electron
correlation effects in the atomic structure calculations, while any
deficiencies in the scattering approximation methods are of minor importance,
regardless of it being close-coupling (CC) or distorted-wave (DW). An
approximate method based on the many-body perturbation theory and DW
approximation is proposed to include such correlation effects in the
calculation of collisional excitation cross sections. The results are shown to
agree with coronal observations and laboratory measurements better than most
previous theories. Using the new atomic data, we then investigate the electron
density sensitivity of the M2/3G intensity ratio and provide an improved
density diagnostic tool for astrophysical observations.
