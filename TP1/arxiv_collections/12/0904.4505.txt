Within the Local Universe galaxies can be studied in great detail star by
star, and here we review the results of quantitative studies in nearby dwarf
galaxies. The Color-Magnitude Diagram synthesis method is well established as
the most accurate way to determine star formation history of galaxies back to
the earliest times. This approach received a large boost from the exceptional
data sets that wide field CCD imagers on the ground and the Hubble Space
Telescope could provide. Spectroscopic studies using large ground based
telescopes such as VLT, Magellan, Keck and HET have allowed the determination
of abundances and kinematics for significant samples of stars in nearby dwarf
galaxies. These studies have shown how the properties of stellar populations
can vary spatially and temporally. This leads to important constraints to
theories of galaxy formation and evolution. The combination of spectroscopy and
imaging and what they have taught us about dwarf galaxy formation and evolution
is the aim of this review.
