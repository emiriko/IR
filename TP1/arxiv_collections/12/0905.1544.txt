Recently Seevinck and Uffink argued that genuine multipartite entanglement
(GME) had not been established in the experiments designed to confirm GME. In
this paper, we use the Bell-type inequalities introduced by Seevinck and
Svetlichny [Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{89}, 060401 (2002)] to investigate the GME
problem in the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model. We show explicitly
that the ground states of this model violate the inequality when the external
transverse magnetic field is weak, which indicate that the ground states in
this model with weak magnetic field are fully entangled. Since this model can
be simulated with nuclear magnetic resonance, our results provide a fresh
approach to experimental test of GME.
