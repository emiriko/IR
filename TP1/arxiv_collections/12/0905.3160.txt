We study the double electronic emission by photon impact from He in the
center of a spherical fullerene, which is modeled by a square-well shell. This
system exhibits a manifold of avoided crossings as a function of the well
depth, and present mirror colapses. However, this symmetry is broken in the
triple differential cross section due to the delocalization of the He electrons
in the initial state. Moreover, the fullerene potential involves higher angular
momenta partial waves to be included in the process, which modifies the
well-known two-lobe cross section from isolated He.
