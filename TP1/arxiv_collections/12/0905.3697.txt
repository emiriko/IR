Hastings recently provided a proof of the existence of channels which violate
the additivity conjecture for minimal output entropy. In this paper we present
an expanded version of Hastings' proof. In addition to a careful elucidation of
the details of the proof, we also present bounds for the minimal dimensions
needed to obtain a counterexample.
