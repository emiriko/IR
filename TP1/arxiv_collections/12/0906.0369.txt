We describe SuperIso Relic, a public program for evaluation of relic density
and flavor physics observables in the minimal supersymmetric extension of the
Standard Model (MSSM). SuperIso Relic is an extension of the SuperIso program
which adds to the flavor observables of SuperIso the computation of all
possible annihiliation and coannihilation processes of the LSP which are
required for the relic density calculation. All amplitudes have been generated
at the tree level with FeynArts/FormCalc, and widths of the Higgs bosons are
computed with FeynHiggs at the two-loop level. SuperIso Relic also provides the
possibility to modify the assumptions of the cosmological model, and to study
their consequences on the relic density.
