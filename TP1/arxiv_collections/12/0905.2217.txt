Josephson tunnel junctions are widely used as nonlinear elements in
superconducting circuits such as low noise amplifiers and quantum bits.
However, microscopic defects in the oxide tunnel barrier can produce low and
high frequency noise which can potentially limit the coherence times and
quality factors of resonant circuits. Weak link Josephson junctions are an
attractive alternative provided that sufficient nonlinearity can be engineered.
We compute the current phase relation for superconducting weak links, with
dimensions comparable to the zero temperature coherence length, connected to
two and three dimensional superconducting electrodes. Our results indicate that
50-100 nm long aluminum nanobridges connected with three dimensional banks can
be used to construct nonlinear oscillators for bifurcation amplification. We
also show that under static current bias, these oscillators have a sufficiently
anharmonic energy level structure to form a qubit. Such weak link junctions
thus present a practical new route for realizing sensitive quantum circuits.
