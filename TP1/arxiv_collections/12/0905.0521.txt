An extension to a high-order model for the direct isotropic/smectic-A liquid
crystalline phase transition was derived to take into account thermal effects
including anisotropic thermal diffusion and latent heat of phase-ordering.
Multi-scale multi-transport simulations of the non-isothermal model were
compared to isothermal simulation, showing that the presented model extension
corrects the standard Landau-de Gennes prediction from constant growth to
diffusion-limited growth, under shallow quench/undercooling conditions.
Non-isothermal simulations, where meta-stable nematic pre-ordering precedes
smectic-A growth, were also conducted and novel non-monotonic
phase-transformation kinetics observed.
