A new algorithm is developed that automatically detects filaments on the
solar disc in H-alpha images. Preprocessing of H-alpha images include
corrections for limb darkening and foreshortening. Further, by applying
suitable intensity and size thresholds, filaments are extracted, while other
solar features e.g. sunspots and plages are removed. Filaments attributes such
as their position on the solar disc, total area, length, and number of
fragments are determined. In addition, every filament is also labelled with a
unique number. The algorithm is capable of following a particular filament
through successive images which allows us to detect the changes and
disappearance of the same, and thus provides a real-time warning of eruptive
filaments. This aspect would prove to be of particular importance in studies
pertaining to space weather. The algorithm will eventually be integrated with
an upcoming telescope at Udaipur Solar Observatory for real time monitoring of
activated/eruptive filaments.
