The two-dimensional Hubbard model on the anisotropic triangular lattice, with
two different hopping amplitudes $t$ and $t^\prime$, is relevant to describe
the low-energy physics of $\kappa$-(ET)$_2$X, a family of organic salts. The
ground-state properties of this model are studied by using Monte Carlo
techniques, on the basis of a recent definition of backflow correlations for
strongly-correlated lattice systems. The results show that there is no magnetic
order for reasonably large values of the electron-electron interaction $U$ and
frustrating ratio $t^\prime/t = 0.85$, suitable to describe the non-magnetic
compound with X=Cu$_2$(CN)$_3$. On the contrary, N\'eel order takes place for
weaker frustrations, i.e., $t^\prime/t \sim 0.4 \div 0.6$, suitable for
materials with X=Cu$_2$(SCN)$_2$, Cu[N(CN)$_2$]Cl, or Cu[N(CN)$_2$]Br.
