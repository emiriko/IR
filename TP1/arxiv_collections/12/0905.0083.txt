In September 2008 the Slim5 collaboration submitted a low material budget
silicon demonstrator to test with 12 GeV/c protons, at the PS-T9 test-beam at
CERN. Inside the reference telescope, two different detectors were placed as
device under test (DUT). The first was a 4k-Pixel Matrix of Deep N Well MAPS,
developed in a 130 nm CMOS Technology, providing digital sparsified readout.
The other one was a high resistivity double sided silicon detector, with short
strips at 45-degree angle to the detector's edge, read out by the FSSR2 chip.
The FSSR2 is a 128 channel data-driven fast readout chip developed by Fermilab
and INFN. In this paper we describe the main features of latter sensor, the
striplet. The primary goal of the test was to measure the efficiency and the
resolution of the striplets. The data-driven approach of the FSSR2 readout
chips has been fully exploited by the DAQ system.
