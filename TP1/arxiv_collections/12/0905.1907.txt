Pre-main sequence (PMS) binaries and multiples enable critical tests of
stellar models if masses, metallicities, and luminosities of the component
stars are known. We have analyzed high-resolution, high signal-to-noise echelle
spectra of the quadruple-star system HD 98800 and using spectrum synthesis,
computed fits to the composite spectrum for a full range of plausible stellar
parameters for the components. We consistently find that sub-solar metallicity
yields fits with lower $\chi^2$ values, with an overall best-fit of $[M/H] =
-0.20\pm0.10$. This metallicity appears to be consistent with PMS evolutionary
tracks for the measured masses and luminosities of the components of HD 98800
but additional constraints on the system and modelling are needed.
