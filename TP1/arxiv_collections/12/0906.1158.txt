We study experimentally the influence of the intensity of the infrared (IR)
probe field on attosecond pulse train (APT) phase measurements performed with
the RABITT method (Reconstruction of Attosecond Beating by Interference in
Two-Photon Transitions). We find that if a strong IR field is applied, the
attosecond pulses will appear to have lower-than-actual chirp rates. We also
observe the onset of the streaking regime in the breakdown of the weak-field
RABITT conditions. We perform a Fourier-analysis of harmonic and sideband
continuum states and show that the mutual phase relation of the harmonics can
be extracted from higher Fourier components.
