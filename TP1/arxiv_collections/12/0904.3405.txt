Electrically detected nuclear magnetic resonance was studied in detail in a
two-dimensional electron gas as a function of current bias and temperature. We
show that applying a relatively modest dc-current bias, I_dc ~ 0.5 microAmps,
can induce a re-entrant and even enhanced nuclear spin signal compared with the
signal obtained under similar thermal equilibrium conditions at zero current
bias. Our observations suggest that dynamic nuclear spin polarization by small
current flow is possible in a two-dimensional electron gas, allowing for easy
manipulation of the nuclear spin by simple switching of a dc current.
