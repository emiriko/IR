The thermal conductivity $\kappa$ of the iron-arsenide superconductor
Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$ ($T_c \simeq$ 30 K) was measured in single crystals
at temperatures down to $T \simeq 50$ mK ($\simeq T_c$/600) and in magnetic
fields up to $H = 15$ T ($\simeq H_{c2}$/4). A negligible residual linear term
in $\kappa/T$ as $T \to 0$ shows that there are no zero-energy quasiparticles
in the superconducting state. This rules out the existence of line and in-plane
point nodes in the superconducting gap, imposing strong constraints on the
symmetry of the order parameter. It excludes d-wave symmetry, drawing a clear
distinction between these superconductors and the high-$T_c$ cuprates. However,
the fact that a magnetic field much smaller than $H_{c2}$ can induce a residual
linear term indicates that the gap must be very small on part of the Fermi
surface, whether from strong anisotropy or band dependence, or both.
