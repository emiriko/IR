Two counter-propagating cool and equally dense electron beams are modelled
with particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations. The electron beam filamentation
instability is examined in one spatial dimension, which is an approximation for
a quasi-planar filament boundary. It is confirmed, that the force on the
electrons imposed by the electrostatic field, which develops during the
nonlinear stage of the instability, oscillates around a mean value that equals
the magnetic pressure gradient force. The forces acting on the electrons due to
the electrostatic and the magnetic field have a similar strength. The
electrostatic field reduces the confining force close to the stable equilibrium
of each filament and increases it farther away, limiting the peak density. The
confining time-averaged total potential permits an overlap of current filaments
with an opposite flow direction.
