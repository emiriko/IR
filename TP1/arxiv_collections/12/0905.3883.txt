We investigate the effects of magnetic impurities in a superconducting state
with $s_\pm$ pairing symmetry. Within a two-band model, we find that the
intra-band magnetic scattering serves as a pair breaker while the inter-band
magnetic scattering preserves pairing and hardly affects transition temperature
in the Born limit. We also show that the same physics can persist beyond the
weak scattering region. Our results coincide with recent experimental
measurements in iron-based superconductors and thus provides an indirect
evidence of the possible $s_\pm$ pairing symmetry in these materials.
