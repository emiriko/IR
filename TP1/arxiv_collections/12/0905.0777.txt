We have integrated magneto-optical traps (MOTs) into an atom chip by etching
pyramids into a silicon wafer. These have been used to trap atoms on the chip,
directly from a room temperature vapor of rubidium. This new atom trapping
method provides a simple way to integrate several atom sources on the same
chip. It represents a substantial advance in atom chip technology and offers
new possibilities for atom chip applications such as integrated single atom or
photon sources and molecules on a chip.
