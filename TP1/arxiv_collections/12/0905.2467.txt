The degree to which a pure quantum state is entangled can be characterized by
the distance or angle to the nearest unentangled state. This geometric measure
of entanglement is explored for bi-partite and multi-partite pure and mixed
states. It is determined analytically for arbitrary two-qubit mixed states,
generalized Werner, and isotropic states, and is also applied to certain
multi-partite mixed states, including two distinct multi-partite bound
entangled states. Moreover, the ground-state entanglement of the XY model in a
transverse field is calculated and shown to exhibit singular behavior near the
quantum critical line. Along the way, connections are pointed out between the
geometric measure of entanglement, the Hartree approximation, entanglement
witnesses, correlation functions, and the relative entropy of entanglement.
