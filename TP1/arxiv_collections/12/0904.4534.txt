Considering Dirac neutrinos and Fritzsch-like texture 6 zero and 5 zero mass
matrices, detailed predictions for cases pertaining to normal/inverted
hierarchy as well as degenerate scenario of neutrino masses have been carried
out. All the cases considered here pertaining to inverted hierarchy and
degenerate scenario of neutrino masses are ruled out by the existing data. For
the normal hierarchy cases, the lower limit of m_nu_1 and of s_13 as well as
the range of Dirac-like CP violating phase delta_l would have implications for
the texture specific cases considered here.
