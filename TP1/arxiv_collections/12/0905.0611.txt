We calculate the current-voltage characteristic of a one-dimensional band
insulator with magnetic field and Rashba spin-orbit coupling which is connected
to nonmagnetic leads. Without spin-orbit coupling we find a complete
spin-filtering effect, meaning that the electric transport occurs in one spin
channel only. For a large magnetic field which closes the band gap, we show
that spin-orbit coupling leads to a transition from metallic to insulating
behavior. The oscillations of the different spin-components of the current with
the length of the transport channel are studied as well.
