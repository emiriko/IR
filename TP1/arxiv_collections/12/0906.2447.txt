The purpose of this work is to design and implement a plugin-based
environment that allows to integrate forensic tools working together to support
programming tasks and addition of new tools. Integration is done through GUI
components. The end-system environment must have user friendly GUI,
configuration capabilities, plug-in capabilities to insert/inject new tools,
case management, and chain of custody capabilities, along with evidence
gathering capabilities, evidence preservation capabilities, and, finally report
generation capabilities. A subset of these requirements has been implemented in
Ftklipse, an open-source project, which is detailed throughout the rest of this
document.
