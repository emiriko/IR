The static and dynamic properties of a Cosserat-type lattice interface of
finite thickness are studied, so that both displacements and rotational degrees
of freedom are taken into account. The model allows considering interfaces with
a beam-like microstructure and interfaces with finite size particles as
particular cases. One-dimensional solutions describing shear and
micro-rotations at the interface are obtained and discussed. Harmonic as well
as localized solutions, and the properties of the interfaces as filters for
elastic waves are investigated. It is shown that both systems with long- and
short-wavelength localization may exist.
