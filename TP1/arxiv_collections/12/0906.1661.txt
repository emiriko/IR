The present paper proposes a simple model aimed to point out the link between
basilar concepts of plasma physics and fundamental principles of quantum
mechanics. The model shows in particular that Debye lengths and plasma
frequency are actually straightforward consequences of the indistinguishability
of identical particles and the exclusion and uncertainty principles.
