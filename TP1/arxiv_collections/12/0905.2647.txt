Using attoscience, we study the electron correlations responsible for Auger
decay in krypton atoms. The Auger decay is induced by a pulse train or a twin
pulse composed of subpulses of attosecond duration. During the Auger decay an
optical dressing laser may be present. Interference effects between the ejected
Auger electron wave packets are predicted.
