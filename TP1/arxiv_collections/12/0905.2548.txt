During the past years the CDF and D0 detectors have collected large amounts
of data obtaining a relatively pure sample of pair-produced top quarks and a
well understood sample containing singly-produced top quarks. These samples
have been used for the precise measurement of the top quark properties, and
have set stringent limits on new physics in the top sample. This reports
presents the latest results from the CDF and D0 collaborations on the search
for new physics within the top sample using an integrated data sample of up to
3.6 fb-1.
