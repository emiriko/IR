We propose an efficient scheme for the implementation of quantum information
transfer in a onedimensional coupled resonator waveguide. We show that, based
on the effective long-range dipole-dipole interactions between the atoms
mediated by the cavity modes, Raman transitions between the atoms trapped in
different nodes can take place. Quantum information could be transferred
directly between the opposite ends of the coupled waveguide without involving
the intermediate nodes via either Raman transitions or the stimulated Raman
adiabatic passages. Since this scheme, in principle, is a one-step protocol, it
may provide useful applications in quantum communications.
