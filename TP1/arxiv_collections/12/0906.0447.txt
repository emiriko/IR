Under certain assumptions in terms of information and models, equilibria
correspond to possible stable outcomes in conflicting or cooperative scenarios
where rational entities interact. For wireless engineers, it is of paramount
importance to be able to predict and even ensure such states at which the
network will effectively operate. In this article, we provide non-exhaustive
methodologies for characterizing equilibria in wireless games in terms of
existence, uniqueness, selection, and efficiency.
