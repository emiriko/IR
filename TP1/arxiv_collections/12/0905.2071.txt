The knowledge of the Free Energy Landscape topology is the essential key to
understand many biochemical processes. The determination of the conformers of a
protein and their basins of attraction takes a central role for studying
molecular isomerization reactions. In this work, we present a novel framework
to unveil the features of a Free Energy Landscape answering questions such as
how many meta-stable conformers are, how the hierarchical relationship among
them is, or what the structure and kinetics of the transition paths are.
Exploring the landscape by molecular dynamics simulations, the microscopic data
of the trajectory are encoded into a Conformational Markov Network. The
structure of this graph reveals the regions of the conformational space
corresponding to the basins of attraction. In addition, handling the
Conformational Markov Network, relevant kinetic magnitudes as dwell times or
rate constants, and the hierarchical relationship among basins, complete the
global picture of the landscape. We show the power of the analysis studying a
toy model of a funnel-like potential and computing efficiently the conformers
of a short peptide, the dialanine, paving the way to a systematic study of the
Free Energy Landscape in large peptides.
