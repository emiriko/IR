We study the Langevin dynamics of a dipole diffusing in a random electrical
field E derived from a quenched Gaussian potential. We show that in a suitable
adiabatic limit (where the dynamics of the dipole moment is much faster than
the dynamics of its position), one can reduce the coupled stochastic equations
to an effective Langevin equation for a particle diffusing in an effective
potential with a spatially varying and anisotropic local diffusivity
$\kappa_{ij}$. Analytic results, close to the adiabatic limit, for the
diffusion constant $\kappa_e$ are found in one dimension and a finite
temperature dynamical transition is found. The system is also studied
numerically. In particular, we study the anomalous diffusion exponent in the
low temperature regime. Our findings strongly support the conclusion that the
location of the dynamical transition and the anomalous diffusion exponents are
determined by purely static considerations, i.e. they are independent of the
relative values of the diffusion constants of the particle position and its
dipole moment.
