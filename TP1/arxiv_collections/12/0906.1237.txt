Recently a new four-dimensional non relativistic renormalizable theory of
gravity was proposed by Horava. In this paper we have found different near
horizon geometries in Horava gravity. We find the rotating solutions in a
special range of parameters of the theory. This range allows us to include up
to six derivative terms in the equations of motion. We have found our solutions
as perturbed solutions over spherical symmetric background with small rotating
parameter.
