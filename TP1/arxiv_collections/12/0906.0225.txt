Recently it has been shown by the present author [H. Hasegawa, Phys. Rev. E
(in press): arXiv:0904.2399] that the interpolation approximation (IA) to the
generalized Bose-Einstein and Femi-Dirac distributions yields results in
agreement with the exact ones within the $O(q-1)$ and in high- and
low-temperature limits, where $(q-1)$ expresses the non-extensivity: the case
of $q=1$ corresponding to the conventional quantal distributions. In this
study, we have applied the generalized distributions in the IA to typical
nonextensive subjects: (1) the black-body radiation, (2) the Bose-Einstein
condensation, (3) the BCS superconductivity and (4) itinerant-electron
(metallic) ferromagnetism. Effects of the non-extensivity on physical
quantities in these nonextenisive quantum systems have been investigated. A
critical comparison is made between results calculated by the IA and the
factorization approximation (FA) which has been so far applied to many
nonextensive systems. It has been pointed out that the FA overestimates the
non-extensivity and that it leads to an inappropriate results for fermion
systems like the subjects (3) and (4).
