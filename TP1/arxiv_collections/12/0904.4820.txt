We report measurements of the branching fractions for the decays
B->D_s1(2536)+ anti-D(*), where anti-D(*) is anti-D0, D- or D*-, and study of
B->X(3872) K with X(3872) decaying to D*0 anti-D0 using a sample of 657 million
B anti-B pairs recorded at the Upsilon(4S) resonance with the Belle detector at
the KEKB asymmetric-energy e+e- collider.
