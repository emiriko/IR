We consider the classical and quantum properties of the "Chirikov typical
map", proposed by Boris Chirikov in 1969. This map is obtained from the well
known Chirikov standard map by introducing a finite number $T$ of random phase
shift angles. These angles induce a random behavior for small time scales
($t<T$) and a $T$-periodic iterated map which is relevant for larger time
scales ($t>T$). We identify the classical chaos border $k_c\sim T^{-3/2} \ll 1$
for the kick parameter $k$ and two regimes with diffusive behavior on short and
long time scales. The quantum dynamics is characterized by the effect of
Chirikov localization (or dynamical localization). We find that the
localization length depends in a subtle way on the two classical diffusion
constants in the two time-scale regime.
