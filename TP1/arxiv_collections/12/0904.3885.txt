We demonstrate that, in a multi-BMPV black hole spacetime, the event horizon
is not smooth. We explicitly show that for a simpler configuration comprising a
line of static extremal black holes and a single BMPV black hole, the metric at
the horizon of the BMPV black hole is once, but not twice, continuously
differentiable. We argue that this result is also valid when all the black
holes are rotating. The Maxwell field strength is shown to be continuous, but
not differentiable at the horizon. We also briefly demonstrate that previous
work done to show lack of smoothness of static multi-centre solutions in five
dimensions is not significantly modified by the inclusion of a higher
derivative term in the action for five dimensional supergravity.
