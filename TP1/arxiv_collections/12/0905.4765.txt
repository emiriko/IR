This paper presents Sweet-Parker type scaling arguments in the context of
hyper-resistive Hall magnetohyrdodynamics (MHD). The predicted steady state
scalings are consistent with those found by Chac\'on et al. [PRL 99, 235001
(2007)], though as with that study, no prediction of electron dissipation
region \emph{length} is made. Numerical experiments confirm that both cusp-like
and modestly more extended geometries are realizable. However, importantly, the
length of the electron dissipation region, which is taken as a parameter by
several recent studies, is found to depend explicitly on the level of
hyper-resistivity. Furthermore, although hyper-resistivity can produce more
extended electron dissipation regions, the length of the region remains smaller
than one ion skin depth for the largest values of hyper-resistivity considered
here. These electron dissipation regions are significantly shorter than those
seen in many recent kinetic studies. The length of the electron dissipation
region is found to depend on electron inertia as well, scaling like
$(m_e/m_i)^{3/8}$. However, the thickness of the region appears to scale
similarly, so that the aspect ratio is at most very weakly dependent on
$(m_e/m_i)$. The limitations of scaling theories which do not predict the
length of the electron dissipation region are emphasized.
