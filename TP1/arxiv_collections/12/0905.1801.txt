In the present work we study (i) charged black hole in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet
(EGB) theory, known as Einstein-Maxwell-Gauss-Bonnet (EMGB) black hole and (ii)
black hole in EGB gravity with Yang-Mills field. The thermodynamic geometry of
these two black hole solutions has been investigated, using the modified
entropy in Gauss-Bonnet theory.
