In the paper it is defined two marginal Markov processes on von Neumann
algebras $\cm$ and $\cm\o\cm$, respectively, corresponding to given quantum
quadratic stochastic process (q.q.s.p.). It is proved that such marginal
processes uniquely determines the q.q.s.p. Moreover, certain ergodic relations
between them are established as well.
