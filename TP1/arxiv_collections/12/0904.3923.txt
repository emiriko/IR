We present a study of the effects of dispersion on the properties of photon
pairs generated by type-II, collinear spontaneous parametric downconversion.
Specifically, we take into consideration the effects of a chirped pump, as well
as of dispersive propagation of the photon pairs. We present expressions for
the joint amplitude both in the spectral and temporal domains, as well as for
the chronocyclic Wigner function of heralded single photons, which fully
characterizes the single photon spectral (temporal) properties. On the one
hand, we show that unwanted effects of pump chirp in terms of the heralded
single photon duration can be suppressed for states designed to be factorable
and spectrally elongated. On the other hand, we show that pump chirp
constitutes an effective tool for the control of the degree of photon-pair
entanglement. We show that when frequency-entangled photon pairs propagate
through a dispersive medium, entanglement can "migrate" between the modulus and
phase of the joint temporal amplitude.
