We give combinatorial formulas for the Laurent expansion of any cluster
variable in any cluster algebra coming from a triangulated surface (with or
without punctures), with respect to an arbitrary seed. Moreover, we work in the
generality of principal coefficients. An immediate corollary of our formulas is
a proof of the positivity conjecture of Fomin and Zelevinsky for cluster
algebras from surfaces, in geometric type.
