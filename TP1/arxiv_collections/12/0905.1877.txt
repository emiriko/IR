In this article we describe the methods of observing WZ signal at CMS
experiment at Large Hadron Collider. To reduce the dependence on Monte Carlo
simulation we use data-driven techniques and estimate that 5sigma significance
of WZ signal can be reached with less than 350 pb^{-1} at 95% C.L. for sqrt{s}
= 14 TeV. We also overview several models that would yield anomalous production
of the WZ final state, sensitivity to which can be achieved with less data.
