Our understanding of earthquakes is based on the theory of plate tectonics.
Earthquake dynamics is the study of the interactions of plates (solid disjoint
parts of the lithosphere) which produce seismic activity. Over the last about
fifty years many models have come up which try to simulate seismic activity by
mimicking plate plate interactions. The validity of a given model is subject to
the compliance of the synthetic seismic activity it produces to the well known
empirical laws which describe the statistical features of observed seismic
activity. Here we present a review of two such models of earthquake dynamics
with main focus on a relatively new model namely The Two Fractal Overlap Model.
