I present results for the finite renormalization of the
Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix induced by gluino--squark diagrams in
the MSSM with non-minimal sources of flavour violation. Subsequently I derive
bounds on the flavour--off--diagonal elements of the squark mass matrices by
requiring that the radiative corrections to the CKM elements do not exceed the
experimental values. The constraints on the associated dimensionless quantities
$\delta^{d LR}_{ij}$, $j>i$, are stronger than the bounds from flavour-changing
neutral current (FCNC) processes if gluino and squarks are heavier than 500$
\gev$. The results imply that it is still possible to generate all observed
flavour violation from the soft supersymmetry-breaking terms without
conflicting with present-day data on FCNC processes. Therefore we reappraise
the idea that only $Y^q_{33}$ is different from zero at tree-level and all
other Yukawa couplings are generated radiatively. This model solves the SUSY
flavour as well as the SUSY CP problem. The presented results are published in
\cite{Crivellin:2008mq}.
