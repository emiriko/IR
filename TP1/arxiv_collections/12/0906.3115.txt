We present a general route to reduce inhomogeneous broadening in nanodevices
due to 1/f noise. We apply this method to a universal two-qubit gate and
demonstrate that for selected optimal couplings, a high-efficient gate can be
implemented even in the presence of 1/f noise. Entanglement degradation due to
interplay of 1/f and quantum noise is quantified via the concurrence. A
charge-phase $\sqrt{{\rm i-SWAP}}$ gate for spectra extrapolated from single
qubit experiments is analyzed.
