We report on observations of the Large Magellanic Cloud with the Fermi
Gamma-Ray Space Telescope. The LMC is clearly detected with the Large Area
Telescope (LAT) and for the first time the emission is spatially well resolved
in gamma-rays. Our observations reveal that the bulk of the gamma-ray emission
arises from the 30 Doradus region. We discuss this result in light of the
massive star populations that are hosted in this area and address implications
for cosmic-ray physics. We conclude by exploring the scientific potential of
the ongoing Fermi observations on the study of high-energy phenomena in massive
stars.
