We for the first time propose a physical model of the precursor (PR) and
interpulse (IP) components of the radio pulsar profiles. It is based on
propagation effects in the secondary plasma flow of a pulsar. The components
are suggested to result from the induced scattering of the main pulse (MP) into
background. The induced scattering appears efficient enough to transfer a
significant part of the MP energy to the background radiation. In the regimes
of superstrong and moderately strong magnetic field, the scattered components
are approximately parallel and antiparallel to the velocity of the scattering
particles and can be identified with the PR and IP, respectively. The spectral
evolution, polarization properties, and fluctuation behaviour of the scattered
components are examined and compared with the observational results. The
perspectives of the complex profile studies are outlined as well.
