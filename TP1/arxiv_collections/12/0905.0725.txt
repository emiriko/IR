We discuss one of the possible origins of large-scale magnetic fields based
on a continuous distribution of toroidal electric current flowing in the inner
region of the disc around a Kerr black hole (BH) in the framework of general
relativity. It turns out that four types of configuration of the magnetic
connection (MC) are generated, i.e., MC of the BH with the remote astrophysical
load (MCHL), MC of the BH with the disc (MCHD), MC of the plunging region with
the disc (MCPD) and MC of the inner and outer disc regions (MCDD). It turns out
that the Blandford-Znajek (BZ) process can be regarded as one type of MC, i.e.,
MCHL. In addition, we propose a scenario for fitting the quasi-periodic
oscillations in BH binaries based on MCDD associated with the magnetic
reconnection.
