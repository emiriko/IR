For a type I basic classical Lie superalgebra
$\mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{g}_{\bar{0}} \oplus \mathfrak{g}_{\bar{1}}$, we
establish an equivalence between typical blocks of categories of
$U_{\chi}(\mathfrak{g})$-modules and $U_{\chi}(mathfrak{g}_{\bar{0})$-modules.
We then deduce various consequences from the equivalence.
