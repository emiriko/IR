We study the Cauchy problem for the cubic nonlinear Schroedinger equation,
perturbed by (higher order) dissipative nonlinearities. We prove global in-time
existence of solutions for general initial data in the energy space. In
particular we treat the energy-critical case of a quintic dissipation in three
space dimensions.
