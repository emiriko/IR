Edge states lying at the edge of PPT entangled states have a very intriguing
existence and their detection is equally interesting. We present here a new
witness for detection of edge states. We then compare between our proposed
witness operator and the witness operator proposed in [Physical Review A, 62,
052310 (2000)] in terms of the efficiency in the detection of PPT entangled
states. In this regard we show that this operator is finer than the Lewenstein
et.al. operator in some restriction. We also discuss about its experimental
realization via Gell-Mann matrices.
