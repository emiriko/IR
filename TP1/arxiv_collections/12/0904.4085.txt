The energy spectrum of the two-magnon bound states in the Heisenberg-Ising
antiferromagnet on the square lattice are calculated using series expansion
methods. The results confirm an earlier spin-wave prediction of Oguchi and
Ishikawa, that the bound states vanish into the continuum before the isotropic
Heisenberg limit is reached.
