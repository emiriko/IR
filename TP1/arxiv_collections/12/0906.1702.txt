Celebrated work of Jerrum, Sinclair, and Vigoda has established that the
permanent of a {0,1} matrix can be approximated in randomized polynomial time
by using a rapidly mixing Markov chain. A separate strand of the literature has
pursued the possibility of an alternate, purely algebraic, polynomial-time
approximation scheme. These schemes work by replacing each 1 with a random
element of an algebra A, and considering the determinant of the resulting
matrix. When A is noncommutative, this determinant can be defined in several
ways. We show that for estimators based on the conventional determinant, the
critical ratio of the second moment to the square of the first--and therefore
the number of trials we need to obtain a good estimate of the permanent--is (1
+ O(1/d))^n when A is the algebra of d by d matrices. These results can be
extended to group algebras, and semi-simple algebras in general. We also study
the symmetrized determinant of Barvinok, showing that the resulting estimator
has small variance when d is large enough. However, for constant d--the only
case in which an efficient algorithm is known--we show that the critical ratio
exceeds 2^{n} / n^{O(d)}. Thus our results do not provide a new polynomial-time
approximation scheme for the permanent. Indeed, they suggest that the algebraic
approach to approximating the permanent faces significant obstacles.
  We obtain these results using diagrammatic techniques in which we express
matrix products as contractions of tensor products. When these matrices are
random, in either the Haar measure or the Gaussian measure, we can evaluate the
trace of these products in terms of the cycle structure of a suitably random
permutation. In the symmetrized case, our estimates are then derived by a
connection with the character theory of the symmetric group.
