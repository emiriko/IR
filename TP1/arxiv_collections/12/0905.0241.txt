We construct a dark energy model where a scalar field non-minimally coupled
to gravity plays the role of the dark component. We compare cosmological
consequences of this non-minimal coupling of the scalar field and gravity in
the spirit of the dark energy paradigm in Jordan and Einstein frames. Some
important issues such as phantom divide line crossing, existence of the
bouncing solutions and the stability of the solutions are compared in these two
frames. We show that while a non-minimally coupled scalar field in the Jordan
frame is a suitable dark energy component with capability to realize phantom
divide line crossing, its conformal transformation in the Einstein frame has
not this capability. The conformal transformation from Jordan frame to Einstein
frame transforms the equation of state parameter of the dark energy component
to its minimal form with a redefined scalar field and in this case it is
impossible to realize a phantom phase with possible crossing of the phantom
divide line.
