A mathematical model to describe period-memorizing behavior in Physarum
plasmodium are reported. In constructing the model, we first examine the basic
characteristics required for the class of models, then create a minimal linear
model to fulfill these requirements. We also propose two modifications of the
minimal model, nonlinearization and noise addition, which improve the
reproducibility of experimental evidences. Differences in the mechanisms and in
the reproducibility of experiments between our models and the previous models
are discussed.
