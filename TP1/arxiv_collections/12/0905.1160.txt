We investigate the distance-redshift relation in a realistic inhomogeneous
universe where the mass distribution is described by the mass function of Sheth
and Tormen. It is found that the derived distance deviates systematically from
the standard distance up to 10% depending on the choice of the lowest halo mass
in which baryonic matter condensed to form luminous object such as galaxies.
Remarkably the derived distance is well approximated by the Dyer-Roeder
distance if we choose the clumpiness parameter \alpha calculated by our
model.We also discuss the effect of inhomogeneities in the determination of
dark energy parameter in the supernovae observation, and find that this effect
must be taken into account for the future high redshift supernovae observation.
