Transition metal ferromagnetic films with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy
(PMA) have ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) linewidths that are one order of
magnitude larger than soft magnetic materials, such as pure iron (Fe) and
permalloy (NiFe) thin films. A broadband FMR setup has been used to investigate
the origin of the enhanced linewidth in Ni$|$Co multilayer films with PMA. The
FMR linewidth depends linearly on frequency for perpendicular applied fields
and increases significantly when the magnetization is rotated into the film
plane. Irradiation of the film with Helium ions decreases the PMA and the
distribution of PMA parameters. This leads to a great reduction of the FMR
linewidth for in-plane magnetization. These results suggest that fluctuations
in PMA lead to a large two magnon scattering contribution to the linewidth for
in-plane magnetization and establish that the Gilbert damping is enhanced in
such materials ($\alpha \approx 0.04$, compared to $\alpha \approx 0.002$ for
pure Fe).
