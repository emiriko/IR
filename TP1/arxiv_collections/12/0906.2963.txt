We present an approach to study the decay modes of the $J/\psi$ into a vector
meson and a tensor meson, taking into account the nature of the $f_2(1270)$,
$f'_2(1525)$, $\bar{K}^{* 0}_2(1430)$ resonances as dynamically generated
states from the vector meson-vector meson interaction. We evaluate four ratios
of partial decay widths in terms of a flavor dependent OZI breaking parameter
and the results obtained compare favorably with experiment. The fit to the data
is possible due to the particular strength and sign of the couplings of the
resonances to pairs of vector mesons given by the theory, thus providing a
nontrivial test for the idea of these tensor states as dynamically generated
from the vector-vector interaction.
