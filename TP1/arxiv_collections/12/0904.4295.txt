The phase-integral approximation devised by Fr\"oman and Fr\"oman, is used
for computing cosmological perturbations in the quadratic chaotic inflationary
model. The phase-integral formulas for the scalar and tensor power spectra are
explicitly obtained up to fifth order of the phase-integral approximation. We
show that, the phase integral gives a very good approximation for the shape of
the power spectra associated with scalar and tensor perturbations as well as
the spectral indices. We find that the accuracy of the phase-integral
approximation compares favorably with the numerical results and those obtained
using the slow-roll and uniform approximation methods.
