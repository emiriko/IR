Improvement of industrial performance such as cost, lead-time, adaptability,
variety and traceability is the major finality of companies. At this need
corresponds the necessity to collaborate and to strengthen their coordination
mechanisms. Information exchange becomes then a strategic question: what is the
nature of the information that can be shared with customers and suppliers?
Which impact on the performance of a company is expectable? What about the
performance of the whole supply chain? It is essential for a company to
identify the information whose exchange contributes to its performance and to
control its information flows. This study aims to release from the literature
the main tendencies of collaboration practices and information exchanges
leading to the performance and to propose a model of hypothesis gathering these
practices.
