We have developed a set of seven observational equations that include all of
the physics necessary to relate the most important of the fundamental constants
to the definitions of the SI kilogram and ampere. We have used these to
determine the influence of alternative definitions being considered for the SI
kilogram and ampere on the uncertainty of three of the fundamental constants
(h, e and mu). We have also reviewed the experimental evidence for the
exactness of the quantum metrology triangle resulting from experiments
combining the quantum Hall effect, the Josephson effects and single-electron
tunnelling.
