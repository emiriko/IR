This paper examines sterile neutrino oscillation models in light of recently
published results from the MiniBooNE Experiment. The new MiniBooNE data include
the updated neutrino results, including the low energy region, and the first
antineutrino results, as well as first results from the off-axis NuMI beam
observed in the MiniBooNE detector. These new global fits also include data
from LSND, KARMEN, NOMAD, Bugey, CHOOZ, CCFR84, and CDHS. Constraints from
atmospheric oscillation data have been imposed.
