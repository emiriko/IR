The existence of two stationary solutions of the nonlinear Boltzmann equation
for inelastic hard spheres or disks is investigated. They are restricted
neither to weak dissipation nor to small gradients. The one-particle
distribution functions are assumed to have an scaling property, namely that all
the position dependence occurs through the density and the temperature. At the
macroscopic level, the state corresponding to both is characterized by uniform
pressure, no mass flow, and a linear temperature profile. Moreover, the state
exhibits two peculiar features. First, there is a relationship between the
inelasticity of collisions, the pressure, and the temperature gradient. Second,
the heat flux can be expressed as being linear in the temperature gradient,
i.e. a Fourier-like law is obeyed. One of the solutions is singular in the
elastic limit. The theoretical predictions following from the other one are
compared with molecular dynamics simulation results and a good agreement is
obtained in the parameter region in which the Fourier state can be actually
observed in the simulations, namely not too strong inelasticity.
