High temeperature (900-1000\degree C) low pressure (<< 1 atm) pyrolysis of
propane yields a pyrocarbon deposit, but also mainly hydrogen and hydrocarbons
from methane to polyaromatics. 30 reaction products were exeperimentally
quantified at different operating conditions. A detailed kinetic pyrolysis
model (600 reactions) has been developed and validated based on the totality of
experiments. This model includes a homogeneous model (describing the gas phase
pyrolysis of propane) coupled with a heterogeneous model describing the
pyrocarbon deposit.
