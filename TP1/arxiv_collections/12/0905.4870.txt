In our paper Semi-symmetric Algebras: General Constructions, J. Algebra, 148
(1992), pp. 479-496, we present the construction of the semi-symmetric algebra
of a module over a commutative ring with unit, which generalizes the tensor
algebra, the symmetric algebra, and the exterior algebra, deduce some of its
functorial properties, and prove a classification theorem. In the present paper
we continue the study of the semi-symmetric algebra and discuss its graded
dual, the corresponding canonical bilinear form, its coalgebra structure, as
well as left and right inner products. Here we present a unified treatment of
these topics whose exposition in N. Bourbaki, Alg\` ebre, Chapitres 1--3,
Hermann, Paris 1970, is made simultaneously for the above three particular
(and, without a shadow of doubt - most important) cases.
