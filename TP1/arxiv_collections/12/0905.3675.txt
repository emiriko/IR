Dark Matter detectors with directional sensitivity have the potential of
yielding an unambiguous positive observation of WIMPs as well as discriminating
between galactic Dark Matter halo models. In this article, we introduce the
motivation for directional detectors, discuss the experimental techniques that
make directional detection possible, and review the status of the experimental
effort in this field.
