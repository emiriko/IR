We extend our subtractive-renormalization method in order to evaluate the 1S0
and 3S1-3D1 NN scattering phase shifts up to next-to-next-to-leading order
(NNLO) in chiral effective theory. We show that, if energy-dependent contact
terms are employed in the NN potential, the 1S0 phase shift can be obtained by
carrying out two subtractions on the Lippmann-Schwinger equation. These
subtractions use knowledge of the the scattering length and the 1S0 phase shift
at a specific energy to eliminate the low-energy constants in the contact
interaction from the scattering equation. For the J=1 coupled channel, a
similar renormalization can be achieved by three subtractions that employ
knowledge of the 3S1 scattering length, the 3S1 phase shift at a specific
energy and the 3S1-3D1 generalized scattering length. In both channels a
similar method can be applied to a potential with momentum-dependent contact
terms, except that in that case one of the subtractions must be replaced by a
fit to one piece of experimental data.
  This method allows the use of arbitrarily high cutoffs in the
Lippmann-Schwinger equation. We examine the NNLO S-wave phase shifts for
cutoffs as large as 5 GeV and show that the presence of linear energy
dependence in the NN potential creates spurious poles in the scattering
amplitude. In consequence the results are in conflict with empirical data over
appreciable portions of the considered cutoff range. We also identify problems
with the use of cutoffs greater than 1 GeV when momentum-dependent contact
interactions are employed. These problems are ameliorated, but not eliminated,
by the use of spectral-function regularization for the two-pion exchange part
of the NN potential
