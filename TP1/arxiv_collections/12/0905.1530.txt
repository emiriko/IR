Angular distribution of the 12C(7Li,6He)13N reaction at E(7Li) = 44.0 MeV was
measured at the HI-13 tandem accelerator of Beijing, China. Asymptotic
normalization coefficient (ANC) of 13N = 12C + p was derived to be 1.64 $\pm$
0.11 fm$^{-1/2}$ through distorted wave Born approximation (DWBA) analysis. The
ANC was then used to deduce the astrophysical $S(E)$ factors and reaction rates
for direct capture in 12C(p,g)13N at energies of astrophysical relevance.
