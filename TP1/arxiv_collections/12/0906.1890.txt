We calculate the bulk viscosity, drag force and jet quenching parameter in
Improved Holographic QCD. We find that the bulk viscosity rises near the phase
transition but does not exceed the shear viscosity. The drag force shows the
effects of asymptotic freedom both as a function of velocity and temperature.
It indicates diffusion times of heavy quarks in rough agreement with data. The
jet quenching parameter values computed via the light-like Wilson loop are in
the lower range suggested by data.
