We measured the radii of 7 low and very low-mass stars using long baseline
interferometry with the VLTI interferometer and its VINCI and AMBER
near-infrared recombiners. We use these new data, together with literature
measurements, to examine the luminosity- radius and mass-radius relations for K
and M dwarfs. The precision of the new interferometric radii now competes with
what can be obtained for double-lined eclipsing binaries. Interferometry
provides access to much less active stars, as well as to stars with much better
measured distances and luminosities, and therefore complements the information
obtained from eclipsing systems. The radii of magnetically quiet late-K to M
dwarfs match the predictions of stellar evolution models very well, providing
direct confirmation that magnetic activity explains the discrepancy that was
recently found for magnetically active eclipsing systems. The radii of the
early K dwarfs are well reproduced for a mixing length parameter that
approaches the solar value, as qualitatively expected.
