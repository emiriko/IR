We present detailed heat capacity measurements for Ba(Fe(1-x)Cox)2As2 and
Ba(Fe(1-x)Nix)2As2 single crystals in the vicinity of the superconducting
transitions. The specific heat jump at the superconducting transition
temperature (Tc), Delta Cp/Tc, changes by a factor ~ 10 across these series.
The Delta Cp/T$ vs. Tc data of this work (together with the literature data for
Ba(Fe0.939Co0.061)2As2, (Ba0.55K0.45)Fe2As2, and (Ba0.6K0.4)Fe2As2) scale well
to a single log-log plot over two orders of magnitude in Delta Cp/Tc and over
about an order of magnitude in Tc, giving Delta Cp/Tc ~ Tc^2.
