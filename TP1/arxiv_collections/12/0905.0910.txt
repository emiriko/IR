A broad continuum excess in the near-infrared, peaking in the rest-frame at
2-5 micron, is detected in a spectroscopic sample of 88 galaxies at 0.5<z<2.0
taken from the Gemini Deep Deep Survey. Line emission from polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons (PAHs) at 3.3 micron alone cannot explain the excess, which can be
fit by a spectral component consisting of a template of PAH emission lines
superposed on a modified blackbody of temperature T~850 K. The luminosity of
this near-infrared excess emission at 3 micron is found to be correlated with
the star formation rate of the galaxy. The origin of the near-infrared excess
is explored by examining similar excesses observed locally in massive star
forming regions, reflection and planetary nebulae, post-asymptotic giant branch
stars and in the galactic cirrus. We also consider the potential contribution
from dust heated around low-luminosity active galactic nuclei. We conclude that
the most likely explanation for the 2-5 micron excess is the contribution from
circumstellar disks around massive young stellar objects seen in the integrated
light of high-redshift galaxies. Assuming circumstellar disks extend down to
lower masses, as they do in our own Galaxy, the excess emission presents us
with an exciting opportunity to measure the formation rate of planetary systems
at cosmic epochs before our own solar system formed.
