The compactness of weak solutions to the magnetohydrodynamic equations for
the viscous, compressible, heat conducting fluids is considered in both the
three-dimensional space $\R^3$ and the three-dimensional periodic domains. The
viscosities, the heat conductivity as well as the magnetic coefficient are
allowed to depend on the density, and may vanish on the vacuum. This paper
provides a new idea to show the compactness of solutions of viscous,
compressible, heat conducting magnetohydrodynamic flows, derives a new entropy
identity, and shows that the limit of a sequence of weak solutions is still a
weak solution to the compressible magnetohydrodynamic equations.
