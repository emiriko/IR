The Sixth Data Release (DR6) in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) provides
more photometric regions, new features and more accurate data around globular
cluster Palomar 5. A new method, Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN), is
used to estimate the probability of cluster member to detect its tidal tails.
Cluster and field stars, used for training the networks, are extracted over a
$40\times20$ deg$^2$ field by color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs). The best BPNNs
with two hidden layers and Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) training algorithm are
determined by the chosen cluster and field samples. The membership
probabilities of stars in the whole field are obtained with the BPNNs, and
contour maps of the probability distribution show that a tail extends $5.42\dg$
to the north of the cluster and a tail extends $3.77\dg$ to the south. The
whole tails are similar to those detected by \citet{od03}, but no longer debris
of the cluster is found to the northeast of the sky. The radial density
profiles are investigated both along the tails and near the cluster center.
Quite a few substructures are discovered in the tails. The number density
profile of the cluster is fitted with the King model and the tidal radius is
determined as $14.28'$. However, the King model cannot fit the observed profile
at the outer regions ($R > 8'$) because of the tidal tails generated by the
tidal force. Luminosity functions of the cluster and the tidal tails are
calculated, which confirm that the tails originate from Palomar 5.
