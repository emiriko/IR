Using 9.4 g of Zr-96 and 1221 days of data from the NEMO-3 detector
corresponding to 0.031 kg yr, the obtained 2vbb decay half-life measurement is
[2.35 +/- 0.14(stat) +/- 0.16(syst)] x 10^19 yr. Different characteristics of
the final state electrons have been studied, such as the energy sum, individual
electron energy, and angular distribution. The 2v nuclear matrix element is
extracted using the measured 2vbb half-life and is 0.049 +/- 0.002. Constraints
on 0vbb decay have also been set.
