The theory part of this paper is sketched as follows. Based on column
stochastic average matrix $T_n$ selected as a basic substitution matrix, the
method of advanced successive difference substitution is established. Then, a
set of necessary and sufficient conditions for deciding positive semi-definite
form on $\R^n_+$ is derived from this method. And furthermore, it is proved
that the sequence of SDS sets of a positive definite form is positively
terminating.
  Worked out according to these results, the Maple program TSDS3 not only
automatically proves the polynomial inequalities, but also outputs counter
examples for the false. Sometimes TSDS3 does not halt, but it is very useful by
experimenting on so many examples.
