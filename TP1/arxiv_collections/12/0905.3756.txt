We devise an ab initio formalism for the quantum dynamics of Auger decay by
laser-dressed atoms which are inner-shell ionized by extreme ultraviolet (XUV)
light. The optical dressing laser is assumed to be sufficiently weak such that
ground-state electrons are neither excited nor ionized by it. However, the
laser has a strong effect on continuum electrons which we describe in
strong-field approximation with Volkov waves. The XUV light pulse has a low
peak intensity and its interaction is treated as a one-photon process. The
quantum dynamics of the inner-shell hole creation with subsequent Auger decay
is given by equations of motion (EOMs). For this paper, the EOMs are simplified
in terms of an essential-states model which is solved analytically and averaged
over magnetic subshells. We apply our theory to the M_4,5 N_1 N_2,3 Auger decay
of a 3d hole in a krypton atom. The orbitals are approximated by scaled
hydrogenic wave functions. A single attosecond pulse produces 3d vacancies
which Auger decay in the presence of an 800nm laser with an intensity of 10^13
W / cm^2. We compute the Auger electron spectrum and assess the convergence of
the various quantities involved.
