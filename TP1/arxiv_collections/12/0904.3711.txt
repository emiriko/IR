In present paper, I propose a method for resolving the timing delays for
output signals from an asynchronous sequential system. It will be used an
example of an asynchronous sequential system that will set up an output signal
when an input signal will be set up. The width of the output signal depends on
the input signal width, and in this case it is very short. There are many
synthesis methods, like using a RC group system, a monostable system in design
of the asynchronous digital system or using an external clock signal, CK. In
this paper will be used an external clock signal, CK.
