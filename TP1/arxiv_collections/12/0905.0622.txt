We consider implications of a fourth generation of leptons, allowing for the
most general mass patterns for the fourth generation neutrino. We determine the
constraints due to the precision electroweak measurements and outline the
signatures to search for at the LHC experiments. As a concrete framework to
apply these results we consider the minimal walking technicolor (MWTC) model
where the matter content, regarding the electroweak quantum numbers,
corresponds to a fourth generation.
