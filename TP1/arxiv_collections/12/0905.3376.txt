We calculate the dissipative dynamics of two-qubit quantum discord under
Markovian environments. We analyze various dissipative channels such as
dephasing, depolarizing, and generalized amplitude damping, assuming
independent perturbation, in which each qubit is coupled to its own channel.
Choosing initial conditions that manifest the so-called sudden death of
entanglement, we compare the dynamics of entanglement with that of quantum
discord. We show that in all cases where entanglement suddenly disappears,
quantum discord vanishes only in the asymptotic limit, behaving similarly to
individual decoherence of the qubits, even at finite temperatures. Hence,
quantum discord is more robust than the entanglement against to decoherence so
that quantum algorithms based only on quantum discord correlations may be more
robust than those based on entanglement.
