This paper studies quantum annealing (QA) for clustering, which can be seen
as an extension of simulated annealing (SA). We derive a QA algorithm for
clustering and propose an annealing schedule, which is crucial in practice.
Experiments show the proposed QA algorithm finds better clustering assignments
than SA. Furthermore, QA is as easy as SA to implement.
