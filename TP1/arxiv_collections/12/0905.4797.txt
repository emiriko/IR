Recent experiments on quantum turbulence in superfluid helium made use of
small tracer particles to track the motion of quantized vortices, determine
velocity statistics and visualize vortex reconnections. A problem with this
visualization technique is that it may change the turbulent flow which it
visualizes. To address this problem, we derive and solve the equations of
motion of a quantized vortex ring which contains a given number of particles
trapped on the vortex core, hence derive a quantitative criterion to determine
in which measure small particles trapped in quantized vortices affect vortex
motion. Finally we apply the criterion to a recent experiment.
