We establish an intriguing connection between quantum phase transitions and
bifurcations in the reduced fidelity between two different reduced density
matrices for quantum lattice many-body systems with symmetry-breaking orders.
Our finding is based on the observation that, in the conventional
Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson paradigm, a quantum system undergoing a phase transition
is characterized in terms of spontaneous symmetry breaking that is captured by
a local order parameter, which in turn results in an essential change of the
reduced density matrix in the symmetry-broken phase. Two quantum systems on an
infinite lattice in one spatial dimension, i.e., quantum Ising model in a
transverse magnetic field and quantum spin 1/2 XYX model in an external
magnetic field, are considered in the context of the tensor network algorithm
based on the matrix product state representation.
