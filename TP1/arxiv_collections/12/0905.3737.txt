The ACS Nearby Galaxy Survey Treasury (ANGST) is a systematic survey to
establish a legacy of uniform multi-color photometry of resolved stars for a
volume-limited sample of nearby galaxies (D<4 Mpc). The survey volume
encompasses 69 galaxies in diverse environments, including close pairs, small &
large groups, filaments, and truly isolated regions. The galaxies include a
nearly complete range of morphological types spanning a factor of ~10^4 in
luminosity and star formation rate. The survey data consists of images taken
with ACS on HST, supplemented with archival data and new WFPC2 imaging taken
after the failure of ACS. Survey images include wide field tilings covering the
full radial extent of each galaxy, and single deep pointings in uncrowded
regions of the most massive galaxies in the volume. The new wide field imaging
in ANGST reaches median 50% completenesses of m_F475W=28.0 mag, m_F606W=27.3
mag, and m_F814W=27.3 mag, several magnitudes below the tip of the red giant
branch (TRGB). The deep fields reach magnitudes sufficient to fully resolve the
structure in the red clump. The resulting photometric catalogs are publicly
accessible and contain over 34 million photometric measurements of >14 million
stars. In this paper we present the details of the sample selection, imaging,
data reduction, and the resulting photometric catalogs, along with an analysis
of the photometric uncertainties (systematic and random), for both the ACS and
WFPC2 imaging. We also present uniformly derived relative distances measured
from the apparent magnitude of the TRGB.
