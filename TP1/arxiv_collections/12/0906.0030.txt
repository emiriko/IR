The Au25(SR)18- cluster is a new member in the superatom family which
features a centered icosahedral shell (Au13) protected by six RS(AuSR)2 motifs
(RS- being a alkylthiolate group). Here we show that this superatom can be
magnetically doped by replacing the center Au atom with Cr, Mn, or Fe. We find
that Cr and Mn-doped clusters have an optimized magnetic moment of 5 Bohr
magnetons while the Fe-doped cluster has an optimized magnetic moment of 3 Bohr
magnetons. Although the dopant atom's local magnetic moment makes a major
contribution to the total moment, the icosahedral Au12 shell is also found to
be significantly magnetized. Our work here provides a new scenario of magnetic
doping of a metal-cluster superatom which is protected by ligands and made by
wet chemistry.
