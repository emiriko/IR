(abridged) The physics of the pulsar magnetosphere near the neutron star
surface remains poorly constrained by observations. Nevertheless it is believed
that large vacuum gaps exist in the magnetosphere, and a non-neutral plasma
partially fills the neutron star surroundings to form an electrosphere.
  The equatorial disk in this electrosphere is diocotron and magnetron
unstable. To better assess the long term evolution of these instabilities, we
study the behavior of the non-neutral plasma with help on particle simulations.
  We designed a 2D electrostatic PIC code. In the diocotron regime, the
equation of motion for particles obeys the electric drift approximation. The
plasma is confined between two conducting walls. Moreover, in order to simulate
a pair cascade in the gaps, we add a source term feeding the plasma with
charged particles.
  We consider the long term non-linear evolution of the diocotron instability.
We found that particles tend to attract together to form small vortex of high
charge density rotating around the axis of the cylinder with only little radial
excursion of the particles. This grouping of particles generates new low
density or even vacuum gaps in the plasma column. We show that particle
injection into the plasma can drastically increase the diffusion of particles
across the magnetic field lines. Also, the newly formed vacuum gaps cannot be
replenished by simply invoking the diocotron instability.
