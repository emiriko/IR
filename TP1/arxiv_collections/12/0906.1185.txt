Using N-body simulations, we have modeled the production and evolution of
substructures in the intracluster light (ICL) of a simulated galaxy cluster. We
use a density-based definition of ICL, where ICL consists of luminous particles
which are at low densities, to identify ICL particles and track their
evolution. We have implemented a friends-of-friends-type clustering algorithm
which finds groups of particles correlated in both position and velocity space
to identify substructures in the ICL, hereafter referred to as ``streams''. We
find that ~40% of the cluster's ICL is generated in the form of these massive
(M > 7.0x10^8 Msun), dynamically cold streams. The fraction of the ICL
generated in streams is greater early in the cluster's evolution, when galaxies
are interacting in the group environment, than later in its evolution when the
massive cluster potential has been assembled. The production of streams
requires the strong tidal fields associated with close interactions between
pairs of galaxies, and is usually associated with merging pairs of galaxies, or
fast, close encounters with the cluster's central galaxy. Once streams are
formed, they begin to decay as they are disrupted by the tidal field of the
cluster. We find that streams have decay timescales which are ~1.5 times their
dynamical time in the cluster.
