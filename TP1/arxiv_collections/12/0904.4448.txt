New Jefferson Lab data are presented on the nuclear dependence of the
inclusive cross section from 2H, 3He, 4He, 9Be and 12C for 0.3<x<0.9, Q^2
approximately 3-6 GeV^2. These data represent the first measurement of the EMC
effect for 3He at large x and a significant improvement for 4He. The data do
not support previous A-dependent or density-dependent fits to the EMC effect
and suggest that the nuclear dependence of the quark distributions may depend
on the local nuclear environment.
