We discuss a mechanism of generating two separable beams of light with high
degree of entanglement in momentum using a fast and sharp optical boundary.
Three regimes of light generation are identified depending on the number of
resonant interactions between the optical perturbation and the electromagnetic
field. The intensity of the process is discussed in terms of the relevant
physical parameters: variation of refractive index and apparent velocity of the
optical boundary. Our results suggest a different class of generation entangled
light robust against thermal degradation by exciting zero point fluctuations
using parametric resonant optical modulations.
