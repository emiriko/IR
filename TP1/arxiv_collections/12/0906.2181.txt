We present a fourth catalog of HI sources from the Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA
(ALFALFA) Survey. We report 541 detections over 136 deg2, within the region of
the sky having 22h < R.A. < 03h and 24 deg < Dec. < 26 deg . This complements a
previous catalog in the region 26 deg < Dec. < 28 deg (Saintonge et al. 2008).
We present here the detections falling into three classes: (a) extragalactic
sources with S/N > 6.5, where the reliability of the catalog is better than
95%; (b) extragalactic sources 5.0 < S/N < 6.5 and a previously measured
optical redshift that corroborates our detection; or (c) High Velocity Clouds
(HVCs), or subcomponents of such clouds, in the periphery of the Milky Way. Of
the 541 objects presented here, 90 are associated with High Velocity Clouds,
while the remaining 451 are identified as extragalactic objects. Optical
counterparts have been matched with all but one of the extragalactic objects.
