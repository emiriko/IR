We investigate the properties of Damped Lyman-alpha systems (DLAs) using
high-resolution and large box-size cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of a
LambdaCDM model. The numerical code used is a modification of GADGET-2 with a
self consistent implementation of the metal enrichment mechanism (Tornatore et
al. 2007). We explore the numerical convergence of some relevant physical
quantities and we vary the parameters describing the properties of galactic
winds; the initial stellar mass function; the linear dark matter power spectrum
and the metal enrichment pattern of the IGM (Intergalactic Medium) around DLAs.
We find that strong galactic winds with speed of about 600 km/s, in an
energy-driven wind scenario, are needed in order to match the observed column
density distribution function for DLAs and the evolution of the neutral
hydrogen content with redshift. The momentum-driven implementation of the
galactic wind model, that relates the speed and mass load in the wind to the
properties of the dark matter haloes, shows a behaviour which is intermediate
between the energy-driven galactic winds of small (100 km/s) and large (600
km/s) velocities. At z=3 the contribution of haloes of masses between 10^9 and
10^10 h^-1 M_sun, for DLAs below 10^20.8 cm^-2, to the column density
distribution function, is significant. By interpolating physical quantities
along line-of-sights through massive haloes we qualitatively show how different
galactic wind models impact on the IGM around DLAs. Furthermore, we analyse
statistics related to the velocity widths of SiII associated to DLAs: the
metallicity in the wind seems to be rather clumpy and this produces an
underestimation of the observed velocity widths. We outline possible solutions
to this problem.
