We used magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of interstellar turbulence to
study the probability distribution functions (PDFs) of increments of density,
velocity, and magnetic field. We found that the PDFs are well described by a
Tsallis distribution, following the same general trends found in solar wind and
Electron MHD studies. We found that the PDFs of density are very different in
subsonic and supersonic turbulence. In order to extend this work to ISM
observations we studied maps of column density obtained from 3D MHD
simulations. From the column density maps we found the parameters that fit to
Tsallis distributions and demonstrated that these parameters vary with the
sonic and Alfv\'en Mach numbers of turbulence. This opens avenues for using
Tsallis distributions to study the dynamical and perhaps magnetic states of
interstellar gas.
