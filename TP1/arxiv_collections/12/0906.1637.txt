Sinopoli et al. (TAC, 2004) considered the problem of optimal estimation for
linear systems with Gaussian noise and intermittent observations, available
according to a Bernoulli arrival process. They showed that there is a
"critical" arrival probability of the observations, such that under that
threshold the expected value of the covariance matrix (i.e., the quadratic
error) of the estimate is unbounded. Sinopoli et al., and successive authors,
interpreted this result implying that the behavior of the system is
qualitatively different above and below the threshold. This paper shows that
this is not necessarily the only interpretation. In fact, the critical
probability is different if one considers the average error instead of the
average quadratic error. More generally, finding a meaningful "average"
covariance is not as simple as taking the algebraic expected value. A rigorous
way to frame the problem is in a differential geometric framework, by
recognizing that the set of covariance matrices (or better, the manifold of
Gaussian distributions) is not a flat space, and then studying the intrinsic
Riemannian mean. Several metrics on this manifold are considered that lead to
different critical probabilities, or no critical probability at all.
