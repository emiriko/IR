While performing molecular dynamics simulations of a simple monatomic liquid,
we observed the crystallization of a material displaying octagonal symmetry in
its simulated diffraction pattern. Inspection of the atomic arrangements in the
crystallization product reveals large grains of the beta-Mn structure aligned
along a common 4-fold axis, with 45 degree rotations between neighboring
grains. These 45 degree rotations can be traced to the intercession of a second
crystalline structure fused epitaxially to the beta-Mn domain surfaces, whose
primitive cell has lattice parameters a = b = c = a_{beta-Mn}, alpha = beta =
90 degrees, and gamma = 45 degrees. This secondary phase adopts a structure
which appears to have no known counterpart in the experimental literature, but
can be simply derived from the Cr_3Si and Al_3Zr_4 structure types. We used
these observations as the basis for an atomistic structural model for octagonal
quasicrystals, in which the beta-Mn and the secondary phase structure unit
cells serve as square and rhombic tiles (in projection), respectively. Its
diffraction pattern down the octagonal axis resembles those experimentally
measured. The model is unique in being consistent with high-resolution electron
microscopy images showing square and rhombic units with edge-lengths equal to
that of the beta-Mn unit cell. Energy minimization of this configuration, using
the same pair potential as above, results in an alternative octagonal
quasiperiodic structure with the same tiling but a different atomic decoration
and diffraction pattern.
