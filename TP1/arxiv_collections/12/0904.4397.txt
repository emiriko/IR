We study the zero-temperature phase diagram of a gas of bosonic 87-Rb atoms
in two-color superlattice potentials starting directly from the experimental
parameters, such as wavelengths and intensities of the two lasers generating
the superlattice. In a first step, we map the experimental setup to a
Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian with site-dependent parameters through explicit
band-structure calculations. In the second step, we solve the many-body problem
using the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) approach and compute
observables such as energy gap, condensate fraction, maximum number
fluctuations and visibility of interference fringes. We study the phase diagram
as function of the laser intensities s_2 and s_1 as control parameters and show
that all relevant quantum phases, i.e. superfluid, Mott-insulator, and quasi
Bose-glass phase, and the transitions between them can be investigated through
a variation of these intensities alone.
