The chiral limit of the rho and sigma masses and widths is discussed. We work
within the inverse amplitude method to one loop in SU(2) ChPT and analyze the
consequences that all chiral logarithms cancel out in the rho-channel, while
they do not cancel for the sigma case, and how they strongly influence the
properties of this latter resonance. Our results confirm and explain the
different behavior of the sigma and rho poles for NC not far from 3, but we
extend the analysis to very large NC, where the behavior of these two
resonances is re-analyzed. We note that the rather natural requirement of
consistency between resonance saturation and unitarization imposes useful
constraints. By looking only at the rho-channel, and within the single
resonance approximation, we find that the masses of the first vector and scalar
meson nonets, invoked in the single resonance approximation, turn out to be
degenerated in the large NC limit. On the contrary we show that, for
sufficiently large NC, the scalar meson evolution lies beyond the applicability
reach of the one-loop inverse amplitude method and if the scalar channel is
also incorporated in the analysis, it may lead, in some cases, to
phenomenologically inconsistent results.
