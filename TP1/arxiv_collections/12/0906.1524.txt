Tunneling electroresistance (TER) effect is the change in the electrical
resistance of a ferroelectric tunnel junction (FTJ) associated with
polarization reversal in the ferroelectric barrier layer. Here we predict that
a FTJ with a composite barrier that combines a functional ferroelectric film
and a thin layer of a non-polar dielectric can exhibit a significantly enhanced
TER. Due to the change in the electrostatic potential with polarization
reversal the non-polar dielectric barrier acts as a switch that changes its
barrier height from a low to high value. The predicted values of TER are giant
and indicate that the resistance of the FTJ can be changed by many orders in
magnitude at the coercive electric field of ferroelectric.
