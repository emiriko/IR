REC (Regular Expression Compiler) is a concise programming language
development in mayor Mexican Universities at end of 60s which allows students
to write programs without knowledge of the complicated syntax of languages like
FORTRAN and ALGOL. The language is recursive and contains only four elements
for control. This paper describes use of the interpreter of REC written in
FORTRAN on IBM1130 Simulator from -Computer History Simulation- Project.
