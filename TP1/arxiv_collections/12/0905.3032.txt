We study bulk fermions in models with warped extra dimensions in the presence
of a soft wall. Fermions can acquire a position dependent bulk Dirac mass that
shields them from the deep infrared, allowing for a systematic expansion in
which electroweak symmetry breaking effects are treated perturbatively. Using
this expansion, we analyze properties of bulk fermions in the soft wall
background. These properties include the realization of non-trivial boundary
conditions that simulate the ones commonly used in hard wall models, the
analysis of the flavor structure of the model and the implications of a heavy
top. We implement a soft wall model of electroweak symmetry breaking with
custodial symmetry and fermions propagating in the bulk. We find a lower bound
on the masses of the first bosonic resonances, after including the effects of
the top sector on electroweak precision observables for the first time, of
m_{KK} \gtrsim 1-3 TeV at the 95% C.L., depending on the details of the Higgs,
and discuss the implications of our results for LHC phenomenology.
