In contrast to graphene which is a gapless semiconductor, graphane, the
hydrogenated graphene, is a semiconductor with an energy gap. Together with the
two-dimensional geometry, unique transport features of graphene, and
possibility of doping graphane, p and n regions can be defined so that 2D p-n
junctions become feasible with small reverse currents. This paper introduces a
basic analysis to obtain current-voltage characteristics of such a 2D p-n
junction based on graphane. As we show, within the approximation of Shockley
law of junctions, an ideal I-V charactristic for this p-n junction is to be
expected.
