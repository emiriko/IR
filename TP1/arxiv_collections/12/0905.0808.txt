We have studied the SED of the quasar LBQS 0102-2713. The available
multiwavelength data are one optical spectrum between 3200 and 7400 A, 7 HST
FOS spectra between 1700 and 2300 A, one GALEX NUV flux density and a K_S
magnitude obtained from NED, and 3 public ROSAT PSPC pointed observations in
the 0.1$-$2.4 keV energy band. The alpha_ox values obtained are -2.3 and -2.2,
respectively, comparable to BAL quasars. The ROSAT photon index is 6.0+-1.3.
The 2500 A luminosity density is about a factor of 10 higher compared to the
mean of the most luminous SDSS quasars. We argue that the object might be
indicative for a new class of quasars with an unusual combination in their UV-,
X-ray, and N_H properties.
