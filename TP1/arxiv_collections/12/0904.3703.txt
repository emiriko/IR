Quite recently Philbin et al present new theory of the van der Waals friction
at zero temperature. Contrary to the previous theory they claimed that there is
no "quantum friction" due to quantum fluctuation of the electromagnetic field
between two parallel plates moving relative to each other. We show that this
theory is incorrect.
