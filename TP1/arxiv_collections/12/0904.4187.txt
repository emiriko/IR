We investigate primordial perturbations and non-gaussianities in the
Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz theory of gravitation. In the UV limit, the scalar
perturbation in the Ho\v{r}ava theory is naturally scale-invariant, ignoring
the details of the expansion of the Universe. One may thus relax the
exponential inflation and the slow-roll conditions for the inflaton field. As a
result, it is possible that the primordial non-gaussianities, which are
``slow-roll suppressed'' in the standard scenarios, become large. We calculate
the non-gaussianities from the bispectrum of the perturbation and find that the
equilateral-type non-gaussianity is of the order of unity, while the local-type
non-gaussianity remains small, as in the usual single-field slow-roll inflation
model in general relativity. Our result is a new constraint on the the
Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity.
