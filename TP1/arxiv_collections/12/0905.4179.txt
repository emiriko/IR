We resume former discussions of the question, whether the spin-spin repulsion
and the gravitational attraction of two aligned black holes can balance each
other. To answer the question we formulate a boundary value problem for two
separate (Killing-) horizons and apply the inverse (scattering) method to solve
it. Making use of results of Manko, Ruiz and Sanabria-G\'omez and a novel black
hole criterion, we prove the non-existence of the equilibrium situation in
question.
