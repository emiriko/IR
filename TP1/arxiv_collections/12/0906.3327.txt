In this paper we investigate the affect of various acceptance conditions on
recogniser membrane systems without dissolution. We demonstrate that two
particular acceptance conditions (one easier to program, the other easier to
prove correctness) both characterise the same complexity class, NL. We also
find that by restricting the acceptance conditions we obtain a characterisation
of L. We obtain these results by investigating the connectivity properties of
dependency graphs that model membrane system computations.
