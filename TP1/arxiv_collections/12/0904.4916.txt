Although frequency multiplexing of information has revolutionized the field
of classical communications, the color degree of freedom (DOF) has been used
relatively little for quantum applications. We experimentally demonstrate a new
hybrid quantum gate that transfers polarization entanglement of non-degenerate
photons onto the color DOF. We create, for the first time, high quality,
discretely color-entangled states (with energy bandgap up to 8.4 THz) without
any filtering or postselection, and unambiguously verify and quantify the
amount of entanglement (tangle, 0.611$\pm$0.009) by reconstructing a restricted
density matrix; we generate a range of maximally entangled states, including a
set of mutually unbiased bases for an encoded qubit space. The technique can be
generalized to transfer polarization entanglement onto other photonic DOFs,
like orbital angular momentum.
