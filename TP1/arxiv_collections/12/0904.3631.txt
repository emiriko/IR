Open source and commercial applications used to be two separate worlds. The
former was the work of amateurs who had little interest in making a profit,
while the latter was only profit oriented and was produced by big companies.
Nowadays open source is a threat and an opportunity to serious businesses of
all kinds, generating good profits while delivering low costs products to
customers. The competition between commercial and open source software has
impacted the industry and the society as a whole. But in the last years, the
markets for commercial and open source software are converging rapidly and it
is interesting to resume and discuss the implications of this new paradigm,
taking into account arguments pro and against it.
