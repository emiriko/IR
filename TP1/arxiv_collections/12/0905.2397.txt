Context: Ogata et al. (2009; hereafter OKK) presented a theoretical
determination of the triple-alpha nuclear reaction rate. Their rate differs
from the NACRE rate by many orders of magnitude at temperatures relevant for
low mass stars. Aims: We explore the evolutionary implications of adopting the
OKK triple-alpha reaction rate in low mass stars and compare the results with
those obtained using the NACRE rate. Methods: The triple-alpha reaction rates
are compared by following the evolution of stellar models at 1 and 1.5 Msol
with Z=0.0002 and Z=0.02. Results: Results show that the OKK rate has severe
consequences for the late stages of stellar evolution in low mass stars. Most
notable is the shortening--or disappearance--of the red giant phase.
Conclusions: The OKK triple-alpha reaction rate is incompatible with
observations of extended red giant branches and He burning stars in old stellar
systems.
