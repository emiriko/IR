The supernumerous eta(1405) is considered a strong candidate for the
pseudoscalar glueball. In a phenomenological chiral approach, we consider a
mixing scenario of bare pseudoscalar (n bar n) and (s bar s) quarkonia with the
glueball. We study the decay properties and point out the peculiarities of this
scenario in order to support the possible identification of the J(PC) = 0(-+)
glueball.
