The notions of mass and range of a Brans-Dicke-like scalar field in
scalar-tensor and f(R) gravity are subject to an ambiguity that hides a
potential trap. We spell out this ambiguity and identify a physically
meaningful and practical definition for these quantities. This is relevant when
giving a mass to this scalar in order to circumvent experimental limits on the
PPN parameters coming from Solar System experiments.
