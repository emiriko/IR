We present a new physical model resolving a long-standing mystery of the
power-law distributions of the blinking times in single colloidal quantum dot
fluorescence. The model considers the non-radiative relaxation of the exciton
through multiple recombination centers. Each center is allowed to switch
between two quasi-stationary states. We point out that the conventional
threshold analysis method used to extract the exponents of the distributions
for the on-times and off-times has a serious flaw: The qualitative properties
of the distributions strongly depend on the threshold value chosen for
separating the on and off states. Our new model explains naturally this
threshold dependence, as well as other key experimental features of the single
quantum dot fluorescence trajectories, such as the power-law power spectrum
(1/f noise).
