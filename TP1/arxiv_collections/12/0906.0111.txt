The most recent measurements of the top quark mass at the D0 experiment are
summarized. Different techniques and final states are used and the top quark
mass is determined to be mtop=172.8+-1.6(stat+syst)GeV/c^2. In addition, a new,
indirect measurement comparing the measured cross section to theoretical
calculations is discussed. Both, the direct and the indirect measurement of the
top quark mass are in good agreement.
