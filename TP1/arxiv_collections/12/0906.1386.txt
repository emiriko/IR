We update the hadronic tau determination of |V_{us}|, showing that current
strange branching fractions produce results 2-3 sigma lower than 3-family
unitarity expectations. Issues related to the size of theoretical uncertainties
and results from an alternate, mixed tau-electroproduction sum rule
determination (which, by construction, produces a much smaller theoretical
uncertainty), are also considered.
