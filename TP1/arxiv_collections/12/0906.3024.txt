We analyse the violations of lepton-flavour universality in the ratios B(P ->
l nu)/B(P -> l' nu) using a general effective theory approach, discussing
various flavour-symmetry breaking patterns of physics beyond the SM. We find
that in models with Minimal Lepton Flavour Violation the effects are too small
to be observed in the next generations of experiments in all relevant meson
systems (P = Pi, K, B). In a Grand Unified framework with a minimal breaking of
the flavour symmetry, the effects remain small in Pi and K decays while large
violations of lepton-flavour universality are possible in B -> l nu decays.
