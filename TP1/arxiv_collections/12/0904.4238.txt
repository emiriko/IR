The possible symmetries of the biaxial nematic phase are examined against the
implications of the presently available experimental results. Contrary to the
widespread notion that biaxial nematics have orthorhombic symmetry, our study
shows that a monoclinic ($C_{2h}$) symmetry is more likely to be the case for
the recently observed phase biaxiality in thermotropic bent-core and calamitc
tetrapode nematic systems. The methodology for differentiating between the
possible symmetries of the biaxial nematic phase by NMR and by IR spectroscopy
measurements is presented in detail. The manifestations of the different
symmetries on the alignment of the biaxial phase are identified and their
implications on the measurement and quantification of biaxiality as well as on
the potential use of biaxial nematic liquid crystals in electro-optic
applications are discussed.
