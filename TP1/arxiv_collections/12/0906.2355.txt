In order to clarify the physics of the crossover from a spin-density-wave
(SDW) Mott insulator to a charge-density-wave (CDW) Peierls insulator in
one-dimensional (1D) systems, we investigate the Hubbard-Holstein Hamiltonian
at half filling within a density matrix renormalisation group (DMRG) approach.
Determining the spin and charge correlation exponents, the momentum
distribution function, and various excitation gaps, we confirm that an
intervening metallic phase expands the SDW-CDW transition in the weak-coupling
regime.
