A variety of analytical techniques suggest that quantum fluctuations lead to
a fundamental instability of the Fermi liquid that drives ferromagnetic
transitions first order at low temperatures. We present both analytical and
numerical evidence that, driven by the same quantum fluctuations, this first
order transition is pre-empted by the formation of an inhomogeneous magnetic
phase. This occurs in a manner that is closely analogous to the formation of
the inhomogeneous superconducting Fulde-Ferrel-Larkin-Ovchinnikov state. We
derive these results from a field theoretical approach supplemented with
numerical Quantum Monte Carlo simulations. Our analytical approach represents a
considerable simplification over diagrammatic methods, makes contact with older
analyses of the unitarity limit, and enables a simple physical picture to
emerge.
