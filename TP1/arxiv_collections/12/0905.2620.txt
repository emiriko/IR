In this paper we study the simplest deformation on a sequence of orthogonal
polynomials, namely, replacing the original (or reference) weight $w_0(x)$
defined on an interval by $w_0(x)e^{-tx}.$ It is a well-known fact that under
such a deformation the recurrence coefficients denoted as $\alpha_n$ and
$\beta_n$ evolve in $t$ according to the Toda equations, giving rise to the
time dependent orthogonal polynomials, using Sogo's terminology. The resulting
"time-dependent" Jacobi polynomials satisfy a linear second order ode. We will
show that the coefficients of this ode are intimately related to a particular
Painlev\'e V. In addition, we show that the coefficient of $z^{n-1}$ of the
monic orthogonal polynomials associated with the "time-dependent" Jacobi
weight, satisfies, up to a translation in $t,$ the Jimbo-Miwa $\sigma$-form of
the same $P_{V};$ while a recurrence coefficient $\alpha_n(t),$ is up to a
translation in $t$ and a linear fractional transformation
$P_{V}(\alpha^2/2,-\beta^2/2, 2n+1+\alpha+\beta,-1/2).$ These results are found
from combining a pair of non-linear difference equations and a pair of Toda
equations. This will in turn allow us to show that a certain Fredholm
determinant related to a class of Toeplitz plus Hankel operators has a
connection to a Painlev\'e equation.
