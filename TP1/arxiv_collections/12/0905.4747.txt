Anisotropy of a space naturally leads to direction dependent electromagnetic
tensors and electromagnetic potentials. Starting from this idea and using
variational approaches and exterior derivative formalism, we extend some of the
classical equations of electromagnetism to anisotropic (Finslerian) spaces. The
results differ from the ones obtained by means of the known approach in [3],
[4].
