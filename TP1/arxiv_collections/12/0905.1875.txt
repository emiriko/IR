Iron Selenide, Fe1.01Se, the layered parent compound of the recently
discovered superconducting arsenide family, has previously been shown to be non
magnetic and superconducting with a critical temperature of 8 K. Here we show
that copper can be substituted at the iron site in Fe1.01Se up to a solubility
limit of 20-30 %, after which a first order transition to the three-dimensional
CuFeSe2 structure type is observed. As little as 1.5 % percent copper is
sufficient to suppress the superconductivity, and 4 % drives the system through
a metal-insulator transition. A local magnetic moment is introduced, which
maximizes near 12% doping, where a spin-glass transition near 15 K is observed.
