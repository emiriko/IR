We present details of a continuous-time quantum Monte-Carlo algorithm for the
screened Hubbard-Froehlich bipolaron. We simulate the bipolaron in one
dimension with arbitrary interaction range in the presence of Coulomb
repulsion, computing the effective mass, binding energy, total number of
phonons associated with the bipolaron, mass isotope exponent and bipolaron
radius in a comprehensive survey of the parameter space. We discuss the role of
the range of the electron-phonon interaction, demonstrating the evolution from
Holstein to Froehlich bipolarons and we compare the properties of bipolarons
with singlet and triplet pairing. Finally, we present simulations of the
bipolaron dispersion. The band width of the Froehlich bipolaron is found to be
broad, and the decrease in bandwidth as the two polarons bind into a bipolaron
is found to be far less rapid than in the case of the Holstein interaction. The
properties of bipolarons formed from long range electron-phonon interactions,
such as light strongly bound bipolarons and intersite pairing when Coulomb
repulsion is large, are found to be robust against screening, with qualitative
differences between Holstein and screened Froehlich bipolarons found even for
interactions screened within a single lattice site.
