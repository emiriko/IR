Many scientific deliverables of the next generation low frequency radio
telescopes require high dynamic range imaging. Next generation telescopes under
construction indeed promise at least a ten-fold increase in the sensitivity
compared with existing telescopes. The projected achievable RMS noise in the
images from these telescopes is in the range of 1--10$\mu$Jy/beam corresponding
to typical imaging dynamic ranges of $10^{6-7}$. High imaging dynamic range
require removal of systematic errors to high accuracy and for long integration
intervals. In general, many source of errors are directionally dependent and
unless corrected for, will be a limiting factor for the imaging dynamic range
of these next generation telescopes. This requires development of new
algorithms and software for calibration and imaging which can correct for such
direction and time dependent errors. In this paper, I discuss the resulting
algorithmic and computing challenges and the recent progress made towards
addressing these challenges.
