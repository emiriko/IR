New checkable criteria for persistence of chemical reaction networks are
proposed, which extend and complement those obtained by the authors in previous
work. The new results allow the consideration of reaction rates which are
time-varying, thus incorporating the effects of external signals, and also
relax the assumption of existence of global conservation laws, thus allowing
for inflows (production) and outflows (degradation). For time-invariant
networks parameter-dependent conditions for persistence of certain classes of
networks are provided. As an illustration, two networks arising in the systems
biology literature are analyzed, namely a hypoxia and an apoptosis network.
