We have performed large-scale nucleosynthesis calculations within the
high-entropy-wind (HEW) scenario of type II supernovae. The primary aim was to
constrain the conditions for the production of the classical "p-only" isotopes
of the light trans-Fe elements. We find, however, that for electron fractions
in the range 0.458 $\le$ Y$_e$ $\le$ 0.478, sizeable abundances of p-, s- and
r-process nuclei between $^{64}$Zn and $^{98}$Ru are coproduced in the HEW at
low entropies (S $\le$ 100) by a primary charged-particle process after an
$\alpha$-rich freezeout. With the above Y$_e$ -- S correlation, most of the
predicted isotopic abundance ratios within a given element (e.g.
$^{64}$Zn(p)/$^{70}$Zn(r) or $^{92}$Mo(p)/$^{94}$Mo(p)), as well as of
neighboring elements (e.g. $^{70}$Ge(s+p)/$^{74}$Se(p) or
$^{74}$Se(p)/$^{78}$Kr(p)) agree with the observed Solar-System ratios. Taking
the Mo isotopic chain as a particularly challenging example, we show that our
HEW model can account for the production of all 7 stable isotopes, from
"p-only" $^{92}$Mo, via "s-only" $^{96}$Mo up to "r-only" $^{100}$Mo.
Furthermore, our model is able to reproduce the isotopic composition of Mo in
presolar SiC X-grains.}
