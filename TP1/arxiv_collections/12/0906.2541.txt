The paper studies the expressivity, relative succinctness and complexity of
satisfiability for hybrid extensions of the branching-time logics CTL and CTL+
by variables. Previous complexity results show that only fragments with one
variable do have elementary complexity. It is shown that H1CTL+ and H1CTL, the
hybrid extensions with one variable of CTL+ and CTL, respectively, are
expressively equivalent but H1CTL+ is exponentially more succinct than H1CTL.
On the other hand, HCTL+, the hybrid extension of CTL with arbitrarily many
variables does not capture CTL*, as it even cannot express the simple CTL*
property EGFp. The satisfiability problem for H1CTL+ is complete for triply
exponential time, this remains true for quite weak fragments and quite strong
extensions of the logic.
