We study the T odd correlations induced by CP violating anomalous top-quark
couplings at both production and decay level in the process gg --> t t_bar -->
(b mu+ nu_mu) (b_bar mu- nu_mu_bar). We consider several counting asymmetries
at the parton level and find the ones with the most sensitivity to each of
these anomalous couplings at the LHC.
