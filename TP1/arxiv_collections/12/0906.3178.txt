The cortical array is a structure consisting of highly aligned microtubules
which plays a crucial role in the characteristic uniaxial expansion of all
growing plant cells. Recent experiments have shown polymerization-driven
collisions between the membrane-bound cortical microtubules, suggesting a
possible mechanism for their alignment. We present both a coarse-grained
theoretical model and stochastic particle-based simulations of this mechanism,
and compare the results from these complementary approaches. Our results
indicate that collisions that induce depolymerization are sufficient to
generate the alignment of microtubules in the cortical array.
