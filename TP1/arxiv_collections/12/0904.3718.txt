The idea of the Neurath Basic Model View Controller (NBMVC) appeared during
the discussion of the design of domain-specific modeling tools based on the
Neurath Modeling Language [Yer06]. The NBMVC is the core of the modeling
process within the modeling environment. It reduces complexity out of the
design process by providing domain-specific interfaces between the developer
and the model. These interfaces help to organize and manipulate the model. The
organization includes, for example, a layer with visual components to drop them
in and filter them out. The control routines includes, for example, model
transformations.
