Recent results obtained using the data sample collected on the Upsilon(4S)
resonance with the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric-energy e^+ e^-
collider and the Babar detector at the PEP-II asymmetric-energy e^+ e^-
collider are discussed. Measurements of several charmless and charmed baryonic
B decay branching fractions are reported, and some behaviors and mechanisms are
discussed.
