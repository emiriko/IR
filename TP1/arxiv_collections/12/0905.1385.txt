At present, applications of biometrics are rapidly increasing due to
inconveniences in using traditional passwords and physical keys. Hand geometry,
one of the most well-known biometrics, is implemented in many verification
systems with various feature extraction methods. In recent work, a hand
geometry verification system using time series conversion techniques and
Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance measure with Sakoe-Chiba band has been
proposed. This system demonstrates many advantages, especially ease of
implementation and small storage space requirement using time series
representation. In this paper, we propose a novel hand geometry verification
system that exploits DTW distance measure and R-K band learning to further
improve the system performance. Finally, our evaluation reveals that our
proposed system outperforms the current system by a wide margin, in terms of
False Acceptance Rate (FAR), False Rejection Rate (FRR), and Total Success Rate
(TSR) at Equal Error Rate (EER).
