Single crystals of Ce2PdIn8 were studied by means of magnetic susceptibility,
electrical resistivity and specific heat measurements. The compound was found
to be a heavy fermion clean-limit superconductor with Tc = 0.68 K. Most
remarkably, the superconductivity in this system emerges out of the
antiferromagnetic state that sets in at TN = 10 K, and both cooperative
phenomena coexist in a bulk at ambient pressure conditions.
