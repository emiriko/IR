The LHCb experiment is dedicated to precision measurements of CP violation
and rare decays of B hadrons at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. The
LHCb installation has been finished in spring 2008 and an intensive testing and
commissioning of the system has been started. An overview and the results from
our commissioning activities are described.
