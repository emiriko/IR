The idea of condensation of the Goldstone $\pi$-meson field in nuclear matter
had been put forward a long time ago. However, it was established that the
normal nuclear density is too low, it is not sufficient to condensate
$\pi$-mesons. This is why the $\pi$-condensation has never been observed.
Recent experimental and theoretical studies of high temperature cuprate
superconductors have revealed condensation of Goldstone magnons, the effect
fully analogous to the $\pi$-condensation. The magnon condensation has been
observed. It is clear now that quantum fluctuations play a crucial role in the
condensation, in particular they drive a quantum phase transition that destroys
the condensate at some density of fermions.
