We consider the long term evolution of debris following the tidal disruption
of compact stars in the context of short gamma ray bursts (SGRBs). The initial
encounter impulsively creates a hot, dense, neutrino-cooled disk capable of
powering the prompt emission. After a long delay, we find that powerful winds
are launched from the surface of the disk, driven by the recombination of free
nucleons into alpha particles. The associated energy release depletes the mass
supply and eventually shuts off activity of the central engine. As a result,
the luminosity and mass accretion rate deviate from the earlier self-similar
behavior expected for an isolated ring with efficient cooling. This then
enables a secondary episode of delayed activity to become prominent as an
observable signature, when material in the tidal tails produced by the initial
encounter returns to the vicinity of the central object. The time scale of the
new accretion event can reach tens of seconds to minutes, depending on the
details of the system. The associated energies and time scales are consistent
with those occurring in X-ray flares.
