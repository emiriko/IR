We estimate the enclosed mass profile in the central 10 pc of the Milky Way
by analyzing the infrared photometry and the velocity observations of
dynamically relaxed stellar population in the Galactic center. HST/NICMOS and
Gemini Adaptive Optics images in the archive are used to obtain the number
density profile, and proper motion and radial velocity data were compiled from
the literature to find the velocity dispersion profile assuming a spherical
symmetry and velocity isotropy. From these data, we calculate the enclosed mass
and density profiles in the central 10 pc of the Galaxy using the Jeans
equation. Our improved estimates can better describe the exact evolution of the
molecular clouds and star clusters falling down to the Galactic center, and
constrain the star formation history of the inner part of the Galaxy.
