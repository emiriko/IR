This article -- written in honour of Juergen Ehlers -- consists of two
different, though interlocking parts: Section 1 describes my 54 years of
perpetual experiences and exchanges with him, both science and episodes, whilst
section 2 describes the history of astrophysical black holes, which evolved
during the same epoque though largely independently, with its activity centers
in other places of the globe, and has by no means terminated.
