We study a smooth crossover transition in the gas of quark-gluon bags. The
equation of state at high temperature is that of the quark-gluon plasma.
However, the system consists of the bags with finite volumes which are defined
by the model parameters of the mass-volume bag spectrum. Possible structures in
this {\it cluster} quark-gluon plasma are classified.
