We show that the holographic entropy bound for gravitational systems and the
Bekenstein entropy bound for nongravitational systems are holographically
related. Using the AdS/CFT correspondence, we find that the Bekenstein bound on
the boundary is obtained from the holographic bound in the bulk by minimizing
the boundary energy with respect the AdS radius or the cosmological constant.
This relation may also ameliorate some problems associated with the Bekenstein
bound.
