We study the superfluid phase of the one-band attractive Hubbard model of
fermions as a prototype of a strongly correlated s-wave fermion superfluid on a
lattice. We show that the collective mode spectrum of this superfluid exhibits,
in addition to the long wavelength sound mode, a sharp roton mode over a wide
range of densities and interaction strengths. We compute the sound velocity and
the roton gap within a generalized random phase approximation (GRPA) and show
that the GRPA results are in good agreement, at strong coupling, with a spin
wave analysis of the appropriate strong-coupling pseudospin model. We also
investigate, using this two-pronged approach, the breakdown of superfluidity in
the presence of a supercurrent. We find that the superflow can break down at a
critical flow momentum via several distinct mechanisms - depairing, Landau
instabilities or dynamical instabilities - depending on the dimensionality, the
interaction strength and the fermion density. The most interesting of these
instabilities is a charge modulation dynamical instability which is distinct
from previously studied dynamical instabilities of Bose superfluids. The charge
order associated with this instability can be of two types: (i) a commensurate
checkerboard modulation driven by softening of the roton mode at the Brillouin
zone corner, or, (ii) an incommensurate density modulation arising from
superflow-induced finite momentum pairing of Bogoliubov quasiparticles. We
elucidate the dynamical phase diagram showing the critical flow momentum of the
leading instability over a wide range of fermion densities and interaction
strengths and point out implications of our results for experiments on cold
atom fermion superfluids in an optical lattice.
