In cubic noncentrosymmetric ferromagnets uniaxial distortions suppress the
helical states and stabilize Skyrmion lattices in a broad range of
thermodynamical parameters. Using a phenomenological theory for modulated and
localized states in chiral magnets, the equilibrium parameters of the Skyrmion
and helical states are derived as functions of the applied magnetic field and
induced uniaxial anisotropy. These results show that due to a combined effect
of induced uniaxial anisotropy and an applied magnetic field Skyrmion lattices
can be formed as thermodynamically stable states in large intervals of magnetic
field and temperatures in cubic helimagnets, e.g., in intermetallic compounds
MnSi, FeGe, (Fe,Co)Si. We argue that this mechanism is responsible for the
formation of Skyrmion states recently observed in thin layers of
Fe_{0.5}Co_{0.5}Si [X.Z.Yu et al., Nature \textbf{465}(2010) 901].
