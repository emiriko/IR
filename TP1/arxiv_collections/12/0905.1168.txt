We prove that the finite gauge transformation of the Ramond sector of the
modified cubic superstring field theory is ill-defined due to collisions of
picture changing operators.
  Despite this problem we study to what extent could a bijective classical
correspondence between this theory and the (presumably consistent)
non-polynomial theory exist. We find that the classical equivalence between
these two theories can almost be extended to the Ramond sector: We construct
mappings between the string fields (NS and Ramond, including Chan-Paton factors
and the various GSO sectors) of the two theories that send solutions to
solutions in a way that respects the linearized gauge symmetries in both sides
and keeps the action of the solutions invariant. The perturbative spectrum
around equivalent solutions is also isomorphic.
  The problem with the cubic theory implies that the correspondence of the
linearized gauge symmetries cannot be extended to a correspondence of the
finite gauge symmetries. Hence, our equivalence is only formal, since it
relates a consistent theory to an inconsistent one. Nonetheless, we believe
that the fact that the equivalence formally works suggests that a consistent
modification of the cubic theory exists. We construct a theory that can be
considered as a first step towards a consistent RNS cubic theory.
