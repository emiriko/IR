Using the most general form of the interpolating current of the baryons, the
strong coupling constants of the light vector mesons with the octet baryons are
calculated within the light cone QCD sum rules. The SU(3)_f symmetry breaking
effects are taken into account in the calculations. It is shown that each of
the electric and magnetic coupling constants can be described in terms of three
universal functions. A detailed comparison of the results of this work on
aforementioned couplings with the existing theoretical results is presented.
