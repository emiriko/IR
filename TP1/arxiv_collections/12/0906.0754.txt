RHIC experiments have established jet quenching as a fundamental tool in the
study of hot matter in heavy-ion collisions. The energy reached is enough for
high-pT inclusive particle studies and one- or two-particle correlations up to
pT= 10-20 GeV. The corresponding data are successfully described by a formalism
based on radiative energy losses. This formalism needs, however, to be improved
for more exclusive observables, in particular for the reconstructed jet
properties. Jet reconstruction is a new branch in heavy-ion collisions with
very high expectations as a tool for the characterization of the medium
properties. We present here an implementation of the jet quenching phenomena
based on a modification at the level of the splitting functions in parton
showers in standard, general purpose, Monte Carlos as PYTHIA or HERWIG.
