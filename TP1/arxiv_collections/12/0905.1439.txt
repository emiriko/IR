Despite the lack of experimental confirmation and of unambiguous theoretical
proof, superstring theory has long been considered by many the only consistent
quantized theory of gravity and the unique viable framework for the unification
of all fundamental forces of nature. In the first part of this essay I explore
the type of reasoning used to support such statements. In order to illustrate
the argument, in the second part I focus on one of the most acclaimed
achievements of the theory: the AdS/CFT correspondence. Finally, I conclude by
observing that what constitutes a result in superstring theory involves more
than purely theoretical arguments. Specifically, the acceptance of facts in
superstring theory is inextricably linked to the large group of people that
make it possible, whether they are string practitioners or not.
