The measurement of diffractively scattered protons in the ATLAS Forward
Physics detector system placed 220 m away from the ATLAS interaction point is
studied. A parameterisation of the scattered proton transport through the LHC
magnet lattice is presented. The proton energy unfolding and its impact on the
centrally produced scalar particle mass resolution are discussed.
