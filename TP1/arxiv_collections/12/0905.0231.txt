We present a signature-based search for anomalous production of events
containing a photon, two jets, of which at least one is identified as
originating from a b quark, and missing transverse energy. The search uses data
corresponding to 2.0/fb of integrated luminosity from p-pbar collisions at a
center-of-mass energy of sqrt(s)=1.96 TeV, collected with the CDF II detector
at the Fermilab Tevatron. From 6,697,466 events with a photon candidate with
transverse energy ET> 25 GeV, we find 617 events with missing transverse energy
> 25 GeV and two or more jets with ET> 15 GeV, at least one identified as
originating from a b quark, versus an expectation of 607+- 113 events.
Increasing the requirement on missing transverse energy to 50 GeV, we find 28
events versus an expectation of 30+-11 events. We find no indications of
non-standard-model phenomena.
