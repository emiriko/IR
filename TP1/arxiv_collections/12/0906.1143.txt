We exposed a prototype of the lead-scintillating fiber KLOE calorimeter to
neutron beam of 21, 46 and 174 MeV at The Svedberg Laboratory, Uppsala, to
study its neutron detection efficiency. This has been found larger than what
expected considering the scintillator thickness of the prototype. %To check our
method, we measured also the neutron %detection efficiency of a 5 cm thick
NE110 scintillator. We show preliminary measurement carried out with a
different prototype with a larger lead/fiber ratio, which proves the relevance
of passive material to neutron detection efficiency in this kind of
calorimeters.
