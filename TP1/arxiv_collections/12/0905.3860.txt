We investigate the role of equilibrium methods and stress transfer range in
describing the process of damage. We find that equilibrium approaches are not
applicable to the description of damage and the catastrophic failure mechanism
if the stress transfer is short ranged. In the long range limit, equilibrium
methods apply only if the healing mechanism associated with ruptured elements
is instantaneous. Furthermore we find that the nature of the catastrophic
failure depends strongly on the stress transfer range. Long range transfer
systems have a failure mechanism that resembles nucleation. In short range
stress transfer systems, the catastrophic failure is a continuous process that,
in some respects, resembles a critical point.
