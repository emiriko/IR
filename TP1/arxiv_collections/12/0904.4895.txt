We assess routes to a diamond-based quantum computer, where we specifically
look towards scalable devices, with at least 10 linked quantum gates. Such a
computer should satisfy the deVincenzo rules and might be used at convenient
temperatures. The specific examples we examine are based on the optical control
of electron spins. For some such devices, nuclear spins give additional
advantages. Since there have already been demonstrations of basic
initialisation and readout, our emphasis is on routes to two-qubit quantum gate
operations and the linking of perhaps 10-20 such gates. We analyse the dopant
properties necessary, especially centres containing N and P, and give results
using simple scoping calculations for the key interactions determining gate
performance. Our conclusions are cautiously optimistic: it may be possible to
develop a useful quantum information processor that works above cryogenic
temperatures.
