Earthshine is sunlight that has been reflected from the dayside Earth onto
the dark side of the Moon and back again to Earth. In recent times, there has
been renewed interest in ground-based visible and near-infrared measurements of
earthshine as a proxy for exoplanet observations. Observations of earthshine
allow us to explore and characterize the globally integrated photometric,
spectral and polarimetric features of the Earth, and to extract precise
information on the distinctive characteristics of our planet, and life in
particular. They also allow us to quantify how this feature changes with time
and orbital configuration. Here we present a brief review of the main
earthshine observations and results.
