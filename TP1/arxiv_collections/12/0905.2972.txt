The inverse seesaw mechanism of neutrino mass, i.e. m_nu =
(m_D^2/m_N^2)epsilon_L where epsilon_L is small, is discussed in the context of
the U(1)_Sigma model. This is a gauge extension of the Standard Model of
particle interactions with lepton triplets (Sigma^+,Sigma^),Sigma^-) as (Type
III) seesaw anchors for obtaining small Majorana neutrino masses.
