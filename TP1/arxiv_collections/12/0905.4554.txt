We investigate Higgs boson production process via gluon fusion at LHC in our
six dimensional universal extra dimension model compactified on a spherical
orbifold S^2/Z_2. We find a striking result that Higgs production cross section
in our model is predicted to be 30(10)% enhancement comparing to the
predictions of the Standard Model (the minimal universal extra dimension model)
for the compactification scale of order 1 TeV.
