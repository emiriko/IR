The increased interest in more exclusive fission observables has demanded
more detailed models. We present here a new computational model, FREYA, that
aims to meet this need by producing large samples of complete fission events
from which any observable of interest can then be extracted consistently,
including arbitrary correlations. The various model assumptions are described
and the potential utility of the model is illustrated by means of several novel
correlation observables.
