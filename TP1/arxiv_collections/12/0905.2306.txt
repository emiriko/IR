We investigate the new type of excitations on the surface of liquid helium.
These excitations, called surfons, appear because helium atoms have discrete
energy level at the liquid surface, being attracted to the surface by the van
der Waals force and repulsed at a hard-core interatomic distance. The
concentration of the surfons increases with temperature. The surfons propagate
along the surface and form a two-dimensional gas. Basing on the simple model of
the surfon microscopic structure, we estimate the surfon activation energy and
effective mass for both helium isotopes. We also calculate the contribution of
the surfons to the temperature dependence of the surface tension. This
contribution explains the great and long-standing discrepancy between theory
and experiment on this temperature dependence in both helium isotopes. The
achieved agreement between our theory and experiment is extremely high. The
comparison with experiment allows to extract the surfon activation energy and
effective mass. The values of these surfon microscopic parameters are in a
reasonable agreement with the calculated from the proposed simple model of
surfon structure.
