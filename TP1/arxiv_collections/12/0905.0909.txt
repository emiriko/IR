In a previous paper (Falkenberg, Kotulla & Fritze 2009, arXiv:0901.1665) we
have shown that the classical definition of E+A galaxies excludes a significant
number of post-starburst galaxies. We suggested that analysing broad-band
spectral energy distributions (SEDs) is a more comprehensive method to select
and distinguish poststarburst galaxies than the classical definition of
measuring equivalent widths of (Hdelta) and [OII] lines.
  In this paper we will carefully investigate this new method and evaluate it
by comparing our model grid of post-starburst galaxies to observed E+A galaxies
from the MORPHS catalog.
  We find that the post-starburst models can be distinguished from undisturbed
spiral, S0 and E galaxies and galaxies in their starburst phase on the basis of
their SEDs. It is even possible to distinguish most of the different
post-starburst by their SEDs. From the comparison with observations we find
that all observed E+A galaxies from the MORPHS catalog can be matched by our
models. However only models with short decline timescales for the star
formation rate are possible scenarios for the observed E+A galaxies in
agreement with our results from the first paper (see Falkenberg, Kotulla &
Fritze 2009a).
