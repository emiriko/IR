We obtain empirical formulae for the final remnant black hole mass, spin, and
recoil velocity from merging black-hole binaries with arbitrary mass ratios and
spins. Our formulae are based on the mass ratio and spin dependence of the
post-Newtonian expressions for the instantaneous radiated energy, linear
momentum, and angular momentum, as well as the ISCO binding energy and angular
momentum. The relative weight between the different terms is fixed by amplitude
parameters chosen through a least-squares fit of recently available fully
nonlinear numerical simulations. These formulae can be used for statistical
studies of N-body simulations of galaxy cores and clusters, and the
cosmological growth of supermassive black holes. As an example, we use these
formulae to obtain a universal spin magnitude distribution of merged black
holes and recoil velocity distributions for dry and hot/cold wet mergers. We
also revisit the long term orbital precession and resonances and discuss how
they affect spin distributions before the merging regime.
