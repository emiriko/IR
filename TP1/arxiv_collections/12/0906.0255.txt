Recent Kaon decay studies seeking lepton-flavor violating (LFV) new-physics
effects are briefly discussed. The main focus is set on precise measurements of
rare or not-so-rare decays aiming at finding evidence of deviations from the SM
prediction rather than on the results from direct searches of LFV transitions
forbidden or ultra-rare in the SM.
