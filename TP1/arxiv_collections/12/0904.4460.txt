We present theory and simulation of simultaneous chemical demixing and phase
ordering in a polymer-liquid crystal mixture in conditions where isotropic-
isotropic phase separation is metastable with respect to isotropic-nematic
phase transition. It is found that mesophase formation proceeds by a transient
metastable phase that surround the ordered phase, and whose lifetime is a
function of the ratio of diffusional to orientational mobilities. It is shown
that kinetic phase ordering in polymer-mesogen mixtures is analogous to kinetic
crystallization in polymer solutions.
