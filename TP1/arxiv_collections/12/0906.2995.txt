We give topological and algebraic characterizations as well as language
theoretic descriptions of the following subclasses of first-order logic FO[<]
for omega-languages: Sigma_2, FO^2, the intersection of FO^2 and Sigma_2, and
Delta_2 (and by duality Pi_2 and the intersection of FO^2 and Pi_2). These
descriptions extend the respective results for finite words. In particular, we
relate the above fragments to language classes of certain (unambiguous)
polynomials. An immediate consequence is the decidability of the membership
problem of these classes, but this was shown before by Wilke and Bojanczyk and
is therefore not our main focus. The paper is about the interplay of algebraic,
topological, and language theoretic properties.
