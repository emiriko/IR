We investigate the spectrum and eigenstates of ultracold fermionic atoms in
the bilayer honeycomb optical lattice. In the low energy approximation, the
dispersion relation has parabolic form and the quasiparticles are chiral. In
the presence of the effective magnetic field, which is created for the system
with optical means, the energy spectrum shows an unconventional Landau level
structure. Furthermore, the experimental detection of the spectrum is proposed
with the Bragg scattering techniques.
