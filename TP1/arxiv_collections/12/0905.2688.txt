We study the dissipation in a system consisting of a small metallic island
coupled to a gate electrode and to a massive reservoir via single tunneling
junction. The dissipation of energy is caused by a slowly oscillating gate
voltage. We compute it in the regimes of weak and strong Coulomb blockade. We
focus on the regime of not very low temperatures when electron coherence can be
neglected but quantum fluctuations of charge are strong due to Coulomb
interaction. The answers assume a particularly transparent form while expressed
in terms of specially chosen physical observables. We discovered that the
dissipation rate is given by a universal expression in both limiting cases.
