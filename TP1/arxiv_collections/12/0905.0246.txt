By virtue of the generalized Hellmann-Feynman theorem for ensemble average,
we obtain internal energy and average energy consumed by the resistance R in a
quantized RLC electric circuit. We also calculate entropy-variation with
respect to R. The relation between entropy and R is also derived. By depicting
figures we indeed see that the entropy increases with the increment of R.
