We present a quantum algorithm to prepare the thermal Gibbs state of
interacting quantum systems. This algorithm sets a universal upper bound
D^alpha on the thermalization time of a quantum system, where D is the system's
Hilbert space dimension and alpha < 1/2 is proportional to the Helmholtz free
energy density of the system. We also derive an algorithm to evaluate the
partition function of a quantum system in a time proportional to the system's
thermalization time and inversely proportional to the targeted accuracy
squared.
