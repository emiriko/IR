This paper describes the development and analysis of finite-volume methods
for the Landau-Lifshitz Navier-Stokes (LLNS) equations and related stochastic
partial differential equations in fluid dynamics. The LLNS equations
incorporate thermal fluctuations into macroscopic hydrodynamics by the addition
of white-noise fluxes whose magnitudes are set by a fluctuation-dissipation
relation. Originally derived for equilibrium fluctuations, the LLNS equations
have also been shown to be accurate for non-equilibrium systems. Previous
studies of numerical methods for the LLNS equations focused primarily on
measuring variances and correlations computed at equilibrium and for selected
non-equilibrium flows. In this paper, we introduce a more systematic approach
based on studying discrete equilibrium structure factors for a broad class of
explicit linear finite-volume schemes. This new approach provides a better
characterization of the accuracy of a spatio-temporal discretization as a
function of wavenumber and frequency, allowing us to distinguish between
behavior at long wavelengths, where accuracy is a prime concern, and short
wavelengths, where stability concerns are of greater importance. We use this
analysis to develop a specialized third-order Runge Kutta scheme that minimizes
the temporal integration error in the discrete structure factor at long
wavelengths for the one-dimensional linearized LLNS equations. Together with a
novel method for discretizing the stochastic stress tensor in dimension larger
than one, our improved temporal integrator yields a scheme for the
three-dimensional equations that satisfies a discrete fluctuation-dissipation
balance for small time steps and is also sufficiently accurate even for time
steps close to the stability limit.
