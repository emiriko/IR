Mnesors are defined as elements of a semimodule over the min-plus integers.
This two-sorted structure is able to merge graduation properties of vectors and
idempotent properties of boolean numbers, which makes it appropriate for hybrid
systems. We apply it to the control of an inverted pendulum and design a full
logical controller, that is, without the usual algebra of real numbers.
