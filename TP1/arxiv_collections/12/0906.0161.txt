Applying random matrix theory to quantum transport in chaotic cavities, we
develop a novel approach to computation of the moments of the conductance and
shot-noise (including their joint moments) of arbitrary order and at any number
of open channels. The method is based on the Selberg integral theory combined
with the theory of symmetric functions and is applicable equally well for
systems with and without time-reversal symmetry. We also compute higher-order
cumulants and perform their detailed analysis. In particular, we establish an
explicit form of the leading asymptotic of the cumulants in the limit of the
large channel numbers. We derive further a general Pfaffian representation for
the corresponding distribution functions. The Edgeworth expansion based on the
first four cumulants is found to reproduce fairly accurately the distribution
functions in the bulk even for a small number of channels. As the latter
increases, the distributions become Gaussian-like in the bulk but are always
characterized by a power-law dependence near their edges of support. Such
asymptotics are determined exactly up to linear order in distances from the
edges, including the corresponding constants.
