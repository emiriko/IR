It is well known that projective measurement will not decrease the von
Neumann entropy of a quantum state. In this paper, it is shown that projective
measurement will not decrease the quantum Tsallis entropy of a quantum state,
either. Using a similar analysis, it can be shown that projective measurement
will not decrease the quantum unified (r, s)-entropy in general.
