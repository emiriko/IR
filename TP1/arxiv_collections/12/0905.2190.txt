HiggsBounds is a computer code which tests the Higgs sectors of new models
against the current exclusion bounds from the Higgs searches at LEP and the
Tevatron. As input, it requires a selection of model predictions, such as Higgs
masses, branching ratios, effective couplings and total decay widths.
HiggsBounds then uses the expected and observed topological cross section
limits from the Higgs searches to determine which points in the parameter space
have already been excluded at 95% CL. HiggsBounds will be updated to include
new results as they become available.
