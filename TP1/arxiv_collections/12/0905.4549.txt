The heat generation by an electric current flowing through a quantum dot with
the dot containing both electron-electron interaction and electron-phonon
interaction, is studied. Using the non-equilibrium Keldysh Green's function
method, the current-induced heat generation is obtained. We find that for a
small phonon frequency, heat generation is proportional to the current.
However, for a large phonon frequency, heat generation is in general
qualitatively different from the current. It is non-monotonic with current and
many unique and interesting behaviors emerge. The heat generation could be very
large in the Coulomb blockade region, in which the current is very small due to
the Coulomb blockade effect. On the other hand, in the resonant tunneling
region, the heat generation is very small despite a large current, an ideal
condition for device operation. In the curve of heat generation versus the
bias, a negative differential of the heat generation is exhibited, although the
current is always monotonously increasing with the bias voltage.
