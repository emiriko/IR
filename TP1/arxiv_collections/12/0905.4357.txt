We carried out two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the
Galactic gas disk to show that the dense loop-like structures discovered by the
Galactic center molecular cloud survey by NANTEN 4 m telescope can be formed by
the buoyant rise of magnetic loops due to the Parker instability. At the
initial state, we assumed a gravitationally stratified disk consisting of the
cool layer ($T \sim 10^3$ K), warm layer ($T \sim 10^4$ K), and hot layer ($T
\sim 10^5$ K). Simulation box is a local part of the disk containing the
equatorial plane. The gravitational field is approximated by that of a point
mass at the galactic center. The self-gravity, and the effects of the galactic
rotation are ignored. Numerical results indicate that the length of the
magnetic loops emerging from the disk is determined by the scale height of the
hot layer ($\sim$ 100 pc at 1 kpc from the Galactic center). The loop length,
velocity gradient along the loops and large velocity dispersions at their foot
points are consistent with the NANTEN observations. We also show that the loops
become top-heavy when the curvature of the loop is sufficiently small, so that
the rising loop accumulates the overlying gas faster than sliding it down along
the loop. This mechanism is similar to that of the formation of solar
chromospheric arch filaments. The molecular loops emerge from the low
temperature layer just like the dark filaments observed in the H$\alpha$ image
of the emerging flux region of the sun.
