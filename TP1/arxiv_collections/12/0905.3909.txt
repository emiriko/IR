The structural and elastic properties as well as phonon-dispersion relations
of the Heusler-type alloys Fe$_2$VAl and Fe$_2$VGa are computed using
density-functional and density-functional perturbation theory within the
generalized-gradient approximation. The calculated equilibrium lattice
constants agree well with the experimental values. The elastic constants of
Fe$_2$VAl and Fe$_2$VGa are predicted for the first time. From the elastic
constants the shear modulus, Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, sound velocities
and Debye temperatures are obtained. By analyzing the ratio between the bulk
and shear modulii, we conclude that both Fe$_2$VAl and Fe$_2$VGa are brittle in
nature. The computed phonon-dispersion relation shows that both compounds are
dynamically stable in the L1$_2$ structure without any imaginary phonon
frequencies. The isomer shifts of Fe in the two compounds are discussed in
terms of the Fe s partial density of states, which reveal larger ionicity/less
hybridization in Fe$_2$VGa than in Fe$_2$VAl. For the same reason the Cauchy
pressure is negative in Fe$_2$VAl but positive in Fe$_2$VGa
