The AKARI and Spitzer satellites provided an unique opportunity to observe a
variety of stars, which are considered as departing from the Asymptotic Giant
Branch (AGB) and have started their post-AGB evolution recently. Most of these
stars are absent optically and are bright in the mid-IR wavelength range.
Spectra of close to 200 objects have been obtained. For all of them the 1-60
micron spectral energy distribution has been constructed using photometric data
from various surveys. We report here on the results of Spitzer observations of
88 IRAS selected post-AGB candidates and discuss them in comparison to the
results of the AKARI observations of post-AGB candidates reported elsewhere in
these proceedings. The dust compositions can be divided broadly in oxygen- and
carbon-rich types, but a variety of intermediate types have been found. Among
the oxygen-rich stars amorphous dust prevails, but a few sources show emission
features from crystalline dust. The spectra from carbon-rich shells may be
completely featureless, may show emission features from PAHs or a molecular
absorption line from C2H2. We found also sources with a neon emission line at
12.8 micron. More than a third of all sources show a near-infrared excess at <
5 micron and almost all of them show evidence of C-rich dust in their shells.
We postulate that the emerging post-AGB wind after the end of AGB evolution
contains always carbon-rich dust irrespective of the chemistry of the former
AGB star.
