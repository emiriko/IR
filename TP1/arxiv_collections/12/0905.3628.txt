We consider a controlled state equation of parabolic type on the halfline
$(0,+\infty)$ with boundary conditions of Dirichlet type in which the unknown
is equal to the sum of the control and of a white noise in time. We study
finite horizon and infinite horizon optimal control problem related by menas of
backward stochastic differential equations.
