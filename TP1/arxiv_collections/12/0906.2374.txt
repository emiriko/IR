We argue that Bekenstein entropy can be interpreted as the entropy of an
effective string with a rescaled tension. Using the AdS/CFT correspondence we
show that the Bekenstein entropy on the boundary CFT is given by the entropy of
a string at the stretched horizon of the AdS black hole in the bulk. The
gravitationally redshifted tension and energy of the string match those
required to reproduce Bekenstein entropy.
