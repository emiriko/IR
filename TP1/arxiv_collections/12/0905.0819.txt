Recently, the static spherically symmetric solution of the gravitational
field equations have been found in theories describing massive graviton with
spontaneous breaking of the Lorentz invariance. These solutions, which show off
two integration constants instead of one in General Relativity, are discussed.
They are candidates for modified black holes provided they are stable against
small perturbations. These solutions may have both attractive or repulsive
behavior at large distances. Therefore, these modified black holes may mimics
the presence of dark matter or be a source of anti-gravity.
