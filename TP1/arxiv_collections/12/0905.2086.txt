We calculated the Maxwellian-averaged cross sections (MACS) and astrophysical
reaction rates of the stellar nucleosynthesis reactions (n,$\gamma$),
(n,fission), (n,p), (n,$\alpha$) and (n,2n) using the ENDF/B-VII.0-, JEFF-3.1-,
JENDL-3.3-, and ENDF/B-VI.8-evaluated nuclear-data libraries. Four major
nuclear reaction libraries were processed under the same conditions for
Maxwellian temperatures ({\it kT}) ranging from 1 keV to 1 MeV. We compare our
current calculations of the {\it s}-process nucleosynthesis nuclei with
previous data sets and discuss the differences between them and the
implications for nuclear astrophysics.
