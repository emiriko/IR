We argue for the plausibility of a broad class of vectorlike confining gauge
theories at the TeV scale which interact with the Standard Model predominantly
via gauge interactions. These theories have a rich phenomenology at the LHC if
confinement occurs at the TeV scale, while ensuring negligible impact on
precision electroweak and flavor observables. Spin-1 bound states can be
resonantly produced via their mixing with Standard Model gauge bosons. The
resonances promptly decay to pseudo-Goldstone bosons, some of which promptly
decay to a pair of Standard Model gauge bosons, while others are charged and
stable on collider time scales. The diverse set of final states with little
background include multiple photons and leptons, missing energy, massive stable
charged particles and the possibility of highly displaced vertices in dilepton,
leptoquark or diquark decays. Among others, a novel experimental signature of
resonance reconstruction out of massive stable charged particles is
highlighted. Some of the long-lived states also constitute Dark Matter
candidates.
