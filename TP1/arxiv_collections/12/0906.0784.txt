We present a model study of gliding assays in which actin filaments are moved
by non-processive myosin motors. We show that even if the power stroke of the
motor protein has no lateral component, the filaments will rotate around their
axis while moving over the surface. Notably, the handedness of this twirling
motion is opposite from that of the actin filament structure. It stems from the
fact that the gliding actin filament has "target zones" where its subunits
point towards the surface and are therefore more accessible for myosin heads.
Each myosin head has a higher binding probability before it reaches the center
of the target zone than afterwards, which results in a left-handed twirling. We
present a stochastic simulation and an approximative analytical solution. The
calculated pitch of the twirling motion depends on the filament velocity (ATP
concentration). It reaches about 400nm for low speeds and increases with higher
speeds.
