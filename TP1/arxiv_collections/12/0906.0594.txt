We report on a heretofore unnoted giant negative magnetocapacitance (>20%) in
non-magnetic Au/GaAs:Si Schottky barriers that we attribute to a magnetic field
in-duced increase in the binding energy of the shallow donor Si impurity atoms.
Depletion capacitance (Cdep) dispersion identifies the impurity ionization and
capture processes that give rise to a magnetic field dependent density of
ionized impurities. Internal photoemission experiments confirm that the large
field-induced shifts in the built-in potential, inferred from 1/Cdep^2 vs
voltage measurements, are not due to a field-dependent Schottky barrier height,
thus requiring a modification of the abrupt junction approximation that
accounts for the observed magnetodielectric coupling.
