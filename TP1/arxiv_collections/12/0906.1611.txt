The addition of gauge singlet fermions to the Standard Model Lagrangian
renders the neutrinos massive and allows one to explain all that is
experimentally known about neutrino masses and lepton mixing by varying the
values of the Majorana mass parameters M for the gauge singlets and the
neutrino Yukawa couplings. Here we explore the region of parameter space where
M values are much smaller than the neutrino Dirac masses. In this region,
neutrinos are pseudo-Dirac fermions. We find that current solar data constrain
M values to be less than at least 1E-9 eV, and discuss the sensitivity of
future experiments to tiny gauge singlet fermion masses. We also discuss a
useful basis for analyzing pseudo-Dirac neutrino mixing effects. In particular,
we identify a simple relationship between elements of M and the induced
enlarged mixing matrix and new mass-squared differences. These allow one to
directly relate bounds on the new mass-squared differences to bounds on the
singlet fermion Majorana masses.
