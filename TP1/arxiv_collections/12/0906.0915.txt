The structural, elastic, and electronic properties of ReN$_{2}$ are
investigated by first-principles calculations with density functional theory.
The obtained orthorhombic $Pbcn$ structure is energetically the most stable
structure at ambient pressure. ReN$_{2}$ is a metallic, superincompressible
solid and presents a rather elastic anisotropy. The estimated Debye temperature
and hardness are 735 K and 17.1 GPa, respectively. Its estimated hardness is
comparative to that of Si$_{3}$N$_{4}$.
