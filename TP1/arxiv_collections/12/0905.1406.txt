Corrections of two-photon exchange to proton and neutron electromagnetic form
factors are employed to study the effect of two-photon exchange on the deuteron
electromagnetic form factors. Numerical results of the effect are given. It is
suggested to test the effect in the measurement of $P_z$ in a small angle
limit.
