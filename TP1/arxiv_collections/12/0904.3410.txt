The K^- induced production of Lambda(1405) is investigated in K^- d to pi
Sigma n reactions based on coupled-channels chiral dynamics, in order to
discuss the resonance position of the Lambda(1405) in the KbarN channel. We
find that the K^-d to Lambda(1405)n process favors the production of
Lambda(1405) initiated by the KbarN channel. The present approach indicates
that the Lambda(1405) resonance position is 1420 MeV rather than 1405 MeV in
the pi Sigma invariant mass spectra of K- d to pi Sigma n reactions. This is
consistent with an observed spectrum of the K^- d to pi^+ Sigma^- n with
686-844 MeV/c incident K^- by bubble chamber experiments done in the 70's. Our
model also reproduces the measured Lambda(1405) production cross section.
