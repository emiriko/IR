Bound and resonance electronic states in impure graphene are studied.
Short-range perturbations for defects and impurities of the types "local
chemical potential" and "local gap" are taken into account. Zero gap and
non-zero gap kinds of graphene are considered. A qualitative analysis of the
electronic spectrum general features and numeric calculations are presented. A
dependence of the resonance widths on the gap value, angular momentum values
and the perturbation amplitudes is investigated.
