We study interior of a charged, non-rotating distorted black hole. We
consider static and axisymmetric black holes, and focus on a special case when
an electrically charged distorted solution is obtained by the Harrison-Ernst
transformation from an uncharged one. We demonstrate that the Cauchy horizon of
such black hole remains regular, provided the distortion is regular at the
event horizon. The shape and the inner geometry of both the outer and inner
(Cauchy) horizons are studied. We demonstrate that there exists a duality
between the properties of the horizons. Proper time of a free fall of a test
particle moving in the interior of the distorted black hole along the symmetry
axis is calculated. We also study the property of the curvature in the inner
domain between the horizons. Simple relations between the 4D curvature
invariants and the Gaussian curvature of the outer and inner horizon surfaces
are found.
