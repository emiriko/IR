The Dark Energy Survey Data Management (DESDM) system will process and
archive the data from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) over the five year period of
operation. This paper focuses on a new adaptable processing framework developed
to perform highly automated, high performance data parallel processing. The new
processing framework has been used to process 45 nights of simulated DECam
supernova imaging data, and was extensively used in the DES Data Challenge 4,
where it was used to process thousands of square degrees of simulated DES data.
