The contrasts of features in the quiet Sun are studied using filtergrams
recorded by the Broad-band Filter Imager on the Hinode/Solar Optical Telescope.
  In a first step, the scattered light originating in the instrument is modeled
using Mercury transit data. Combinations of four two-dimensional Gaussians with
different widths and weights were employed to retrieve the point-spread
functions (PSF) of the instrument at different wavelengths, which also describe
instrumental scattered light. The parameters of PSFs at different wavelengths
are tabulated. The observed images were then deconvolved using the PSFs. The
corrected images were used to obtain contrasts of features such as bright
points and granulation in different wavelength bands. After correction, rms
contrasts of the granulation of between 0.11 (at 668 nm) and 0.22 (at 388 nm)
are obtained.
  Similarly, bright point contrasts ranging from 0.07 (at 668 nm) to 0.78 (at
388 nm) are found, which are a factor of 1.8 to 2.8 higher than those obtained
before PSF deconvolution. The mean contrast of the bright points is found to be
somewhat higher in the CN-band than in the G-band, which confirms theoretical
predictions.
