The issue raised in this paper is classical in the sense of being ancient:
which subset of 4X4 matrices should be accepted as physical Mueller matrices in
polarization optics? Non-quantum entanglement between the polarization and
spatial degrees of freedom of an electromagnetic beam is shown to provide the
physical basis to resolve this issue in a definitive manner.
