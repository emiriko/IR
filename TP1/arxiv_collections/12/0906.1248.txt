An SU(2) slave boson formulation of bond-type spin nematic orders is
developed in frustrated ferromagnets, where the spin nematic states are
described as the resonating spin-triplet valence bond (RVB) states. The
d-vectors of spin-triplet pairing ansatzes play the role of the directors in
the bond-type spin quadrupolar states. The low-energy excitations around such
spin-triplet RVB ansatzes generally comprise the (potentially massless) gauge
bosons, massless Goldstone bosons, and spinon individual excitations. Extending
the projective symmetry group argument to the spin-triplet ansatzes, we show
how to identify the number of massless gauge bosons efficiently. Applying this
formulation, we next (i) enumerate possible mean field solutions for the S=1/2
ferromagnetic J1-J2 Heisenberg model on the square lattice, with ferromagnetic
nearest neighbor J1 and competing antiferromagnetic next-nearest neighbor J2,
and (ii) argue their stability against small gauge fluctuations. As a result,
two stable spin-triplet RVB ansatzes are found in the intermediate coupling
regime around J1:J2 \simeq 1:0.4. One is the Z_2 Balian-Werthamer (BW) state
stabilized by the Higgs mechanism and the other is the SU(2) chiral p-wave
(Anderson-Brinkman-Morel) state stabilized by the Chern-Simon mechanism. The
former Z_2 BW state in fact shows the same bond-type spin quadrupolar order as
found in the previous exact diagonalization study [N. Shannon et al., Phys.
