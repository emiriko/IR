Model independent formulae are derived for the polarizations and spin
correlations of protons in the final state of $pp \to pp\omega $, taking into
consideration all the six threshold partial wave amplitudes $f_1, ..., f_6$
covering $Ss, Sp$ and $Ps$ channels. It is shown that these measurements of the
final state spin observables, employing only an unpolarized beam and an
unpolarized target, may be utilized to complement measurements, at the double
differential level, suggested earlier [Phys. Rev. \textbf{C78}, 01210(R)(2009)]
so that all the six partial wave amplitudes may be determined empirically.
