We present VLT eclipse photometry for the giant planet CoRoT-1b. We observed
a transit in the R-band filter and an occultation in a narrow filter centered
on 2.09 microns. Our analysis of this new photometry and published radial
velocities, in combination with stellar-evolutionary modeling, leads to a
planetary mass and radius of 1.07 (+0.13,-0.18) M_Jup and 1.45 (+0.07,-0.13)
R_Jup, confirming the very low density previously deduced from CoRoT
photometry. The large occultation depth that we measure at 2.09 microns (0.278
(+0.043,-0.066) %) is consistent with thermal emission and is better reproduced
by an atmospheric model with no redistribution of the absorbed stellar flux to
the night side of the planet.
