The fundamental problem faced in quantum chemistry is the calculation of
molecular properties, which are of practical importance in fields ranging from
materials science to biochemistry. Within chemical precision, the total energy
of a molecule as well as most other properties, can be calculated by solving
the Schrodinger equation. However, the computational resources required to
obtain exact solutions on a conventional computer generally increase
exponentially with the number of atoms involved. This renders such calculations
intractable for all but the smallest of systems. Recently, an efficient
algorithm has been proposed enabling a quantum computer to overcome this
problem by achieving only a polynomial resource scaling with system size. Such
a tool would therefore provide an extremely powerful tool for new science and
technology. Here we present a photonic implementation for the smallest problem:
obtaining the energies of H2, the hydrogen molecule in a minimal basis. We
perform a key algorithmic step - the iterative phase estimation algorithm - in
full, achieving a high level of precision and robustness to error. We implement
other algorithmic steps with assistance from a classical computer and explain
how this non-scalable approach could be avoided. Finally, we provide new
theoretical results which lay the foundations for the next generation of
simulation experiments using quantum computers. We have made early experimental
progress towards the long-term goal of exploiting quantum information to speed
up quantum chemistry calculations.
