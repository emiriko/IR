We obtain two results concerning the Feichtinger conjecture for systems of
normalized reproducing kernels in the model subspace $K_\Theta = H^2\ominus
\Theta H^2$ of the Hardy space $H^2$, where $\Theta$ is an inner function.
First, we verify the Feichtinger conjecture for the kernels $ \tilde
k_{\lambda_n} = k_{\lambda_n}/\|k_{\lambda_n}\|$ under the assumption that
$\sup_n |\Theta(\lambda_n)|<1$. Secondly, we prove the Feichtinger conjecture
in the case where $\Theta$ is a one-component inner function, meaning that the
set $\{z:|\Theta(z)|<\varepsilon\}$ is connected for some
$\varepsilon\in(0,1)$.
