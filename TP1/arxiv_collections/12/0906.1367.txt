Context: The sharp temperature and density gradients in the coronal
transition region are a challenge for models and observations.
  Aims: We set out to get linearly- and quadratically-weighted average electron
densities in the region emitting the S VI lines, using the observed opacity and
the emission measure of these lines.
  Methods: We analyze SoHO/SUMER spectroscopic observations of the S VI lines,
using the center-to-limb variations and radiance ratios to derive the opacity.
We also use the Emission Measure derived from radiance at disk center.
  Results: We get an opacity at S VI line center of the order of 0.05. The
resulting average electron density is 2.4 10^16 m^-3 at T = 2 10^5 K. This
value is higher than the values obtained from radiance measurements.
Conversely, taking a classical value for the density leads to a too high value
of the thickness of the emitting layer.
  Conclusions: The pressure derived from the Emission Measure method compares
well with previous determinations and implies a low opacity of 5 10^-3 to
10^-2. The fact that a direct derivation leads to a much higher opacity remains
unexplained, despite tentative modeling of observational biases. Further
measurements need to be done, and more realistic models of the transition
region need to be used.
