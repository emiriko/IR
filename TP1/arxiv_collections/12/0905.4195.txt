Evidence from the lattice suggests that formation of a flux tube between a
$q\bar{q}$ pair in the QCD vacuum leads to quark confinement. For large
separations between the quarks, it is conjectured that the flux tube has a
behaviour similar to an oscillating bosonic string, supported by lattice data
for the groundstate $q\bar{q}$ potential. We measure the excited states of the
flux tube in 3d SU(2) gauge theory with three different couplings inside the
scaling region. We compare our results to predictions of effective string
theories.
