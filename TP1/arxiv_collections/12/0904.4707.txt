We model an infinitely long liquid bridge confined between two plates
chemically patterned by stripes of same width and different contact angle,
where the three-phase contact line runs, on average, perpendicular to the
stripes. This allows us to study the corrugation of a contact line in the
absence of pinning. We find that, if the spacing between the plates is large
compared to the length scale of the surface patterning, the cosine of the
macroscopic contact angle corresponds to an average of cosines of the intrinsic
angles of the stripes, as predicted by the Cassie equation. If, however, the
spacing becomes of order the length scale of the pattern there is a sharp
crossover to a regime where the macroscopic contact angle varies between the
intrinsic contact angle of each stripe, as predicted by the local Young
equation. The results are obtained using two numerical methods, Lattice
Boltzmann (a diffuse interface approach) and Surface Evolver (a sharp interface
approach), thus giving a direct comparison of two popular numerical approaches
to calculating drop shapes when applied to a non-trivial contact line problem.
We find that the two methods give consistent results if we take into account a
line tension in the free energy. In the lattice Boltzmann approach, the line
tension arises from discretisation effects at the diffuse three phase contact
line.
