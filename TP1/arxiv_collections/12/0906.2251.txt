In addition to gamma-rays, dark matter annihilation products can include
energetic electrons which inverse Compton scatter with the cosmic microwave
background to produce a diffuse extragalactic background of gamma-rays and
X-rays. In models in which the dark matter particles annihilate primarily to
electrons or muons, the measurements of EGRET and COMPTEL can provide
significant constraints on the annihilation cross section. The Fermi Gamma-Ray
Space Telescope will likely provide an even more stringent test of such
scenarios.
