The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) source J102347.6+003841 was recently
revealed to be a binary 1.69 millisecond radio pulsar with a 4.75 hr orbital
period and a ~0.2 M_sun companion. Here we analyze the SDSS spectrum of the
source in detail. The spectrum was taken on 2001 February 1, when the source
was in a bright state and showed broad, double-peaked hydrogen and helium lines
-- dramatically different from the G-type absorption spectrum seen from 2003
onward. The lines are consistent with emission from a disk around the compact
primary. We derive properties of the disk by fitting the SDSS continuum with a
simple disk model, and find a temperature range of 2000--34000 K from the outer
to inner edge of the disk. The disk inner and outer radii were approximately
10^9 and 5.7x10^10 cm, respectively. These results further emphasize the unique
feature of the source: it is likely a system at the end of its transition from
an X-ray binary to a recycled radio pulsar. The disk mass is estimated to have
been ~10^23 g, most of which would have been lost due to pulsar wind ablation
(or due to the propeller effect if the disk had extended inside the light
cylinder of the pulsar) before the final disk disruption event. The system
could undergo repeated episodes of disk formation. Close monitoring of the
source is needed to catch the system in its bright state again, so that this
unusual example of a pulsar-disk interaction can be studied in much finer
detail
