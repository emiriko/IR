The cross section and the transverse-longitudinal asymmetry A_{TL} of the
three-body-break-up (3BBU) process 3He(e,e'p)pn have been calculated by a
non-factorized and parameter-free approach based upon realistic few-body wave
functions corresponding to the $AV18$ interaction, treating the rescattering of
the struck nucleon within a generalized eikonal approximation. The results of
calculations exhibit a good agreement with recent JLab experimental data and
show that the Final State Interaction (FSI) of the struck proton in the region
of missing momentum 300 < p_m < 600 MeV/c and removal energy E_m > p_m^2/4m_N
is dominated by single nucleon rescattering, in agreement with nucleon-nucleon
correlation predictions.
