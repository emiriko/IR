The role of light scalar meson `$f_0 (600)$' is investigated in nuclear
matter in an Effective chiral model in the mean-field approach. For the
purpose, we scan the properties of the matter at various saturation densities
imposing constraint such as the vacuum value of the pion decay constant
$f_{\pi} \approx 131 ~MeV$. With a simple approach, the bound on the mass of
the scalar meson is calculated and found in the range $m_{\sigma} = 546 \pm 10
MeV$. Further, the present analysis show that nuclear matter favor high nucleon
effective mass and dominant repulsive forces at high density, the insight and
the implications of which are discussed.
