A novel method is presented for the beam shaping of far field intensity
distributions of coherently combined fiber arrays. The fibers are arranged
uniformly on the perimeter of a circle, and the linearly polarized beams of
equal shape are superimposed such that the far field pattern represents an
effective radially polarized vector beam, or discrete cylindrical vector (DCV)
beam. The DCV beam is produced by three or more beams that each individually
have a varying polarization vector. The beams are appropriately distributed in
the near field such that the far field intensity distribution has a central
null. This result is in contrast to the situation of parallel linearly
polarized beams, where the intensity peaks on axis.
