Arguments are summarized, that neutral matter made of helium, carbon, etc.,
should form a quantum liquid at the above-atomic but below-nuclear densities
for which the charged spin-0 nuclei can condense. The resulting substance has
distinctive features, such as a mass gap in the bosonic sector and a gap-less
spectrum of quasifermions, which determine its thermodynamic properties. I
discuss an effective field theory description of this substance, and as an
example, consider its application to calculation of a static potential between
heavy charged impurities. The potential exhibits a long-range oscillatory
behavior in which both the fermionic and bosonic low-energy degree of freedom
contribute. Observational consequences of the condensate for cooling of
helium-core white dwarf stars are briefly discussed.
