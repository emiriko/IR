We report the observation of phase-super resolution in a motion-sensitive
spin-wave (SW) atom interferometer utilizing a NOON-type entanged state. The SW
interferometer is implemented by generating a superposition of two SWs and
observing the interference between them, where the interference fringe is
sensitive to the atomic collective motion. By heralded generation of a second
order NOON state in the SW interferometer, we clearly observe the interference
pattern with phase super-resolution. The demonstrated SW interferometer can in
principle be scaled up to highly entangled quantum state, and thus is of
fundamental importance to implement quantum-enhanced-measurement.
