This note constructs completely integrable convex Hamiltonians on the
cotangent bundle of certain k-dimensional torus bundles over an l-dimensional
torus. A central role is played by the Lax representation of a
Bogoyavlenskij-Toda lattice. The classification of these systems, up to
iso-energetic topological conjugacy, is related to the classification of
abelian groups of Anosov toral automorphisms by their topological entropy
function.
