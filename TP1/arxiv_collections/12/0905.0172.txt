Yokoyama and Inoue gabe their replies to eight questions raised by the
present author with respect to their paper on "Production of Zr55Cu30Ni5Al10
glassy alloy rod of 30mm in diameter by a cap-cast technique" in 2007. Yokoyama
and Inoue stressed in their reply that there were no inadequeate descriptions
in their paper, except for the catalog name of a TEM machine, which was a
typographical error. It is still unclear why a cap-cast technique is needed to
produce glassy alloy rods up to 30mm in diameter. Lack of essential information
regarding the cap-cast technique leads us no valuable assessment of a new
technique. Further questions arose.
