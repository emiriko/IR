Optical dipole traps and atom chips are two very powerful tools for the
quantum manipulation of neutral atoms. We demonstrate that both methods can be
combined by creating an optical lattice potential on an atom chip. A
red-detuned laser beam is retro-reflected using the atom chip surface as a
high-quality mirror, generating a vertical array of purely optical oblate
traps. We load thermal atoms from the chip into the lattice and observe cooling
into the two-dimensional regime where the thermal energy is smaller than a
quantum of transverse excitation. Using a chip-generated Bose-Einstein
condensate, we demonstrate coherent Bloch oscillations in the lattice.
