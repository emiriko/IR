We study a functional equation whose unknown maps a Euclidean space into the
space of probability distributions on [0,1]. We prove existence and uniqueness
of its solution under suitable regularity and boundary conditions, we show that
it depends continuously on the boundary datum, and we characterize solutions
that are diffuse on [0,1]. A canonical solution is obtained by means of a
Randomly Reinforced Urn with different reinforcement distributions having equal
means. The general solution to the functional equation defines a new parametric
collection of distributions on [0,1] generalizing the Beta family.
