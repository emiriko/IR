We use deep (~27.5 mag V-band point-source limiting magnitude) V- and U-band
LBT imaging to study the outer disk (beyond the optical radius R_25) of the
non-interacting, face-on spiral galaxy NGC 3184 (D = 11.1 Mpc; R_25 = 11.1 kpc)
and find that this outer disk contains >1000 objects (or marginally-resolved
'knots') resembling star clusters with masses ~10^2 - 10^4 M_sun and ages up to
~1 Gyr. We find statistically significant numbers of these cluster-like knots
extending to ~1.4 R_25, with the redder knots outnumbering bluer at the largest
radii. We measure clustering among knots and find significant correlation to
galactocentric radii of 1.5 R_25 for knot separations <1 kpc. The effective
integrated surface brightness of this outer disk cluster population ranges from
30 - 32 mag arcsec^-2 in V. We compare the HI extent to that of the correlated
knots and find that the clusters extend at least to the damped Lyman-alpha
threshold of HI column density (2e20 cm^-2; 1.62 R_25). The blue knots are
correlated with HI spiral structure to 1.5 R_25, while the red knots may be
correlated with the outer fringes of the HI disk to 1.7 R_25. These results
suggest that outer disks are well-populated, common, and long-lasting features
of many nearby disk galaxies.
