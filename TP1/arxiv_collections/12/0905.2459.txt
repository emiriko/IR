We present the requirements and design specification of the open-source
Distributed Modular Audio Recognition Framework (DMARF), a distributed
extension of MARF. The distributed version aggregates a number of distributed
technologies (e.g. Java RMI, CORBA, Web Services) in a pluggable and modular
model along with the provision of advanced distributed systems algorithms. We
outline the associated challenges incurred during the design and implementation
as well as overall specification of the project and its advantages and
limitations.
