Charge and thermal conductivities are the most important parameters of carbon
nanomaterials as candidates for future electronics. In this paper we address
the effects of Anderson type disorder in long semiconductor carbon nanotubes
(CNTs) to electron charge conductivity and lattice thermal conductivity using
the atomistic Green function approach. The electron and phonon transmissions
are analyzed as a function of the length of the disordered nanostructures. The
thermal conductance as a function of temperature is calculated for different
lengths. Analysis of the transmission probabilities as a function of length of
the disordered device shows that both electrons and phonons with different
energies display different transport regimes, i.e. quasi-ballistic, diffusive
and localization regimes coexist. In the light of the results we discuss
heating of the semiconductor device in electronic applications.
