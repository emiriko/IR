We consider a two-dimensional px+i py superconductor in the presence of
multiple vortices, which support zero-energy Majorana fermion states in their
cores. Intervortex tunnelings of the Majorana fermions lift the topological
state degeneracy. Using the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equation, we calculate
splitting of the zero-energy modes due to these tunneling events. We also
discuss superconducting fluctuations and, in particular, their effect on the
energy splitting.
