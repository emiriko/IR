An updated version of the dust radiation transfer code Sunrise, including
models for star-forming regions and a self-consistent calculation of the
spatially dependent dust and PAH emission, is presented. Given a hydrodynamic
simulation of a galaxy, this model can calculate a realistic 2-dimensional
ultraviolet--submillimeter spectral energy distribution of the galaxy,
including emission lines from HII regions, from any viewpoint. To model the
emission from star-forming regions, the MAPPINGSIII photoionization code is
used. The high wavelength resolution (~ 1000 wavelengths) is made possible by
the polychromatic Monte-Carlo algorithm employed by Sunrise. From the 2-D
spectral energy distributions, images in any filter bands or integrated galaxy
SEDs can be created. Using a suite of hydrodynamic simulations of disc
galaxies, the output broad-band images and spectral energy distributions are
compared with observed galaxies from the multiwavelength SINGS and SLUGS galaxy
surveys. Overall, the output spectral energy distributions show a good match
with observed galaxies in colours ranging from GALEX far-UV to SCUBA
submillimeter wavelengths. The only possible exception is the 160 micron/850
micron colour, which the simulations underestimate by a factor "of order 5"
compared to the SINGS sample. However, the simulations here agree with the
SLUGS galaxies, which consistently have significantly larger amounts of cold
dust than the SINGS galaxies. The Sunrise model can be used to generate
simulated observations of arbitrary hydrodynamic galaxy simulations. In this
way, predictions of galaxy formation theories can be directly tested against
observations of galaxies.
