We investigate the effect of electron-electron interactions on Aharonov-Bohm
(AB) current oscillations in nanorings formed by a chain of metallic quantum
dots. We demonstrate that electron-electron interactions cause electron
dephasing thereby suppressing the amplitude of AB oscillations at all
temperatures down to T=0. The crossover between thermal and quantum dephasing
is found to be controlled by the ring perimeter. Our predictions can be
directly tested in future experiments.
