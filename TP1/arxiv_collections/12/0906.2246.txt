We studied the phase diagram for a two-dimensional d-wave superconducting
system under an in-plane magnetic field or an exchange field. According to the
spatial configuration of the order parameter, we show that there exists quantum
phase transitions in which the uniform phase transforms to the one-dimensional
Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state, and then to two-dimensional FFLO
state upon increasing the exchange field.
  The local density of states are calculated and suggested to be signatures to
distinguish these phases.
