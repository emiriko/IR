A debate exists over whether tropical troposphere temperature trends in
climate models are inconsistent with observations (Karl et al. 2006, IPCC
(2007), Douglass et al 2007, Santer et al 2008). Most recently, Santer et al
(2008, herein S08) asserted that the Douglass et al statistical methodology was
flawed and that a correct methodology showed there is no statistically
significant difference between the model ensemble mean trend and either RSS or
UAH satellite observations. However this result was based on data ending in
1999. Using data up to the end of 2007 (as available to S08) or to the end of
2008 and applying exactly the same methodology as S08 results in a
statistically significant difference between the ensemble mean trend and UAH
observations and approaching statistical significance for the RSS T2 data. The
claim by S08 to have achieved a "partial resolution" of the discrepancy between
observations and the model ensemble mean trend is unwarranted.
