We consider the stationary solutions of N=4 supergravity coupled to n vector
multiplets that define linear superpositions of non-interacting extremal black
holes. The most general solutions of this type are derived from the graded
decompositions of so(8,2+n) associated to its nilpotent orbits. We illustrate
the formalism by giving explicitly asymptotically Minkowski non-BPS solutions
of the most exotic class depending on 6+n harmonic functions.
