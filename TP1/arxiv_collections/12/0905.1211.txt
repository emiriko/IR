The Tokai to Kamioka (T2K) experiment is a next generation long baseline
neutrino oscillation experiment utilising the Japan Proton Accelerator Research
complex (J-PARC) high intensity proton synchrotron. After a brief introduction
of the current understanding of neutrino mixing, the T2K experiment, its
current status and the expected physics results are presented. Then,
possibilities for future neutrino oscillation experiments utilising J-PARC are
discussed.
