We analyse the continuum-state and bound-state beta^-decay rates of the
neutron. For the calculation of theoretical values of the decay rates we use
the new value for the axial coupling constant g_A = 1.2750(9), obtained
recently by H. Abele (Progr. Part. Nucl. Phys., 60, 1 (2008)) from the fit of
the experimental data on the neutron spin-electron correlation coefficient of
the electron energy spectrum of the continuum-state beta^- decay of the
neutron. We take into account the contribution of radiative corrections and the
scalar and tensor weak couplings. We define correlation coefficients of the
electron energy spectrum in terms of axial, scalar and tensor coupling
constants. Using recent precise experimental data for the lifetime of the
neutron and correlation coefficients we estimate the scalar and tensor weak
coupling constants. The bound-state beta^- decay rates of the neutron we
calculate as functions of axial, scalar and tensor weak coupling constants. We
show that dominantly the neutron decays into hydrogen in the hyperfine states
with total angular momentum F = 0. The calculated angular distributions of the
probabilities of the bound-state beta^- decays of the polarised neutron can be
used for the experimental measurements of the bound-state beta^- decays into
the hyperfine states with a total angular momentum F = 1.
