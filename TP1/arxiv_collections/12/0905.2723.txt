We discuss V.P. Belavkin's approach to the measurement problem encapsulated
in his theory of eventum mechanics (as presented in his 2007 survey). In
particular, we show its relation to ideas based on superselection and
interaction with the environment developed by N.P. Landsman (1995, and more
recent papers).
  Landsman writes "those believing that the classical world exists
intrinsically and absolutely [such persons later termed by him B-realists] are
advised against reading this [his, 1995] paper". He adopts a milder position,
calling it that of an A-realist: we live in a classical world but to give it
special status is like insisting that the Earth is the centre of the universe.
The B-realists are accused of living under some kind of hallucination. Landsman
presents arguments pointing in a particular direction to a resolution of the
measurement problem which at least would satisfy the A-realists. We point out
in this paper that the theory earlier developed by Belavkin (surveyed in his
2007 paper) seems to complete Landsman's program or at least exhibits a
"realisation" satisfying his desiderata. At the same time it seems that this
completion of the program ends up giving both A- and B-realists equal licence
to accuse the others of living under hallucinations.
