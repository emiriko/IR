We report on a search for gravitational waves from coalescing compact
binaries, of total mass between 2 and 35 Msun, using LIGO observations between
November 14, 2006 and May 18, 2007. No gravitational-wave signals were
detected. We report upper limits on the rate of compact binary coalescence as a
function of total mass. The LIGO cumulative 90%-confidence rate upper limits of
the binary coalescence of neutron stars, black holes and black hole-neutron
star systems are 1.4x10^-2, 7.3x10^-4 and 3.6x10^-3 yr^-1L_10^-1 respectively,
where L_10 is 10^10 times the blue solar luminosity.
