Using synchrotron X-rays and neutron diffraction we disentangle spin-lattice
order in highly frustrated ZnCr$_2$O$_4$ where magnetic chromium ions occupy
the vertices of regular tetrahedra. Upon cooling below 12.5 K the quandary of
anti-aligning spins surrounding the triangular faces of tetrahedra is resolved
by establishing weak interactions on each triangle through an intricate lattice
distortion. The resulting spin order is however, not simply a N\'{e}el state on
strong bonds. A complex co-planar spin structure indicates that antisymmetric
and/or further neighbor exchange interactions also play a role as ZnCr$_2$O$_4$
resolves conflicting magnetic interactions.
