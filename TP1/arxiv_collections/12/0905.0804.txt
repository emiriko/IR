We reconsider the construction of the vector and axial-vector currents in
Wilson Chiral Perturbation Theory (WChPT), the low-energy effective theory for
lattice QCD with Wilson fermions. We discuss in detail the finite
renormalization of the currents that has to be taken into account in order to
properly match the currents. We explicitly show that imposing the chiral Ward
identities on the currents does, in general, affect the axial-vector current at
O(a). As an application of our results we compute the pion decay constant to
one loop in the two flavor theory. Our result differs from previously published
ones.
