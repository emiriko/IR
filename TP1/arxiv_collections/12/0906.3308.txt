We examine the jets and the disc of SS 433 at super-Eddington luminosities
with 600 times Eddington critical accretion rate by time-dependent
two-dimensional radiation hydrodynamical calculations, assuming alpha-model for
the viscosity. One-dimensional supercritical accretion disc models with mass
loss or advection are used as the initial configurations of the disc. As a
result, from the initial advective disc models with alpha =0.001 and 0.1, we
obtain the total luminosities 2.5x10^{40} and 2.0x10^{40} erg/s. The total
mass-outflow rates are 4x10^{-5} and 10^{-4} solar-mass/yr and the rates of the
relativistic axial outflows in a small half opening angle of 1 degree are about
10^{-6} solar-mass/yr: the values generally consistent with the corresponding
observed rates of the wind and the jets, respectively. From the initial models
with mass loss but without advection, we obtain the total mass-outflow and
axial outflow rates smaller than or comparable to the observed rates of the
wind and the jets respectively, depending on alpha. In the advective disc model
with alpha=0.1, the initially radiation-pressure dominant, optically thick disc
evolves to the gas-pressure dominated, optically thin state in the inner region
of the disc, and the inner disc is unstable. Consequently, we find remarkable
modulations of the disc luminosity and the accretion rate through the inner
edge. These modulations manifest themselves as the recurrent hot blobs with
high temperatures and low densities at the disc plane, which develop outward
and upward and produce the QPOs-like variability of the total luminosity with
an amplitude of a factor of 2 and quasi-periods of 10 -- 25 s. This may explain
the massive jet ejection and the QPOs phenomena observed in SS 433.
