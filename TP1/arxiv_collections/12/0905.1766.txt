We report the preparation of a Kr-83m source and its subsequent use in
calibrating a liquid xenon detector. Kr-83m atoms were produced through the
decay of Rb-83 atoms trapped in zeolite molecular sieve and were then
introduced into liquid xenon. Decaying Kr-83m nuclei were detected through
liquid xenon scintillation. Conversion electrons with energies of 9.4 keV and
32.1 keV from the decay of Kr-83m were both observed. This calibration source
will allow the characterization of the scintillation and ionization response of
noble liquid detectors at low energies, highly valuable for the search for WIMP
dark matter. Kr-83m may also be useful for measuring fluid flow dynamics, both
to understand purification in noble liquid-based particle detectors, as well as
for studies of classical and quantum turbulence in superfluid helium.
