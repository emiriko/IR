The production of two weak bosons at the Large Hadron Collider will be one of
the most important sources of SM backgrounds for final states with multiple
leptons. In this paper we consider several quantities that can help normalize
the production of weak boson pairs. Ratios of inclusive cross-sections for
production of two weak bosons and Drell-Yan are investigated and the
corresponding theoretical errors are evaluated. The possibility of predicting
the jet veto survival probability of VV production from Drell-Yan data is also
considered. Overall, the theoretical errors on all quantities remain less than
5-20%. The dependence of these quantities on the center of mass energy of the
proton-proton collision is also studied.
