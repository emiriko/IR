We report on near normal infrared reflectivity spectra of ~550 nm thick films
made of cosputtered transition metal nanograins and SiO2 in a wide range of
metal fractions. Co0.85(SiO2)0.15,with conductivity well above the percolation
threshold has a frequency and temperature behavior according to what it is find
in conducting metal oxides. The electron scattering rate displays an unique
relaxation time characteristic of single type of carriers experiencing strong
electron-phonon interactions. Using small polaron fits we identify those
phonons as glass vibrational modes. Ni0.61(SiO2)0.39, with a metal fraction
closer to the percolation threshold, undergoes a metal-non metal transition at
~77 K. Here, as it is suggested by the scattering rate nearly quadratic
dependence, we broadly identify two relaxation times (two carrier
contributions) associated to a Drude mode and a mid-infrared overdamped band,
respectively. Disorder induced, the mid-infrared contribution drives the phase
transition by thermal electron localization. Co0.51(SiO2)0.49 has the
reflectivity of an insulator with a distinctive band at ~1450cm\^{-1}
originating in electron promotion, localization, and defect induced polaron
formation. Angle dependent oblique reflectivity of globally insulating
Co0.38(SiO2)0.62, Fe0.34(SiO2)0.66, and Ni0.28(SiO2)0.72, reveals a remarkable
resonance at that band threshold. We understand this as due to the excitation
by normal to the film electric fields of defect localized electrons in the
metallic nanoparticles
