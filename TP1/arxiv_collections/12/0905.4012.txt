We present models representing the scattering of quasar radiation off free
electrons and dust grains in geometries that approximate the structure of
quasar host galaxies. We show that, for reasonable assumptions, scattering
alone can easily produce ratios of nuclear (point source) to extended fluxes
comparable to those determined in studies of quasar hosts. This result suggests
that scattered quasar light, as well as stellar emission from the host galaxy,
contributes significantly to the detected extended flux, leading to uncertainty
in the inferred properties of quasar host. A significant contribution from
scattered quasar light will lead to overestimates of the luminosity and hence
mass of the host galaxy, and may also distort its morphology. Scattering of
quasar light within the host galaxy may provide alternative explanations for
the apparent peak in host luminosity at z = 2-3; possibly the overall average
higher luminosity of radio-loud host galaxies relative to those of radio-quiet
quasars (RQQs), and the apparent preference of high-luminosity RQQs for
spheroidal rather than disk galaxies.
