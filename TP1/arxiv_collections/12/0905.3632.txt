For the universe I use dimensionless entropy $S/k = \ln \Omega$ for which the
most convenient unit is the googol ($10^{100}$) and identify all dark matter as
black holes whereupon the present entropy is about a thousand googols. While
the energy of the universe has been established to be about 0.04 baryons, 0.24
dark matter and 0.72 dark energy, the cosmological entropy is almost entirely,
about $(1 - 10^{-15})$, from black holes and only $10^{-15}$ from everything
else. This identification of all dark matter as black holes is natural in
statistical mechanics.
