It is proposed to treat cancer by the combination of a strong magnetic field
with intense ultrasound. At the low electrical conductivity of tissue the
magnetic field is not frozen into the tissue, and oscillates against the tissue
which is brought into rapid oscillation by the ultrasound. As a result, a
rapidly oscillating electric field is induced in the tissue, strong enough to
disrupt cancer cell replication. Unlike radio frequency waves, which have been
proposed for this purpose, ultrasound can be easily focused onto the regions to
be treated. This method has the potential for the complete eradication of the
tumor.
