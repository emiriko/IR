We have realised a 4-beam pyramidal magneto-optical trap ideally suited for
future microfabrication. Three mirrors split and steer a single incoming beam
into a tripod of reflected beams, allowing trapping in the four-beam overlap
volume. We discuss the influence of mirror angle on cooling and trapping,
finding optimum efficiency in a tetrahedral configuration. We demonstrate the
technique using an ex-vacuo mirror system to illustrate the previously
inaccessible supra-plane pyramid MOT configuration. Unlike standard pyramidal
MOTs both the pyramid apex and its mirror angle are non-critical and our MOT
offers improved molasses free from atomic shadows in the laser beams. The MOT
scheme naturally extends to a 2-beam refractive version with high optical
access. For quantum gas experiments, the mirror system could also be used for a
stable 3D tetrahedral optical lattice.
