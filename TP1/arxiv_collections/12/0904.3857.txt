One year after their initial discovery, two schools of thought have
crystallized regarding the electronic structure and magnetic properties of
ferropnictide systems. One postulates that these are itinerant weakly
correlated metallic systems that become magnetic by virtue of spin-Peierls type
transition due to near-nesting between the hole and the electron Fermi surface
pockets. The other argues these materials are strongly or at least moderately
correlated, the electrons are considerably localized and close to a
Mott-Hubbard transition, with the local magnetic moments interacting via
short-range superexchange. In this paper we argue that neither picture is fully
correct. The systems are moderately correlated, but with correlations driven by
Hund's rule coupling rather than by the on-site Hubbard repulsion. The iron
moments are largely local, driven by Hund's intra-atomic exchange.
Superexchange is not operative and the interactions between the Fe moments are
considerably long-range and driven mostly by one-electron energies of all
occupied states.
