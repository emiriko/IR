High contrast coronagraphic imaging is a challenging task for telescopes with
central obscurations and thick spider vanes, such as the Subaru Telescope. Our
group is currently assembling an extreme AO bench designed as an upgrade for
the newly commissionned coronagraphic imager instrument HiCIAO, that addresses
these difficulties. The so-called SCExAO system combines a high performance
PIAA coronagraph to a MEMS-based wavefront control system that will be used in
complement of the Subaru AO188 system. We present and demonstrate good
performance of two key optical components that suppress the spider vanes, the
central obscuration and apodize the beam for high contrast coronagraphy, while
preserving the throughput and the angular resolution.
