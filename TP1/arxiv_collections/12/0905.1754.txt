A scheme to a complex-valued acquisition of the Fourier transform imaging was
proposed. The main idea is to project the real and the imaginary parts of a
diffraction field to intensity distributions respectively. The whole procedure
was algorithm independent and needs no a priori knowledge of an arbitrary
objet. An example was demonstrated with a numerical modeling and its results.
