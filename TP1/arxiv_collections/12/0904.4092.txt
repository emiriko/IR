We have utilized the antiferromagnetic nature and structural/chemical
compatibility of La$_{0.45}$Sr$_{0.55}$MnO$_{3}$ with highly spin polarized
La$_{0.67}$Sr$_{0.33}$MnO$_{3}$ to prepare epitaxial exchange bias couples. A
robust exchange bias (EB) shift of magnetization hysteresis with associated
interfacial exchange energy J $\approx$ 0.13 erg/cm$^2$ at 10 K along with
enhanced coercivity are reported. The EB effect was engineered to bring
coercivity contrast between
  La$_{0.67}$Sr$_{0.33}$MnO$_{3}$ and cobalt films in
La$_{0.45}$Sr$_{0.55}$MnO$_{3}$/La$_{0.67}$Sr$_{0.33}$MnO$_{3}$/SrTiO$_{3}$/Co
magnetic tunnel junctions.
