The three-algebras used by Bagger and Lambert in N=6 theories of ABJM type
are in one-to-one correspondence with a certain type of Lie superalgebras. We
show that the description of three-algebras as generalized Jordan triple
systems naturally leads to this correspondence. Furthermore, we show that
simple three-algebras correspond to simple Lie superalgebras, and vice versa.
This gives a classification of simple three-algebras from the well known
classification of simple Lie superalgebras.
