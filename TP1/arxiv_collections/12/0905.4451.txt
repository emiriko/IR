A method to produce suspensions of graphene sheets by combining
solution-based bromine intercalation and mild sonochemical exfoliation is
presented. Ultrasonic treatment of graphite in water leads to the formation of
suspensions of graphite flakes. The delamination is dramatically improved by
intercalation of bromine into the graphite before sonication. The bromine
intercalation was verified by Raman spectroscopy as well as by x-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and density functional theory (DFT)
calculations show an almost ten times lower interlayer binding energy after
introducing Br2 into the graphite. Analysis of the suspended material by
transmission and scanning electron microscopy (TEM and SEM) revealed a
significant content of few-layer graphene with sizes up to 30 $mu$m,
corresponding to the grain size of the starting material.
