It is well known that the dynamics of a quantum system is always
non-adiabatic in passage through a quantum critical point and the defect
density in the final state following a quench shows a power-law scaling with
the rate of quenching. However, we propose here a possible situation where the
dynamics of a quantum system in passage across quantum critical regions is
adiabatic and the defect density decays exponentially. This is achieved by
incorporating additional interactions which lead to quantum critical behavior
and gapless phases but do not participate in the time evolution of the system.
To illustrate the general argument, we study the defect generation in the
quantum critical dynamics of a spin-1/2 anisotropic quantum XY spin chain with
three spin interactions and a linearly driven staggered magnetic field.
