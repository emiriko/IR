(Abridged) We present two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of slowly
rotating gas that is under the influence of the gravity of a super massive
black hole and is irradiated by a thin UV accretion disc and a spherical X-ray
corona. We calculate the accretion luminosity of a system based on the
accretion-rate which is assumed to be equal to the mass-supply rate at the
radius of ~10^-2 pc. For the models with high temperature gas at large radii
(~10 pc) and high luminosities, we find a strong correlation between the
mass-outflow rate (Mdot_out) and the luminosity (L). The power law index (q)
describing the Mdot_out-L relation is q=2.0(+/-0.1), which is very similar to
that for radiation-driven stellar and disc wind models. More surprisingly, for
high density at large radii, we find steady state solutions with the accretion
luminosity exceeding the Eddington limit. The super-Eddington accretion
proceeds in the equatorial region and is possible because the radiation flux
from the disc is significantly reduced in the equatorial direction due to the
geometrical foreshortening effect. In all models, an outflow is driven from an
inflow with sub-Keplerian rotation. For high temperature at large radii, the
inflow occurs over a wide range of the polar angles, and the outflow occurs in
a relatively narrow polar cone. However, for the super-Eddington cases with low
temperature at large radii, the inflow persists only very close to the
equatorial plane, resembling a thin accretion disc, while the outflow arises in
a wide range of radii and polar angles. The geometry of this extreme
inflow-outflow solution is very similar to a radiation-driven wind from a
luminous Keplerian accretion disc.
