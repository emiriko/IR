We have developed an interface which allows to perform rigorous
electromagnetic field (EMF) simulations with the simulator JCMsuite and
subsequent aerial imaging and resist simulations with the simulator Dr.LiTHO.
With the combined tools we investigate the convergence of near-field and
far-field results for different DUV masks. We also benchmark results obtained
with the waveguide-method EMF solver included in Dr.LiTHO and with the
finite-element-method EMF solver JCMsuite. We demonstrate results on
convergence for dense and isolated hole arrays, for masks including diagonal
structures, and for a large 3D mask pattern of lateral size 10 microns by 10
microns.
