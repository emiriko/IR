We present preliminary results on the ability of self-gravitating discs to
cool in response to their internal heating. These discs are modelled using a
Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) code with radiative transfer (Whitehouse,
Bate & Monaghan 2005) and we investigate the ability of these discs to maintain
a state of thermal equilibrium with their boundaries as an indication of their
likelihood to fragment.
