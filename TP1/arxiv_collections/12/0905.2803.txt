PHENIX and STAR data on the intercept parameter of the two-pion Bose-Einstein
correlation functions in $\sqrt{s_{NN}}= 200$ GeV Au+Au collisions were
analysed in terms of various models of hadronic abundances. To describe these
data, an in-medium $\eta^\prime$ mass decrease of at least 200 MeV was needed
in each case.
