Time-dependent fields are a valuable tool to control fundamental quantum
phenomena in highly coherent low dimensional electron systems. Carbon nanotubes
and graphene are a promising ground for these studies. Here we offer a brief
overview of driven electronic transport in carbon-based materials with the main
focus on carbon nanotubes. Recent results predicting control of the current and
noise in nanotube based Fabry-P\'{e}rot devices are highlighted.
