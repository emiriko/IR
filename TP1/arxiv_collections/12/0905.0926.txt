Charge transport measurements on flexible Mo$_{6}$S$_{3}$I$_{6}$ (MoSI)
nanowires with different diameters in highly imperfect 2-terminal circuits
reveal systematic power law behaviour of the conductivity $\sigma(T,V)$ as a
function of temperature and voltage. On the basis of measurements on a number
of circuits we conclude that the behaviour in \emph{thin} wires can be most
convincingly described by tunneling through Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL)
segments of MoSI wire, which is in some cases modified by environmental Coulomb
blockade (ECB). The latter are proposed to arise from deformations or
imperfections of the MoSI wires, which - in combination with their recognitive
terminal sulfur-based connectivity properties - might be useful for creating
sub-nanometer scale interconnects as well as non-linear elements for molecular
electronics.
