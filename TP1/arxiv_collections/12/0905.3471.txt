In this talk, we firstly overview the experimental status of
$\bar{N}_X(1625)$, which is an enhancement structure observed in
$K^{-}\bar{\Lambda}$ invariant mass spectrum of $J/\psi\to pK^{-}\bar{\Lambda}$
process. Then we present the result of the decay of $\bar{N}_X(1625)$ under the
two molecular assumptions, i.e. S-wave $\bar\Lambda K^-$ and S-wave
$\bar{\Sigma}^0K^-$ molecular states. Several experimental suggestions for
$\bar{N}_X(1625)$ are proposed.
