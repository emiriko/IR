We study heat transport in a class of stochastic energy exchange systems that
characterize the interactions of networks of locally trapped hard spheres under
the assumption that neighbouring particles undergo rare binary collisions. Our
results provide an extension to three-dimensional dynamics of previous ones
applying to the dynamics of confined two-dimensional hard disks [Gaspard P &
Gilbert T On the derivation of Fourier's law in stochastic energy exchange
systems J Stat Mech (2008) P11021]. It is remarkable that the heat conductivity
is here again given by the frequency of energy exchanges. Moreover the
expression of the stochastic kernel which specifies the energy exchange
dynamics is simpler in this case and therefore allows for faster and more
extensive numerical computations.
