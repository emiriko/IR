Recent calculations, concerning the magnetism of uranium in the U/Fe
multilayer system have described the spatial dependence of the 5f polarization
that might be expected. We have used the x-ray resonant magnetic reflectivity
technique to obtain the profile of the induced uranium magnetic moment for
selected U/Fe multilayer samples. This study extends the use of x-ray magnetic
scattering for induced moment systems to the 5f actinide metals. The spatial
dependence of the U magnetization shows that the predominant fraction of the
polarization is present at the interfacial boundaries, decaying rapidly towards
the center of the uranium layer, in good agreement with predictions.
