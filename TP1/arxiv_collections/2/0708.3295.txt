This paper summarizes our recent progress towards using single rubidium atoms
trapped in an optical tweezer to encode quantum information. We demonstrate
single qubit rotations on this system and measure the coherence of the qubit.
We move the quantum bit over distances of tens of microns and show that the
coherence is reserved. We also transfer a qubit atom between two tweezers and
show no loss of coherence. Finally, we describe our progress towards
conditional entanglement of two atoms by photon emission and two-photon
interferences.
