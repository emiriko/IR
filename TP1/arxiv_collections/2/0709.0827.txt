We have experimentally realized a hybrid trap for ultracold paramagnetic
rubidium and diamagnetic ytterbium atoms by combining a bichromatic optical
dipole trap for ytterbium with a Ioffe-Pritchard-type magnetic trap for
rubidium. In this hybrid trap, sympathetic cooling of five different ytterbium
isotopes through elastic collisions with rubidium was achieved. A strong
dependence of the interspecies collisional cross section on the mass of the
ytterbium isotope was observed.
