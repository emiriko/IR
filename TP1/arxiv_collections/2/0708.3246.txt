Transversity quark light-cone momentum distributions are calculated for the
nucleon. We utilize a modified Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model in which confinement
is simulated by eliminating unphysical thresholds for nucleon decay into
quarks. The nucleon bound state is obtained by solving the relativistic Faddeev
equation in the quark-diquark approximation, where both scalar and axial-vector
diquark channels are included. Particular attention is paid to comparing our
results with the recent experimental extraction of the transversity
distributions by Anselmino et al. We also compare our transversity results with
earlier spin-independent and helicity quark distributions calculated in the
same approach.
