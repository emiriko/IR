We present detailed analyses of the vacuum structure of the scalar potential
in a supersymmetric Mass Varying Neutrinos model. The observed dark energy
density is identified with false vacuum energy and the dark energy scale of
order $(10^{-3}eV)^4$ is understood by gravitationally suppressed supersymmetry
breaking scale, $F({TeV})^2/M_{Pl}$, in the model. The vacuum expectation
values of sneutrinos should be tiny in order that the model works. Some decay
processes of superparticles into acceleron and sterile neutrino are also
discussed in the model.
