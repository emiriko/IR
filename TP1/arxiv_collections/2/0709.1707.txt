We report magnetization experiments in two magnetically isolated
ferromagnetic nanotubes of perovskite La$_{0.67}$Ca$_{0.33}$MnO$_3$. The
results show that the magnetic anisotropy is determined by the sample shape
although the coercive field is reduced by incoherent magnetization reversal
modes. The temperature dependence of the magnetization reveals that the
magnetic behavior is dominated by grain surface properties. These measurements
were acquired using a Silicon micro-mechanical oscillator working in its
resonant mode. The sensitivity was enough to measure the magnetic properties of
these two samples with a mass lower than 14 picograms and to obtain for the
first time the magnetization loop for one isolated nanotube.
