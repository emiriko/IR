We construct a large class of bipartite M x N quantum states which defines a
proper subset of states with positive partial transposes (PPT). Any state from
this class is PPT but the positivity of its partial transposition is recognized
with respect to canonical factorization of the original density operator. We
propose to call elements from this class states with strong positive partial
transposes (SPPT). We conjecture that all SPPT states are separable.
