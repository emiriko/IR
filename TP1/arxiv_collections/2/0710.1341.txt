We study an Ising model in one dimension with short range ferromagnetic and
long range (power law) antiferromagnetic interactions. We show that the zero
temperature phase diagram in a (longitudinal) field H involves a sequence of up
and down domains whose size varies continuously with H, between -H_c and H_c
which represent the edge of the ferromagnetic up and down phases. The
implications of long range interaction in many body systems are discussed.
