We derive the form of the infrared gluon propagator by proving a mapping in
the infrared of the quantum Yang-Mills and $\lambda\phi^4$ theories. The
equivalence is complete at a classical level. But while at a quantum level, the
correspondence is spoiled by quantum fluctuations in the ultraviolet limit, we
prove that it holds in the infrared where the coupling constant happens to be
very large. The infrared propagator is then obtained from the quantum field
theory of the scalar field producing a full spectrum. The results are in fully
agreement with recent lattice computations. We get a finite propagator at zero
momentum, the ghost propagator going to infinity as $1/p^{2+2\kappa}$ with
$\kappa=0$.
