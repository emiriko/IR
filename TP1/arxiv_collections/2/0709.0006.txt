In this paper we present a quantization of Cellular Automata. Our formalism
is based on a lattice of qudits, and an update rule consisting of local unitary
operators that commute with their own lattice translations. One purpose of this
model is to act as a theoretical model of quantum computation, similar to the
quantum circuit model. It is also shown to be an appropriate abstraction for
space-homogeneous quantum phenomena, such as quantum lattice gases, spin chains
and others. Some results that show the benefits of basing the model on local
unitary operators are shown: universality, strong connections to the circuit
model, simple implementation on quantum hardware, and a wealth of applications.
