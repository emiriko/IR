The rotation of the polarization vector for light propagating perpendicular
to an external constant external magnetic field $B$, is calculated in quantum
vacuum, where it leads to different photon eigenmodes of the magnetized photon
self-energy tensor for polarizations along and orthogonal to $B$ (Cotton-Mouton
effect in QED vacuum). Its analogies and differences with Faraday effect are
discussed and both phenomena are calculated for a relativistic electron gas at
low densities, by starting from the low energy limit of the photon self-energy
eigenvalues in presence of $B$. In the Cotton-Mouton case the polarization
vector describes an ellipse whose axes vary periodically from zero to a maximum
value. By assuming an effective electron density of order $10^3$ cm$^{-3}$ the
quantum relativistic eigenvalues lead to a rotation of the polarization plane
compatible with some of the limit values reported by PVLAS experiments. Other
consequences, which are interesting for astrophysics, are also discussed.
