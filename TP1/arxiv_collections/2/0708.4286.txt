We propose electrically tunable hybrid metamaterial consisting of special
wire grid immersed into nematic liquid crystal. The plasma-like permittivity of
the structure can be substantially varied due to switching of the liquid
crystal alignment by external voltages applied to the wires. Depending on the
scale of the structure, the effect is available for both microwave and optical
frequency ranges.
