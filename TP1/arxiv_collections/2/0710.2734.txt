We propose a supersymmetric model of quark flavor symmetry based on
SU(3)colorxSU(3)WxU(1)X x T' where T' (binary tetrahedral group) is a discrete
flavor symmetry group. The third (heavy) generation of quarks are assigned to
singlet representation of T' while light quark generations are treated
differently and assigned to doublet representation of T' . The model generates
masses for heavy quarks as in 3-3-1 case. The quark mass terms for the second
generation are obtained when T' symmetry is broken at leading order and for
first generation with small higher order corrections .The flavor-changing
neutral current (FCNC) effects are suppressed at leading order for third to
second generation quark transitions due to T' breaking which is an attractive
feature of the 3-3-1 model with T' symmetry.
