The sensitive conductance change of semiconductor nanowires and carbon
nanotubes in response to binding of charged molecules provide a novel sensing
modality which is generally denoted as nanoFET sensors. In this paper, we study
the scaling laws of nanoplate FET sensors by simplifying nanoplates as random
resistor networks with molecular receptors sitting on lattice sites.
Nanowire/tube FETs are included as the limiting cases where the device width
goes small. Computer simulations show that the field effect strength exerted by
the binding molecules has significant impact on the scaling behaviors. When the
field effect strength is small, nanoFETs have little size and shape dependence.
In contrast, when the field-effect strength becomes stronger, there exists a
lower detection threshold for charge accumulation FETs and an upper detection
threshold for charge depletion FET sensors. At these thresholds, the nanoFET
devices undergo a transition between low and large sensitivities. These
thresholds may set the detection limits of nanoFET sensors, while could be
eliminated by designing devices with very short source-drain distance and large
width.
