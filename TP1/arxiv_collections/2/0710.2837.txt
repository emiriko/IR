Sizable nuclear spin polarization is pumped in individual InP/GaInP dots in a
wide range of external magnetic fields B_ext=0-5T by circularly polarized
optical excitation. We observe nuclear polarization of up to ~40% at Bext=1.5T
and corresponding to an Overhauser field of ~1.2T. We find a strong feedback of
the nuclear spin on the spin pumping efficiency. This feedback, produced by the
Overhauser field, leads to nuclear spin bi-stability at low magnetic fields of
Bext=0.5-1.5T. We find that the exciton Zeeman energy increases markedly, when
the Overhauser field cancels the external field. This counter-intuitive result
is shown to arise from the opposite contribution of the electron and hole
Zeeman splittings to the total exciton Zeeman energy.
