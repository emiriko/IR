The phonon-bottleneck problem in the relaxation of two-level systems (spins)
via direct phonon processes is considered numerically in the weak-excitation
limit where the Schroedinger equation for the spin-phonon system simplifies.
The solution for the relaxing spin excitation p(t), emitted phonons n_k(t),
etc. is obtained in terms of the exact many-body eigenstates. In the absence of
phonon damping Gamma_{ph} and inhomogeneous broadening, p(t) approaches the
bottleneck plateau p_\infty > 0 with strongly damped oscillations, the
frequency being related to the spin-phonon splitting Delta at the avoided
crossing. For any Gamma_{ph} > 0 one has p(t) -> 0 but in the case of strong
bottleneck the spin relaxation rate is much smaller than Gamma_{ph} and p(t) is
nonexponential. Inhomogeneous broadening exceeding Delta partially alleviates
the bottleneck and removes oscillations of p(t). The line width of emitted
phonons, as well as Delta, increase with the strength of the bottleneck, i.e.,
with the concentration of spins.
