In the experiment with the SND detector at the VEPP-2M $e^+e^-$ collider
measuring the $e^+e^-\to \eta\gamma$ cross section in the energy range
$0.6<\sqrt{s}<1.38 \mathrm{GeV}$ the reanalysis of data is performed. The goal
is to improve the accuracy of the previous results by analysing ambiguities in
the approximation of energy dependence of the $e^+e^-\to \eta\gamma$ cross
section, which were not taken into account in our previous study. We report new
results on the approximation of the $e^+e^-\to \eta\gamma$ cross section based
on Vector Dominance Model under new model parameter assumptions.
