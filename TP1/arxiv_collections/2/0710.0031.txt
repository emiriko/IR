The $B_{c}$ ${\to}$ $J/{\psi}{\pi}$, ${\eta}_{c}{\pi}$ decays are studied in
the scheme of the QCD factorization approach. The branching ratios are
calculated with the asymptotic distribution amplitude of the pion. The charm
quark mass effect is considered. We find that the mass effect on the branching
ratios is small.
