We analyze electroproduction of light vector meson at small Bjorken $x$
within the generalized parton distribution (GPD) approach. Calculation is based
on the modified perturbative approach, where the quark transverse degrees of
freedom in the hard subprocess are considered. Our results on the cross section
are in fair agreement with experiment from HERMES to HERA energies.
