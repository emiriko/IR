We discuss a special function (polyexponential) that extends the natural
exponential function and also the exponential integral. The basic properties of
the polyexponential are listed and some applications are given. In particular,
it is shown that certain Mellin integrals can be evaluated in terms of
polyexponentials. The polyexponential is related to the exponential
polynomials, the Riemann zeta function, the Dirichlet eta function and the
Lerch Transcendent.
