An important problem in wireless sensor networks is to find the minimal
number of randomly deployed sensors making a network connected with a given
probability. In practice sensors are often deployed one by one along a
trajectory of a vehicle, so it is natural to assume that arbitrary probability
density functions of distances between successive sensors in a segment are
given. The paper computes the probability of connectivity and coverage of
1-dimensional networks and gives estimates for a minimal number of sensors for
important distributions.
