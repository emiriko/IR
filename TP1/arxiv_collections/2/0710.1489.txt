We review the influence of lepton flavour violation (LFV) on the production
processes e+e- -> ~chi+_i ~chi-_j at the International Linear Collider (ILC)
with longitudinal e+ and e- beam polarizations in the framework of the Minimal
Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). The t-channel sneutrino exchange
contribution to the processes e+e- -> ~chi+_i ~chi-_j is modified in the case
of LFV, as the sneutrino mass eigenstates have no definite flavour, and
therefore more than one sneutrino can contribute. This influence can alter the
cross section sigma(e+e- -> ~chi+_1 ~chi-_1) by a factor of 2 or more when
varying the LFV mixing angles, in accordance with the restrictions due to the
current limits on rare lepton decays. Hence, the inclusion of LFV parameters
can be important when deducing the underlying model parameters from measured
observables such as sigma(e+e- -> ~chi+_1 ~chi-_1).
