A new transmission-type electron multiplier was fabricated from
silicon-on-insulator (SOI) material by integrating an array of one dimensional
(1D) silicon nanopillars onto a two dimensional (2D) silicon membrane. Primary
electrons are injected into the nanopillar-membrane system from the flat
surface of the membrane, while electron emission from the other side is probed
by an anode. The secondary electron yield (SEY) from nanopillars is found to be
about 1.8 times that of plane silicon membrane. This gain in electron number is
slightly enhanced by the electric field applied from the anode. Further
optimization of the dimensions of nanopillars and membrane and application of
field emission promise an even higher gain for detector applications and allow
for probing of electronic/mechanical excitations in nanopillar-membrane system
excited by incident particles or radiation.
