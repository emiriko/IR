The present communication highlights that ac conductivity measurement of the
multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs)-polymer composites is a very promising
characterizing tool for qualifying any crude MWNT-sample synthesized by
electric arc. It distinguishes graphite structures from that of the MWNTs and
reflects the relative amount of nearly one-dimensional structures and disorders
present within the samples. This new protocol would help in evolving more
direct and quantitative criteria for qualification of MWNTs synthesized through
diverse techniques and will definitely add up to the conceptual understanding
in visualizing the exact roles of different controlling parameters affecting
the growth of MWNTs.
