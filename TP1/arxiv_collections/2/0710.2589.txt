We implement a one-loop analysis of the $\rho$ parameter in the Left Right
Twin Higgs model, including the logarithmically enhanced contributions from
both fermion and scalar loops. Numerical results show that the one-loop
contributions are dominant over the tree level corrections in most regions of
parameter space. The experimentally allowed values of $\rho$-parameter divide
the allowed parameter space into two regions; less than $670 {\rm GeV}$ and
larger than $1100 {\rm GeV}$ roughly, for symmetry breaking scale $f$. Our
numerical analysis significantly reduces the parameter space which are
favorably accessible to the LHC.
