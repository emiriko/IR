We present Backlund transformations for the noncommutative anti-self-dual
Yang-Mills equation where the gauge group is G=GL(2) and use it to generate a
series of exact solutions from a simple seed solution. The solutions generated
by this approach are represented in terms of quasideterminants and belong to a
noncommutative version of the Atiyah-Ward ansatz. In commutative limit, our
results coincide with those by Corrigan, Fairlie, Yates and Goddard.
