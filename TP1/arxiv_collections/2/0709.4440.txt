We present a case study on a new type of cold neutron beam station for the
investigation of angular correlations in the beta-decay of free neutrons. With
this beam station, called PERC, the 'active decay volume' lies inside the
neutron guide, and the charged neutron decay products are magnetically guided
towards the end of the neutron guide. Hence, the guide delivers at its exit a
beam of decay electrons and protons, under well-defined and precisely variable
conditions, which can be well separated from the cold neutron beam. In this way
a general-purpose source of neutron decay products is obtained which can be
used for various different experiments in neutron decay correlation
spectroscopy. A gain in phase space density of several orders of magnitude can
be achieved with PERC, as compared to existing neutron decay spectrometers.
Neutron beam related background is separately measurable in PERC, and magnetic
mirror effects on the charged neutron decay products and edge effects in the
active neutron beam volume are both strongly suppressed. Therefore the spectra
and angular distributions of the emerging decay particles will be
distortion-free on the level of 10^-4, more than 10 times better than achieved
today.
