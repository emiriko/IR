We study magnetic-field-dependent nonresonant microwave absorption and
dispersion in thin La$_{0.7}$Sr$_{0.3}$MnO$_{3}$ films and show that it
originates from the colossal magnetoresistance. We develop the model for
magnetoresistance of a thin ferromagnetic film in oblique magnetic field. The
model accounts fairly well for our experimental findings, as well as for
results of other researchers. We demonstrate that nonresonant microwave
absorption is a powerful technique that allows contactless measurement of
magnetic properties of thin films, including magnetoresistance, anisotropy
field and coercive field.
