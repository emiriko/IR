The dynamics of observables which are matrices depending on \hbar and taking
values in classical phase space is defined retaining the terms up to the first
order in \hbar of the Moyal bracket. Within this semiclassical approach a first
order lagrangian involving gauge fields is studied as a constrained hamiltonian
system. This provides a systematic study of spin dynamics in the presence of
non-abelian Berry gauge fields. We applied the method to various types of
dynamical spin systems and clarified some persisting discussions. In particular
employing the Berry gauge field which generates the Thomas precession, we
calculated the force exerted on an electron in the external electric and
magnetic fields. Moreover, a simple semiclassical formulation of the spin Hall
effect is accomplished.
