With the help of von Neumann entropy, we study numerically the localization
properties of two interacting particles (TIP) with on-site interactions in
one-dimensional disordered, quasiperiodic, and slowly varying potential
systems, respectively. We find that for TIP in disordered and slowly varying
potential systems, the spectrum-averaged von Neumann entropy <E_v> first
increases with interaction U until its peak, then decreases as U gets larger.
For TIP in the Harper model[S. N. Evangelou and D. E. Katsanos, Phys. Rev. B
56, 12797(1997)], the functions of <E_v> versus U are different for particles
in extended and localized regimes. Our numerical results indicate that for
these two-particle systems, the von Neumann entropy is a suitable quantity to
characterize the localization properties of particle states. Moreover, our
studies propose a consistent interpretation of the discrepancies between
previous numerical results.
