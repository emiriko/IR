A forty-four pass fibre optic surface plasmon resonance sensor that enhances
detection sensitivity according to the number of passes is demonstrated for the
first time. The technique employs a fibre optic recirculation loop that passes
the detection spot forty- four times, thus enhancing sensitivity by a factor of
forty-four. Presently, the total number of passes is limited by the onset of
lasing action of the recirculation loop. This technique offers a significant
sensitivity improvement for various types of plasmon resonance sensors that may
be used in chemical and biomolecule detections.
