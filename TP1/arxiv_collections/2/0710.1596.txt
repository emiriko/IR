We propose a new classification scheme for diffusion processes for which the
backward Kolmogorov equation is solvable in analytically closed form by
reduction to hypergeometric equations of the Gaussian or confluent type. The
construction makes use of transformations of diffusion processes to eliminate
the drift which combine a measure change given by Doob's h-transform and a
diffeomorphism. Such transformations have the important property of preserving
analytic solvability of the process: the transition probability density for the
driftless process can be expressed through the transition probability density
of original process. We also make use of tools from the theory of ordinary
differential equations such as Liouville transformations, canonical forms and
Bose invariants. Beside recognizing all analytically solvable diffusion process
known in the previous literature fall into this scheme and we also discover
rich new families of analytically solvable processes.
