Fluctuations in the spontaneous beating activity of isolated cardiac cells
were studied over a timescale of six decades. The beat dynamics of single
cardiac cells were heterogeneous and intermittent. The interbeat intervals
(IBIs) were power-law distributed in a long-time regime. Furthermore, for long
timescales up to the experimental window, the autocorrelation of IBIs exhibits
a scaling behavior of 1/f^beta-noise type. These observations suggest that
1/f^beta noise is an intrinsic characteristic of spontaneous activity of single
cardiac cells.
