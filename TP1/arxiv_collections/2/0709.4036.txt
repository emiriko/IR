Micro- and nanoscale opto-mechanical systems provide radiation pressure
coupling of optical and mechanical degree of freedom and are actively pursued
for their ability to explore quantum mechanical phenomena of macroscopic
objects. Many of these investigations require preparation of the mechanical
system in or close to its quantum ground state. Remarkable progress in ground
state cooling has been achieved for trapped ions and atoms confined in optical
lattices. Imperative to this progress has been the technique of resolved
sideband cooling, which allows overcoming the inherent temperature limit of
Doppler cooling and necessitates a harmonic trapping frequency which exceeds
the atomic species' transition rate. The recent advent of cavity back-action
cooling of mechanical oscillators by radiation pressure has followed a similar
path with Doppler-type cooling being demonstrated, but lacking inherently the
ability to attain ground state cooling as recently predicted. Here we
demonstrate for the first time resolved sideband cooling of a mechanical
oscillator. By pumping the first lower sideband of an optical microcavity,
whose decay rate is more than twenty times smaller than the eigen-frequency of
the associated mechanical oscillator, cooling rates above 1.5 MHz are attained.
Direct spectroscopy of the motional sidebands reveals 40-fold suppression of
motional increasing processes, which could enable reaching phonon occupancies
well below unity (<0.03). Elemental demonstration of resolved sideband cooling
as reported here should find widespread use in opto-mechanical cooling
experiments. Apart from ground state cooling, this regime allows realization of
motion measurement with an accuracy exceeding the standard quantum limit.
