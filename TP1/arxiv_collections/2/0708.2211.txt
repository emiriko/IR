Both hexagonal wurtzite and cubic zinc blend GaN phases were synthesized in
GaAs by 50 keV N+ implantation at 400 deg C and subsequent annealing at 900 deg
C for 15 min in N2 ambient. Crystallographic structural and Raman scattering
studies revealed that GaN phases were grown for fluence above 2x1017 cm-2.
Temperature-dependent photoluminescence study showed sharp direct band-to-band
transition peak ~3.32 eV at temperature <= 200K. The intermediate bandgap
value, with respect to ~3.4 eV for hexagonal and ~3.27 eV for cubic phases of
GaN is an indicative for the formation of mixed hexagonal and cubic phases.
