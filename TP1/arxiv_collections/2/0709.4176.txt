We present in this work a pedagogical way of quantizing the atomic orbit for
the hydrogen's atom model proposed by Bohr without using his hypothesis of
angular momentum quantization. In contrast to the usual treatment for the
orbital quantization, we show that using energy conservation, correspondence
principle and Plank's energy quantization Bohr's hypothesis can be deduced from
and is a consequence of the Planck's energy quantization.
