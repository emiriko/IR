Differential conductance spectra are obtained from nanoscale junctions on the
heavy-fermion superconductor CeCoIn$_5$ along three major crystallographic
orientations. Consistency and reproducibility of characteristic features among
the junctions ensure their spectroscopic nature. All junctions show a similar
conductance asymmetry and Andreev reflection-like conductance with reduced
signal (~ 10%-13%), both commonly observed in heavy-fermion superconductor
junctions. Analysis using the extended Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk model indicates
that our data provide the first spectroscopic evidence for $d_{x^2-y^2}$
symmetry. To quantify our conductance spectra, we propose a model by
considering the general phenomenology in heavy fermions, the two-fluid
behavior, and an energy-dependent density of states. Our model fits to the
experimental data remarkably well and should invigorate further investigations.
