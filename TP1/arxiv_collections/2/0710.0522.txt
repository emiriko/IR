We study bosonic atoms in small optical lattices by exact diagonalization and
observe a striking similarity to the superfluid to Mott insulator transition in
macroscopic systems. The momentum distribution, the formation of an energy gap,
and the pair correlation function show only a weak size dependence. For
noncommensurate filling we reveal in deep lattices a mixture of localized and
delocalized particles, which is sensitive to lattice imperfections. Breaking
the lattice symmetry causes a Bose-glass-like behavior. We discuss the nature
of excited states and orbital effects by using an exact diagonalization
technique that includes higher bands.
