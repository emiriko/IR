Monotonicity is a simple yet significant qualitative characteristic. We
consider the problem of segmenting a sequence in up to K segments. We want
segments to be as monotonic as possible and to alternate signs. We propose a
quality metric for this problem using the l_inf norm, and we present an optimal
linear time algorithm based on novel formalism. Moreover, given a
precomputation in time O(n log n) consisting of a labeling of all extrema, we
compute any optimal segmentation in constant time. We compare experimentally
its performance to two piecewise linear segmentation heuristics (top-down and
bottom-up). We show that our algorithm is faster and more accurate.
Applications include pattern recognition and qualitative modeling.
