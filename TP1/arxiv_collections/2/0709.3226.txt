The Einstein-Rupp experiments were proposed in 1926 by Albert Einstein to
study the wave versus particle nature of light. Einstein presented a
theoretical analysis of these experiments to the Berlin Academy together with
results of Emil Rupp, who claimed to have successfully carried them out.
However, as the preceding paper has claimed (HSPS 37 Suppl. (2007), 73-121),
Rupp's success was the result of scientific fraud. This paper will argue, after
exploring their interpretation, that the experiments were a relevant part of
the background to such celebrated contributions to quantum mechanics as Born's
statistical interpretation of the wave function and Heisenberg's uncertainty
principle. Yet, the Einstein-Rupp experiments have hardly received attention in
the history of quantum mechanics literature. In part, this is a consequence of
self-censorship in the physics community, enforced in the wake of the Rupp
affair. Self-censorship among historians of physics may however also have
played a role.
