A search for charmonium and other new states is performed in a study of
exclusive initial-state-radiation production of D Dbar events from
electron-positron annihilations at a center-of-mass energy of 10.58 GeV. The
data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 384 fb-1 and was
recorded by the BABAR experiment at the PEP-II storage ring. The D Dbar mass
spectrum shows clear evidence of the psi(3770) plus other structures near 3.9,
4.1, and 4.4 GeV/c^2. No evidence for Y(4260) -> D Dbar is observed, leading to
an upper limit of B(Y(4260) -> D Dbar)/B(Y(4260) -> J/psi pi+ pi-) < 1.0 at 90
% confidence level.
