It is well-known that the electric and magnetic Aharonov-Bohm effects may be
formally described on equal footing using the four-vector potential in a
relativistic framework. We propose an illustrative manifestation of both
effects in a single configuration, in which the specific path of the charged
particle determines the weight of the electric and magnetic acquired relative
phases. The phases can be distinctively obtained in the Coulomb gauge. The
scheme manifests the pedagogical lesson that though each of the relative phases
is gauge-dependent their sum is gauge-invariant.
