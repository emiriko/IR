Propagation and tunneling of light through subwavelength photonic barriers,
formed by dielectric layers with continuous spatial variations of dielectric
susceptibility across the film are considered. Effects of giant
heterogeneity-induced non-local dispersion, both normal and anomalous, are
examined by means of a series of exact analytical solutions of Maxwell
equations for gradient media. Generalized Fresnel formulae, visualizing a
profound influence of gradient and curvature of dielectric susceptibility
profiles on reflectance/transmittance of periodical photonic heterostructures
are presented. Depending on the cutoff frequency of the barrier, governed by
technologically managed spatial profile of its refractive index, propagation or
tunneling of light through these barriers are examined. Nonattenuative transfer
of EM energy by evanescent waves, tunneling through dielectric gradient
barriers, characterized by real values of refractive index, decreasing in the
depth of medium, is shown. Scaling of the obtained results for different
spectral ranges of visible, IR and THz waves is illustrated. Potential of
gradient optical structures for design of miniaturized filters, polarizers and
frequency-selective interfaces of subwavelength thickness is considered.
