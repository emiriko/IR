The antiferromagnetic Heisenberg two-leg ladder in the presence of
frustration and an external magnetic field is a system that is characterized by
two sorts of quantum criticalities, not only one. One criticality is the
consequence of intrinsic frustration, and the other one is a result of the
external magnetic field. So the behaviour of each of them in the presence of
the other deserves to be studied. Using the Jordan-Wigner transformation in
dimensions higher than one and bond-mean-field theory we examine the interplay
between the field-induced and frustration-induced quantum criticalities in this
system. The present work could constitute a prototype for those systems showing
multiple, perhaps sometimes competing, quantum criticalities. We calculate
several physical quantities like the magnetization and spin susceptibility as
functions of field and temperature.
