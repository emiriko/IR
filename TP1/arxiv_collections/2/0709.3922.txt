Ambipolar transport has been realised in blends of the molecular hole
conductor Cu-phthalocyanine (CuPc) and the electron conducting fullerene C60.
Charge carrier mobilities and the occupied electronic levels have been analyzed
as a function of the mixing ratio using field-effect transistor measurements
and photoelectron spectroscopy. These results are discussed in the context of
photovoltaic cells based on these materials.
