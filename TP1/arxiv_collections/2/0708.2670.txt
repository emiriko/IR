The time evolution of quantum correlations of entangled two-mode continuous
variable states is examined in single-reservoir as well as two-reservoir
models, representing noisy correlated or uncorrelated non-Markovian quantum
channels. For this purpose the model of quantum Brownian motion is extended.
Various separability criteria for Gaussian continuous variable systems are
applied. In both types of reservoir models moderate non-Markovian effects
prolong the separability time scales. However, in these models the properties
of the stationary state may differ. In the two-reservoir model the initial
entanglement is completely lost and both modes are finally uncorrelated. In a
common reservoir both modes interact indirectly via the coupling to the same
bath variables. Below a critical bath temperature entanglement between the two
modes is preserved even in the steady state. A separability criterion is
derived, which depends on the bath temperature and the response function of the
open quantum system. Thus, the extended quantum Brownian motion model of a
two-mode continuous variable system in a common reservoir provides an example
of environment-induced entanglement.
