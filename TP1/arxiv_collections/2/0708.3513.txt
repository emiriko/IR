We study the Hamiltonian-independent contribution to the complexity of
quantum optimal control problems. The optimization of controls that steer
quantum systems to desired objectives can itself be considered a classical
dynamical system that executes an analog computation. The system-independent
component of the equations of motion of this dynamical system can be integrated
analytically for various classes of discrete quantum control problems. For the
maximization of observable expectation values from an initial pure state and
the maximization of the fidelity of quantum gates, the time complexity of the
corresponding computation belongs to the class continuous log (CLOG), the
lowest analog complexity class, equivalent to the discrete complexity class NC.
The simple scaling of the Hamiltonian-independent contribution to these
problems with quantum system dimension indicates that with appropriately
designed search algorithms, quantum optimal control can be rendered efficient
even for large systems.
