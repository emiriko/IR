It was proved by Michel Talagrand in [10] that the Parisi formula for the
free energy in the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model is differentiable with respect
to inverse temperature parameter. We present a simpler proof of this result by
using approximate solutions in the Parisi formula and give one example of
application of the differentiability to prove non self-averaging of the overlap
outside of the replica symmetric region.
