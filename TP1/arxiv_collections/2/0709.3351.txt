We present here the results of frequency dependent dielectric, polarization
and powder X-ray powder diffraction studies in the 300 to 100K temperature
range for Ba_0.55Sr_0.45TiO_3. The dielectric results indicate a succession of
three relaxor ferroelectric transitions accompanying the cubic to tetragonal to
orthorhombic to rhombohedral phase transitions confirmed by XRD studies. Our
results confirm the coexistence of the relaxor ferroelectric and ferroelectric
behaviours.
