Due to the experimental necessity we present a formula to determine the
absorption strength by power losses inside a chaotic system (cavities, graphs,
acoustic resonators, etc) when the antenna coupling, always present in
experimental measurements, is taken into account. This is done by calculating
the average of the absorption coefficient as a function of the absorption
strength and the coupling of the antenna to the system, in the one channel
case.
