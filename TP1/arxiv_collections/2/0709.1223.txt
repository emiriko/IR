The (asymptotic) complexity of matrix multiplication (over the complex field)
is measured by a real parameter w > 0, called the exponent of matrix
multiplication (over the complex field), which is defined to be the smallest
real number w > 0 such that for an arbitrary degree of precision > 0, two n by
n complex matrices can be multiplied using an algorithm using O(n^(w+\epsilon))
number of non-division arithmetical operations. By the standard algorithm for
multiplying two matrices, the trivial lower and upper bounds for the exponent w
are 2 and 3 respectively.
  W. Strassen in 1969 obtained the first important result that w < 2.81 using
his result that 2 by 2 matrix multiplication could be performed using 7
multiplications, not 8, as in the standard algorithm. In 1984, V. Pan improved
this to 2.67, using a variant of Strassen's approach. It has been conjectured
that w = 2, but the best known result is that w < 2.38, due to D. Coppersmith
and S. Winograd. In all these approaches, estimates for w depend on the number
of main running steps in their algorithms.
  In a recent series of papers in 2003 and 2005, H. Cohn and C. Umans put
forward an entirely different approach using fairly elementary methods
involving finite groups, group algebras and their representations. The author
describes and proves their main results, and suggests possible ways of getting
improved estimates for the exponent using their methods.
