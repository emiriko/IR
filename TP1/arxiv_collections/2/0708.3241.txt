We study a mixture of strongly interacting bosons and spinless fermions with
on-site repulsion in a three-dimensional optical lattice. For this purpose we
develop and apply a generalized DMFT scheme, which is exact in infinite
dimensions and reliably describes the full range from weak to strong coupling.
We restrict ourselves to half filling. For weak Bose-Fermi repulsion a
supersolid forms, in which bosonic superfluidity coexists with charge-density
wave order. For stronger interspecies repulsion the bosons become localized
while the charge density wave order persists. The system is unstable against
phase separation for weak repulsion among the bosons.
