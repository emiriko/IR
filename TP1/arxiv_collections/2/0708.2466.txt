Using soft-collinear effective theory we describe at leading order in 1/m_b
all the semi-inclusive hadronic B -> XM decays near the endpoint, where an
energetic light meson M recoils against an inclusive jet X. We also include the
decays involving eta, eta' mesons that receive additional contributions from
gluonic operators. The predicted branching ratios and CP asymmetries depend on
fewer hadronic parameters than the corresponding two-body B decays. This makes
semi-inclusive hadronic B -> XM decays a powerful probe of the potential
nonperturbative nature of charming penguins as well as a useful probe of new
physics effects in electroweak flavor changing transitions. A comparison with B
-> KX data from BaBar points to an enhanced charming penguin, albeit with large
experimental errors.
