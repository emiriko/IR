We perform high-statistics Monte Carlo simulations of three three-dimensional
Ising spin-glass models: the +-J Ising model for two values of the disorder
parameter p, p=1/2 and p=0.7, and the bond-diluted +-J model for
bond-occupation probability p_b = 0.45. A finite-size scaling analysis of the
quartic cumulants at the critical point shows conclusively that these models
belong to the same universality class and allows us to estimate the
scaling-correction exponent omega related to the leading irrelevant operator,
omega=1.0(1). We also determine the critical exponents nu and eta. Taking into
account the scaling corrections, we obtain nu=2.53(8) and eta=-0.384(9).
