The hyperensembles, introduced by Crooks in a context of non-equilibrium
statistical physics, are considered here as a tool for systems in equilibrium.
Simple examples like the ideal gas, the mean-field model, and the Ising
interaction on small square lattices, are worked out to illustrate the
concepts.
