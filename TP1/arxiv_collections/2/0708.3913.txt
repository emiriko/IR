The charged lepton mass formula can be explained when the masses are
propotinal to the squared vacuum expectation values (VEVs) of scalar fields. We
introduce U(3) flavor symmetry and its nonet scalar field $\Phi$, whose VEV
structure plays an essential role for generating the fermion mass spectrum. We
can naturally obtain bilinear form of the Yukawa coupling
  $Y_{ij} \propto \sum_k <\Phi_{ik}> <\Phi_{kj}>$ without the
non-renormalizable interactions, when the flavor symmetry is broken only
through the Yukawa coupling and tadpole terms. We also speculate the possible
VEV structure of $<\Phi>$.
