We propose an abstract approach to coalition formation that focuses on simple
merge and split rules transforming partitions of a group of players. We
identify conditions under which every iteration of these rules yields a unique
partition. The main conceptual tool is a specific notion of a stable partition.
The results are parametrized by a preference relation between partitions of a
group of players and naturally apply to coalitional TU-games, hedonic games and
exchange economy games.
