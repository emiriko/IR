In this work, we compile the necessary and sufficient conditions a theory has
to fulfill in order to ensure general lepton flavour conservation, in the
spirit of the Glashow-Weinberg criteria for the absence of flavour-changing
neutral currents. At tree-level, interactions involving electrically neutral
and doubly charged bosons are investigated. We also investigate flavour changes
at 1-loop level. In all cases we find that the essential theoretical
requirements can be reduced to a few basic conditions on the particle content
and the coupling matrices. For 1-loop diagrams, we also investigate how exactly
a GIM-suppression can occur that will strongly reduce the rates of lepton
flavour violating effects even if they are in principle present in a certain
theory. In all chapters, we apply our criteria to several models which can in
general induce lepton flavour violation, e.g. LR-symmetric models or the MSSM.
In the end we give a summarizing table of the obtained results, thereby
demonstrating the applicability of our criteria to a large class of models
beyond the Standard Model.
