We study the purely relaxational dynamics (model A) at criticality in
three-dimensional disordered Ising systems whose static critical behaviour
belongs to the randomly diluted Ising universality class. We consider the
site-diluted and bond-diluted Ising models, and the +- J Ising model along the
paramagnetic-ferromagnetic transition line. We perform Monte Carlo simulations
at the critical point using the Metropolis algorithm and study the dynamic
behaviour in equilibrium at various values of the disorder parameter. The
results provide a robust evidence of the existence of a unique model-A dynamic
universality class which describes the relaxational critical dynamics in all
considered models. In particular, the analysis of the size-dependence of
suitably defined autocorrelation times at the critical point provides the
estimate z=2.35(2) for the universal dynamic critical exponent. We also study
the off-equilibrium relaxational dynamics following a quench from T=\infty to
T=T_c. In agreement with the field-theory scenario, the analysis of the
off-equilibrium dynamic critical behavior gives an estimate of z that is
perfectly consistent with the equilibrium estimate z=2.35(2).
