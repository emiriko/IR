The vortex electronic structure in the multiband superconductor NbSe2 is
studied by means of Scanning Tunneling Spectroscopy (STS) using a
superconducting tip. The use of a superconducting tip (Pb) as a probe provides
an enhancement of the different features related to the DOS of NbSe2 in the
tunneling conductance curves. This use allows the observation of rich patterns
of electronic states in the conductance images around the vortex cores in a
wide range of temperature, as well as the simultaneous acquisition of Josephson
current images in the vortex state.
