Future neutrino oscillation measurement focus, at first priority, on the
discovery of sin^2(2 theta_13) describing the coupling between solar and
atmospheric oscillations. In this talk, we briefly discuss the prospects to
measure sin^2(2 theta_13) by future reactor and beam experiments, and we
illustrate the usefulness of these measurements (and their precision) from the
theoretical point of view with an example.
