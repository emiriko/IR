We propose and analyse a practically implementable scheme to generate
macroscopic entanglement of a Bose-Einstein condensate in a micro-magnetic trap
magnetically coupled to a superconducting loop. We treat the superconducting
loop in a quantum superposition of two different flux states coupled with the
magnetic trap to generate macroscopic entanglement. Our scheme also provides a
platform to realise interferometry of entangled atoms through the Bose-Einstein
condensate and to explore physics at the quantum-classical interface.
