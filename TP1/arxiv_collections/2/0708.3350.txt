We use an extended laser Doppler technique to track optically the velocity of
individual particles in a high Reynolds number turbulent flow. The particle
sizes are of the order of the Kolmogorov scale and the time resolution, 30
microseconds, resolves the fastest scales of the fluid motion. Particles are
tracked for mean durations of the order of 10 Kolmogorov time scales. The
fastest scales of the particle motion are resolved and the particle
acceleration is measured. For neutrally buoyant particles, our measurement
matches the performance of the silicon strip detector technique introduced at
Cornell University \cite{Voth,MordantCornell}. This reference dynamics is then
compared to that of slightly heavier solid particles (density 1.4) and to air
bubbles. We observe that the acceleration variance strongly depends on the
particle density: bubbles experience higher accelerations than fluid particles,
while heavier particles have lower accelerations. We find that the probability
distribution functions of accelerations normalized to the variance are very
close although the air bubbles have a much faster dynamics.
