We show that dark solitons in 1D bose systems may be excited by resonant
absorption of single quanta of an external ac field. The energy of the quantum
$\hbar\omega$ should be slightly blue-detuned from the energy of a soliton with
momentum $\hbar q$, where $q$ is the external field wavenumber $q$. We
calculate the absorption cross-section and show that it has power-law
dependence on the frequency detuning. This reflects the quantum nature of the
absorption process and the orthogonality catastrophe phenomenon associated with
it.
