We analyze the transverse instabilities of spatial bright solitons in
nonlocal nonlinear media, both analytically and numerically. We demonstrate
that the nonlocal nonlinear response leads to a dramatic suppression of the
transverse instability of the soliton stripes, and we derive the asymptotic
expressions for the instability growth rate in both short- and long-wave
approximations.
