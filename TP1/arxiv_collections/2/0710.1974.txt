We investigate the dc electric response induced by ferromagnetic resonance in
ferromagnetic Permalloy (Ni80Fe20) microstrips. The resulting magnetization
precession alters the angle of the magnetization with respect to both dc and rf
current. Consequently the time averaged anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR)
changes (photoresistance). At the same time the time-dependent AMR oscillation
rectifies a part of the rf current and induces a dc voltage (photovoltage). A
phenomenological approach to magnetoresistance is used to describe the distinct
characteristics of the photoresistance and photovoltage with a consistent
formalism, which is found in excellent agreement with experiments performed on
in-plane magnetized ferromagnetic microstrips. Application of the microwave
photovoltage effect for rf magnetic field sensing is discussed.
