We derive exact strong-contrast expansions for the effective dielectric
tensor $\epeff$ of electromagnetic waves propagating in a two-phase composite
random medium with isotropic components explicitly in terms of certain
integrals over the $n$-point correlation functions of the medium. Our focus is
the long-wavelength regime, i.e., when the wavelength is much larger than the
scale of inhomogeneities in the medium. Lower-order truncations of these
expansions lead to approximations for the effective dielectric constant that
depend upon whether the medium is below or above the percolation threshold. In
particular, we apply two- and three-point approximations for $\epeff$ to a
variety of different three-dimensional model microstructures, including
dispersions of hard spheres, hard oriented spheroids and fully penetrable
spheres as well as Debye random media, the random checkerboard, and
power-law-correlated materials. We demonstrate the importance of employing
$n$-point correlation functions of order higher than two for high
dielectric-phase-contrast ratio. We show that disorder in the microstructure
results in an imaginary component of the effective dielectric tensor that is
directly related to the {\it coarseness} of the composite, i.e., local
volume-fraction fluctuations for infinitely large windows. The source of this
imaginary component is the attenuation of the coherent homogenized wave due to
scattering. We also remark on whether there is such attenuation in the case of
a two-phase medium with a quasiperiodic structure.
