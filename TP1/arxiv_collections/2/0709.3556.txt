Precisely engineered tunnel junctions exhibit a long sought effect that
occurs when the energy of the electron is comparable to the potential energy of
the tunneling barrier. The resistance of metal-insulator-metal tunnel junctions
oscillates with an applied voltage when electrons that tunnel directly into the
barrier's conduction band interfere upon reflection at the classical turning
points: the insulator-metal interface, and the dynamic point where the incident
electron energy equals the potential barrier inside the insulator. A model of
tunneling between free electron bands using the exact solution of the
Schroedinger equation for a trapezoidal tunnel barrier qualitatively agrees
with experiment.
