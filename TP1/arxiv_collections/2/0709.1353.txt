The well-known theory of "rational canonical form of an operator" describes
the invariant factors, or elementary divisors, as a complete set of invariants
of a similarity class of an operator on a finite-dimensional vector space $\V$
over a given field $\F$. A finer part of the theory is the contribution by
Frobenius dealing with the structure of the centralizer of an operator. The
viewpoint is that of finitely generated modules over a PID, cf. for example
[J], ch. 3. In this paper we approach the issue from a "dynamic" viewpoint, as
explained in [K]. We also extend the theory to affine maps. The formulation is
in terms of the action of the geneal linear group, or the group of invertible
affine maps, on the semigroup of all linear resp. affine maps by conjugacy. We
describe a parametrization of orbits and orbit-classes under this action, and
also provide a parametrization of all affine maps themselves.
