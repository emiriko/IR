The predictions of the semiclassical description of particle creation based
on QFT in classical backgrounds may be significantly modified when the source
of the classical background is also quantized and backreaction is taken into
account. In the cases of a stable charged particle, expanding empty (Milne)
universe, and de Sitter universe with a true cosmological constant, the
semiclassical particle creation is completely blocked up.
