This paper describes a system capable of semi-automatically filling an XML
template from free texts in the clinical domain (practice guidelines). The XML
template includes semantic information not explicitly encoded in the text
(pairs of conditions and actions/recommendations). Therefore, there is a need
to compute the exact scope of conditions over text sequences expressing the
required actions. We present in this paper the rules developed for this task.
We show that the system yields good performance when applied to the analysis of
French practice guidelines.
