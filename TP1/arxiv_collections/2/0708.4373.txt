We propose an accurate and efficient method to compute vibrational spectra of
molecules, based on exact diagonalization of an algebraically calculated matrix
based on powers of Morse coordinate. The present work focuses on the 1D
potential of diatomic molecules: as typical examples, we apply this method to
the standard Lennard-Jones oscillator, and to the ab initio potential of the H2
molecule. Global cm-1 accuracy is exhibited through the H2 spectrum, obtained
through the diagonalization of a 30 x 30 matrix. This theory is at the root of
a new method to obtain globally accurate vibrational spectral data in the
context of the multi-dimensional potential of polyatomic molecules, at an
affordable computational cost.
