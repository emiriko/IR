We consider a homogeneous non-ideal Bose gas at nonzero temperature in
equilibrium below the critical temperature $T_C$ in the framework of finite
temperature field theory. An algorithm is described in which a manageable
subset of diagrams can be considered which, coupled with a self--consistent
condition related to the minimization of the free energy, can be used to obtain
physically reasonable results.
