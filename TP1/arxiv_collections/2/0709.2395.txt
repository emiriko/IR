We use the iterative unitary matrix multiply method to calculate the long
time behavior of the resonant quantum kicked rotator with a large denominator.
The delocalization time is exponentially large. The quantum wave delocalizes
through degenerate states. At last we construct a nonresonant quantum kicked
rotator with delocalization.
