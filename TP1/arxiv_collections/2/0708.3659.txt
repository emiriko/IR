Extending independently the Balitsky-Kovchegov (BK) equation to running
coupling or to fluctuation effects due to Pomeron loops is known to lead in
both cases to qualitative changes of the traveling-wave asymptotic solutions.
In this paper we study the extension of the forward BK equation, including both
running coupling and fluctuations effects, using the method developed for the
fixed coupling case. We derive the exact asymptotic behavior of the
probabilistic distribution of the saturation scale.
