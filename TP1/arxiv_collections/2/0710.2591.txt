The von Neumann entropy for an electron in periodic, disorder and
quasiperiodic quantum small-world networks(QSWNs) are studied numerically. For
the disorder QSWNs, the derivative of the spectrum averaged von Neumann entropy
is maximal at a certain density of shortcut links p*, which can be as a
signature of the localization delocalization transition of electron states. The
transition point p* is agreement with that obtained by the level statistics
method. For the quasiperiodic QSWNs, it is found that there are two regions of
the potential parameter. The behaviors of electron states in different regions
are similar to that of periodic and disorder QSWNs, respectively.
