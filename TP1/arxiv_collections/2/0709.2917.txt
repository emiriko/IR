We present measurements of the process $p\bar{p} \to WZ+X \to \ell^{\prime}
\nu_{\ell^{\prime}} \ell \bar{\ell}$ at $\sqrt{s}=1.96$ TeV, where $\ell$ and
$\ell^{\prime}$ are electrons or muons. Using 1 fb$^{-1}$ of data from the D0
experiment, we observe 13 candidates with an expected background of $4.5\pm0.6$
events and measure a cross section $\sigma(WZ)=2.7^{+1.7}_{-1.3}$ pb. From the
number of observed events and the $Z$ boson transverse momentum distribution,
we limit the trilinear $WWZ$ gauge couplings to $-0.17 \le \lambda_Z \le 0.21$
$(\Delta \kappa_Z = 0)$ at the 95% C.L. for a form factor scale $\Lambda=2$
TeV. Further, assuming that $\Delta g^Z_1 = \Delta\kappa_Z$, we find $-0.12 \le
\Delta\kappa_Z \le 0.29$ $(\lambda_Z=0)$ at the 95% C.L. These are the most
restrictive limits on the $WWZ$ couplings available to date.
