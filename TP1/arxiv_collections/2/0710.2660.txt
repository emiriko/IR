An alternative to the Braginskii decomposition is proposed, one rooted in
treating the viscosity as a scalar quantity in a coordinate-free
representation. With appropriate application to the rate-of-shear tensor, one
may solve the neoclassical force density equations for its undetermined
velocity dependence, as well as the radial and poloidal profiles mentioned in
[R. W. Johnson, Phys. Plasmas, under review], using an improved poloidal
expansion. The pseudoplastic behavior of magnetized plasma is again obtained,
and the high viscosity solution is determined to be physical. A clear
relationship between confinement mode and viscosity is observed, indicating a
physical origin for transport barriers, pedestals, and other phenomena. The
gyroviscous contribution is found to be an effect on the order of one
one-thousandth of one percent of the dominant collisional viscosity.
