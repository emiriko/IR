We observe two thresholds in the variations of electrical conductivity of dry
solid electrolyte (AgI)x(AgPO3)1-x glasses, when the AgI additive concentration
x increases to 9.5% and to 37.8%. Raman scattering complemented by calorimetric
measurements confirm that these thresholds are signatures of the rigidity phase
transitions; at x = 9.5% from a stressed rigid to an isostatically (stress
free) rigid phase, and at x = 37.8% from isostatically rigid to a flexible
phase. In the flexible phase, the electrical conductivity seems to increase as
a power of x, this is in good agreement with the theoretical prediction based
on 3d percolation.
