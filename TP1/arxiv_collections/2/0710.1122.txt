Physicists have long debated whether the hidden order in URu2Si2 is itinerant
or localized, and it remains inaccessible to direct external probes. Recent
observation of an overdamped collective mode in this material (C. Weibe et al,
Nature Physics 3, 96-100 (2007)), appears to resolve this outstanding issue.
