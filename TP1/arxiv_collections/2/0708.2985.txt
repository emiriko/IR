We report on the in-plane magnetic field (H) dependence of the critical
current density (Jc) in meandered and planar single grain boundaries (GBs)
isolated in YBa2Cu3O7-d (YBCO) coated conductors. The Jc(H)properties of the
planar GB are consistent with those previously seen in single GBs of YBCO films
grown on SrTiO3 bi-crystals. In the straight boundary a characteristic flux
channeling regime when H is oriented near the GB plane, associated with a
reduced Jc, is seen. The meandered GB does not show vortex channeling since it
is not possible for a sufficient length of vortex line to lie within it.
