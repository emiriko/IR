The emerging field of ultracold molecules with their rich internal structure
is currently attracting a lot of interest. Various methods have been developed
to produce ultracold molecules in pre-set quantum states. For future
experiments it will be important to efficiently transfer these molecules from
their initial quantum state to other quantum states of interest. Optical Raman
schemes are excellent tools for transfer, but can be involved in terms of
equipment, laser stabilization and finding the right transitions. Here we
demonstrate a very general and simple way for transfer of molecules from one
quantum state to a neighboring quantum state with better than 99% efficiency.
The scheme is based on Zeeman tuning the molecular state to avoided level
crossings where radio-frequency transitions can then be carried out. By
repeating this process at different crossings, molecules can be successively
transported through a large manifold of quantum states. As an important
spin-off of our experiments, we demonstrate a high-precision spectroscopy
method for investigating level crossings.
