Topology of urban environments can be represented by means of graphs. We
explore the graph representations of several compact urban patterns by random
walks. The expected time of recurrence and the expected first passage time to a
node scales apparently linearly in all urban patterns we have studied In space
syntax theory, a positive relation between the local property of a node
(qualified by connectivity or by the recurrence time) and the global property
of the node (estimated in our approach by the first passage time to it) is
known as intelligibility. Our approach based on random walks allows to extend
the notion of intelligibility onto the entire domain of complex networks and
graph theory.
