We propose a top hypercharge model with gauge symmetry SU(3)_C x SU(2)_L x
U(1)_1 x U(1)_2 where the first two families of the Standard Model (SM)
fermions are charged under U(1)_1 while the third family is charged under
U(1)_2. The U(1)_1 x U(1)_2 gauge symmetry is broken down to the U(1)_Y gauge
symmetry, when a SM singlet Higgs field acquires a vacuum expectation value. We
consider the electroweak constraints, and compare the fit to experimental
observables to that of the SM. We study the quark CKM mixing between the first
two families and the third family, the neutrino masses and mixing, the flavour
changing neutral current effects in meson mixing and decays, the Z' discovery
potential at the Large Hadron Collider, the dark matter with a gauged Z_2
symmetry, and the Higgs boson masses.
