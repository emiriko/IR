Low energy elastic scattering between clouds of Bose condensed atoms leads to
the well known s-wave halo with atoms emerging in all directions from the
collision zone. In this paper we discuss the emergence of Hanbury Brown and
Twiss coincidences between atoms scattered in nearly parallel directions. We
develop a simple model that explains the observations in terms of an
interference involving two pairs of atoms each associated with the elementary s
wave scattering process.
