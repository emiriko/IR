The parametric resonance enhancement of the phase of neutrons due to
non-Newtonian anomalous gravitational is considered. The existence of such
resonances are confirmed by numerical calculations. A possible experimental
scheme for the observation of this effect is discussed based on an existing
neutron interferometer design.
