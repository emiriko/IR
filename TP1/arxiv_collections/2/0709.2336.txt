The properties of the resonant Gamow states are studied numerically in the
semiclassical limit for the quantum Chirikov standard map with absorption. It
is shown that the number of such states is described by the fractal Weyl law
and their Husimi distributions closely follow the strange repeller set formed
by classical orbits nonescaping in future times. For large matrices the
distribution of escape rates converges to a fixed shape profile characterized
by a spectral gap related to the classical escape rate.
