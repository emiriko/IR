In recent years there has been some progress in understanding how one might
model the interactions of branes in M-theory despite not having a fundamental
perturbative description. The goal of this review is to describe different
approaches to M-theory branes and their interactions. This includes: a review
of M-theory branes themselves and their properties; brane interactions; the
self-dual string and its properties; the role of anomalies in learning about
brane systems; the recent work of Basu and Harvey with subsequent developments;
and how these complimentary approaches might fit together.
