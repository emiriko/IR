This paper describes recent progress using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
as a platform for implementing quantum information processing (QIP) tasks. The
basic ideas of NMR QIP are detailed, examining the successes and limitations of
liquid and solid state experiments. Finally, a future direction for
implementing quantum processors is suggested,utilizing both nuclear and
electron spin degrees of freedom.
