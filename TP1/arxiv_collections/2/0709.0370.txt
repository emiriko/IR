It has been reported that virtual reality can be a useful tool for ergonomics
study. The proposed integrated simulation system aims at measuring operator's
performance in an interactive way for 2D control panel design. By incorporating
some sophisticated virtual reality hardware/software, the system allows natural
human-system and/or human-human interaction in a simulated virtual environment;
enables dynamic objective measurement of human performance; and evaluates the
quality of the system design in human factors perspective based on the
measurement. It can also be for operation training for some 2D control panels.
