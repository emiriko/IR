We report an experiment in which two-photon interference occurs between
degenerate single photons that never meet. The two photons travel in opposite
directions through our fibre-optic interferometer and interference occurs when
the photons reach two different, spatially separated, 2-by-2 couplers at the
same time. We show that this experiment is analogous to the conventional
Franson-type entanglement experiment where the photons are entangled in
position and time. We measure wavefunction overlaps for the two photons as high
as 94 $\pm$ 3%.
