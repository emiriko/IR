We study the Stephani quantum cosmological model in the presence of a
cosmological constant in radiation dominated Universe. In the present work the
Schutz's variational formalism which recovers the notion of time is applied.
This gives rise to Wheeler-DeWitt equations which can be cast in the form of
Schr\"odinger equations for the scale factor. We find their eigenvalues and
eigenfunctions by using the Spectral Method. Then we use the eigenfunctions in
order to construct wave packets and evaluate the time-dependent expectation
value of the scale factor, which is found to oscillate between non-zero finite
maximum and minimum values. Since the expectation value of the scale factor
never tends to the singular point, we have an initial indication that this
model may not have singularities at the quantum level.
