We discuss conditions under which a convex cone $\K\subset \R^{\Omega}$
admits a probability $m$ such that $\sup_{k\in \K} m(k)\leq0$. Based on these,
we also characterize linear functionals that admit the representation as
finitely additive expectations. A version of Riesz decomposition based on this
property is obtained as well as a characterisation of positive functionals on
the space of integrable functions
