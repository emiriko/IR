We study the effects of confinement between two parallel walls on a two
dimensional fluid with competing interactions which lead to the formation of
particle micro-domains at the thermodynamic equilibrium (microphases or
microseparation). The possibility to induce structural changes of the
morphology of the micro-domains is explored, under different confinement
conditions and temperatures. In presence of neutral walls, a switch from
stripes of particles to circular clusters (droplets) occurs as the temperature
decreases, which does not happen in bulk. While the passage from droplets to
stripes, as the density increases, is a well known phenomenon, the change of
the stripes into droplets as an effect of temperature is rather unexpected.
Depending on the wall separation and on the wall-fluid interaction parameters,
the stripes can switch from parallel to perpendicular to the walls and also a
mixed morphology can be stable.
