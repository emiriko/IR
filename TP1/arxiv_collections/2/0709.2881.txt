In this publication the construction of an automatic algorithm to subtract
infrared divergences in real QCD corrections through the Catani-Seymour dipole
subtraction method [arXiv:hep-ph/9605323] is reported. The resulting computer
code has been implemented in the matrix element generator AMEGIC++
[arXiv:hep-ph/0109036]. This will allow for the automatic generation of dipole
subtraction terms and their integrals over the one-parton emission phase space
for any given process. If the virtual matrix element is provided as well, this
then directly leads to an NLO QCD parton level event generator.
