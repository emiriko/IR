In this paper we study cosmological application of interacting holographic
dark energy density in the scalar-Gauss-Bonnet framework. We employ the
interacting holographic model of dark energy to obtain the equation of state
for the interacting holographic energy density in spatially flat universe. Our
calculation show, taking $\Omega_{\Lambda}=0.73$ for the present time, it is
possible to have $w_{\rm \Lambda}^{eff}$ crossing -1. This implies that one can
generate phantom-like equation of state from the interacting holographic dark
energy model in flat universe in the scalar-Gauss-Bonnet cosmology framework.
Then we reconstruct the potential of the scalar field.
