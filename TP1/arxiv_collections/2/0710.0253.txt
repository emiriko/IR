We give a new representation theoretic interpretation of the ring of
quasi-symmetric functions. This is obtained by showing that the super analogue
of the Gessel's fundamental quasi-symmetric function can be realized as the
character of an irreducible crystal for the Lie superalgebra $\frak{gl}_{n|n}$
associated to its non-standard Borel subalgebra with a maximal number of odd
isotropic simple roots. We also present an algebraic characterization of these
super quasi-symmetric functions.
