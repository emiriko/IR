Homogenous Boolean function is an essential part of any cryptographic system.
The ability to construct an optimized reversible circuits for homogeneous
Boolean functions might arise the possibility of building cryptographic system
on novel computing paradigms such as quantum computers. This paper shows a
factorization algorithm to synthesize such circuits.
