Direct detection experiments rule out fermion dark matter that is a chiral
representation of the electroweak gauge group. Non-chiral real, complex and
singlet representations, however, provide viable fermion dark matter
candidates. Although any one of these candidates will be virtually impossible
to detect at the LHC, it is shown that they may be detected at future planned
direct detection experiments. For the real case, an irreducible radiative
coupling to quarks may allow a detection. The complex case in general has an
experimentally ruled out tree-level coupling to quarks via Z-boson exchange.
However, in the case of two SU(2)_L doublets, a higher dimensional coupling to
the Higgs can suppress this coupling, and a remaining irreducible radiative
coupling may allow a detection. Singlet dark matter could be detected through a
coupling to quarks via Higgs exchange. Since all non-chiral dark matter can
have a coupling to the Higgs, at least some of its mass can be obtained from
electroweak symmetry breaking, and this mass is a useful characterization of
its direct detection cross-section.
