Let us assume that gravity is an emergent low-energy phenomenon arising from
a topologically stable defect in momentum space -- the Fermi point. What are
the consequences? We discuss the natural values of fermion masses and
cosmological constant; flatness of the Universe; bounds on Lorentz violation;
etc.
