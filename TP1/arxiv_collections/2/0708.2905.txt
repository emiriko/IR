The multiple point principle (MPP) can be used to suppress non--diagonal
flavour transitions and CP violation in the two Higgs doublet extension of the
standard model. We discuss the quasi--fixed point scenario in the MPP inspired
two Higgs doublet model which leads to the enhanced production of Higgs
particles at the LHC if the MPP scale is low.
