Discussion of the constancy, or otherwise, of the various so-called universal
constants which abound in physics has continued for many years. However,
relatively recent observations, which appear to indicate a variation in the
value of the fine structure constant, have reignited the subject. These
observations relate to quasars and that in itself raises questions. Also, since
many of the arguments utilise the Bekenstein-Hawking expression for the entropy
of a black hole, further controversy is introduced into the discussion
immediately. In what follows these two points will be examined and some less
well-known theoretical considerations introduced which, hopefully, will
instigate wider examination of this topic.
