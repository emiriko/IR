We present exact solutions to the Einstein-Maxwell system of equations in
spherically symmetric gravitational fields with a specified form of the
electric field intensity. The condition of pressure isotropy yields a
difference equation with variable, rational coefficients. In an earlier
treatment this condition was integrated by first transforming it to a
hypergeometric equation. We demonstrate that it is possible to obtain a more
general class of solutions to the Einstein-Maxwell system both in the form of
special functions and elementary functions. Our results contain particular
solutions found previously including models of charged relativistic spheres and
uncharged neutron star models.
