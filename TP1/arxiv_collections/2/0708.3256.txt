We compute the difference in decay widths of charged and neutral \rho(770)
vector mesons. The isospin breaking arising from mass differences of neutral
and charged \pi and \rho mesons, radiative corrections to \rho -> \pi\pi, and
the \rho -> \pi\pi\gamma decays are taken into account. It is found that the
width difference \Delta \Gamma_rho is very sensitive ot the isospin breaking in
the $\rho$ meson mass \Delta m_\rho. This result can be useful to test the
correlations observed between the values of these parameters extracted from
experimental data.
