We explore the possibility of studying $B\to\pi l\nu$ semileptonic decays at
large recoil momentum. Our methods include the use of a random-wall source for
the pion to reduce statistical errors, and different smearing functions are
used for the B meson to improve the overlap with the ground state. We observe,
in general, a factor of 3-4 improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio in
correlation functions if random-wall propagators are used.
