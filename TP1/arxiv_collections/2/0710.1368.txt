A first measurement of the average polarisation P_tau of tau leptons produced
in e+e- annihilation at energies significantly above the Z resonance is
presented. The polarisation is determined from the kinematic spectra of tau
hadronic decays. The measured value P_tau = -0.164 +/- 0.125 is consistent with
the Standard Model prediction for the mean LEP energy of 197 GeV.
