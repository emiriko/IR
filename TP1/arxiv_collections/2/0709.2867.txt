We observe the opto-mechanical multistability of a macroscopic torsion
balance oscillator. The torsion oscillator forms the moving mirror of a
hemi-spherical laser light cavity. When a laser beam is coupled into this
cavity, the radiation pressure force of the intra-cavity beam adds to the
torsion wire's restoring force, forming an opto-mechanical potential. In the
absence of optical damping, up to 23 stable trapping regions were observed due
to local light potential minima over a range of 4 micrometer oscillator
displacement. Each of these trapping positions exhibits optical spring
properties. Hysteresis behavior between neighboring trapping positions is also
observed. We discuss the prospect of observing opto-mechanical stochastic
resonance, aiming at enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in gravity
experiments.
