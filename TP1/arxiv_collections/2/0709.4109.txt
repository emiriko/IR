In recent experiments[e.g., Nature Physics 2, 332 (2006)], the enhanced light
deflection in an atomic ensemble due to inhomogeneous fields is demonstrated by
the electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) based mechanism. In this
paper, we explore an different mechanism for the similar phenomenon of the
enhanced light deflection. This mechanism is based on the coherent population
oscillation, which leads to the hole burning in the absorption spectrum. The
medium causing the deflection of probe light is an ensemble of two-level atoms
manipulated by a strong controlled field on the two photon resonances. In the
large detuning condition, the response of the medium to the pump field and
signal field is obtained with steady state approximation. And it is found that
after the probe field travels across the medium, the signal ray bends due to
the spatial-dependent profile of the control beam.
