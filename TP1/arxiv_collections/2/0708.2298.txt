We determine the average number $ \vartheta (N, K) $, of \textit{NK}-Kauffman
networks that give rise to the same binary function. We show that, for $ N \gg
1 $, there exists a connectivity critical value $ K_c $ such that $
\vartheta(N,K) \approx e^{\phi N} $ ($ \phi > 0 $) for $ K < K_c $ and
$\vartheta(N,K) \approx 1 $ for $ K > K_c $. We find that $ K_c $ is not a
constant, but scales very slowly with $ N $, as $ K_c \approx \log_2 \log_2 (2N
/ \ln 2) $. The problem of genetic robustness emerges as a statistical property
of the ensemble of \textit{NK}-Kauffman networks and impose tight constraints
in the average number of epistatic interactions that the genotype-phenotype map
can have.
