The Chalker-Coddington network model is often used to describe the transport
properties of quantum Hall systems. By adding an extra channel to this model,
we introduce an asymmetric model with profoundly different transport
properties. We present a numerical analysis of these transport properties and
consider the relevance for realistic systems.
