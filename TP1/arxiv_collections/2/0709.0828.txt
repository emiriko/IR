Fano Resonances are a new continuum excitation mode in light exotic nuclei.
By the QPC model we explain these sharp and asymmetric structures as due to the
coupling of a single particle elastic channel to the closed core-excited
channels. Theoretical model calculations are compared for 15C, 17C and 19C. The
theoretical results for 15C are in qualitative agreement with the experimental
spectrum.
