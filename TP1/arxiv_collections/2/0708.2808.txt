I discuss the relation between inclusive and exclusive dynamics suggested by
Bloom-Gilman duality. Duality implies the simultaneous applicability of two
distinct limits, the standard DIS limit of hard inclusive processes taken at
fixed xB and a limit where the hadronic mass is held fixed. I review
experimental evidence for the relevance of the fixed mass limit in inclusive
processes at high xF. Semi-local duality suggests that inclusive and exclusive
processes occur on the same target Fock states. DIS scaling then implies that
the Fock states contributing to hard exclusive processes have a large
transverse size, i.e., that the hard scattering occurs off a single parton
which carries a large fraction of the hadron momentum.
