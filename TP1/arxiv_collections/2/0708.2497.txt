We study existence, uniqueness, semi-group property, and a priori estimates
for solutions for backward parabolic Ito equations in domains with boundary. We
study also duality between forward and backward equations. The semi-group for
backward equations is established in the form of some anti-causality. The
novelty is that the semi-group property involves the diffusion term that is a
part of the solution.
