We assess the theoretical uncertainties on the total charm cross section. We
discuss the importance of the quark mass, the scale choice and the parton
densities on the estimate of the uncertainty. We conclude that due to the small
charm quark mass, which amplifies the effect of the other parameters in the
calculation, the uncertainty on the total charm cross section is difficult to
quantify.
