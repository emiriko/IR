We describe some basic facts about the weak subintegral closure of ideals in
both the algebraic and complex-analytic settings. We focus on the analogy
between results on the integral closure of ideals and modules and the weak
subintegral closure of an ideal. We start by giving a geometric interpretation
of the Reid-Roberts-Singh criterion for when an element is weakly subintegral
over a subring. We give new characterizations of the weak subintegral closure
of an ideal. We associate with an ideal $I$ of a ring $A$ an ideal $I_>$, which
consists of all elements of $A$ such that $v(a)>v(I)$, for all Rees valuations
$v$ of $I$. The ideal $I_>$ plays an important role in conditions from
stratification theory such as Whitney's condition A and Thom's condition $A_f$
and is contained in every reduction of $I$. We close with a valuative criterion
for when an element is in the weak subintegral closure of an ideal. For this,
we introduce a new closure operation for a pair of modules, which we call
relative closure.
