We study the SU(4) Kondo effect in carbon nanotube quantum dots, where doubly
degenerate orbitals form 4-electron ``shells''. The SU(4) Kondo behavior is
investigated for one, two and three electrons in the topmost shell. While the
Kondo state of two electrons is quenched by magnetic field, in case of an odd
number of electrons two types of SU(2) Kondo effect may survive. Namely, the
spin SU(2) state is realized in the magnetic field parallel to the nanotube
(inducing primarily orbital splitting). Application of the perpendicular field
(inducing Zeeman splitting) results in the orbital SU(2) Kondo effect.
