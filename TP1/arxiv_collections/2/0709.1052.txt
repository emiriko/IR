A simple explanation of the fact that light magnetic monopoles have not been
observed at accelerator experiments is given. It is based on a possibility of
violation of C invariance in the electromagnetic interactions. Because of the
difficulty of monopole registration, two interconnected problems arise: to
formulate a theory describing monopole production (it should include a new
force beyond the Standard Model of electroweak interaction), and to point the
way to monopole observation. We consider a possibility, closely related to some
experiments, of a modification of life time of radioactive elements by magnetic
monopoles. The first part of the article is devoted to purely electromagnetic
impact of monopoles, caused by the vertex M --> M + gamma. The second part,
more speculative one, is based on experimental evidences in favour of the
existence of some axial vector currents, responsible for a new force, which can
stimulate, or suppress, decays of radioactive elements.
