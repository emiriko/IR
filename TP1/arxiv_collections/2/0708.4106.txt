We have applied the quantum Monte Carlo method and tight-binding modelling to
calculate the binding energy of biexcitons in semiconductor carbon nanotubes
for a wide range of diameters and chiralities. For typical nanotube diameters
we find that biexciton binding energies are much larger than previously
predicted from variational methods, which easily brings the biexciton binding
energy above the room temperature threshold.
