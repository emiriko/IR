In recent years two nonlinear dispersive partial differential equations have
attracted a lot of attention due to their integrable structure. We prove that
both equations arise in the modeling of the propagation of shallow water waves
over a flat bed. The equations capture stronger nonlinear effects than the
classical nonlinear dispersive Benjamin-Bona-Mahoney and Korteweg-de Vries
equations. In particular, they accomodate wave breaking phenomena.
