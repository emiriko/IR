Results of first-principles electronic structure calculations for the
isotypic compounds GdAuX (ZrNiAl type, X = Mg, Cd, and In) are presented. We
report on a systematic examination of the electronic structure and nature of
the bonding in these intermetallics. Our calculations indicate a metallic state
for all of the compounds. We find that the indium in GdAuIn and magnesium in
GdAuMg have significant bonding interactions with Au. We have also identified
In s lone pair in GdAuIn has more localized behaviour as compared with Mg s in
GdAuMg. The magnetic properties are well described within the local density
approximation.
