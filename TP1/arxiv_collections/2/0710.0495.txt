The lineshape in an auto-oscillator with a large nonlinear frequency shift in
the presence of thermal noise is calculated. Near the generation threshold,
this lineshape becomes strongly non-Lorentzian, broadened, and asymmetric. A
Lorentzian lineshape is recovered far below and far above threshold, which
suggests that lineshape distortions provide a signature of the generation
threshold. The theory developed adequately describes the observed behavior of a
strongly nonlinear spin-torque nano-oscillator.
