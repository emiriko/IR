We examine the allowed mass range of the lightest neutralino within the
Minimal Non--minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model. Being absolutely stable if
R-parity is conserved this lightest neutralino is a candidate for the dark
matter of the universe. We establish the theoretical upper bound on the
lightest neutralino mass and obtain an approximate solution for this mass.
