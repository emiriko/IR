We present the calculations of the next-to-leading order (NLO) QCD
corrections to the inclusive total cross sections for the associated production
of the $W^{\pm}H^{\mp}$ through $b\bar{b}$ annihilation in the Minimal
Supersymmetric Standard Model at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. The NLO QCD
corrections can either enhance or reduce the total cross sections, but they
generally efficiently reduce the dependence of the total cross sections on the
renormalization/factorization scale. The magnitude of the NLO QCD corrections
is about 10% in most of the parameter space and can reach 15% in some parameter
regions. We also show the Monte Carlo simulation results for the
$2j+\tau_{jet}+\not{p}_{T}$ signature from the $W^{\pm}$ and the $H^{\mp}$
decays including the NLO QCD effects, and find an observable signal at a
$5\sigma$ level in some parameter region of the minimal supergravity model.
