Low-order quantum resonances manifested by directed currents have been
realized with cold atoms. Here we show that by increasing the strength of an
experimentally achievable delta-kicking ratchet potential, quantum resonances
of a very high order may naturally emerge and can induce larger ratchet
currents than low-order resonances, with the underlying classical limit being
fully chaotic. The results offer a means of controlling quantum transport of
cold atoms.
