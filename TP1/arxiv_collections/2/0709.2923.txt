This letter reports telecom-band sequential time-bin entangled photon-pair
generation at a repetition rate of 10 GHz in periodically-poled
reverse-proton-exchange lithium niobate waveguides based on mode
demultiplexing. With up-conversion single-photon detectors, we observed a
two-photon-interference-fringe visibility of 85.32% without subtraction of
accidental noise contributions, which can find broad application in quantum
information and quantum entanglement research.
