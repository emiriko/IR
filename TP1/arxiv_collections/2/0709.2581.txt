X-ray spectroscopy measurements have been performed on a series of Pt/Co/AlOx
trilayers to investigate the role of Co oxidation in the perpendicular magnetic
anisotropy of the Co/AlOx interface. It is observed that high temperature
annealing modifies the magnetic properties of the Co layer, inducing an
enhancement of the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. The microscopic
structural properties are analyzed via X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy, X-ray
Magnetic Circular Dichroism and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy measurements.
It is shown that annealing enhances the amount of interfacial oxide, which may
be at the origin of a strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy.
