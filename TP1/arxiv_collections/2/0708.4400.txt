This paper concerns a specific class of strict standard episturmian words
whose directive words resemble those of characteristic Sturmian words. In
particular, we explicitly determine all integer powers occurring in such
infinite words, extending recent results of Damanik and Lenz (2003), who
studied powers in Sturmian words. The key tools in our analysis are canonical
decompositions and a generalization of singular words, which were originally
defined for the ubiquitous Fibonacci word. Our main results are demonstrated
via some examples, including the $k$-bonacci word: a generalization of the
Fibonacci word to a $k$-letter alphabet ($k\geq2$).
