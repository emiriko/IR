We study the spatial distribution of the Kondo screening cloud. We find that
in 3 D the spatial range of the cloud is limited to distances of the order of
the Fermi wavelength due to angular dispersion effects. In lower dimensions
this effect is less important and thus the Kondo length determines the
localization of the cloud around the magnetic impurity. We clarify the role of
the Kondo cloud in the impurity-impurity interactions: the hole coherence
factor of the Kondo-doublet interaction is proportional to the amplitude of the
Kondo cloud. We single out an experimental setup in which the Kondo cloud could
be directly measured.
