Joint signal-idler photoelectron distributions of twin beams containing
several tens of photons per mode have been measured recently. Exploiting a
microscopic quantum theory for joint quasi-distributions in parametric
down-conversion developed earlier we characterize properties of twin beams in
terms of quasi-distributions using experimental data. Negative values as well
as oscillating behaviour in quantum region are characteristic for the
subsequently determined joint signal-idler quasi-distributions of integrated
intensities. Also the conditional and difference photon-number distributions
are shown to be sub-Poissonian and sub-shot-noise, respectively.
