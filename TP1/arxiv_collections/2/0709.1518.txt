By means of the density matrix renormalization group technique, the scaling
relation of the fidelity susceptibility proposed recently is verified for the
spin-one XXZ spin chain with an on-site anisotropic term. Moreover, from the
results of both the fidelity susceptibility and the entanglement entropy, the
critical points and some of the corresponding critical exponents are determined
through a proper finite-size scaling analysis, and these values agree with the
findings in the literature. Thus our work provides a numerical support of the
use of the fidelity in detecting quantum phase transitions.
