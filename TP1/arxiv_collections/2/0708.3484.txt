We consider a lightcone wrapped supermembrane compactified on 2-torus in the
matrix regularization. We examine the double dimensional reduction technique
and deduce the free matrix string of (p,q)-string in type IIB superstring
theory explicitly from the matrix-regularized wrapped supermembrane. In
addition we obtain the (2+1)-dimensional super Yang-Mills action in curved
background. We also examine the duality.
