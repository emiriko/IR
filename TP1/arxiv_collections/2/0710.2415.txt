Several extended supersymmetric models, motivated by either grand
unification, or by neutrino mass generation, predict light doubly charged
higgsinos. We study the production of a single doubly charged higgsino and its
decay channels at the International Linear Collider (ILC) operating in the e-e-
mode. We analyze the production cross section for e-e- -->
tilde{Delta}^{--}_{L,R} chi^0_1 as a function of different kinematic variables,
followed by the decay, through several channels, of the doubly charged higgsino
into a final state of two leptons plus missing energy. We include the standard
model background and discuss how kinematic cuts could be used effectively to
limit this background. Single production of these exotics could provide a
spectacular signal for a new underlying symmetry and for physics beyond the
minimal supersymmetric standard model.
