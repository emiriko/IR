Existing solar energy application systems use small fraction of full spectrum
of solar energy. So attempts are made to show how full spectrum solar energy
can be used for diffused and beamed form of incident solar energy. Luminescent
Solar Concentrator (LSC) principle with optical fibre in diffused sun light and
dielectric mirror separation technique with optical fibre in beamed form are
discussed. Comparison of both the cases are done.
