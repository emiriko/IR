For Si and Ge nanocrystals (NCs) embedded in wide band-gap matrices, Auger
recombination (AR) and carrier multiplication (CM) lifetimes are computed
exactly in a three-dimensional real space grid using empirical pseudopotential
wave functions. Our results in support of recent experimental data offer new
predictions. We extract simple Auger constants valid for NCs. We show that both
Si and Ge NCs can benefit from photovoltaic efficiency improvement via CM due
to the fact that under an optical excitation exceeding twice the band gap
energy, the electrons gain lion's share from the total excess energy and can
cause a CM. We predict that CM becomes especially efficient for hot electrons
with an excess energy of about 1 eV above the CM threshold.
