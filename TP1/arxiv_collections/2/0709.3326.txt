We propose a set of thermodynamic guidelines aimed at facilitating more
robust screening of hydrogen storage reactions. The utility of the guidelines
is illustrated by reassessing the validity of reactions recently proposed in
the literature, and through vetting a list of more than 20 candidate reactions
based on destabilized LiBH4 and Ca(BH4)2 borohydrides. Our analysis reveals
several new reactions having both favorable thermodynamics and relatively high
hydrogen densities (5-9 wt.% H2 & 85-100 g H2 /L), and demonstrates that
chemical intuition alone is not sufficient to identify valid reaction pathways.
