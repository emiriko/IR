Ultrafast relaxation dynamics of an athermal electron distribution is
investigated in silver films using a femtosecond pump-probe technique with 18
fs pulses in off-resonant conditions. The results yield evidence for an
increase with time of the electron-gas energy loss rate to the lattice and of
the free electron damping during the early stages of the electron-gas
thermalization. These effects are attributed to transient alterations of the
electron average scattering processes due to the athermal nature of the
electron gas, in agreement with numerical simulations.
