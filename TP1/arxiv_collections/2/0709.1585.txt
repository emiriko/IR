The high lattice mismatched SiC/Si(001) interface was investigated by means
of combined classical and ab initio molecular dynamics. Among the several
configurations analyzed, a dislocation network pinned at the interface was
found to be the most efficient mechanism for strain relief. A detailed
description of the dislocation core is given, and the related electronic
properties are discussed for the most stable geometry: we found interface
states localized in the gap that may be a source of failure of electronic
devices.
