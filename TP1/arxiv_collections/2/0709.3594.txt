The protection of any electrical installation is one of the most important
considerations in the field of electrical engineering. The electrical
installation should be protected against hazards such as overload current and
short circuit current conditions. The protection devices studied in this paper
are the Miniature Circuit Breaker (MCB) and the High Rupturing Capacity (HRC)
Fuse. Using a new tool known as the 3-AND Convergence Classifier, it was
observed that the MCB is the most reliable in terms of offering protection
against the damage caused by overload currents and the destruction caused by
short circuit currents.
