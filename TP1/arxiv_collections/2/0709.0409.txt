Positioning 3R manipulators may have two or four inverse kinematic solutions
(IKS). This paper derives a necessary and sufficient condition for 3R
positioning manipulators with orthogonal joint axes to have four distinct IKS.
We show that the transition between manipulators with 2 and 4 IKS is defined by
the set of manipulators with a quadruple root of their inverse kinematics. The
resulting condition is explicit and states that the last link length of the
manipulator must be greater than a quantity that depends on three of its
remaining DH-parameters. This result is of interest for the design of new
manipulators.
