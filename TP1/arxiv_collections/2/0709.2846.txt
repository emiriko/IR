Calculations of frequencies of the lattice and surface oscillations of
organic nano-crystals are carried out. As the sample the para-dichlorobenzol
has been chosen. Change of spectra of oscillations from the sizes of
nano-particles is found. It is shown that with the reduction of the sizes of
nano-particles a spectrum of the surface oscillations prevailing. Calculations
have shown that for the correct interpretation of the observational spectra it
is necessary to consider orientation disorder of the surface molecules and
presence of vacancies in nano-particle volume.
