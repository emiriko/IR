A general method for the derivation of asymptotic nonlinear shallow water and
deep water models is presented. Starting from a general dimensionless version
of the water-wave equations, we reduce the problem to a system of two equations
on the surface elevation and the velocity potential at the free surface. These
equations involve a Dirichlet-Neumann operator and we show that all the
asymptotic models can be recovered by a simple asymptotic expansion of this
operator, in function of the shallowness parameter (shallow water limit) or the
steepness parameter (deep water limit). Based on this method, a new
two-dimensional fully dispersive model for small wave steepness is also
derived, which extends to uneven bottom the approach developed by Matsuno
\cite{matsuno3} and Choi \cite{choi}. This model is still valid in shallow
water but with less precision than what can be achieved with Green-Naghdi
model, when fully nonlinear waves are considered. The combination, or the
coupling, of the new fully dispersive equations with the fully nonlinear
shallow water Green-Naghdi equations represents a relevant model for describing
ocean wave propagation from deep to shallow waters.
