We place limits on scalar and vector unparticle couplings to electrons and
neutrinos using data from reactor neutrino experiments originally designed to
search for neutrino magnetic moment. Upper bounds on Standard Model
lepton-scalar unparticle and lepton-vector unparticle couplings $\lambda_0$,
and $\lambda_1$ are given for various values of the unparticle mass dimension
d, and the unparticle energy scale $\Lambda_{\cal U}$. Especially for smaller
values of the mass dimension d (1 <d <1.3) these bounds are very significant
and comparable to those obtained from production rates at high energy
colliders. These bounds are also similar to those obtained by the analysis of
the absence of the decay of the low-energy solar and reactor neutrinos.
