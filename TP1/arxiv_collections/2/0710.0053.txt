Twin entangled beams produced by single-pass parametric down-conversion (PDC)
offer the opportunity to detect weak amount of absorption with an improved
sensitivity with respect to standard techniques which make use of classical
light sources. We propose a differential measurement scheme which exploits the
spatial quantum correlation of type II PDC to image a weak amplitude object
with a sensitivity beyond the standard quantum limit imposed by shot-noise.
