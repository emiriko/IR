We review some of the well-known features of quantum cosmology, such as the
factor ordering problem, the wave function and the density matrix, for a dark
energy dominated universe, where analytical solutions can be obtained. For the
particular case of the phantom universe, we suggest a quantum system in which
the usual notion of locality (non-locality) of quantum information theory have
to be extended. In that case, we deal also with a quantum description where the
existence of a non-chronal region around the big rip singularity is explicitly
accounted for.
