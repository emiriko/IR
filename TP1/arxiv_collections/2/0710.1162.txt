We compute here the Yang-Mills effective action on Moyal space by integrating
over the scalar fields in a noncommutative scalar field theory with harmonic
term, minimally coupled to an external gauge potential. We also explain the
special regularisation scheme chosen here and give some links to the Schwinger
parametric representation. Finally, we discuss the results obtained: a
noncommutative possibly renormalisable Yang-Mills theory.
