The spectrum of masses from a lattice QCD simulation may be found by fitting
exponential functions to correlators of operators possessing the quantum
numbers of the particles of interest. The ability of evolutionary algorithms to
find globally optimized solutions containing a variable number of states across
multiple data sets is exploited to provide a promising solution to the problem
of finding these fits.
