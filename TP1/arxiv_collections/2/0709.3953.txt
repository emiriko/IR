We apply the tropical intersection theory developed by L. Allermann and J.
Rau to compute intersection products of tropical Psi-classes on the moduli
space of rational tropical curves. We show that in the case of zero-dimensional
(stable) intersections, the resulting numbers agree with the intersection
numbers of Psi-classes on the moduli space of n-marked rational curves computed
in algebraic geometry.
