We show how to freeze distributed entanglement that has been created from the
natural dynamics of spin chain systems. The technique that we propose simply
requires single-qubit operations and isolates the entanglement in specific
qubits at the ends of branches. Such frozen entanglement provides a useful
resource, for example for teleportation or distributed quantum processing. The
scheme can be applied to a wide range of systems -- including actual spin
systems and alternative qubit embodiments in strings of quantum dots, molecules
or atoms.
