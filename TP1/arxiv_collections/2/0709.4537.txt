We introduce a new class of polynomials $\{P_{n}\}$, that we call polar
Legendre polynomials, they appear as solutions of an inverse Gauss problem of
equilibrium position of a field of forces with $n+1$ unit masses. We study
algebraic, differential and asymptotic properties of this class of polynomials,
that are simultaneously orthogonal with respect to a differential operator and
a discrete-continuous Sobolev type inner product.
