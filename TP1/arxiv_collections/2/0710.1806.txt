The complex oxide Pb(0.55)Cd(0.45)V(2)O(5) was synthesized and investigated
by means of X-ray powder diffraction, electron diffraction, magnetic
susceptibility measurements and band structure calculations. Its structure is
similar to that of MV(2)O(5) compounds (M = Na, Ca) giving rise to a spin
system of coupled S=1/2 two-leg ladders. Magnetic susceptibility measurements
reveal a spin gap-like behavior with \Delta ~ 270 K and a spin singlet ground
state. Band structure calculations suggest Pb(0.55)Cd(0.45)V(2)O(5) to be a
system of weakly coupled dimers in perfect agreement with the experimental
data. Pb(0.55)Cd(0.45)V(2)O(5) provides an example of the modification of the
spin system in layered vanadium oxides by cation substitution. Simple
correlations between the cation size, geometrical parameters and exchange
integrals for the MV(2)O(5)-type oxides are established and discussed.
