The conductance through a semi-infinite one-dimensional wire, partly embedded
in a superconducting bulk electrode, is studied. When the electron-electron
interactions within the wire are strongly repulsive, the wire effectively
decouples from the superconductor. If they are moderately or weakly repulsive,
the proximity of the superconductor induces superconducting order in the
segment of the wire embedded in it. In this case it is shown that the
conductance exhibits a crossover from conductive to insulating behavior as the
temperature is lowered down. The characteristic crossover temperature of this
transition has a stretched exponential dependence on the length of the part of
the wire embedded in the superconductor. The amount of this stretch is
determined by the nature of the electron interactions within the wire.
