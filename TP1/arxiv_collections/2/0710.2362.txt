An algorithm is presented here to get more detailed information, of mixed
culture type, based exclusively on the biomass concentration data for
fermentation processes. The analysis is performed with only the on-line
measurements of the redox potential being available. It is a two-step procedure
which includes an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) that relates the redox
potential to the biomass concentrations in the first step. Next, a multifractal
wavelet analysis is performed using the biomass estimates of the process. In
this context, our results show that the redox potential is a valuable indicator
of microorganism metabolic activity during the spontaneous fermentation. In
this paper, the detailed design of the multifractal wavelet analysis is
presented, as well as its direct experimental application at the laboratory
level
