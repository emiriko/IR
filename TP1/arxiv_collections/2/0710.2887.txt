ICOOOLPS'2006 was the first edition of ECOOP-ICOOOLPS workshop. It intended
to bring researchers and practitioners both from academia and industry
together, with a spirit of openness, to try and identify and begin to address
the numerous and very varied issues of optimization. This succeeded, as can be
seen from the papers, the attendance and the liveliness of the discussions that
took place during and after the workshop, not to mention a few new cooperations
or postdoctoral contracts. The 22 talented people from different groups who
participated were unanimous to appreciate this first edition and recommend that
ICOOOLPS be continued next year. A community is thus beginning to form, and
should be reinforced by a second edition next year, with all the improvements
this first edition made emerge.
