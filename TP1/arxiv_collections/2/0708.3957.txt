We present a complete calculation of the SU(3)-breaking corrections to the
hyperon vector form factors up to O(p^4) in covariant baryon chiral
perturbation theory. Partial higher-order contributions are obtained, and we
discuss chiral extrapolations of the vector form factor at zero momentum
transfer. In addition we derive low-energy theorems for the subleading moments
in hyperon decays, the weak Dirac radii and the weak anomalous magnetic
moments, up to O(p^4).
