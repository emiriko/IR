Aging effects in the relaxations of conductivity of a two-dimensional
electron system in Si have been studied as a function of carrier density. They
reveal an abrupt change in the nature of the glassy phase at the
metal-insulator transition (MIT): (a) while full aging is observed in the
insulating regime, there are significant departures from full aging on the
metallic side of the MIT, before the glassy phase disappears completely at a
higher density $n_g$; (b) the amplitude of the relaxations peaks just below the
MIT, and it is strongly suppressed in the insulating phase. Other aspects of
aging, including large non-Gaussian noise and similarities to spin glasses,
also have been discussed.
