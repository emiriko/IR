We provide further evidence that the canonical quantization of cosmological
models eliminates the classical Big Bang singularity, using the {\it
DeBroglie-Bohm} interpretation of quantum mechanics. The usual criterion for
absence of the Big Bang singularity in Friedmann-Robertson-Walker quantum
cosmological models is the non-vanishing of the expectation value of the scale
factor. We compute the `local expectation value' of the Ricci and Kretschmann
scalars, for some quantum FRW models. We show that they are finite for all
time. Since these scalars are elements of general scalar polynomials in the
metric and the Riemann tensor, this result indicates that, for the quantum
models treated here, the `local expectation value' of these general scalar
polynomials should be finite everywhere. Therefore, we have further evidence
that the quantization of the models treated here eliminates the classical Big
Bang singularity. PACS: 04.40.Nr, 04.60.Ds, 98.80.Qc.
