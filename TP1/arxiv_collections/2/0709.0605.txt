We argue that a system of ultracold bosonic atoms in a tilted optical lattice
can become superfluid in response to resonant AC forcing. Among others, this
allows one to prepare a Bose-Einstein condensate in a state associated with a
negative effective mass. Our reasoning is backed by both exact numerical
simulations for systems consisting of few particles, and by a theoretical
approach based on Floquet-Fock states.
