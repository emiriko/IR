In 2002 Biskup et al. [Europhys. Lett. 60, 21 (2002)] sketched a rigorous
proof for the behavior of the 2D Ising lattice gas, at a finite volume and a
fixed excess \delta M of particles (spins) above the ambient gas density
(spontaneous magnetisation). By identifying a dimensionless parameter \Delta
(\delta M) and a universal constant \Delta_c, they showed in the limit of large
system sizes that for \Delta < \Delta_c the excess is absorbed in the
background (``evaporated'' system), while for \Delta > \Delta_c a droplet of
the dense phase occurs (``condensed'' system).
  To check the applicability of the analytical results to much smaller,
practically accessible system sizes, we performed several Monte Carlo
simulations for the 2D Ising model with nearest-neighbour couplings on a square
lattice at fixed magnetisation M. Thereby, we measured the largest minority
droplet, corresponding to the condensed phase, at various system sizes (L=40,
>..., 640). With analytic values for for the spontaneous magnetisation m_0, the
susceptibility \chi and the Wulff interfacial free energy density \tau_W for
the infinite system, we were able to determine \lambda numerically in very good
agreement with the theoretical prediction.
  Furthermore, we did simulations for the spin-1/2 Ising model on a triangular
lattice and with next-nearest-neighbour couplings on a square lattice. Again,
finding a very good agreement with the analytic formula, we demonstrate the
universal aspects of the theory with respect to the underlying lattice. For the
case of the next-nearest-neighbour model, where \tau_W is unknown analytically,
we present different methods to obtain it numerically by fitting to the
distribution of the magnetisation density P(m).
