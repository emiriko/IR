We have developed a microcavity single-photon source based on a single
quantum dot within a planar cavity in which wet-oxidation of a high-aluminium
content layer provides lateral confinement of both the photonic mode and the
injection current. Lateral confinement of the optical mode in optically pumped
structures produces a strong enhancement of the radiative decay rate. Using
microcavity structures with doped contact layers, we demonstrate a
single-photon emitting diode where current may be injected into a single dot.
