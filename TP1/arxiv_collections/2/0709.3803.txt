Let G be a reductive linear algebraic group over an algebraically closed
field of characteristic p > 0. A subgroup of G is said to be separable in G if
its global and infinitesimal centralizers have the same dimension. We study the
interaction between the notion of separability and Serre's concept of
G-complete reducibility for subgroups of G. The separability hypothesis appears
in many general theorems concerning G-complete reducibility. We demonstrate
that many of these results fail without this hypothesis. On the other hand, we
prove that if G is a connected reductive group and p is very good for G, then
any subgroup of G is separable; we deduce that under these hypotheses on G, a
subgroup H of G is G-completely reducible provided the Lie algebra of G is
semisimple as an H-module.
  Recently, Guralnick has proved that if H is a reductive subgroup of G and C
is a conjugacy class of G, then the intersection of C and H is a finite union
of H-conjugacy classes. For generic p -- when certain extra hypotheses hold,
including separability -- this follows from a well-known tangent space argument
due to Richardson, but in general, it rests on Lusztig's deep result that a
connected reductive group has only finitely many unipotent conjugacy classes.
We show that the analogue of Guralnick's result is false if one considers
conjugacy classes of n-tuples of elements from H for n > 1.
