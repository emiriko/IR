Recent experiments undertaken by Caprez, Barwick, and Batelaan should clarify
the connections between classical and quantum theories in connection with the
Aharonov-Bohm phase shift. It is pointed out that resistive aspects for the
solenoid current carriers play a role in the classical but not the quantum
analysis for the phase shift. The observed absence of a classical lag effect
for a macroscopic solenoid does not yet rule out the possibility of a lag
explanation of the observed phase shift for a microscopic solenoid.
