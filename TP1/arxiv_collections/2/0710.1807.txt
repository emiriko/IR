The Liouville and first Bogoliubov hierarchy equations with derivatives of
noninteger order are derived. The fractional Liouville equation is obtained
from the conservation of probability to find a system in a fractional volume
element. This equation is used to obtain Bogoliubov hierarchy and fractional
kinetic equations with fractional derivatives. Statistical mechanics of
fractional generalization of the Hamiltonian systems is discussed. Liouville
and Bogoliubov equations with fractional coordinate and momenta derivatives are
considered as a basis to derive fractional kinetic equations. The
Fokker-Planck-Zaslavsky equation that has fractional phase-space derivatives is
obtained from fractional Bogoliubov equation. The linear fractional kinetic
equation for distribution of the charged particles is considered.
