In a classical spacetime satisfying Einstein's equation and the null
convergence condition, the same quantum mechanical effects that cause black
holes to have a temperature are found to imply, if joined to the macroscopic
nature of entropy, the covariant entropy bound in its generalized form. This is
obtained from thermodynamics, as applied across the local Rindler causal
horizon through every point p of the null hypersurfaces L the covariant entropy
bound refers to, in the direction of the null geodesics generating L.
