Theoretical studies of a planar tunnel junction between two superconductors
with antisymmetric spin-orbit coupling are presented. The half-space Green's
function for such a superconductor is determined. This is then used to derive
expressions for the dissipative current and the Josephson current of the
junction. Numerical results are presented in the case of the Rashba spin-orbit
coupling, relevant to the much studied compound CePt$_3$Si. Current-voltage
diagrams, differential conductance and the critical Josephson current are
presented for different crystallographic orientations and different weights of
singlet and triplet components of the pairing state. The main conclusion is
that Josephson junctions with different crystallographic orientations may
provide a direct connection between unconventional pairing in superconductors
of this kind and the absence of inversion symmetry in the crystal.
