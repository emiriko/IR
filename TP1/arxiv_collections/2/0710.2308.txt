Entangled photons can be generated "on demand" in a novel scheme involving
unitary time reordering of the photons emitted in a radiative decay cascade.
The scheme yields polarization entangled photon pairs, even though prior to
reordering the emitted photons carry significant "which path information" and
their polarizations are unentangled. This shows that quantum chronology can be
manipulated in a way that is lossless and deterministic (unitary). The theory
can, in principle, be tested and applied to the biexciton cascade in
semiconductor quantum dots.
