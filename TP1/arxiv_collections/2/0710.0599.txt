We have obtained spectra of second-harmonic generation, third harmonic
generation, and four-wave mixing from a fishnet metamaterial around its
magnetic resonance. The resonant behaviors are distinctly different from those
for ordinary materials. They result from the fact that the resonance is
plasmonic, and its enhancement appears through the local field in the
nanostructure.
