We use a renormalization group method to treat QCD-vacuum behavior specially
closer to the regime of asymptotic freedom. QCD-vacuum behaves effectively like
a "paramagnetic system" of a classical theory in the sense that virtual color
charges (gluons) emerges in it as a spin effect of a paramagnetic material when
a magnetic field aligns their microscopic magnetic dipoles. Due to that strong
classical analogy with the paramagnetism of Landau's theory,we will be able to
use a certain Landau effective action without temperature and phase transition
for just representing QCD-vacuum behavior at higher energies as being
magnetization of a paramagnetic material in the presence of a magnetic field
$H$. This reasoning will allow us to apply Thompson's approach to such an
action in order to extract an "effective susceptibility" ($\chi>0$) of
QCD-vacuum. It depends on logarithmic of energy scale $u$ to investigate
hadronic matter. Consequently we are able to get an ``effective magnetic
permeability" ($\mu>1$) of such a "paramagnetic vacuum". Actually,as QCD-vacuum
must obey Lorentz invariance,the attainment of $\mu>1$ must simply require that
the "effective electrical permissivity" is $\epsilon<1$ in such a way that
$\mu\epsilon=1$ ($c^2=1$). This leads to the anti-screening effect where the
asymptotic freedom takes place. We will also be able to extend our
investigation to include both the diamagnetic fermionic properties of
QED-vacuum (screening) and the paramagnetic bosonic properties of QCD-vacuum
(anti-screening) into the same formalism by obtaining a $\beta$-function at 1
loop,where both the bosonic and fermionic contributions are considered.
