We derive constraints on the statistics of the charge transfer between two
conductors in the model of arbitrary time-dependent instant scattering of
non-interacting fermions at zero temperature. The constraints are formulated in
terms of analytic properties of the generating function: its zeroes must lie on
the negative real axis. This result generalizes existing studies for scattering
by a time-independent scatterer under time-dependent bias voltage.
