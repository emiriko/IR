We investigated the effects of bulk scalar field in the braneworld
cosmological scenario. The Friedmann equations and acceleration condition in
presence of the bulk scalar field for a zero tension brane and cosmological
constant are studied. In DGP model the effective Einstein equation on the brane
is obtained with bulk scalar field. The rescaled bulk scalar field on the brane
in the DGP model behaves as an effective four dimensional field, thus standard
type cosmology is recovered. In present study of the DGP model, the late-time
accelerating phase of the universe can be explained .
