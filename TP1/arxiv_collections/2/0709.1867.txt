Status of the new experimental program to study hadron production in
hadron-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus collisions at the CERN SPS will be
presented. In particular, a detailed physics motivation and experimental
strategy will be given for the part of the program related to the physics of
strongly interacting matter: search for the critical point of strongly
interacting matter, study properties of the onset of deconfinement, and high
p_T measurements in p+p and p+A interactions. The planned measurements for the
neutrino T2K and cosmic-ray experiments will also be discussed.
