We experimentally investigate quadrature correlations between pump, signal,
and idler fields in an above-threshold optical parametric oscillator. We
observe new quantum correlations among the pump and signal or idler beams, as
well as among the pump and a combined quadrature of signal and idler beams. A
further investigation of unforeseen classical noise observed in this system is
presented, which hinders the observation of the recently predicted tripartite
entanglement. In spite of this noise, current results approach the limit
required to demonstrate three-color entanglement.
