A step towards a successful implementation of timeresolved digital in-line
holography with extreme ultraviolet radiation is presented. Ultrashort XUV
pulses are produced as high-order harmonics of a femtosecond laser and a
Schwarzschild objective is used to focus harmonic radiation at 38 nm and to
produce a strongly divergent reference beam for holographic recording.
Experimental holograms of thin wires are recorded and the objects
reconstructed. Descriptions of the simulation and reconstruction theory and
algorithms are also given. Spatial resolution of few hundreds of nm is
potentially achievable, and micrometer resolution range is demonstrated.
