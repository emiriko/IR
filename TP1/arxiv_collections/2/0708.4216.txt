Recently, observations of compact stars have provided new data of high
accuracy which put strong constraints on the high-density behaviour of the
equation of state of strongly interacting matter otherwise not accessible in
terrestrial laboratories. The evidence for neutron stars with high mass (M =2.1
+/- 0.2 M_sun for PSR J0751+1807) and large radii (R > 12 km for RX J1856-3754)
rules out soft equations of state and has provoked a debate whether the
occurence of quark matter in compact stars can be excluded as well. In this
contribution it is shown that modern quantum field theoretical approaches to
quark matter including color superconductivity and a vector meanfield allow a
microscopic description of hybrid stars which fulfill the new, strong
constraints. The deconfinement transition in the resulting stiff hybrid
equation of state is weakly first order so that signals of it have to be
expected due to specific changes in transport properties governing the
rotational and cooling evolution caused by the color superconductivity of quark
matter. A similar conclusion holds for the investigation of quark deconfinement
in future generations of nucleus-nucleus collision experiments at low
temperatures and high baryon densities such as CBM @ FAIR.
