In this paper we present a preliminary study for designing interactive
systems that are sensible to human emotions based on the body movements. To do
so, we first review the literature on the various approaches for defining and
characterizing human emotions. After justifying the adopted characterization
space for emotions, we then focus on the movement characteristics that must be
captured by the system for being able to recognize the human emotions.
