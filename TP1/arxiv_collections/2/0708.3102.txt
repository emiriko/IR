We investigate a recently proposed non-Markovian random walk model
characterized by loss of memories of the recent past and amnestically induced
persistence. We report numerical and analytical results showing the complete
phase diagram, consisting of 4 phases, for this system: (i) classical
nonpersistence, (ii) classical persistence (iii) log-periodic nonpersistence
and (iv) log-periodic persistence driven by negative feedback. The first two
phases possess continuous scale invariance symmetry, however log-periodicity
breaks this symmetry. Instead, log-periodic motion satisfies discrete scale
invariance symmetry, with complex rather than real fractal dimensions. We find
for log-periodic persistence evidence not only of statistical but also of
geometric self-similarity.
