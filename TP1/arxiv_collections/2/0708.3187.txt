We discuss the dynamic and structural properties of polynomial semigroups, a
natural extension of iteration theory to random (walk) dynamics, where the
semigroup $G$ of complex polynomials (under the operation of composition of
functions) is such that there exists a bounded set in the plane which contains
any finite critical value of any map $g \in G$. In general, the Julia set of
such a semigroup $G$ may be disconnected, and each Fatou component of such $G$
is either simply connected or doubly connected (\cite{Su01,Su9}). In this
paper, we show that for any two distinct Fatou components of certain types
(e.g., two doubly connected components of the Fatou set), the boundaries are
separated by a Cantor set of quasicircles (with uniform dilatation) inside the
Julia set of $G.$ Important in this theory is the understanding of various
situations which can and cannot occur with respect to how the Julia sets of the
maps $g \in G$ are distributed within the Julia set of the entire semigroup
$G$. We give several results in this direction and show how such results are
used to generate (semi) hyperbolic semigroups possessing this postcritically
boundedness condition.
