Using the action for the instanton representation of Plebanski gravity
(IRPG), we construct minisuperspace solutions restricted to diagonal variables.
We have treated the Euclidean signature case with zero cosmological constant,
depicting a gravitational analogy to free particle motion. This paper provides
a testing ground for the IRPG for a simple case, which will be extended to the
full theory in future work.
