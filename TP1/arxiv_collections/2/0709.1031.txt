Heretofore neglected decay modes of heavy MSSM Higgs bosons into a variety of
neutralino pairs may push the LHC discovery reach for these crucial elements of
an extended Higgs sector to nearly the TeV-scale -- if sparticle-sector MSSM
input parameters are favorable. This is well into the so-called decoupling
region, including moderate to low tan(beta) values, where no known signals
exist for said heavy Higgs bosons via decays involving solely SM daughter
particles, and the lighter h^0 mimics the lone SM Higgs boson. While the
expanse of the Higgs to sparticle discovery region is sensitive to a number of
MSSM parameters, including in particular those for the sleptons, its presence
is primarily linked to the gaugino inputs -- in fact, to just one parameter,
M_2, if gaugino unification is invoked. Thus consideration of high vs. low M_2
realms in the MSSM should be placed on a par with the extensive consideration
already given to high vs. low tan(beta) regimes.
