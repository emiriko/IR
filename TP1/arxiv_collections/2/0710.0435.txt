We study an exactly solvable model where an uniformly accelerated detector is
linearly coupled to a massless scalar field initially in the Minkowski vacuum.
Using the exact correlation functions we show that as soon as the coupling is
switched on one can see information flowing from the detector to the field and
propagating with the radiation into null infinity. By expressing the reduced
density matrix of the detector in terms of the two-point functions, we
calculate the purity function in the detector and study the evolution of
quantum entanglement between the detector and the field. Only in the ultraweak
coupling regime could some degree of recoherence in the detector appear at late
times, but never in full restoration. We explicitly show that under the most
general conditions the detector never recovers its quantum coherence and the
entanglement between the detector and the field remains large at late times. To
the extent this model can be used as an analog to the system of a black hole
interacting with a quantum field, our result seems to suggest in the prevalent
non-Markovian regime, assuming unitarity for the combined system, that black
hole information is not lost but transferred to the quantum field degrees of
freedom. Our combined system will evolve into a highly entangled state between
a remnant of large area (in Bekenstein's black hole atom analog) without any
information of its initial state, and the quantum field, now imbued with
complex information content not-so-easily retrievable by a local observer.
