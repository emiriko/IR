Let $G$ be a torsionfree compact $p$-adic analytic group. We give sufficient
conditions on $p$ and $G$ which ensure that the Iwasawa algebra $\Omega_G$ of
$G$ has no non-trivial two-sided reflexive ideals. Consequently, these
conditions imply that every nonzero normal element in $\Omega_G$ is a unit. We
show that these conditions hold in the case when $G$ is an open subgroup of
$\SL_2(\Zp)$ and $p$ is arbitrary. Using a previous result of the first author,
we show that there are only two prime ideals in $\Omega_G$ when $G$ is a
congruence subgroup of $\SL_2(\Zp)$: the zero ideal and the unique maximal
ideal. These statements partially answer some questions asked by the first
author and Brown.
