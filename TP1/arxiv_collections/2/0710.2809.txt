The LHC potential for a measurement of the Higgs boson coupling to the b
quark in the standard model is not well established yet. We show that requiring
a large transverse momentum photon in the light Higgs boson production via
vector-boson fusion (with subsequent H->bb decay) could provide a further
handle on the Hbb coupling determination, and on the measurement of the HWW
coupling as well.
