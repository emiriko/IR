Nucleation and growth of crystal in an oxide glass was studied in a Si B Al
Zr Nd Ca Na O system. The nucleation and growth process was monitored by
thermal analysis and isothermal experiments. For the Ca sample the
crystallization is homogeneous in the bulk showing a slow increase of
crystallinity as temperature increases. The Na rich sample on the other hand go
through several crystallization process in the bulk or from the surface,
leading to bigger crystals. The activation energy of the viscous flow and the
glass transition are of same magnitude when that of crystallization is a lot
smaller. Early diffusion of element is done with a mechanism different than the
configurational rearrangements of the liquid sate. The global density and small
shape of the crystals within the Ca rich matrix confirmed that it would be a
profitable waste form for minor actinides.
