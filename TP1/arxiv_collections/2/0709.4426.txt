Recent determinations of alphas(Mz) from the H1 and ZEUS Collaborations using
inclusive-jet cross-section measurements in neutral current deep inelastic
scattering at high Q2 are presented. A combined value of alphas(mz)=0.1198 +-
0.0019 (exp.) +- 0.0026 (th.) was obtained from these measurements. The
determinations of alphas at various scales clearly show the running of the
coupling from HERA jet data alone and in agreement with the prediction of QCD.
