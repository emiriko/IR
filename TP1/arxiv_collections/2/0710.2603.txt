We analyze dynamics of 3D coreless vortices in superfluid films covering
porous substrates. The 3D vortex dynamics is derived from the 2D dynamics of
the film. The motion of a 3D vortex is a sequence of jumps between neighboring
substrate cells, which can be described, nevertheless, in terms of
quasi-continuous motion with average vortex velocity. The vortex velocity is
derived from the dissociation rate of vortex-antivortex pairs in a 2D film,
which was developed in the past on the basis of the Kosterlitz-Thouless theory.
The theory explains the rotation-induced dissipation peak in torsion-oscillator
experiments on $^4$He films on rotating porous substrates and can be used in
the analysis of other phenomena related to vortex motion in films on porous
substrates.
