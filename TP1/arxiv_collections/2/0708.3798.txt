We propose an approach to optical imaging beyond the diffraction limit, based
on transformation optics in concentric circular cylinder domains. The resulting
systems allow image magnification and minimize reflection losses due to the
impedance matching at the input or output boundaries. While perfect impedance
matching at both surfaces can only be obtained in a system with
radius-dependent magnetic permeability, we demonstrate that comparable
performance can be achieved in an optimized non-magnetic design.
