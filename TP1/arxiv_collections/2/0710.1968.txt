We present recent results of the Landau gauge gluon and ghost propagators in
SU(3) pure gauge theory at Wilson \beta=5.7 for lattice sizes up to 80^4
corresponding to physical volumes up to (13.2 fm)^4. In particular, we focus on
finite-volume and Gribov copy effects. We employ a gauge fixing method that
combines a simulated annealing algorithm with finalizing overrelaxation. We
find the gluon propagator for the largest volumes and at q^2 ~ 0.01 GeV^2 to
become flat. Although not excluded by our data, there is still no clear
indication of a gluon propagator tending towards zero in the zero-momentum
limit. New data for the ghost propagator are reported, too.
