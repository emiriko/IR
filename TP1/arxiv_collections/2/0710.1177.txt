A new Monte-Carlo method for long-range interacting systems is presented.
This method consists of eliminating interactions stochastically with the
detailed balance condition satisfied. When a pairwise interaction $V_{ij}$ of a
$N$-particle system decreases with the distance as $r_{ij}^{-\alpha}$,
computational time per one Monte Carlo step is ${\cal O}(N)$ for $\alpha \ge d$
and ${\cal O}(N^{2-\alpha/d})$ for $\alpha < d$, where $d$ is the spatial
dimension. We apply the method to a two-dimensional magnetic dipolar system.
The method enables us to treat a huge system of $256^2$ spins with reasonable
computational time, and reproduces a circular order originated from long-range
dipolar interactions.
