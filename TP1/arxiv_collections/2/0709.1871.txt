This paper presents a study of accuracy issues in thermal modeling of high
power LED modules on system level. Both physical as well as numerical accuracy
issues are addressed. Incorrect physical assumptions may result in seemingly
correct, but erroneous results. It is therefore important to motivate the
underlying key physical assumptions of a thermal model. In this paper thermal
measurements are used to calibrate a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model
of a high power LED module model at a reference application condition, and to
validate it at other application conditions.
