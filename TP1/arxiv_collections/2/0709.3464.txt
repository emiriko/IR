A measurement of the double-differential $\pi^{\pm}$ production cross-section
in proton--carbon, proton--copper and proton--tin collisions in the range of
pion momentum $100 \MeVc \leq p < 800 \MeVc$ and angle $0.35 \rad \le \theta
<2.15 \rad$ is presented. The data were taken with the HARP detector in the T9
beam line of the CERN PS. The pions were produced by proton beams in a momentum
range from 3 \GeVc to 12 \GeVc hitting a target with a thickness of 5% of a
nuclear interaction length. The tracking and identification of the produced
particles was done using a small-radius cylindrical time projection chamber
(TPC) placed in a solenoidal magnet. An elaborate system of detectors in the
beam line ensured the identification of the incident particles. Results are
shown for the double-differential cross-sections at four incident proton beam
momenta (3 \GeVc, 5 \GeVc, 8 \GeVc and 12 \GeVc).
