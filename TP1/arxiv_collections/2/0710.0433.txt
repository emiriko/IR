An important instance of Rota-Baxter algebras from their quantum field theory
application is the ring of Laurent series with a suitable projection. We view
the ring of Laurent series as a special case of generalized power series rings
with exponents in an ordered monoid. We study when a generalized power series
ring has a Rota-Baxter operator and how this is related to the ordered monoid.
