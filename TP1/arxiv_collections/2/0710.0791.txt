The hypothesis of coupling between spin and rotation introduced long ago by
Mashhoon is examined in the context of "1+3" and "3+1" space-time splitting
techniques, either in special or in general relativity. Its content is
discussed in terms of classical (Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon-Souriou model) as
well as quantum physics (Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation for the Dirac field in
an external field), reviewing and discussing all the relevant theoretical
literature concerning the existence of such effect. Some original contributions
are also included.
