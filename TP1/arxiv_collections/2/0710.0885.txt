The Ghirardi-Rimini-Weber (GRW) theory of spontaneous wave function collapse
is known to provide a quantum theory without observers, in fact two different
ones by using either the matter density ontology (GRWm) or the flash ontology
(GRWf). Both theories are known to make predictions different from those of
quantum mechanics, but the difference is so small that no decisive experiment
can as yet be performed. While some testable deviations from quantum mechanics
have long been known, we provide here something that has until now been
missing: a formalism that succinctly summarizes the empirical predictions of
GRWm and GRWf. We call it the GRW formalism. Its structure is similar to that
of the quantum formalism but involves different operators. In other words, we
establish the validity of a general algorithm for directly computing the
testable predictions of GRWm and GRWf. We further show that some well-defined
quantities cannot be measured in a GRWm or GRWf world.
