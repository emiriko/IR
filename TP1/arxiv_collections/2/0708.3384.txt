Existing algorithms for the optimal control of quantum observables are based
on locally optimal steps in the space of control fields, or as in the case of
genetic algorithms, operate on the basis of heuristics that do not explicitly
take into account details pertaining to the geometry of the search space. We
present globally efficient algorithms for quantum observable control that
follow direct or close-to-direct paths in the domain of unitary dynamical
propagators, based on partial reconstruction of these propagators at successive
points along the search trajectory through orthogonal observable measurements.
These algorithms can be implemented experimentally and offer an alternative to
the adaptive learning control approach to optimal control experiments (OCE).
Their performance is compared to that of local gradient-based control
optimization.
