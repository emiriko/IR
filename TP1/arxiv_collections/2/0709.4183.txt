Half-metallic ferromagnets and especially the full-Heusler alloys containing
Co are at the center of scientific research due to their potential applications
in spintronics. For realistic devices it is important to control accurately the
creation of defects in these alloys. We review some of our late results on the
role of defects and impurities in these compounds. More precisely we present
results for the following cases (i) doping and disorder in Co$_2$Cr(Mn)Al(Si)
alloys, (ii) half-metallic ferrimagnetism appeared due to the creation of
Cr(Mn) antisites in these alloys, (iii) Co-doping in Mn$_2$VAl(Si) alloys
leading to half-metallic antiferromagnetism, and finally (iv) the occurrence of
vacancies in the full-Heusler alloys containing Co and Mn. These results are
susceptible of encouraging further theoretical and experimental research in the
properties of these compounds.
