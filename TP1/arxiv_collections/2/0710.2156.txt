Increasingly, business projects are ephemeral. New Business Intelligence
tools must support ad-lib data sources and quick perusal. Meanwhile, tag clouds
are a popular community-driven visualization technique. Hence, we investigate
tag-cloud views with support for OLAP operations such as roll-ups, slices,
dices, clustering, and drill-downs. As a case study, we implemented an
application where users can upload data and immediately navigate through its ad
hoc dimensions. To support social networking, views can be easily shared and
embedded in other Web sites. Algorithmically, our tag-cloud views are
approximate range top-k queries over spontaneous data cubes. We present
experimental evidence that iceberg cuboids provide adequate online
approximations. We benchmark several browser-oblivious tag-cloud layout
optimizations.
