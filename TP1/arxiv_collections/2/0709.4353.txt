Games with incomplete information are formulated in a multi-sector
probability matrix formalism that can cope with quantum as well as classical
strategies. An analysis of classical and quantum strategy in a multi-sector
extension of the game of Battle of Sexes clarifies the two distinct roles of
nonlocal strategies, and establish the direct link between the true quantum
gain of game's payoff and the breaking of Bell inequalities.
