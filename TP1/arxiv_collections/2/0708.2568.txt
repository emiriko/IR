The supergravity description of various configurations of supersymmetric
M-fivebranes wrapped on calibrated cycles of special holonomy manifolds is
studied. The description is provided by solutions of eleven-dimensional
supergravity which interpolate smoothly between a special holonomy manifold and
an event horizon with Anti-de Sitter geometry. For known examples of Anti-de
Sitter solutions, the associated special holonomy metric is derived. One
explicit Anti-de Sitter solution of M-theory is so treated for fivebranes
wrapping each of the following cycles: K\"{a}hler cycles in Calabi-Yau two-,
three- and four-folds; special lagrangian cycles in three- and four-folds;
associative three- and co-associative four-cycles in $G_2$ manifolds; complex
lagrangian four-cycles in $Sp(2)$ manifolds; and Cayley four-cycles in
$Spin(7)$ manifolds. In each case, the associated special holonomy metric is
singular, and is a hyperbolic analogue of a known metric. The analogous known
metrics are respectively: Eguchi-Hanson, the resolved conifold and the
four-fold resolved conifold; the deformed conifold, and the Stenzel four-fold
metric; the Bryant-Salamon-Gibbons-Page-Pope $G_2$ metrics on an $\mathbb{R}^4$
bundle over $S^3$, and an $\mathbb{R}^3$ bundle over $S^4$ or $\mathbb{CP}^2$;
the Calabi hyper-K\"{a}hler metric on $T^*\mathbb{CP}^2$; and the
Bryant-Salamon-Gibbons-Page-Pope $Spin(7)$ metric on an $\mathbb{R}^4$ bundle
over $S^4$. By the AdS/CFT correspondence, a conformal field theory is
associated to each of the new singular special holonomy metrics, and defines
the quantum gravitational physics of the resolution of their singularities.
