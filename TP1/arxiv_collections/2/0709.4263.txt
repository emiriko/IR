Kwasniewski's cobweb posets uniquely represented by directed acyclic graphs
are such a generalization of the Fibonacci tree that allows joint combinatorial
interpretation for all of them under admissibility condition. This
interpretation was derived in the source papers and it entailes natural
enquieres already formulated therein. In our note we response to one of those
problems. This is a tiling problem. Our observations on tiling problem include
proofs of tiling's existence for some cobweb-admissible sequences. We show also
that not all cobwebs admit tiling as defined below.
