The Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) is one of the most popular games of the Game
Theory due to the emergence of cooperation among competitive rational players.
In this paper, we present the PD played in cells of one-dimension cellular
automata, where the number of possible neighbors that each cell interacts, z,
can vary. This makes possible to retrieve results obtained previously in
regular lattices. Exhaustive exploration of the parameters space is presented.
We show that the final state of the system is governed mainly by the number of
neighbors z and there is a drastic difference if it is even or odd.
