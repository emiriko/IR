The rotated multipliers method is performed in the case of the boundary
stabilization by means of a(linear or non-linear) Neumann feedback. this method
leads to new geometrical cases concerning the "active" part of the boundary
where the feedback is apllied. Due to mixed boundary conditions, these cases
generate singularities. Under a simple geometrical conditon concerning the
orientation of boundary, we obtain a stabilization result in both cases.
