NLSP - LSP decays could have dramatic influence on SUSY phenomenology at LHC.
NLSP could have significant lifetime and could be charged. In at least two
scenarios detectors must be used in a special way. They were not optimized for
detection of heavy (semi)stable charged particles and decaying in flight
(neutral or charged) NLSPs. During the last decade both ATLAS and CMS
collaboration have developed strategies which allow for effective search within
such scenarios.
