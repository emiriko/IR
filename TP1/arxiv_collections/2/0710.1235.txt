In multichannel rings, evanescent modes will always co-exist with propagating
modes. The evanescent modes can carry a very large diamagnetic persistent
current that can oscillate with energy and are very sensitive to impurity
scattering. This provides a natural explanation for the large diamagnetic
persistent currents observed in experiments.
