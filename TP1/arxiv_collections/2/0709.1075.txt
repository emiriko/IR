We review the techniques necessary for the calculation of virtual electroweak
and soft photonic corrections at the one-loop level. In particular we describe
renormalization, calculation of one-loop integrals and evaluation of one-loop
Feynman amplitudes. We summarize many explicit results of general relevance. We
give the Feynman rules and the explicit form of the counter terms of the
electroweak standard model, we list analytical expressions for scalar one-loop
integrals and reduction of tensor integrals, we present the decomposition of
the invariant matrix element for processes with two external fermions and we
give the analytic form of soft photonic corrections. These techniques are
applied to physical processes with external W-bosons. We present the full set
of analytical formulae and the corresponding numerical results for the decay
width of the W-boson and the top quark. We discuss the cross section for the
production of W-bosons in e^{+}e^{-}-annihilaton including all O(alpha)
radiative corrections and finite width effects. Improved Born approximations
for these processes are given.
