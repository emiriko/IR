In this paper we describe market in projective geometry language and give
definition of a matrix of market rate, which is related to the matrix rate of
return and the matrix of judgements in the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). We
use these observations to extend the AHP model to projective geometry formalism
and generalise it to intransitive case. We give financial interpretations of
such generalised model and propose its simplification. The unification of the
AHP model and projective aspect of portfolio theory suggests a wide spectrum of
new applications such extended model.
