We consider charged Lepton Flavour Violation (LFV) in the Constrained Minimal
Supersymmetric Standard Model, extended to include the see-saw mechanism with
Constrained Sequential Dominance (CSD), where CSD provides a natural see-saw
explanation of tri-bimaximal neutrino mixing. When charged lepton corrections
to tri-bimaximal neutrino mixing are included, we discover characteristic
correlations among the LFV branching ratios, depending on the mass ordering of
the right-handed neutrinos, with a pronounced dependence on the leptonic mixing
angle $\theta_{13}$ (and in some cases also on the Dirac CP phase $\delta$).
