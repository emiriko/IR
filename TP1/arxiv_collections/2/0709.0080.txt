We have used the recently discovered acoustic Faraday effect in superfluid
3He to perform high resolution spectroscopy of an excited state of the
superfluid condensate. With acoustic cavity interferometry we measure the
rotation of the plane of polarization of a transverse sound wave propagating in
the direction of magnetic field from which we determine the Zeeman energy of
the excited state. We interpret the Lande g-factor, combined with the
zero-field energies of the state, using the theory of Sauls and Serene to
calculate the strength of f -wave interactions in 3He.
