At high temperatures, gravitinos are generated in inelastic scattering
processes with particles that are in thermal equilibrium with the hot
primordial plasma. We consider the regeneration of gravitinos that starts with
completion of reheating after inflation. Following a consistent
finite-temperature approach, we provide the complete result for the gravitino
production rate to leading order in the gauge couplings. Focusing on gravitino
dark matter scenarios we compute the relic density of thermally produced
gravitinos. Moreover, we show that a conceivable determination of the gravitino
mass at future colliders will allow for a unique test of the viability of
thermal leptogenesis in the laboratory.
