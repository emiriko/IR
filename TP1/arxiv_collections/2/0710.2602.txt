The process ee-->ZH allows to measure the Higgs boson in the recoil mass
spectrum against the Z boson without any assumptions on the Higgs boson decay.
We performed a full simulation and reconstruction of ee-->ZH using the MOKKA
and MARLIN packages describing the LDC detector. The Z is reconstructed from
its decays into electrons and muons. The mass of the Higgs boson is set to 120
GeV. Assuming a centre-of-mass energy of 250 GeV and an integrated luminosity
of 50/fb the Higgs boson mass and the Higgs-strahlung cross section can be
measured with a precision of 120 MeV and 9%, respectively.
