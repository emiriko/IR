Clear air turbulence, also known as CAT, can cause damage to an aircrafts
structure and, in severe cases, harm passengers. Though CAT has been thoroughly
studied since the mid 1960s, scientists have not been able to create an
accurate forecasting device. The product tested is known as the
Deformation-Vertical Shear Index (DVSI), created by Knox, Ellrod, and Williams.
The DVSI is currently used by several commercial carriers and military
aircraft. The general feedback has been positive; however, results indicate
that the product tends to overestimate CAT intensity.
