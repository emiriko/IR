We report on the all-optical detection of Rydberg states in a effusive atomic
beam of strontium atoms using electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT).
Using narrow-linewidth CW lasers we obtain an EIT linewidth of 5 MHz. To
illustrate the high spectroscopic resolution offered by this method, we have
measured isotope shifts of the 5s18d ^1D_2 and 5s19s ^1S_0 Rydberg states. This
technique could be applied to high-resolution, non-destructive measurements of
ultra-cold Rydberg gases and plasmas.
