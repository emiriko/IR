Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field of characteristic 2. We compute the
vertices of all indecomposable $kD_8$-modules for the dihedral group $D_8$ of
order 8. We also give a conjectural formula of the induced module of a string
module from $kT_0$ to $kG$ where $G$ is a dihedral group of order $\geq 8$ and
where $T_0$ is a dihedral subgroup of index 2 of $G$. Some cases where we
verified this formula are given.
