The process e+e- to K+K-J/psi is observed for the first time via initial
state radiation. The cross section of e+e- to K+K-J/psi for center-of-mass
energies between threshold and 6.0 GeV is measured using 673 fb^{-1} of data
collected with the Belle detector on and off the Upsilon(4S) resonance. We also
find evidence for e+e- to K_S K_S J/psi in the same energy region.
