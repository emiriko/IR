In this work the physicochemical characterization of liposomes loaded with a
newly synthesised carboranyl porphyrazine (H2HECASPz) is described. This
molecule represents a potential drug for different anticancer therapies, such
as Boron Neutron Capture Therapy, Photodynamic Therapy and Photothermal
Therapy. Different loading methods and different lipid mixtures were tested.
The corresponding loaded vectors were studied by Small Angle Scattering (SANS
and SAXS), light scattering and zeta potential. The combined analysis of
structural data at various length scales and the measurement of the surface
charge allowed to obtain a detailed characterization of the investigated
systems. The mechanisms underlying the onset of differences in relevant
physicochemical parameters (size, polydispersity and charge) were also
critically discussed.
