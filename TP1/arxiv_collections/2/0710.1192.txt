The 14 Killing vectors of the target space for five-dimensional minimal
supergravity reduced to three dimensions are explicitly constructed in terms of
the original field variables. These vectors generate the Lie algebra of $G_2$.
We also construct a symmetrical $7\times7$ matrix representative of the coset
$G_{2(+2)}/((SL(2,R)\times SL(2,R))$ as a function of the same fields.
