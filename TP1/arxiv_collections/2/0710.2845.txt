Electronic transport through rubrene single-crystal field effect transistors
(FETs) is investigated experimentally in the high carrier density regime (n ~
0.1 carrier/molecule). In this regime, we find that the current does not
increase linearly with the density of charge carriers, and tends to saturate.
At the same time, the activation energy for transport unexpectedly increases
with increasing n. We perform a theoretical analysis in terms of a well-defined
microscopic model for interacting Frohlich polarons, that quantitatively
accounts for our experimental observations. This work is particularly
significant for our understanding of electronic transport through organic FETs.
