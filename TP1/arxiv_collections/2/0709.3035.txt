A detailed study is presented of the search for Higgs bosons in the b-decay
channel in the central exclusive production process at the LHC. We present
results for proton tagging detectors at both 220m and 420m around ATLAS or CMS.
We consider two benchmark scenarios; a Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson and the
m_h^{max} scenario of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM).
Detector acceptance, smearing and event trigger strategies are considered. We
find that the SM Higgs will be challenging to observe in the b-jet channel
without improvements to the currently proposed experimental configuration, but
a neutral scalar MSSM Higgs Boson could be observable in the b-jet channel with
a significance of 3 sigma or greater within three years of data taking at all
luminosities between 2 x 10^{33} cm^{-2} s^{-1} and 10^{34} cm^{-2} s^{-1}, and
at 5 sigma or greater after three years in certain scenarios.
