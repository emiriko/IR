The exponential growth of multimedia information and the development of
various communication media generated new problems at various levels including
the rate of flow of information, problems of storage and management. The
difficulty which arises is no longer the existence of information but rather
the access to this information. When designing multimedia information retrieval
system, it is appropriate to bear in mind the potential users and their
information needs. We assumed that multimedia information representation which
takes into account explicitly the users' needs and the cases of use could
contribute to the adaptation potentials of the system for the end-users. We
believe also that responses of multimedia information system would be more
relevant to the users' needs if the types of results to be used from the system
were identified before the design and development of the system. We propose the
integration of the users' information needs. More precisely integrating usage
contexts of resulting information in an information system (during creation and
feedback) should enhance more pertinent users' need. The first section of this
study is dedicated to traditional multimedia information systems and
specifically the approaches of representing multimedia information. Taking into
account the dynamism of users, these approaches do not permit the explicit
integration of the users' information needs. In this paper, we will present our
proposals based on economic intelligence approach. This approach emphasizes the
importance of starting any process of information retrieval witch the user
information need.
