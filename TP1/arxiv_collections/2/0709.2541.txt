We study the static, spherically symmetric black hole solutions for a
non-minimally coupled multi-scalar theory. We find numerical solutions for
values of the scalar fields when a certain constraint on the maximal charge is
satisfied. Beyond this constraint no black hole solutions exist. This
constraint therefore corresponds to extremal solutions, however, this does not
match the \kappa = 0 constraint which typically indicates extremal solutions in
other models. This implies that the set of extremal solutions have non-zero,
finite and varying surface gravity. These solutions also violate the no-hair
theorems for N>1 scalar fields and have previously been proven to be linearly
stable.
