We formulate a field theory for resonantly interacting anyons, that enables
us to perform a perturbative calculation near the fermionic limit. We derive
renormalization group equations for three-body and four-body couplings at
one-loop order. In addition to two fixed points, we find a limit cycle behavior
in the four-body coupling, which implies an infinite set of bound states in the
four-anyon system.
