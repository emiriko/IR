A model of autocrine signaling in cultures of suspended cells is developed on
the basis of the effective medium approximation. The fraction of autocrine
ligands, the mean and distribution of distances traveled by paracrine ligands
before binding, as well as the mean and distribution of the ligand lifetime are
derived. Interferon signaling by dendritic immune cells is considered as an
illustration.
