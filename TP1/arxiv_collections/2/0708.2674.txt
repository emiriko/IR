This paper defines an equation for causality. This equation is then combined
with the postulates of quantum mechanics and mass-energy equivalence to produce
a quantum mechanical telegrapher's equation and to reproduce the Schrodinger
and Klein-Gordon equations. The incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and
dynamic general equilibrium in economics (with an interpretation of a Nash
equilibrium) are obtained when the equation of causality refers to itself, i.e.
when the cause is its own effect. As it is shown that the Klein-Gordon equation
is obtained by Wick rotating the cause vector with de Broglie angular
frequency, this paper postulates an equation for Quantum Gravity, which relates
the Navier-Stokes equations to the Einstein Field Equations of General
Relativity.
