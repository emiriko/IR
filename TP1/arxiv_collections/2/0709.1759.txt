We consider spin-fermion systems which get their magnetic properties from a
system of localized magnetic moments being coupled to conducting electrons. The
dynamical degrees of freedom are spin-$s$ operators of localized spins and
spin-1/2 fermi operators of itinerant electrons. We develop modified spin-wave
theory and obtain that system has two ferromagnetic phases. At the
characteristic temperature T* the magnetization of itinerant electrons becomes
zero, and high temperature ferromagnetic phase (T*<T<T_C) is a phase where only
localized electrons give contribution to the magnetization of the system. An
anomalous increasing of magnetization below T* is obtained in a good agrement
with experimental measurements of the ferromagnetic phase of UGe2.
