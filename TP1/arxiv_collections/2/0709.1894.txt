We observe direct mechanical mixing in nanoelectromechanical transistors
fabricated in semiconductor materials operating in the radio frequency band of
10-1000 MHz. The device is made of a mechanically flexible pillar with a length
of 240 nm and a diameter of 50 nm, placed between two electrodes in an
impedance matched coplanar wave guide. We find a non-linear IV-characteristic,
which enables radio frequency mixing of two electromagnetic signals via the
nanomechanical transistor. Potential applications for this mixer are
ultrasensitive displacement detection or signal processing in communication
electronic circuits requiring high-throughput insulation.
