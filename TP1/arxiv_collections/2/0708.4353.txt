The scaling properties of the inverse moments of Wigner delay times are
investigated in finite one-dimensional (1D) random media with one channel
attached to the boundary of the sample. We find that they follow a simple
scaling law which is independent of the microscopic details of the random
potential. Our theoretical considerations are confirmed numerically for systems
as diverse as 1D disordered wires and optical lattices to microwave waveguides
with correlated scatterers.
