We propose a new model for naturally light Dirac neutrinos and explain the
baryon asymmetry of the universe through neutrinogenesis. We extend the
standard model with a real singlet scalar, a heavy singlet Dirac fermion and a
heavy doublet scalar besides three right-handed neutrinos, respecting lepton
number conservation and a Z_2 symmetry. The neutrinos acquire small Dirac
masses due to the suppression of the weak scale over the heavy mass scale. As a
key feature of our construction, once the heavy Dirac fermion and doublet
scalar go out of equilibrium, their decays induce the CP asymmetry from the
interference of tree-level processes with the \textit{radiative vertex
corrections} (rather than the self-energy corrections). Although there is no
lepton number violation, an equal and opposite amount of CP asymmetry is
generated in the left-handed and the right-handed neutrinos. The left-handed
lepton asymmetry would then be converted to the baryon asymmetry in the
presence of the sphalerons, while the right-handed lepton asymmetry remains
unaffected.
