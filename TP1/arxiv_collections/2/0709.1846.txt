The aim of this paper is to give a short review on cluster dynamics modeling
in the field of atoms and point defects clustering in materials. It is shown
that this method, due to its low computer cost, can handle long term evolution
that cannot, in many cases, be obtained by Lattice Kinetic Monte Carlo methods.
Indeed, such a possibility is achieved thanks to an important drawback that is
the loss of space correlations of the elements of the microstructures. Some
examples, in the field of precipitation and irradiation of metallic materials
are given. The limitations and difficulties of this method are also discussed.
Unsurprisingly, it is shown that it goes in a very satisfactory way when the
objects are distributed homogeneously. Conversely, the source term describing
the primary damage under irradiation, by nature heterogeneous in space and
time, is tricky to introduce especially when displacement cascades are
produced.
