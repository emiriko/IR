In the frame of the Hartree-Fock approximation, the dispersion of
magnetoplasmons in Graphene is derived for all types of transitions for filling
factors $\nu\leq 6$. The optical conductivity components of the magnetoplasmon
curves are calculated. It is shown that the electron-electron interactions lead
to a strong re-normalization of the apparent Fermi velocity of Graphene which
is different for different types of transitions.
