Mobile ad hoc networks are expected to support voice traffic. The requirement
for small delay and jitter of voice traffic poses a significant challenge for
medium access control (MAC) in such networks. User mobility makes it more
complex due to the associated dynamic path attenuation. In this paper, a MAC
scheme for mobile ad hoc networks supporting voice traffic is proposed. With
the aid of a low-power probe prior to DATA transmissions, resource reservation
is achieved in a distributed manner, thus leading to small delay and jitter.
The proposed scheme can automatically adapt to dynamic path attenuation in a
mobile environment. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed scheme.
