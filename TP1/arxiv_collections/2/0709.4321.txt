The problem of chaotic scattering in presence of direct processes or prompt
responses is mapped via a transformation to the case of scattering in absence
of such processes for non-unitary scattering matrices, \tilde S. In the absence
of prompt responses, \tilde S is uniformly distributed according to its
invariant measure in the space of \tilde S matrices with zero average, < \tilde
S > =0. In the presence of direct processes, the distribution of \tilde S is
non-uniform and it is characterized by the average < \tilde S > (\neq 0). In
contrast to the case of unitary matrices S, where the invariant measures of S
for chaotic scattering with and without direct processes are related through
the well known Poisson kernel, here we show that for non-unitary scattering
matrices the invariant measures are related by the Poisson kernel squared. Our
results are relevant to situations where flux conservation is not satisfied.
For example, transport experiments in chaotic systems, where gains or losses
are present, like microwave chaotic cavities or graphs, and acoustic or elastic
resonators.
