The detailed formulation for loop quantum cosmology (LQC) in the Bianchi I
model with a scalar massless field has been constructed. In this paper, its
effective dynamics is studied in two improved strategies for implementing the
LQC discreteness corrections. Both schemes show that the big bang is replaced
by the big bounces, which take place up to three times, once in each diagonal
direction, when the area or volume scale factor approaches the critical values
in the Planck regime measured by the reference of the scalar field momentum.
These two strategies give different evolutions: In one scheme, the effective
dynamics is independent of the choice of the finite sized cell prescribed to
make Hamiltonian finite; in the other, the effective dynamics reacts to the
macroscopic scales introduced by the boundary conditions. Both schemes reveal
interesting symmetries of scaling, which are reminiscent of the relational
interpretation of quantum mechanics and also suggest that the fundamental
spatial scale (area gap) may give rise to a temporal scale.
