We construct the classification scheme for all possible evolution scenarios
and find the corresponding global geometries for dynamics of a thin spherical
vacuum shell in the Schwarzschild-de Sitter metric. This configuration is
suitable for the modelling of vacuum bubbles arising during cosmological phase
transitions in the early Universe. The distinctive final types of evolution
from the local point of view of a rather distant observer are either the
unlimited expansion of the shell or its contraction with a formation of black
hole (with a central singularity) or wormhole (with a baby universe in
interior).
