We study the eigenvalues of Dirac operators in QCD with two mass degenerate
dynamical fermions. The gauge configurations have been obtained with HMC and
the so-called Chirally Improved fermionic action. We compare eigenvalues
obtained for the overlap Dirac operator on these configurations with those for
the Chirally Improved (CI) operator (studied earlier). Results of Random Matrix
Theory allow us to determine the chiral condensate.
