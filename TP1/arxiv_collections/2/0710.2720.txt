We study the Schubert calculus of the affine Grassmannian Gr of the
symplectic group. The integral homology and cohomology rings of Gr are
identified with dual Hopf algebras of symmetric functions, defined in terms of
Schur's P and Q-functions. An explicit combinatorial description is obtained
for the Schubert basis of the cohomology of Gr, and this is extended to a
definition of the affine type C Stanley symmetric functions. A homology Pieri
rule is also given for the product of a special Schubert class with an
arbitrary one.
