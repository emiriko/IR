The tetragonal compound YbRu$_{2}$Ge$_{2}$ exhibits a non-magnetic transition
at $T_0$=10.2K and a magnetic transition at $T_1$=6.5K in zero magnetic field.
We present a model for this material based on a quasi-quartet of Yb$^{3+}$
crystalline electric field (CEF) states and discuss its mean field solution.
Taking into account the broadening of the specific heat jump at $T_0$ for
magnetic field perpendicular to [001] and the decrease of $T_0$ with magnetic
field parallel to [001], it is shown that ferro-quadrupole order of either
O$_{2}^{2}$ or O$_{\rm xy}$ - type are prime candidates for the non-magnetic
transition. Considering the matrix element of these quadrupole moments, we show
that the lower CEF states of the level scheme consist of a $\Gamma_{6}$ and a
$\Gamma_{7}$ doublet. This leads to induced type of O$_{2}^{2}$ and O$_{\rm
xy}$ quadrupolar order parameters. The quadrupolar order introduces exchange
anisotropy for planar magnetic moments. This causes a spin flop transition at
low fields perpendicular [001] which explains the observed metamagnetism. We
also obtain a good explanation for the temperature dependence of magnetic
susceptibility and specific heat for fields both parallel and perpendicular to
the [001] direction.
