A very simple Data acquisition card was developed in our under-graduate class
for interfacing with the parallel port of a standard computer. It was developed
with the intention to enable students to do various physics experiments with
the computer sparing them from knowing the details of the electronics required.
The article is a summary of our experience and ends with a request for
suggestions to improve the circuit without losing its simplicity.
