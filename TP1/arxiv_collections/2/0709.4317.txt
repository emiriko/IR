We investigate the current and noise characteristics of a double quantum dot
system. The strong correlations induced by the Coulomb interaction create
entangled two-electron states and lead to signatures in the transport
properties. We show that the interaction parameter phi, which measures the
admixture of the double-occupancy contribution to the singlet state and thus
the degree of entanglement, can be directly accessed through the Fano factor of
super-Poissonian shot noise.
