The theory of four-body systems is revisited. It is illustrated that the
theory provides a rigorous proof for the formation of ground state (unexcited)
biexcitons in molecular crystals. The generalization of the theory predicts the
possible existence of excited biexcitons in nature. In order to test the
validity of the extended theory on computational level, a very elaborate
computer code is constructed for the treatment of arbitrary four-body system
with arbitrary electron/hole mass ratio and arbitrary exciton - exciton
interaction (VXX). The results, for mass ratio = 1 and VXX is a pure Coulomb
force, show that the test is successful. Realization of these conclusions on
experimental level should open the door for wide industrial applications.
