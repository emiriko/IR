This note shows that the hope expressed in [ADL+07]--that the new algorithm
for edge-unfolding any polyhedral band without overlap might lead to an
algorithm for unfolding any prismatoid without overlap--cannot be realized. A
prismatoid is constructed whose sides constitute a nested polyhedral band, with
the property that every placement of the prismatoid top face overlaps with the
band unfolding.
