Chiral perturbation theory (ChPT) is the effective field theory of the strong
interactions at low energies. We will address the issue of a consistent power
counting scheme in a manifestly Lorentz-invariant formulation of baryon ChPT.
As applications we show how the inclusion of vector and axial-vector mesons in
the calculation of the nucleon electromagnetic and axial form factors,
respectively, lead to an improved description of the empirical data. Finally,
we will outline a systematic implementation of the Delta(1232) resonance into
the effective field theory program.
