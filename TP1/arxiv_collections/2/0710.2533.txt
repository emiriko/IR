In many networks, it is of great interest to identify "communities",
unusually densely knit groups of individuals. Such communities often shed light
on the function of the networks or underlying properties of the individuals.
Recently, Newman suggested "modularity" as a natural measure of the quality of
a network partitioning into communities. Since then, various algorithms have
been proposed for (approximately) maximizing the modularity of the partitioning
determined.
  In this paper, we introduce the technique of rounding mathematical programs
to the problem of modularity maximization, presenting two novel algorithms.
More specifically, the algorithms round solutions to linear and vector
programs. Importantly, the linear programing algorithm comes with an a
posteriori approximation guarantee: by comparing the solution quality to the
fractional solution of the linear program, a bound on the available "room for
improvement" can be obtained. The vector programming algorithm provides a
similar bound for the best partition into two communities. We evaluate both
algorithms using experiments on several standard test cases for network
partitioning algorithms, and find that they perform comparably or better than
past algorithms.
