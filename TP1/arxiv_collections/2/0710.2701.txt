Quantum dots pose a problem where one must confront three obstacles:
randomness, interactions and finite size. Yet it is this confluence that allows
one to make some theoretical advances by invoking three theoretical tools:
Random Matrix theory (RMT), the Renormalization Group (RG) and the 1/N
expansion. Here the reader is introduced to these techniques and shown how they
may be combined to answer a set of questions pertaining to quantum dots
