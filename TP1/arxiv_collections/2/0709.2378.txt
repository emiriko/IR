We analyze collider signatures of massive color-octet bosons whose couplings
to quarks are suppressed. Gauge invariance forces the octets to couple at tree
level only in pairs to gluons, with a strength set by the QCD gauge coupling.
For a spin-1 octet, the cross section for pair production at hadron colliders
is larger than that for a quark of equal mass. The octet decays into two jets,
leading to a 4-jet signature with two pairs of jets forming resonances of the
same mass. For a spin-0 octet the cross section is smaller, and the dominant
decay is into b\bar{b}, or t\bar{t} if kinematically allowed. We estimate that
discovery of spin-1 octets is possible for masses up to 330 GeV at the
Tevatron, and 1 TeV at the LHC with 1 fb^{-1}, while the reach is somewhat
lower for spin-0 octets.
