We present results of searches for new physics in final states with photons
at CDF in approximately 1 fb-1 of ppbar collisions at 1.96 TeV. We give an
overview of the data-driven photon background estimation techniques used for
the analyses. We report on a search for diphoton peaks and signature-based
searches for diphoton+X, lepton+photon+X (X = electron, muon, missing
transverse energy, photon) and ttbar+photon.
