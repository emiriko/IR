We present results for masses of excited mesons from dynamical clover-Wilson
lattices provided by the CP-PACS collaboration at pion masses down to 500 MeV.
Our analysis of the data is based on using a matrix of correlators from various
source and sink operators. The spectroscopy results are discussed and compared
to experimental values.
