We consider the case where supersymmetry with broken R-parity is embedded in
the minimal supergravity model (mSUGRA). This alters the standard mSUGRA
spectrum and opens a wide range in parameter space, where the scalar tau is the
lightest supersymmetric particle, instead of the lightest neutralino. We study
the resulting LHC phenomenology. Promising signatures would be detached
vertices from long-lived staus, multi lepton final states and multi-tau final
states. We investigate in detail the corresponding cross sections and decay
rates in characteristic benchmark scenarios.
