Pre-post testing is a commonly used method in physics education community for
evaluating students' achievement and or the effectiveness of teaching through a
specific period of instruction. A popular method to analyze pre-post testing
results is the normalized gain first brought to the physics education community
in wide use by R.R. Hake. This paper presents a measurement based probabilistic
model of the dynamic process of learning that explains the experimentally
observed features of the normalized gain. In Hake's study with thousands of
students' pre-post testing results, he observed that on average 48 courses
employing "interactive engagement" types of instruction achieved average
normalized gains about two standard deviations greater than did 14 courses
subjected to traditional instruction. For all courses the average normalized
gains had a very low correlation +0.02 with average pretest scores. This
feature of the normalized gain has allowed researchers to investigate the
effectiveness of instruction using data collected from classes with widely
different average pretest scores. However, the question of why the average
normalized gain has this feature and to what extent this feature is generally
present is not well understood. In addition, there have been debates as to what
the normalized gain actually measures, and concerns that it lacks a probability
framework that undergirds psychometric methods such as Item Response Theory
(IRT). The present model leads to an explanation of the observed features of
the normalized gain, connects to other models such as IRT, and shows that the
normalized gain does have a probability framework but one different from that
emphasized by IRT.
