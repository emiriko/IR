We obtain an explicit representation for quasiradial $\gamma$-harmonic
functions, which shows that these functions have essentially algebraic nature.
In particular, we give a complete description of all $\gamma$ which admit
algebraic quasiradial solutions. Unlike the cases $\gamma=\infty$ and
$\gamma=1$, only finitely many algebraic solutions is shown to exist for any
fixed $|\gamma|>1$. Moreover, there is a special extremal series of $\gamma $
which exactly corresponds to the well-known ideal $m$-atomic gas adiabatic
constant $\gamma=\frac{2m+3}{2m+1}$.
