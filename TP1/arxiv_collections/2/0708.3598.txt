In this paper, we are concerned with the BFV-reduction of first class
constraints in classsical Hamiltonian mechanics and deformation quantization.
As a result, we obtain continuous star products for certain singular reduced
symplectic quotients. We relate the notion of "irreducibility" of a constraint
to the notion of complete intersection used in commutative algebra. We
generalize the classical BFV construction to the case of projective Tate
generators using a super-Poisson bracket discovered by M. Rothstein. We also
discuss the problem of infinite reducibility. Several examples are elaborated
on.
