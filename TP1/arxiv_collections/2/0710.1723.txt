Inter-tube conductance of double-wall carbon nanotubes with impurities is
numerically studied. Its length dependence for various impurities is scaled by
a mean-free path. The inter-tube conductance exhibits drastic linear increase
with the tube length and takes a maximum around at the localization length. The
maximum conductance is much smaller than the conductance quantum
$e^2/\pi\hbar$.
