Recent studies on the spectral function of charmonium in lattice QCD suggest
survival of $J/\psi$ state in the deconfinement phase till relatively high
temperature. Based on the studies, different scenarios of $J/\psi$ suppression
are discussed to understand experimental results in the Heavy Ion Collision
experiments. The scenarios require the information on the dissociation
temperatures of $\chi_c$ and $\psi'$ as well as that of $J/\psi$. In order to
investigate these states in finite temperature lattice QCD, we have to consider
an effect of a characteristic constant mode in the correlators. As a result of
the study on the constant mode, we find that most drastic change in charmonium
correlators for $\chi_c$ states just above the deconfinement transition are
caused by the constant mode. It may indicate the survival of $\chi_c$ states
after the deconfinement transition until, at least, $1.4T_c$.
