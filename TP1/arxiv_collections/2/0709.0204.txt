One natural constraint in the sponsored search advertising framework arises
from the fact that there is a limit on the number of available slots,
especially for the popular keywords, and as a result, a significant pool of
advertisers are left out. We study the emergence of diversification in the
adword market triggered by such capacity constraints in the sense that new
market mechanisms, as well as, new for-profit agents are likely to emerge to
combat or to make profit from the opportunities created by shortages in
ad-space inventory. We propose a model where the additional capacity is
provided by for-profit agents (or, mediators), who compete for slots in the
original auction, draw traffic, and run their own sub-auctions. The quality of
the additional capacity provided by a mediator is measured by its {\it fitness}
factor. We compute revenues and payoffs for all the different parties at a {\it
symmetric Nash equilibrium} (SNE) when the mediator-based model is operated by
a mechanism currently being used by Google and Yahoo!, and then compare these
numbers with those obtained at a corresponding SNE for the same mechanism, but
without any mediators involved in the auctions. Such calculations allow us to
determine the value of the additional capacity. Our results show that the
revenue of the auctioneer, as well as the social value (i.e. efficiency),
always increase when mediators are involved; moreover even the payoffs of {\em
all} the bidders will increase if the mediator has a high enough fitness. Thus,
our analysis indicates that there are significant opportunities for
diversification in the internet economy and we should expect it to continue to
develop richer structure, with room for different types of agents and
mechanisms to coexist.
