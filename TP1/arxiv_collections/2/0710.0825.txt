We describe a general method of realizing entanglement witnesses in terms of
the interference pattern of a single quantum probe. After outlining the
principle, we discuss specific realizations both with electrons in mesoscopic
Aharonov-Bohm rings and with photons in standard Young's double-slit or
coherent-backscattering interferometers.
