We propose an extension of a result by Repetowicz et al. about Wick's theorem
and its applications: we first show that Wick's theorem can be extended to the
uniform distribution on the sphere and then to the whole class of elliptical
distributions. Then, as a special case, we detail this result for distributions
that are Gaussian scale mixtures. Finally, we show that these results allow to
recover easily a theorem by Folland about integration of polynomials over the
sphere.
