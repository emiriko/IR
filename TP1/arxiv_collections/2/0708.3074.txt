Phase slips play a primary role in dissipation across a wide spectrum of
bosonic systems, from determining the critical velocity of superfluid helium to
generating resistance in thin superconducting wires. This subject has also
inspired much technological interest, largely motivated by applications
involving nanoscale superconducting circuit elements, e.g., standards based on
quantum phase-slip junctions. While phase slips caused by thermal fluctuations
at high temperatures are well understood, controversy remains over the role of
phase slips in small-scale superconductors. In solids, problems such as
uncontrolled noise sources and disorder complicate the study and application of
phase slips. Here we show that phase slips can lead to dissipation for a clean
and well-characterized Bose-Hubbard (BH) system by experimentally studying
transport using ultra-cold atoms trapped in an optical lattice. In contrast to
previous work, we explore a low velocity regime described by the 3D BH model
which is not affected by instabilities, and we measure the effect of
temperature on the dissipation strength. We show that the damping rate of
atomic motion-the analogue of electrical resistance in a solid-in the confining
parabolic potential fits well to a model that includes finite damping at zero
temperature. The low-temperature behaviour is consistent with the theory of
quantum tunnelling of phase slips, while at higher temperatures a cross-over
consistent with the transition to thermal activation of phase slips is evident.
Motion-induced features reminiscent of vortices and vortex rings associated
with phase slips are also observed in time-of-flight imaging.
