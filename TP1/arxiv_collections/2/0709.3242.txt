We introduce the set of bicomplex numbers $\mathbb{T}$ which is a commutative
ring with zero divisors defined by $\mathbb{T}=\{w_0+w_1
\bold{i_1}+w_2\bold{i_2}+w_3 \bold{j}| w_0,w_1,w_2,w_3 \in \mathbb{R}\}$ where
$\bold{i^{\text 2}_1}=-1, \bold{i^{\text 2}_2}=-1, \bold{j}^2=1,\
\bold{i_1}\bold{i_2}=\bold{j}=\bold{i_2}\bold{i_1}$. We present the conjugates
and the moduli associated with the bicomplex numbers. Then we study the
bicomplex Schr\"odinger equation and found the continuity equations. The
discrete symmetries of the system of equations describing the bicomplex
Schr\"odinger equation are obtained. Finally, we study the bicomplex Born
formulas under the discrete symetries. We obtain the standard Born's formula
for the class of bicomplex wave functions having a null hyperbolic angle.
