In this talk we will discuss how inflation can be embedded within a minimal
extension of the Standard Model where the inflaton carries the Standard Model
charges. There is no need of an ad-hoc scalar field to be introduced in order
to explain the temperature anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background
radiation, all the ingredients are present within a minimal supersymmetric
Standard Model. The model is robust enough to provide a successful exit from
inflation with all observed matter in the universe. This is a triumph for an
inflationary paradigm which has always begged a simple question: can we
identify the inflaton in a laboratory. We will briefly discuss how LHC can shed
some insight into the inflaton.
