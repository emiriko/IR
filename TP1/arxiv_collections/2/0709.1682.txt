This paper studies a quantum risk-sensitive estimation problem and
investigates robustness properties of the filter. This is a direct extension to
the quantum case of analogous classical results. All investigations are based
on a discrete approximation model of the quantum system under consideration.
This allows us to study the problem in a simple mathematical setting. We close
the paper with some examples that demonstrate the robustness of the
risk-sensitive estimator.
