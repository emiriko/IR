A model of self avoiding walks with suitable constraint has been developed to
study the effect of temperature on a single stranded DNA (ssDNA) in the
constant force ensemble. Our exact calculations for small chains show that the
extension (reaction co-ordinate) may increase or decrease with the temperature
depending upon the applied force. The simple model developed here which
incorporates semi-microscopic details of base direction provide an explanation
of the force induced transitions in ssDNA as observed in experiments.
