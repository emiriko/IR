We have studied charged current one pion production induced by
$\nu_\mu(\bar\nu_\mu)$ from some nuclei. The calculations have been done for
the incoherent pion production processes from these nuclear targets in the
$\Delta$ dominance model and take into account the effect of Pauli blocking,
Fermi motion and renormalization of $\Delta$ properties in the nuclear medium.
The effect of final state interactions of pions has also been taken into
account. The numerical results have been compared with the recent results from
the MiniBooNE experiment for the charged current 1$\pi$ production, and also
with some of the older experiments in Freon and Freon-Propane from CERN.
