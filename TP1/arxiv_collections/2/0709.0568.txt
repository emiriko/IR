Using molecular dynamics simulation we examine dynamics in sheared
polycrystal states in a binary mixture containing 10% larger particles in two
dimensions. We find large stress fluctuations arising from sliding motions of
the particles at the grain boundaries, which occur cooperatively to release the
elastic energy stored. These dynamic processes are visualized with the aid of a
sixfold angle $\alpha_j(t)$ representing the local crystal orientation and a
disorder variable $D_j(t)$ representing a deviation from the hexagonal order
for particle $j$.
