I discuss forms of high energy density matter in QCD. These include the Color
Glass Condensate, the Glasma and the Quark Gluon Plasma. They all might be
studied in ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions, nd the Color Glass
Condensate might also be probed in electron-hadron collisions. I present the
properties of such matter and some aspects of what is known of their
properties.
