We study the dynamics of the first order phase transition in the holographic
hard wall model, namely, Polchinski-Strassler's model and come to the
conclusion that the phase transition is incomplete in large N limit with the
natural boundary condition. We also consider the string length corrections to
both hard wall model and Witten's model, and find that the interesting
transition configuration is preserved under the alpha' corrections.
