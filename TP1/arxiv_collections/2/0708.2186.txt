The logarithmic connections studied in the paper are direct images of regular
connections on line bundles over genus-2 double covers of the elliptic curve.
We give an explicit parametrization of all such connections, determine their
monodromy, differential Galois group and the underlying rank-2 vector bundle.
The latter is described in terms of elementary transforms. The question of its
(semi)-stability is addressed.
