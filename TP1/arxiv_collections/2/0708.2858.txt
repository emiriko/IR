The transport of a dimer, consisting of two Brownian particles bounded by a
harmonic potential, moving on a periodic substrate is investigated both
numerically and analytically. The mobility and diffusion of the dimer center of
mass present distinct properties when compared with those of a monomer under
the same transport conditions. Both the average current and the diffusion
coefficient are found to be complicated non-monotonic functions of the driving
force. The influence of dimer equilibrium length, coupling strength and damping
constant on the dimer transport properties are also examined in detail.
