Kerov polynomials express the normalized characters of irreducible
representations of the symmetric group, evaluated on a cycle, as polynomials in
the free cumulants of the associated Young diagram. We present two positivity
conjectures for their coefficients. The latter are stronger than the positivity
conjecture of Kerov-Biane, recently proved by Feray.
