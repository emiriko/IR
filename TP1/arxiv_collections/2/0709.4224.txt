We present the first 2+1 flavour lattice QCD calculations of pseudoscalar
flavour-singlet propagators using improved staggered fermions. We explore the
relevant techniques and discuss prospects for the larger scale studies now in
progress. The disconnected correlator is shown to have a highly non-Gaussian
distribution and reliable estimates of the errors require care.
