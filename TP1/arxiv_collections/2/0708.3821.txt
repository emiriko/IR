We discuss a scenario consisting of an effective 4D theory containing
fundamental and composite fields. The strong dynamics sector responsible for
the compositeness is assumed to be of extra dimensional origin. In the 4D
effective theory the SM fermion and gauge fields are taken as fundamental
fields. The scalar sector of the theory resembles a bosonic topcolor in the
sense there are two scalar Higgs fields, a composite scalar field and a
fundamental gauge-Higgs unification scalar. A detailed analysis of the scalar
spectrum is presented in order to explore the parameter space consistent with
experiment. It is found that, under the model assumptions, the acceptable
parameter space is quite constrained. As a part of our phenomenological study
of the model, we evaluate the branching ratio of the lightest Higgs boson and
find that our model predicts a large FCNC mode h -> tc, which can be as large
as O(10^{-3}). Similarly, a large BR for the top FCNC decay is obtained, namely
B.R.(t -> c + H) \simeq 10^{-4}
