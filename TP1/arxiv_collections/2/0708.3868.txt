Relativistic Faddeev equations for three-body scattering at arbitrary
energies are solved in first order in the two-body transition operator in terms
of momentum vectors without employing a partial wave decomposition.
Relativistic invariance is incorporated within the framework of Poincar{\'e}
invariant quantum mechanics. Based on a Malfliet-Tjon type interaction,
observables for elastic and breakup scattering are calculated and compared to
the nonrelativistic ones.
