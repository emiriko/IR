We investigate the cross sections of the elastic electron or positron
scattering from $^{208}$Pb, $^{12}$C, $^{12,16}$O and $^{28, 32}$S by the
relativistic partial-wave expansion method using the static charge density
distribution from the self-consistent relativistic mean field model and also
calculate the charge form factor for $^{12, 16}$O and $^{28, 32}$S. The
numerical results are compared with the available data. Calculations indicate
that the extended charge density distributions of $^{12}$O and $^{28}$S have
observable effects on the cross sections of the electron or positron scattering
as well as the charge form factors.
