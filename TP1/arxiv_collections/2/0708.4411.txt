The magnetic field distribution around the vortices in TmNi2B2C in the
paramagnetic phase was studied experimentally as well as theoretically. The
vortex form factor, measured by small-angle neutron scattering, is found to be
field independent up to 0.6 Hc2 followed by a sharp decrease at higher fields.
The data are fitted well by solutions to the Eilenberger equations when
paramagnetic effects due to the exchange interaction with the localized 4f Tm
moments are included. The induced paramagnetic moments around the vortex cores
act to maintain the field contrast probed by the form factor.
