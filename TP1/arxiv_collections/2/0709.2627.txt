Transition energies and oscillator strengths of excitons in dependence on
magnetic field are investigated in type I and II semiconductor nanorings. A
slight deviation from circular (concentric) shape of the type II nanoring gives
a better observability of the Aharonov-Bohm oscillations since the ground state
is always optically active. Kinetic equations for the exciton occupation are
solved with acoustic phonon scattering as the major relaxation process, and
absorption and luminescence spectra are calculated showing deviations from
equilibrium. The presence of a non-radiative exciton decay leads to a quenching
of the integrated photoluminescence with magnetic field.
