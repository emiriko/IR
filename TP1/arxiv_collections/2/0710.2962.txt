We investigate the doping dependent low energy, low temperature ($T$ = 5 K)
properties of nodal quasiparticles in the d-wave superconductor
Bi$_{2.1}$Sr$_{1.9}$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ (Bi2212). By utilizing ultrahigh
resolution laser-excited angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we obtain
precise band dispersions near $E_{F}$, mean free paths and scattering rates
($\Gamma$) of quasiparticles. For optimally and overdoped, we obtain very sharp
quasiparticle peaks of 8 meV and 6 meV full-width at half-maximum,
respectively, in accord with terahertz conductivity. For all doping levels, we
find the energy-dependence of $\Gamma \sim |\omega |$, while $\Gamma$($\omega
=0$) shows a monotonic increase from overdoping to underdoping. The doping
dependence suggests the role of electronic inhomogeneity on the nodal
quasiparticle scattering at low temperature (5 K $\lsim 0.07T_{\rm c}$),
pronounced in the underdoped region.
