We analyze the behavior of quantum dynamical entropies production from
sequences of quantum approximants approaching their (chaotic) classical limit.
The model of the quantized hyperbolic automorphisms of the 2-torus is examined
in detail and a semi-classical analysis is performed on it using coherent
states, fulfilling an appropriate dynamical localization property.
Correspondence between quantum dynamical entropies and the Kolmogorov-Sinai
invariant is found only over time scales that are logarithmic in the
quantization parameter.
