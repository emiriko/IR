Quantum mechanics is difficult to learn because it is counterintuitive, hard
to visualize, mathematically challenging, and abstract. The Physics Education
Technology (PhET) Project, known for its interactive computer simulations for
teaching and learning physics, now includes 18 simulations on quantum mechanics
designed to improve learning of this difficult subject. Our simulations include
several key features to help students build mental models and intuitions about
quantum mechanics: visual representations of abstract concepts and microscopic
processes that cannot be directly observed, interactive environments that
directly couple students' actions to animations, connections to everyday life,
and efficient calculations so students can focus on the concepts rather than
the math. Like all PhET simulations, these are developed using the results of
education research and feedback from educators, and are tested in student
interviews and classroom studies. This article provides an overview of the PhET
quantum simulations and their development. We also describe research
demonstrating their effectiveness and share some insights about student
thinking that we have gained from our research on quantum simulations.
