We develop a numerical technique to study Anderson localization in
interacting electronic systems. The ground state of the disordered system is
calculated with quantum Monte-Carlo simulations while the localization
properties are extracted from the ``Thouless conductance'' $g$, i.e. the
curvature of the energy with respect to an Aharonov-Bohm flux. We apply our
method to polarized electrons in a two dimensional system of size $L$. We
recover the well known universal $\beta(g)=\rm{d}\log g/\rm{d}\log L$ one
parameter scaling function without interaction. Upon switching on the
interaction, we find that $\beta(g)$ is unchanged while the system flows toward
the insulating limit. We conclude that polarized electrons in two dimensions
stay in an insulating state in the presence of weak to moderate
electron-electron correlations.
