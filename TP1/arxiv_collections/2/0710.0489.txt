This is a summary of a detailed study of heavy-light meson excited state
energies. Our lattice measurements include both radial and orbital excitations.
Particular attention is paid to the spin-orbit splittings, to see which one of
the states (for a given angular momentum L) has the lower energy. In nature the
closest equivalent of this heavy-light system is the B_s meson, which allows us
to compare our lattice calculations to experimental results (where available)
or give a prediction where the excited states, particularly P-wave states,
should lie.
