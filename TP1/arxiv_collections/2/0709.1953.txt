The 248nm and 193nm photodissociation of submonolayer quantities of CH$_3$Br
and CH$_3$I adsorbed on thin layers of n-hexane indicate that the dissociation
is caused by dissociative electron attachment from sub-vacuum level
photoelectrons created in the copper substrate. The characteristics of this
photodissociation-- translation energy distributions and coverage dependences
show that the dissociation is mediated by an image potential state which
temporarily traps the photoelectrons near the n-hexane--vacuum interface, and
then the charge transfers from this image state to the affinity level of a
co-adsorbed halomethane which then dissociates.
