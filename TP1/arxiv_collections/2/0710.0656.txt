We report the observation of new bottom baryon states. The most recent result
is the observation of the baryon \Xi_b^- through the decay \Xi_b^- to J/\psi
\Xi^-. The significance of the signal corresponds to 7.7 sigma and the \Xi_b^-
mass is measured to be 5792.9 \pm 2.5(stat.) \pm 1.7(syst.) MeV/c^2. In
addition we observe four resonances in the \Lambda_b^0 \pi^{\pm} spectra,
consistent with the bottom baryons \Sigma_b^{(*)\pm}. All observations are in
agreement with theoretical expectations.
