We study the ground state and the magnetization process of a spin-1/2
$J_1$-$J_2$ model with a plaquette structure by using various methods. For
small inter-plaquette interaction, this model is expected to have a spin-gap
and we computed the first- and the second excitation energies. If the gap of
the lowest excitation closes, the corresponding particle condenses to form
magnetic orders. By analyzing the quintet gap and magnetic interactions among
the quintet excitations, we find a spin-nematic phase around $J_1/J_2\sim -2$
due to the strong frustration and the quantum effect. When high magnetic moment
is applied, not the spin-1 excitations but the spin-2 ones soften and dictate
the magnetization process. We apply a mean-field approximation to the effective
Hamiltonian to find three different types of phases (a conventional BEC phase,
``striped'' supersolid phases and a 1/2-plateau). Unlike the BEC in spin-dimer
systems, this BEC phase is not accompanied by transverse magnetization.
Possible connection to the recently discovered spin-gap compound (CuCl)LaNb2O7
is discussed.
