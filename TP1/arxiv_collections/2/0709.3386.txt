The non-perturbative quark-gluon interaction depends significantly on the
value of the quark mass. In particular, in the light quark mass regime,
correlations are strongly influenced by dynamics associated to chiral symmetry
breaking. We use the Interacting Instanton Liquid Model (IILM) as a tool to
investigate the microscopic dynamical mechanisms which underly the dependence
on the quark mass and drive the transition into the chiral regime of QCD. To
ensure the validity of the model, we first verify that the dependence on the
quark mass for several observables calculated in the IILM agrees well with the
predictions of chiral perturbation theory and with lattice simulations. We then
show that a quark mass m*~80 MeV emerging naturally from the model specifies
the mass scale above which the dynamics associated with low-lying eigenmodes of
the Direac operator becomes sub-leading and the contribution of the fermion
determinant is suppressed.
