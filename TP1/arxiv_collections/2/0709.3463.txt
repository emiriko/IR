We propose to use a quantum ratchet to transport quantum information in a
chain of atoms trapped in an optical superlattice. The quantum ratchet is
created by a continuous modulation of the optical superlattice which is
periodic in time and in space. Though there is zero average force acting on the
atoms, we show that indeed the ratchet effect permits atoms on even and odd
sites to move along opposite directions. By loading the optical lattice with
two-level bosonic atoms, this scheme permits to perfectly transport a qubit or
entangled state imprinted in one or more atoms to any desired position in the
lattice. From the quantum computation point of view, the transport is achieved
by a smooth concatenation of perfect swap gates. We analyze setups with
noninteracting and interacting particles and in the latter case we use the
tools of optimal control to design optimal modulations. We also discuss the
feasibility of this method in current experiments.
