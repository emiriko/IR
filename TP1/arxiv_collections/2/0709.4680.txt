In this work, we perform parameter tuning with dynamical anisotropic clover
lattices using the Schr\"odinger functional and stout-smearing in the fermion
field. We find that $\xi_R/\xi_0$ is relatively close to 1 in our parameter
search, which allows us to fix $\xi_0$ in our runs. We proposed to determine
the gauge and fermion anisotropy in a Schr\"odinger-background small box using
Wilson loop ratios and PCAC masses. We demonstrate that these ideas are
equivalent to but more efficient than the conventional meson dispersion
approach. The spatial and temporal clover coefficients are fixed to the
tree-level tadpole-improved clover values, and we demonstrate that they satisfy
the nonperturbative condition determined by Schr\"odinger functional method.
