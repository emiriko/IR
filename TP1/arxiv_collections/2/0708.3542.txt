The minority game is a simple congestion game in which the players' main goal
is to choose among two options the one that is adopted by the smallest number
of players. We characterize the set of Nash equilibria and the limiting
behavior of several well-known learning processes in the minority game with an
arbitrary odd number of players. Interestingly, different learning processes
provide considerably different predictions.
