We summarize recent results on the nonperturbative quark-gluon interaction in
Landau gauge QCD. Our analytical analysis of the infrared behaviour of the
quark-gluon vertex reveals infrared singularities, which lead to an infrared
divergent running coupling and a linear rising quark-antiquark potential when
chiral symmetry is broken. In the chirally symmetric case we find an infrared
fixed point of the coupling and, correspondingly, a Coulomb potential. These
findings provide a new link betwen dynamical chiral symmetry breaking and
confinement.
