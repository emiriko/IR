With the advances in the technology of materials based on GaN, high
brightness white light emitting diodes (LEDs) have flourished over the past few
years and have shown to be very promising in many new illumination applications
such as outdoor illumination, task and decorative lighting as well as aircraft
and automobile illuminations. The objective of this paper is to investigate an
active liquid cooling solution of such LEDs in an application of automotive
headlights. The thermal design from device to board to system level has been
carried out in this research. Air cooling and passive liquid cooling methods
are investigated and excluded as unsuitable, and therefore an active liquid
cooling solution is selected. Several configurations of the active liquid
cooling system are studied and optimisation work has been carried out to find
an optimum thermal performance.
