We demonstrate an electrically tunable two dimensional photonic crystal
nanocavity containing InAs self assembled quantum dots. Photoluminescence and
electroluminescence measurements are combined to probe the cavity mode
structure and demonstrate a local electrical contact to the quantum dots.
Measurements performed as a function of the electric field enable us to probe
the capture, relaxation and recombination dynamics of photogenerated carriers
inside the quantum dots emitting into a modified photonic environment.
Furthermore, the two dimensional photonic crystal is probed by spatially
dependent photocurrent spectroscopy indicating a 3.5x enhancement of the local
radiative lifetime of the QDs inside the photonic crystal environment.
