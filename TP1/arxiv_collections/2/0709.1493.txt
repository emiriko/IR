In this paper, we develop the notion of the marginal and density atomic Wehrl
entropies for two-level atom interacting with the single mode field, i.e.
Jaynes-Cummings model. For this system we show that there are relationships
between these quantities and both of the information entropies and the von
Neumann entropy.
