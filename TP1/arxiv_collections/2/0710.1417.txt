The orientation of individual C60 molecules adsorbed on Cu(100) is reversibly
switched when the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope is approached to
contact the molecule. The probability of switching rises sharply upon
displacing the tip beyond a threshold. A mechanical mechanism is suggested to
induce the rotation of the molecule.
