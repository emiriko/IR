We derive the bias function that minimizes the statistical error of free
energy differences calculated in work-biased fast-switching simulations. The
optimum bias function is compared to other bias functions using a particle
pulled through a viscous fluid as an illustrative example. Our analysis
indicates that the uncertainty in the free energy is smallest if both dominant
and typical work values are sampled with high frequency.
