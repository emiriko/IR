An introduction is given into current lattice investigations of the
non-perturbative gluon and ghost propagators, in the light of the
Gribov-Zwanziger and Kugo-Ojima scenarios of confinement, in the context of
results obtained from the non-perturbative Dyson-Schwinger approach in the
continuum and in connection with the vortex mechanism of confinement.
