Effects of CP violation and of final state interactions between pairs of
pseudoscalar mesons are studied in three-body B+, B-, B0 and antiB0 decays into
K pi pi. An alternative approach to the isobar model for three-body B decays is
proposed. It is based on the QCD factorization approximation and the knowledge
of the meson-meson form factors. Some phenomenological charming penguin
amplitudes are needed to describe the branching fractions, direct CP
asymmetries of the quasi-two-body B --> K*(892) pi and B --> K0*(1430) pi
decays as well as the K pi effective mass and the helicity angle distributions.
The experimental branching fractions for the B --> K0*(1430) pi decay, obtained
by the Belle and BaBar collaborations using the isobar model, are larger than
our predictions by about 52 per cent.
