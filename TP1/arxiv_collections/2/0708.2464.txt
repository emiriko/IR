The experimental data on inclusive cross sections of jet, direct photon and
hadron production in pp/antipp and AA collisions at RHIC and Tevatron are
analyzed in the framework of z-scaling. Results of analysis are compared with
data obtained at ISR, SppS and Tevatron. The properties of z-presentation of
experimental data are verified. Physical interpretation of the scaling function
and variable z is discussed. The locality, self-similarity and fractality are
argued to reflect the general structure of the colliding objects, interaction
of their constituents and particle formation at small scales. The obtained
results suggest that the z-scaling may be used as a tool for searching for new
physics phenomena beyond Standard Model in hadron and nucleus collisions at
high transverse momentum and high multiplicity at U70, RHIC, Tevatron and LHC.
