Excited states of the neutron deficient $^{103}$Cd nucleus have been
investigated via the $^{72}$Ge($^{35}$Cl, p3n) reaction at beam energy of 135
MeV by use of in-beam spectroscopic methods. Gamma rays depopulating the
excited states were detected using the Gammasphere spectrometer with high-fold
$\gamma$-ray coincidences. A quadrupole $\gamma$-ray coincidence analysis
($\gamma^{4}$) has been used to extend the known level scheme. The positive
parity levels have been established up to $J = 35/2\hbar$ and $E_{x} = 7.071$
MeV. In addition to the observation of highly-fragmented level scheme belonging
to the positive-parity sequences at E$_{x}\sim$ 5 MeV, the termination of a
negative-parity sequence connected by $E2$ transitions has been established at
$J = 47/2 \hbar$ and $E_{x} = 11.877$ MeV. The experimental results
corresponding to both the positive- and negative-parity sequences have been
theoretically interpreted in the framework of the core particle coupling model.
Evidence is presented for a shape change from collective prolate to
non-collective oblate above the $J^{\pi} = 39/2^{-}$ (8011 keV) level and for a
smooth termination of the negative-parity band.
