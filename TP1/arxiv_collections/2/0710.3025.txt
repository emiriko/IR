Using magnetization, specific heat and neutron scattering measurements, as
well as exact calculations on realistic models, the magnetic properties of the
\lacuvo compound are characterized on a wide temperature range. At high
temperature, this oxide is well described by strongly correlated atomic $S$=1/2
spins while decreasing the temperature it switches to a set of weakly
interacting and randomly distributed entangled pseudo spins $\tilde S=1/2$ and
$\tilde S=0$. These pseudo-spins are built over frustrated clusters, similar to
the kagom\'e building block, at the vertices of a triangular superlattice, the
geometrical frustration intervening then at different scales.
