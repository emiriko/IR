The infrared conductivity of V2O3 is measured in the whole phase diagram.
Quasiparticles appear above the Neel temperature TN and eventually disappear
further enhancing the temperature, leading to a pseudogap in the optical
spectrum above 425 K. Our calculations demonstrate that this loss of coherence
can be explained only if the temperature dependence of lattice parameters is
considered. V2O3 is therefore effectively driven from the metallic to the
insulating side of the Mott transition as the temperature is increased.
