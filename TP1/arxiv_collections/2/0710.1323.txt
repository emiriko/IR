We study higher-dimensional analogs of the Dedekind-Carlitz polynomials
c(u,v;a,b) := sum_{k=1..b-1} u^[ka/b] v^(k-1), where u and v are indeterminates
and a and b are positive integers. Carlitz proved that these polynomials
satisfy the reciprocity law (v-1) c(u,v;a,b) + (u-1) c(v,u;b,a) = u^(a-1)
v^(b-1) - 1, from which one easily deduces many classical reciprocity theorems
for the Dedekind sum and its generalizations. We illustrate that
Dedekind-Carlitz polynomials appear naturally in generating functions of
rational cones and use this fact to give geometric proofs of the Carlitz
reciprocity law and various extensions of it. Our approach gives rise to new
reciprocity theorems and computational complexity results for Dedekind-Carlitz
polynomials, a characterization of Dedekind-Carlitz polynomials in terms of
generating functions of lattice points in triangles, and a multivariate
generalization of the Mordell-Pommersheim theorem on the appearance of Dedekind
sums in Ehrhart polynomials of 3-dimensional lattice polytopes.
