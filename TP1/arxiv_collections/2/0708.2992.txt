We propose a cheat sensitive quantum protocol to perform a private search on
a classical database which is efficient in terms of communication complexity.
It allows a user to retrieve an item from the server in possession of the
database without revealing which item she retrieved: if the server tries to
obtain information on the query, the person querying the database can find it
out. Furthermore our protocol ensures perfect data privacy of the database,
i.e. the information that the user can retrieve in a single queries is bounded
and does not depend on the size of the database. With respect to the known
(quantum and classical) strategies for private information retrieval, our
protocol displays an exponential reduction both in communication complexity and
in running-time computational complexity.
