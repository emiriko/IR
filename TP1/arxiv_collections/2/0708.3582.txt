This paper provides a new, decidable definition of the higher- order
recursive path ordering in which type comparisons are made only when needed,
therefore eliminating the need for the computability clo- sure, and bound
variables are handled explicitly, making it possible to handle recursors for
arbitrary strictly positive inductive types.
