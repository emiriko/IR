The process gg -> h_0 -> gamma gamma is studied in the Lee-Wick extension of
the Standard Model (LWSM) proposed by Grinstein, O'Connell and Wise. In this
model negative norm partners for each SM field are introduced with the aim to
cancel quadratic divergences in the Higgs mass. All sectors of the model
relevant to gg -> h_0 -> gamma gamma are diagonalized and results are commented
on from the perspective of both the Lee-Wick and higher derivative formalisms.
Deviations from the SM rate for gg -> h_0 are found to be of the order of 15% -
5% for Lee-Wick masses in the range 500GeV - 1000GeV. Effects on the rate for
h_0-> gamma gamma are smaller, of the order of 5% - 1% for Lee-Wick masses in
the same range. These comparatively small changes may well provide a means of
distinguishing the LWSM from other models such as universal extra dimensions
where same-spin partners to Standard Model fields also appear. Corrections to
determinations of CKM elements |V_{t(b,s,d)}| are also considered and are shown
to be positive, allowing the possibility of measuring a CKM element larger than
unity, a characteristic signature of the ghost-like nature of the Lee-Wick
fields.
