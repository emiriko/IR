Size-selected silver clusters on Ag(111) were fabricated with the tip of a
scanning tunneling microscope. Unoccupied electron resonances give rise to
image contrast and spectral features which shift toward the Fermi level with
increasing cluster size. Linear assemblies exhibit higher resonance energies
than equally sized compact assemblies. Density functional theory calculations
reproduce the observed energies and enable an assignment of the resonances to
hybridized atomic 5s and 5p orbitals with silver substrate states.
