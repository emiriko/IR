Chudnovsky recently proposed (arXiv: 0709.0725) a beautifully simple
mechanism for the intrinsic spin Hall effect involving an extension of the
Drude model. We point out that an equivalent proposal was made by us in an
alternative treatment of the problem in Phys.Rev. B60, 14787 (1999)
(arXiv:cond-mat/9910408, reaching identical conclusions. The coincidence of
both approaches supports their physical validity. The mechanism applies to the
spin Hall effect in all metals and semiconductors and to the anomalous Hall
effect in all ferromagnetic metals and semiconductors.
