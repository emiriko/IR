Language is one of the most important aspects of human cognition; it
represents the way we think, act and communicate with each other. Each language
has its own history, background, and form. A language represents a lot of
important cultural aspects of the nation speaking it. Languages differ and so
do cultures. In this paper we analyze cultural differences between East and
West in a multi-linguistic context from a complex networks point of view. There
has been considerable work on the topic of cultural differences by psychologist
and sociologist. Also studies on complex networks that make use of WordNet have
been done, but until now there is no previous work that uses WordNets from
different Eastern and Western languages as complex lexical networks in order to
obtain possible differences or similarities between the cultures using those
respective languages. Our work aims to do this.
