Parton equilibration for a thermally equilibrated but chemically
non-equilibrated quark gluon plasma is presented. Parton equilibration is
studied enforcing baryon numbver conservation. Process like quark flavour
interchanging is also considered. The degree of equilibration is studied
comparatively for the various reactions / constraints that are being
considered.
