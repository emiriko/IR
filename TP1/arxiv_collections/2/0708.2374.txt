The temperature dependence of the London penetration depth \lambda was
measured for an untwined single crystal of YBa_2Cu_3O_{7-\delta} along the
three principal crystallographic directions (a, b, and c). Both in-plane
components (\lambda_a and \lambda_b) show an inflection point in their
temperature dependence which is absent in the component along the c-direction
(\lambda_c). The data provide convincing evidence that the in-plane
superconducting order parameter is a mixture of s+d-wave symmetry whereas it is
exclusively s-wave along the c-direction. In conjunction with previous results
it is concluded that coupled s+d-order parameters are universal and intrinsic
to cuprate superconductors.
