We introduce and study a noncommutative two-parameter family of
noncommutative Brownian motions in the free Fock space. They are associated
with Kesten laws and give a continuous interpolation between Brownian motions
in free probability and monotone probability. The combinatorics of our model is
based on ordered non-crossing partitions, in which to each such partition $P$
we assign a weight depending on the numbers of disorders and orders in $P$
related to the natural partial order on the set of blocks of $P$ implemented by
the relation of being inner or outer. In particular, we obtain a simple
relation between Delaney's numbers (related to inner blocks in non-crossing
partitions) and generalized Euler's numbers (related to orders and disorders in
ordered non-crossing partitions). An important feature of our interpolation is
that the mixed moments of the corresponding creation and annihilation processes
also reproduce their monotone and free counterparts, which does not take place
in other interpolations. The same combinatorics is used to construct an
interpolation between free and monotone Poisson processes.
