We investigate the dynamics of the population transfer for atom-molecule
three-level $\Lambda$-system on stimulated Raman adiabatic passage(STIRAP). We
find that the adiabatic fidelity for the coherent population trapping(CPT)
state or dark state, as the function of the adiabatic parameter, approaches to
unit in a power law. The power exponent however is much less than the
prediction of linear adiabatic theorem. We further discuss how to achieve
higher adiabatic fidelity for the dark state through optimizing the external
parameters of STIRAP. Our discussions are helpful to gain higher atom-molecule
conversion yield in practical experiments.
