A probabilistic method for solving the Monge-Kantorovich mass transport
problem on $R^d$ is introduced. A system of empirical measures of independent
particles is built in such a way that it obeys a doubly indexed large deviation
principle with an optimal transport cost as its rate function. As a
consequence, new approximation results for the optimal cost function and the
optimal transport plans are derived. They follow from the Gamma-convergence of
a sequence of normalized relative entropies toward the optimal transport cost.
A wide class of cost functions including the standard power cost functions
$|x-y|^p$ enter this framework.
