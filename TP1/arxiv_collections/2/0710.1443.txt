Let g be a complex semisimple Lie algebra and let G' be the Langlands dual
group. We give a description of the cohomology algebra of an arbitrary
spherical Schubert variety in the loop Grassmannian for G' as a quotient of the
form Sym(g^e)/J. Here, J is an appropriate ideal in the symmetric algebra of
g^e, the centralizer of a principal nilpotent in g.
  We also discuss a `topological' proof of Kostant's famous result on the
structure of the polynomial algebra on g.
