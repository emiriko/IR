We give the analytic expressions of maximal probabilities of successfully
controlled teleportating an unknown qubit via every kind of tripartite states.
Besides, another kind of localizable entanglement is also determined.
Furthermore, we give the sufficient and necessary condition that a three-qubit
state can be collapsed to an EPR pair by a measurement on one qubit, and
characterize the three-qubit states that can be used as quantum channel for
controlled teleporting a qubit of unknown information with unit probability and
with unit fidelity.
