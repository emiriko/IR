The associated production of a Higgs boson with a b quark is a discovery mode
for an MSSM Higgs boson at large tan beta. We compute the SUSY QCD corrections
from gluino and squark loops to this process and combine them with the order
alpha_s^2 NLO QCD corrections to obtain reliable predictions for the rate.
Finally, we compare our results with an effective Lagrangian approximation
which includes only the low energy corrections from squark and gluino loops to
the b- bbar- Higgs vertices.
