Computationalism provides a framework for understanding how a mathematically
describable physical world could give rise to conscious observations without
the need for dualism. A criterion is proposed for the implementation of
computations by physical systems, which has been a problem for
computationalism. Together with an independence criterion for implementations
this would allow, in principle, prediction of probabilities for various
observations based on counting implementations. Applied to quantum mechanics,
this results in a Many Computations Interpretation (MCI), which is an explicit
form of the Everett style Many Worlds Interpretation (MWI). Derivation of the
Born Rule emerges as the central problem for most realist interpretations of
quantum mechanics. If the Born Rule is derived based on computationalism and
the wavefunction it would provide strong support for the MWI; but if the Born
Rule is shown not to follow from these to an experimentally falsified extent,
it would indicate the necessity for either new physics or (more radically) new
philosophy of mind.
