We describe and analyze an efficient register-based hybrid quantum
computation scheme. Our scheme is based on probabilistic, heralded optical
connection among local five-qubit quantum registers. We assume high fidelity
local unitary operations within each register, but the error probability for
initialization, measurement, and entanglement generation can be very high
(~5%). We demonstrate that with a reasonable time overhead our scheme can
achieve deterministic non-local coupling gates between arbitrary two registers
with very high fidelity, limited only by the imperfections from the local
unitary operation. We estimate the clock cycle and the effective error
probability for implementation of quantum registers with ion-traps or
nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers. Our new scheme capitalizes on a new efficient
two-level pumping scheme that in principle can create Bell pairs with
arbitrarily high fidelity. We introduce a Markov chain model to study the
stochastic process of entanglement pumping and map it to a deterministic
process. Finally we discuss requirements for achieving fault-tolerant operation
with our register-based hybrid scheme, and also present an alternative approach
to fault-tolerant preparation of GHZ states.
