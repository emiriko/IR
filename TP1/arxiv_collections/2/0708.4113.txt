We have presented computer simulations of conoscopic patterns occurring in
optically uniaxial gyrotropic crystals in the vicinity of isotropic point for a
number of sets of crystal parameters and orientations. The appearance of
special directions characterized by equalization of linear and circular
birefringences has been revealed.
