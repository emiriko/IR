In the theory of dynamical Yang-Baxter equation, with any Hopf algebra $H$
and a certain $H$-module and $H$-comodule algebra $L$ (base algebra) one
associates a monoidal category. Given an algebra $A$ in that category, one can
construct an associative algebra $A\rtimes L$, which is a generalization of the
ordinary smash product when $A$ is an ordinary $H$-algebra. We study this
"dynamical smash product" and its modules induced from one-dimensional
representation of the subalgebra $L$. In particular, we construct an analog of
the Galois map $A\otimes_{A^H} A\to A\otimes H^*$.
