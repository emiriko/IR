In this paper a new class of generalized backward doubly stochastic
differential equations is investigated. This class involves an integral with
respect to an adapted continuous increasing process. A probabilistic
representation for viscosity solutions of semi-linear stochastic partial
differential equations with a Neumann boundary condition is given.
