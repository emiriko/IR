The hypothesis that gravitational self-binding energy may be the source for
the vacuum energy term of cosmology is studied in a Newtonian Ansatz. For
spherical spaces the attractive force of gravitation and the negative pressure
of the vacuum energy term form a self stabilizing system under very reasonable
restrictions for the parameters, among them a characteristic coefficient \beta
of self energy. In the Weyl geometric approach to cosmological redshift,
Einstein-Weyl universes with observational restrictions of the curvature
parameters are dynamically stable, if \beta is about 40 % smaller than in the
exact Newton Ansatz or if the space geometry is elliptical.
