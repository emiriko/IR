The calculation of self-energy corrections to the electron bands of a metal
requires the evaluation of the intraband contribution to the polarizability in
the small-q limit. When neglected, as in standard GW codes for semiconductors
and insulators, a spurious gap opens at the Fermi energy. Systematic methods to
include intraband contributions to the polarizability exist, but require a
computationally intensive Fermi-surface integration. We propose a numerically
cheap and stable method, based on a fit of the power expansion of the
polarizability in the small-q region. We test it on the homogeneous electron
gas and on real metals such as sodium and aluminum.
