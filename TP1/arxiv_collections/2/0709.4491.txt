The couplings of charmonia and charmonium hybrids (generically Psi) to ppbar
are of great interest in view of future plans to study these states using an
antiproton storage ring at GSI. These low to moderate energy Psi-ppbar
couplings are not well understood theoretically, and currently must be
determined from experiment. In this letter we note that the two independent
Dirac (gamma_mu) and Pauli (sigma_munu) ppbar couplings of the J/psi and psi'
can be constrained by the angular distribution of e+e- -> (J/psi, psi') ->
ppbar on resonance. A comparison of our theoretical results to recent
unpolarized data allows estimates of the ppbar couplings; in the better
determined J/psi case the data is inconsistent with a pure Dirac (gamma_mu)
coupling, and can be explained by the presence of a sigma_munu term. This Pauli
coupling may significantly affect the cross section of the PANDA process p pbar
-> pi0 J/psi near threshold. There is a phase ambiguity that makes it
impossible to uniquely determine the magnitudes and relative phase of the Dirac
and Pauli couplings from the unpolarized angular distributions alone; we show
in detail how this can be resolved through a study of the polarized reactions.
