We study signals at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) for Kaluza-Klein (KK)
excitations of the electroweak gauge bosons in the framework with the Standard
Model (SM) gauge and fermion fields propagating in a warped extra dimension.
Such a framework addresses both the Planck-weak and flavor hierarchy problems
of the SM. Unlike the often studied Z' cases, in this framework, there are
three neutral gauge bosons due to the underlying SU(2)_L x SU(2)_R x U(1)_X
gauge group in the bulk. Furthermore, couplings of these KK states to light
quarks and leptons are suppressed, whereas those to top and bottom quarks are
enhanced compared to the SM gauge couplings. Therefore, the production of light
quark and lepton states is suppressed relative to other beyond the SM
constructions, and the fermionic decays of these states are dominated by the
top and bottom quarks, which are, though, overwhelmed by KK gluons dominantly
decaying into them. However, as we emphasize in this paper, decays of these
states to longitudinal W, Z and Higgs are also enhanced similarly to the case
of top and bottom quarks. We show that the W, Z and Higgs final states can give
significant sensitivity at the LHC to 2 (3) TeV KK scale with an integrated
luminosity of 100 invfb (1 invab). Since current theoretical framework(s) favor
KK masses greater than about 3 TeV, luminosity upgrade of LHC is likely to be
crucial in observing these states.
