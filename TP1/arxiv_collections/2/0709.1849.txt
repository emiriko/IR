In this paper new characterization equipment for thermal interface materials
is presented. Thermal management of electronic products relies on the
effec-tive dissipation of heat. This can be achieved by the optimization of the
system design with the help of simulation methods. The precision of these
models relies also on the used material data. For the determi-nation of this
data an experimental set-up for a static measurement is presented, which
evaluates thermal conductivity and interface resistance of thermal inter-face
materials (e.g. adhesive, solder, pads, or pastes). A qualitative
structure-property correlation is pro-posed taking into account particle size,
filler content and void formation at the interface based on high resolution FIB
imaging. The paper gives an overview over the set-up and the measurement
technique and discusses experimental and simulation results.
