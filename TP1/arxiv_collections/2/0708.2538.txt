We compare the recent results on the higher twist (HT) contribution to the
nonsinglet combination $g_1^p - g_1^n$ of the polarized proton and neutron
structure functions with that one to the unpolarized structure function $F_3$
using the assumption that the HT contributions to the Gross-Llewellyn Smith and
the Bjorken sum rules are similar. We have found, that the relation
${1/3}h^{F_3}(x) \approx \frac{6}{g_A}h^{g_1^p - g_1^n}(x)$ is valid for $x
\geq 0.2$ in the case of NLO QCD approximation for the leading term parts of
the structure functions.
