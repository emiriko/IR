If the observable universe really is a hologram, then of what sort? Is it
rich enough to keep track of an eternally inflating multiverse? What physical
and mathematical principles underlie it? Is the hologram a lower dimensional
quantum field theory, and if so, how many dimensions are explicit, and how many
"emerge?" Does the Holographic description provide clues for defining a
probability measure on the Landscape?
  The purpose of this lecture is first, to briefly review a proposal for a
holographic cosmology by Freivogel, Sekino, Susskind, and Yeh (FSSY), and then
to develop a physical interpretation in terms of a "Cosmic Census Taker:" an
idea introduced in reference [1]. The mathematical structure--a hybrid of the
Wheeler DeWitt formalism and holography--is a boundary "Liouville" field
theory, whose UV/IR duality is closely related to the time evolution of the
Census Taker's observations. That time evolution is represented by the
renormalization-group flow of the Liouville theory.
  Although quite general, the Census Taker idea was originally introduced in
\cite{shenker}, for the purpose of counting bubbles that collide with the
Census Taker's bubble. The "Persistence of Memory" phenomenon discovered by
Garriga, Guth, and Vilenkin, has a natural RG interpretation, as does slow roll
inflation. The RG flow and the related C-theorem are closely connected with
generalized entropy bounds.
