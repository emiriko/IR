The complementary principle of quantum mechanics relates qualitatively the
visibility of quantum interference with path indistinguishability. Here we
propose a scheme of constructive quantum interference involving superposition
between an $N$-photon state and a single-photon state to characterize
quantitatively the degree of temporal distinguishability of the $N$-photon
state. This scheme is based on a generalized photon bunching effect. Such a
scheme can be extended to other more general cases.
