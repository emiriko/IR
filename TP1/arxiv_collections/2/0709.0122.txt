The performance of short distance optical interconnections in general relies
very strongly on coupling structures, since they will determine the overall
efficiency of the system to a large extent. Different configurations can be
considered and a variety of manufacturing technologies can be used. We present
two different discrete and two different integrated coupling components which
can be used to deflect the light beam over 90 degrees and can play a crucial
role when integrating optical interconnections in printed circuit boards. The
fabrication process of the different coupling structures is discussed and
experimental results are shown. The main characteristics of the coupling
structures are given. The main advantages and disadvantages of the different
components are discussed.
