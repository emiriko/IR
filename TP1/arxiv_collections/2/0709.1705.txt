We report a high-resolution resonant inelastic x-ray scattering study of
La2CuO4. A number of spectral features are identified that were not clearly
visible in earlier lower-resolution data. The momentum dependence of the
spectral weight and the dispersion of the lowest energy excitation across the
insulating gap have been measured in detail. The temperature dependence of the
spectral features was also examined. The observed charge transfer edge shift,
along with the low dispersion of the first charge transfer excitation are
attributed to the lattice motion being coupled to the electronic system. In
addition, we observe a dispersionless feature at 1.8 eV, which is associated
with a d-d crystal field excitation.
