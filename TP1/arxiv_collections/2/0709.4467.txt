A continuous-time financial portfolio selection model with expected utility
maximization typically boils down to solving a (static) convex stochastic
optimization problem in terms of the terminal wealth, with a budget constraint.
In literature the latter is solved by assuming {\it a priori} that the problem
is well-posed (i.e., the supremum value is finite) and a Lagrange multiplier
exists (and as a consequence the optimal solution is attainable). In this paper
it is first shown, via various counter-examples, neither of these two
assumptions needs to hold, and an optimal solution does not necessarily exist.
These anomalies in turn have important interpretations in and impacts on the
portfolio selection modeling and solutions. Relations among the non-existence
of the Lagrange multiplier, the ill-posedness of the problem, and the
non-attainability of an optimal solution are then investigated. Finally,
explicit and easily verifiable conditions are derived which lead to finding the
unique optimal solution.
