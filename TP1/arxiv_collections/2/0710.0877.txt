Epitaxial films of graphene on SiC(0001) are interesting from a basic physics
as well as applications-oriented point of view. Here we study the emerging
morphology of in-vacuo prepared graphene films using low energy electron
microscopy (LEEM) and angle-resolved photoemission (ARPES). We obtain an
identification of single and bilayer of graphene film by comparing the
characteristic features in electron reflectivity spectra in LEEM to the PI-band
structure as revealed by ARPES. We demonstrate that LEEM serves as a tool to
accurately determine the local extent of graphene layers as well as the layer
thickness.
