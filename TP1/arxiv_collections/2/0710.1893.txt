Employing data on the assessed value of land in 1974--2007 Japan, we exhibit
a quasistatically varying log-normal distribution in the middle scale region.
In the derivation, a Non-Gibrat's law under the detailed quasi-balance is
adopted together with two approximations. The resultant distribution is
power-law with the varying exponent in the large scale region and the
quasistatic log-normal distribution with the varying standard deviation in the
middle scale region. In the distribution, not only the change of the exponent
but also the change of the standard deviation depends on the parameter of the
detailed quasi-balance. These results are consistently confirmed by the
empirical data.
