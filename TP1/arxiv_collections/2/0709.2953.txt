For any quantum discrete memoryless channel, we define a quantity called
quantum entanglement capacity with classical feedback ($E_B$), and we show that
this quantity lies between two other well-studied quantities. These two
quantities - namely the quantum capacity assisted by two-way classical
communication ($Q_2$) and the quantum capacity with classical feedback ($Q_B$)
- are widely conjectured to be different: there exists quantum discrete
memoryless channel for which $Q_2>Q_B$. We then present a general scheme to
convert any quantum error-correcting codes into adaptive protocols for this
newly-defined quantity of the quantum depolarizing channel, and illustrate with
Cat (repetition) code and Shor code. We contrast the present notion with
entanglement purification protocols by showing that whilst the Leung-Shor
protocol can be applied directly, recurrence methods need to be supplemented
with other techniques but at the same time offer a way to improve the
aforementioned Cat code. For the quantum depolarizing channel, we prove a
formula that gives lower bounds on the quantum capacity with classical feedback
from any $E_B$ protocols. We then apply this formula to the $E_B$ protocols
that we discuss to obtain new lower bounds on the quantum capacity with
classical feedback of the quantum depolarizing channel.
