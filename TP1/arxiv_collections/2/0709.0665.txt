Multiplicity distributions of hadrons produced in central nucleus-nucleus
collisions are studied within the hadron-resonance gas model in the large
volume limit. In the canonical ensemble conservation of three charges (baryon
number, electric charge, and strangeness) is enforced. In addition, in the
micro-canonical ensemble energy conservation is included. An analytical method
is used to account for resonance decays. Multiplicity distributions and scaled
variances for negatively charged hadrons are presented along the chemical
freeze-out line of central Pb+Pb (Au+Au) collisions from SIS to LHC energies.
Predictions obtained within different statistical ensembles are compared with
preliminary NA49 experimental results on central Pb+Pb collisions in the SPS
energy range. The measured fluctuations are significantly narrower than a
Poisson reference distribution, and clearly favor expectations for the
micro-canonical ensemble.
