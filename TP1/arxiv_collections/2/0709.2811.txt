The purpose of the present study was to determine the effects of a plantar
pressure-based, tongue-placed tactile biofeedback on postural control
mechanisms during quiet standing. To this aim, sixteen young healthy adults
were asked to stand as immobile as possible with their eyes closed in two
conditions of No-biofeedback and Biofeedback. Centre of foot pressure (CoP)
displacements, recorded using a force platform, were used to compute the
horizontal displacements of the vertical projection the centre of gravity
(CoGh) and those of the difference between the CoP and the vertical projection
of the CoG (CoP-CoGv). Altogether, the present findings suggest that the main
way the plantar pressure-based, tongue-placed tactile biofeedback improves
postural control during quiet standing is via both a reduction of the
correction thresholds and an increased efficiency of the corrective mechanism
involving the CoGh displacements.
