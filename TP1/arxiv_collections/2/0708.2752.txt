We show that if over some number field there exists a certain diagonal plane
cubic curve that is locally solvable everywhere, but that does not have points
over any cubic galois extension of the number field, then the algebraic part of
the Brauer-Manin obstruction is not the only obstruction to the Hasse principle
for K3 surfaces.
