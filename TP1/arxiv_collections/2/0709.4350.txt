The question in the title, first raised by Goldman and Donaldson, was
partially answered by Reznikov. We give a complete answer, as follows: if G can
be realized as both the fundamental group of a closed 3-manifold and of a
compact K\"ahler manifold, then G must be finite, and thus belongs to the
well-known list of finite subgroups of O(4).
