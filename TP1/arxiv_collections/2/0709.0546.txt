We introduce and give normal forms for (one-dimensional) Riccati foliations
(vector fields) on $\ov \bc \times \bc P(2)$ and $\ov \bc \times \ov \bc^n$.
These are foliations are characterized by transversality with the generic fiber
of the first projection and we prove they are conjugate {\em in some invariant
Zariski open subset} to the suspension of a group of automorphisms of the
fiber, $\bc P(2)$ or $\ov \bc^n$, this group called {\it global holonomy}. Our
main result states that given a finitely generated subgroup $G$ of $\Aut(\bc P
(2))$, there is a Riccati foliation on $\ov \bc \times \bc P(2)$ for which the
global holonomy is conjugate to $G$.
