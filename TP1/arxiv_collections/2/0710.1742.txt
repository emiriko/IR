We evaluate the predictive power of the neutrino mass matrices arising from
seesaw mechanism with heavy Majorana mass matrices subject to texture zero and
satisfy a cyclic permutation invariant form to the solar neutrino mixing
phenomena. From eight possible patterns of heavy Majorana neutrino mass matrix,
we found that there is no heavy Majorana neutrino mass matrix to be invariant
in form under a cyclic permutation. But, by imposing an additional assumption
that at least one of the 2x2 sub-matrices of heavy Majorana neutrino mass
matrix inverse having zero determinant, we found that only two of the eight
possible patterns for heavy Majorana neutrino mass matrices to be invariant
under a cyclic permutation. One of the two invariant heavy Majorana neutrino
mass matrices could produces neutrino mass matrix $M_{\nu}$ that can be used to
explain the neutrino mixing phenomena for both solar and atmospheric neutrinos
qualitatively.
