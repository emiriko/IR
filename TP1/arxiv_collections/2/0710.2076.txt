The controlled motion of objects through narrow channels is important in many
fields. We have fabricated asymmetric weak-pinning channels in a
superconducting thin-film strip for controlling the dynamics of vortices. The
lack of pinning allows the vortices to move through the channels with the
dominant interaction determined by the shape of the channel walls. We present
measurements of vortex dynamics in the channels and compare these with similar
measurements on a set of uniform-width channels. While the uniform-width
channels exhibit a symmetric response for both directions through the channel,
the vortex motion through the asymmetric channels is quite different, with
substantial asymmetries in both the static depinning and dynamic flux flow.
This vortex ratchet effect has a rich dependence on magnetic field and driving
force amplitude.
