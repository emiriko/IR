It is well established that lattice artifacts can be suppressed substantially
by the use of SU(3)-projected smeared links in the fermion action. An example
is the Highly Improved Staggered Quark action where the ASQ-like effective
links are constructed from reunitarized Fat7 links. A general procedure is
presented for computing the derivative of the fermion action with respect to
the base links (fermion force) - a key component in dynamical simulations using
molecular dynamics evolution. The method is iterative and can be applied to
actions with arbitrary levels of smearing and reunitarization. The cost of
calculating the fermion force is determined for the ASQ action and the HISQ
action. Test results show that calculating the HISQ force is about two times
more expensive than the ASQ force.
