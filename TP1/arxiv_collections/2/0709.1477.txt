Conditions are provided under which an endomorphism on quasisymmetric
functions gives rise to a left random walk on the descent algebra which is also
a lumping of a left random walk on permutations. Spectral results are also
obtained. Several well-studied random walks are now realized this way:
Stanley's QS-distribution results from endomorphisms given by evaluation maps,
a-shuffles result from the a-th convolution power of the universal character,
and the Tchebyshev operator of the second kind introduced recently by Ehrenborg
and Readdy yields traditional riffle shuffles. A conjecture of Ehrenborg
regarding the spectra for a family of random walks on ab-words is proven. A
theorem of Stembridge from the theory of enriched P-partitions is also
recovered as a special case.
