A numerical analysis for the Meissner mass in the simplest gluonic phase (the
minimal cylindrical gluonic phase II) is performed in the framework of the
gauged Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model with cold two-flavor quark matter. We derive
Meissner mass formulae without using the numerical second derivative. It is
revealed that the gapless mode yields a characterized contribution to the
Meissner mass. We also find that there are large and positive contributions
from the tree gluon potential term to the transverse modes of gluons. It is
shown that the simplest gluonic phase resolves the chromomagnetic instability
in a rather wide region.
