We present a measurement of the correlated $b\bar{b}$ production cross
section. The data used in this analysis were taken with the upgraded CDF
detector (CDF II) at the Fermilab Tevatron collider, and correspond to an
integrated luminosity of 742 pb$^{-1}$. We utilize muon pairs with invariant
mass $5 \leq m_{\mu\mu} \leq 80
  \gevcc$ produced by $b\bar{b}$ double semileptonic decays. For muons with
$p_T \geq 3 \gevc$ and $|\eta| \leq 0.7$, that are produced by $b$ and
$\bar{b}$ quarks with $p_T \geq 2 \gevc$ and $|y| \leq 1.3$, we measure
$\sigma_{b\to\mu,\bar{b}\to \mu}= 1549 \pm 133$ pb. We compare this result with
theoretical predictions and previous measurements. We also report the
measurement of $\sigma_{c\to\mu,\bar{c}\to \mu}$, a by-product of the study of
the background to $b\bar{b}$ production.
