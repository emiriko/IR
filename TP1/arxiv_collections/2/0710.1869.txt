We present a variant of the warped extra dimension, Randall-Sundrum (RS),
framework which is based on five dimensional (5D) minimal flavor violation
(MFV), in which the only sources of flavor breaking are two 5D anarchic Yukawa
matrices. The Yukawa matrices also control the bulk masses, which are
responsible for the resulting flavor structure and mass hierarchy in the low
energy theory. An interesting result of this set-up is that at low energies the
theory flows to next to MFV model where flavor violation is dominantly coming
from the third generation. Low energy flavor violation is further suppressed by
a single parameter that dials the amount of violation in the up or down sector.
There is therefore a sharp limit in which there is no flavor violation in the
down type quark sector which, remarkably, is favored when we fit for the flavor
parameters. This mechanism is used to eliminate the current RS flavor and CP
problem even with a Kaluza-Klein scale as low as 2 TeV! Our construction also
suggests that economic supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric, strong
dynamic-based, flavor models may be built based on the same concepts.
