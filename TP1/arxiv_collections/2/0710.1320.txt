We study the quantum walk subjected to measurements with a L\'evy
waiting-time distribution. We find that the system has a sub-ballistic behavior
instead of a diffusive one. We obtain an analytical expression for the exponent
of the power law of the variance as a function of the characteristic parameter
of the L\'evy distribution.
