High magnetic field study of Hall resistivity in the ferromagnetic phase of
(In,Mn)Sb allows one to separate its normal and anomalous components. We show
that the anomalous Hall term is not proportional to the magnetization, and that
it even changes sign as a function of magnetic field. We also show that the
application of pressure modifies the scattering process, but does not influence
the Hall effect. These observations suggest that the anomalous Hall effect in
(In,Mn)Sb is an intrinsic property and support the application of the Berry
phase theory for (III,Mn)V semiconductors. We propose a phenomenological
description of the anomalous Hall conductivity, based on a field-dependent
relative shift of the heavy- and light-hole valence bands and the split-off
band.
