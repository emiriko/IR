The infinite gravitational collapse of any supermassive stars should pass
through an energy scale of the grand unified theory (GUT). After
nucleon-decays, the supermassive star will convert nearly all its mass into
energy, and produce the radiation of GUT. It may probably explain some
ultrahigh energy puzzles in astrophysics, for example, quasars and gamma-ray
bursts (GRB), etc. This is similar with a process of the Big Bang Universe with
a time-reversal evolution in much smaller space scale and mass scale. In this
process the star seems be a true white hole.
