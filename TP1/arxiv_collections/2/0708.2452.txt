We study theoretically a novel drug delivery system that utilizes the
overexpression of certain proteins in cancerous cells for cell specific
chemotherapy. The system consists of dendrimers conjugated with "keys" (ex:
folic acid) which "key-lock" bind to particular cell membrane proteins (ex:
folate receptor). The increased concentration of "locks" on the surface leads
to a longer residence time for the dendrimer and greater incorporation into the
cell. Cooperative binding of the nanocomplexes leads to an enhancement of cell
specificity. However, both our theory and detailed analysis of in-vitro
experiments indicate that the degree of cooperativity is kinetically limited.
We demonstrate that cooperativity and hence the specificity to particular cell
type can be increased by making the strength of individual bonds weaker, and
suggest a particular implementation of this idea. The implications of the work
for optimizing the design of drug delivery vehicles are discussed.
