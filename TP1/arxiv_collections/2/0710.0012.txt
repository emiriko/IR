Let G/K be a Riemannian symmetric space of the complex type, meaning that G
is complex semisimple and K is a compact real form. Now let {\Gamma} be a
discrete subgroup of G that acts freely and cocompactly on G/K. We consider the
Segal--Bargmann transform, defined in terms of the heat equation, on the
compact quotient {\Gamma}\G/K. We obtain isometry and inversion formulas
precisely parallel to the results we obtained previously for globally symmetric
spaces of the complex type. Our results are as parallel as possible to the
results one has in the dual compact case. Since there is no known Gutzmer
formula in this setting, our proofs make use of double coset integrals and a
holomorphic change of variable.
