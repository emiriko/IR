In this talk we argue that the breakdown of global symmetries in no--scale
supergravity (SUGRA), which ensures the vanishing of the vacuum energy density
near the physical vacuum, leads to a natural realisation of the multiple point
principle (MPP). In the MPP inspired SUGRA models the cosmological constant is
naturally tiny.
