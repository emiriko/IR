A hypothesis of the evolution of the genetic code is proposed, the leading
mechanism of which is the nucleotide spontaneous damage leading to
AT-enrichment of the genome. The hypothesis accounts for stability of the
genetic code towards point mutations, the presence of code dialects, and the
symmetry of the genetic code table.
