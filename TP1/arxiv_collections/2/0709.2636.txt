We present a detailed, realistic proposal and analysis of the implementation
of a cold atom deflector using time-dependent far off-resonance optical guides.
An analytical model and numerical simulations are used to illustrate its
characteristics when applied to both non-degenerate atomic ensembles and to
Bose-Einstein condensates. Using for all relevant parameters values that are
achieved with present technology, we show that it is possible to deflect almost
entirely an ensemble of $^{87}$Rb atoms falling in the gravity field. We
discuss the limits of this proposal, and illustrate its robustness against
non-adiabatic transitions.
