The supersymmetric contributions to the theoretically clean K+ --> pi+ nu nu
bar, KL --> pi0 nu nu bar, KL --> pi0 e+ e- and KL --> pi0 mu+ mu- decays are
briefly reviewed. Particular emphasis is laid on the information one could get
on the MSSM flavor sector from a combined study of the four modes.
