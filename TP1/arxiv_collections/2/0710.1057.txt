Blackman's diagram of two dimensionless ratios of elastic constants is
frequently used to correlate elastic properties of cubic crystals with
interatomic bondings. Every's diagram of a different set of two dimensionless
variables was used by us for classification of various properties of such
crystals. We compare these two ways of characterization of elastic properties
of cubic materials and consider the description of various groups of materials,
e.g. simple metals, oxides, and alkali halides. With exception of intermediate
valent compounds, the correlation coefficients for Every's diagrams of various
groups of materials are greater than for Blackaman's diagrams, revealing the
existence of a linear relationship between two dimensionless Every's variables.
Alignment of elements and compounds along lines of constant Poisson's ratio
$\nu(<100>,\textbf{m})$, ($\textbf{m}$ arbitrary perpendicular to <100>) is
observed. Division of the stability region in Blackman's diagram into region of
complete auxetics, auxetics and non-auxetics is introduced. Correlations of a
scaling and an acoustic anisotropy parameter are considered.
