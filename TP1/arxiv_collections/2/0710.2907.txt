We argue that massless Dirac particles in two spatial dimensions with $1/r$
Coulomb repulsion and quenched random gauge field are described by a manifold
of fixed points which can be accessed perturbatively in disorder and
interaction strength, thereby confirming and extending the results of
arXiv:0707.4171. At small interaction and small randomness, there is an
infra-red stable fixed curve which merges with the strongly interacting
infra-red unstable line at a critical endpoint, along which the dynamical
critical exponent $z=1$.
