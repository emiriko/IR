We present in this talk recent investigations on the nucleon-like resonance
N*(1675) newly found in eta photoproduction by the GRAAL, Tohoku LNS-gamma and
CB-ELSA collaborations. We focus on the production mechanism of the N*(1675),
examining its spin and parity theoretically within the framework of the
effective Lagrangian method. We expliucitly consider D_{13}(1520),
S_{11}(1535), S_{11}(1650), D_{15}(1675), P_{11}(1710), P_{13}(1720) as well as
possible background contributions. We calculate the differential cross sections
and beam asymmetries for the neutron and proton targets. It turns out that
there is manifest isospin asymmetry in eta photoproduction, which can be
explained by the asymmetry in the transition magnetic moments: mu_{gamma p p*}
=<mu_{gamma n n*}. Moreover, we find that the spin-1/2 state is preferred and
this observation implies that the new resonance may be identified as a
non-strangeness member of the baryon antidecuplet.
