In this pedagogical study, carried out by adopting standard mathematical
methods of nonlinear dynamics, we have presented some simple analytical models
to understand terminal behaviour in industrial growth. This issue has also been
addressed from a dynamical systems perspective, with especial emphasis on the
concept of the Balanced Scorecard. Our study enables us to make the general
claim that although the fortunes of an industrial organization can rise with
exponential rapidity on relatively short time scales, its growth will
ultimately and inevitably be saturated on long time scales by various factors
which are nonlinear in character. We have mathematically demonstrated the
likely occurrence of this feature under various possible circumstances,
including the Red Ocean and the Blue Ocean. Finally and most importantly, our
arguments and their associated mathematical modelling have received remarkable
support from the growth pattern indicated by empirical data gathered from a
well-recognized global company like IBM.
