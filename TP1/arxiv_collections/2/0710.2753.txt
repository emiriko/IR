We study the effects of double octupole and quadrupole phonon excitations in
the 144Sm nucleus on quasi-elastic 16O+144Sm scattering at backward angles. To
this end, we use the coupled-channels framework, taking into account explicitly
the anharmonicities of the vibrations. We use the same coupling scheme as that
previously employed to explain the experimental data of sub-barrier fusion
cross sections for the same system. We show that the experimental data for the
quasi-elastic cross sections are well reproduced in this way, although the
quasi-elastic barrier distribution has a distinct high energy peak which is
somewhat smeared in the experimental barrier distribution. We also discuss the
effects of proton transfer on the quasi-elastic barrier distribution. Our study
indicates that the fusion and quasi-elastic barrier distributions for this
system cannot be accounted for simultaneously with the standard
coupled-channels approach.
