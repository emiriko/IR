Based on the high statistics data from the pp -> ppX reaction measured by the
COSY-11 collaboration [1] we have derived a two-proton correlation function for
the production of the ppeta and pp+pions systems. The measured correlation
function normalized to the value simulated for a point-like source was compared
with a theoretical prediction in order to estimate the size of the reaction
volume.
