We prove that every Markov solution to the three dimensional Navier-Stokes
equation with periodic boundary conditions driven by additive Gaussian noise is
uniquely ergodic. The convergence to the (unique) invariant measure is
exponentially fast.
  Moreover, we give a well-posedness criterion for the equations in terms of
invariant measures. We also analyse the energy balance and identify the term
which ensures equality in the balance.
