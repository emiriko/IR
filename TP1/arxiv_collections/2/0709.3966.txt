Surface effects become important in microfluidic setups because the surface
to volume ratio becomes large. In such setups the surface roughness is not any
longer small compared to the length scale of the system and the wetting
properties of the wall have an important influence on the flow. However, the
knowledge about the interplay of surface roughness and hydrophobic
fluid-surface interaction is still very limited because these properties cannot
be decoupled easily in experiments.
  We investigate the problem by means of lattice Boltzmann (LB) simulations of
rough microchannels with a tunable fluid-wall interaction. We introduce an
``effective no-slip plane'' at an intermediate position between peaks and
valleys of the surface and observe how the position of the wall may change due
to surface roughness and hydrophobic interactions.
  We find that the position of the effective wall, in the case of a Gaussian
distributed roughness depends linearly on the width of the distribution.
Further we are able to show that roughness creates a non-linear effect on the
slip length for hydrophobic boundaries.
