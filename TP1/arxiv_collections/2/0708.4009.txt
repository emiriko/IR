We show that the spin-current response of a semiconductor crystal to an
external electric field is considerably more complex than previously assumed.
While in systems of high symmetry only the spin-Hall components are allowed, in
systems of lower symmetry other non-spin-Hall components may be present. We
argue that, when spin-orbit interactions are present only in the band
structure, the distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic contributions to the
spin current is not useful. We show that the generation of spin currents and
that of spin densities in an electric field are closely related, and that our
general theory provides a systematic way to distinguish between them in
experiment. We discuss also the meaning of vertex corrections in systems with
spin-orbit interactions.
