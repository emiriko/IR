We present transverse momentum (p_T) spectra of charged hadrons measured in
deuteron-gold and nucleon-gold collisions at \sqrts = 200 GeV for four
centrality classes. Nucleon-gold collisions were selected by tagging events in
which a spectator nucleon was observed in one of two forward rapidity
detectors. The spectra and yields were investigated as a function of the number
of binary nucleon-nucleon collisions, \nu, suffered by deuteron nucleons. A
comparison of charged particle yields to those in p+p collisions show that the
yield per nucleon-nucleon collision saturates with \nu for high momentum
particles. We also present the charged hadron to neutral pion ratios as a
function of p_T.
