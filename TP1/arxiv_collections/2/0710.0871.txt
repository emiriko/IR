There is overwhelming evidence that the continued and widespread use of
untested spreadsheets in business gives rise to regular, significant and
unexpected financial losses. Whilst this is worrying, it is perhaps a
relatively minor concern compared with the risks arising from the use of poorly
constructed and/or untested spreadsheets in medicine, a practice that is
already occurring. This article is intended as a warning that the use of poorly
constructed and/or untested spreadsheets in clinical medicine cannot be
tolerated. It supports this warning by reporting on potentially serious
weaknesses found while testing a limited number of publicly available clinical
spreadsheets.
