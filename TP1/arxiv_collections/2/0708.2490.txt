In special relativity a gyroscope that is suspended in a torque-free manner
will precess as it is moved along a curved path relative to an inertial frame
S. We explain this effect, which is known as Thomas precession, by considering
a real grid that moves along with the gyroscope, and that by definition is not
rotating as observed from its own momentary inertial rest frame. From the basic
properties of the Lorentz transformation we deduce how the form and rotation of
the grid (and hence the gyroscope) will evolve relative to S. As an
intermediate step we consider how the grid would appear if it were not length
contracted along the direction of motion. We show that the uncontracted grid
obeys a simple law of rotation. This law simplifies the analysis of spin
precession compared to more traditional approaches based on Fermi transport. We
also consider gyroscope precession relative to an accelerated reference frame
and show that there are extra precession effects that can be explained in a way
analogous to the Thomas precession. Although fully relativistically correct,
the entire analysis is carried out using three-vectors. By using the
equivalence principle the formalism can also be applied to static spacetimes in
general relativity. As an example, we calculate the precession of a gyroscope
orbiting a static black hole. In an addendum the general reasoning is extended
to include also rotating reference frames.
