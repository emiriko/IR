We present a study of the electronic structure of two laterally coupled
gaussian quantum dots filled with two particles. The exact diagonalization
method has been used in order to inspect the spatial correlations and examine
the particular spin singlet-triplet configurations for different coupling
degrees between quantum dots. The outcome of our research shows this structure
to have highly modifiable properties promoting it as an interesting quantum
device, showing the possible use of this states as a quantum bit gate.
