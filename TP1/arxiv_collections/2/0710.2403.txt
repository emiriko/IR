Absorption of energy quanta generated by quantum point contact results in the
inelastic current through the double quantum dot placed nearby. In contrast to
a single quantum dot, the inelastic current through the double quantum dot is
sensitive to the energy dependence of the quantum point contact transmission,
which can explain the experimentally observed features. We calculate the
inelastic current as a function of microscopic parameters of the circuit.
