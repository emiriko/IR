We study the magnetoresistance of spin-valve devices using graphene as a
non-magnetic material to connect ferromagnetic leads. As a preliminary step we
first study the conductivity of a graphene strip connected to metallic contacts
for a variety of lead parameters, and demonstrate that the resulting
conductivity is rather insensitive to them. We then compute the conductivity of
the spin-valve device in the parallel and antiparallel spin polarization
configurations, and find that it depends only weakly on the relative spin
orientations of the leads, so that the magnetoresistance $MR$ of the system is
very small. The smallness of $MR$ is a consequence of the near independence of
the graphene conductivity from the electronic details of the leads. Our results
indicate that, although graphene has properties that make it attractive for
spintronic devices, the performance of an graphene-based spin-valve is likely
to be poor.
