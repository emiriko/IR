The formalism of covariant quantum theory, introduced by Reisenberger and
Rovelli, casts the description of quantum states and evolution into a framework
compatable with the principles of general relativity. The leap to this
covariant formalism, however, outstripped the standard interpretation used to
connect quantum theory to experimental predictions, leaving the predictions of
the RR theory ambiguous. Here we discuss in detail some implications of our
recently proposed description of covariant quantum information (CQI), which
addresses these problems. We show explicit agreement with standard quantum
mechanics in the appropriate limit. In addition to compatability with general
covariance, we show that our framework has other attractive and satisfying
features -- it is fully unitary, realist, and self-contained. The full
unitarity of the formalism in the presence of measurements allows us to invoke
time-reversal symmetry to obtain new predictions closely related to the quantum
Zeno effect.
