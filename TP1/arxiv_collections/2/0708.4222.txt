We study the possibility that the $Z^+(4430)$ state observed by Belle is a
$D_1D^*$ (or $D_1'D^*$) resonance in S-wave. Focusing on its decays, We find
that the open-charm decay into $D^*D^*\pi$ is dominant. Furthermore, we use the
re-scattering mechanism to study its hidden-charm decays and find that the
re-scattering effects are significant in $D_1D^*$ channel but not in $D_1'D^*$
channel. For the $J^P=1^-$ candidate, with chosen parameters, we can get
$\Gamma(Z^+\to\psi'\pi^+)/\Gamma(Z^+\to J/\psi\pi^+)\thickapprox 5.3$, which
tends to account for why the $Z^+(4430)$ is difficult to be found in
$J/\psi\pi^+$. However, the $0^-$ candidate can not be ruled out by our
calculations.
