We make time resolved velocity measurements of steel spheres in free fall
through liquid using a continuous ultrasound technique. We explore two
different ways to induce large changes in drag on the spheres: 1) a small
quantity of viscoelastic polymer added to water and 2) altering the surface of
the sphere. Low concentration polymer solutions and/or a pattern of grooves in
the sphere surface induce an early drag crisis, which may reduce drag by more
than 50 percent compared to smooth spheres in pure water. On the other hand,
random surface roughness and/or high concentration polymer solutions reduce
drag progressively and suppress the drag crisis. We also present a
qualititative argument which ties the drag reduction observed in low
concentration polymer solutions to the Weissenberg number and normal stress
difference.
