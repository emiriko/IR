The direct determination of the excitation level density and radiative
strength functions of their exciting gamma-transitions is impossible for the
larger part of the stable and long-life radioactive target nuclei. This
circumstance is uniquely determined by the fact, that the level spacing much
less than the resolution of the existing spectrometers of gamma-rays and
charged particles. The extraction of these parameters of nucleus in this
situation can be executed by their only fitting to the most probable values,
reproducing the measured in the nuclear reactions spectra and sections. This
inverse problem of mathematical analysis of its nature is principally
ambiguous. Moreover, system of equations, those connecting the number of
excitable levels and probability of the emission of charge particles are
assigned usually within the framework of some assumptions about the mechanism
of nuclear reaction and factors, determining the dynamics of the studied
process. The verification of these parameters can be partially executed by the
calculation of total gamma-spectra for their different sets. As, in particular,
the results of this analysis show, the calculation of the structure of the
excited levels to a change in the form of the energy dependence of radiative
strength functions most likely must be considered to the neutron-binding
energy. It is not possible to exclude the possibility of that, that also
radiative, and neutron strength functions depend on the structure of neutron
resonance and for the higher excitation energies.
