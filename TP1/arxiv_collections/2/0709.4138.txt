Degradation of mechanical properties of zirconia polycrystals is hardly
discussed in terms of solution-precipitation grain-boundary sliding due to
experimental controversies over imaging of intergranular amorphous phases at
high and room temperatures. Here, the authors applied the techniques of
mechanical spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to shed
light on the amorphization of grain interfaces at high temperature where the
interface-reaction determines the behaviour of fine-grained zirconia
polycrystals. They present mechanical spectroscopy results, which yield
evidences of an intergranular amorphous phase in silica doped and high-purity
zirconia at high temperature. Quenching of zirconia polycrystals reveals an
intergranular amorphous phase on TEM images at room temperature.
