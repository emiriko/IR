We investigate the low-energy quantum transport in the ballistic normal
metal-insulator -superconductor junction in the presence of magnetic field
creating Abrikosov vortices in the superconductor. Within the Bogolubov- de
Gennes theory we show that the presence of the subgap quasiparticle states
localized within the vortex cores near the junction interface leads to the
strong resonant enhancement of the Andreev reflection probability, and the
normal-to supercurrent conversion. The corresponding increase of the charge
conductance of the junction is determined by the distance from the vortex chain
to the junction interface, which can be controlled by the applied magnetic
field. The effect that we study provides a tool for probing the vortex core
states by the measurements of charge transport across the applied magnetic
field.
