We discuss the classical statement of group classification problem and some
its extensions in the general case. After that, we carry out the complete
extended group classification for a class of (1+1)-dimensional nonlinear
diffusion--convection equations with coefficients depending on the space
variable. At first, we construct the usual equivalence group and the extended
one including transformations which are nonlocal with respect to arbitrary
elements. The extended equivalence group has interesting structure since it
contains a non-trivial subgroup of non-local gauge equivalence transformations.
The complete group classification of the class under consideration is carried
out with respect to the extended equivalence group and with respect to the set
of all point transformations. Usage of extended equivalence and correct choice
of gauges of arbitrary elements play the major role for simple and clear
formulation of the final results. The set of admissible transformations of this
class is preliminary investigated.
