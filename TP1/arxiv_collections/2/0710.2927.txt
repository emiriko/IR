We are interested in the consistency between the cutoff, chiral symmetry, and
the power counting. For this purpose, we apply the Wilsonian renormalization
group (RG) to an operator and then decrease the Wilsonian cutoff. As an
example, we study the s-wave pion production operator for NN\to d\pi, derived
in chiral perturbation theory. We find that the renormalized part of the RG
effective operator is accurately absorbed by chiral counter terms of higher
order with natural coefficients. Thus, the use of the (sharp) cutoff
regularization does not require us to introduce chiral-symmetry-breaking
counter terms, at least in the case of the NN\to d\pi reaction.
