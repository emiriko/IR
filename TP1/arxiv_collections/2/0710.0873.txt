I show that the effective action of string compactifications has a structure
that can naturally solve the supersymmetric flavour and CP problems. At leading
order in the g_s and \alpha' expansions, the hidden sector factorises. The
moduli space splits into two mirror parts that depend on Kahler and complex
structure moduli. Holomorphy implies the flavour structure of the Yukawa
couplings arises in only one part. In type IIA string theory flavour arises
through the Kahler moduli sector and in type IIB flavour arises through the
complex structure moduli sector. This factorisation gives a simple solution to
the supersymmetric flavour and CP problems: flavour physics is generated in one
sector while supersymmetry is broken in the mirror sector. This mechanism does
not require the presence of gauge, gaugino or anomaly mediation and is
explicitly realised by phenomenological models of IIB flux compactifications.
