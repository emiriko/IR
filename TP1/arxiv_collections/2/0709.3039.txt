We study a random even subgraph of a finite graph $G$ with a general
edge-weight $p\in(0,1)$. We demonstrate how it may be obtained from a certain
random-cluster measure on $G$, and we propose a sampling algorithm based on
coupling from the past. A random even subgraph of a planar lattice undergoes a
phase transition at the parameter-value $\frac 12 \pc$, where $\pc$ is the
critical point of the $q=2$ random-cluster model on the dual lattice. The
properties of such a graph are discussed, and are related to Schramm--L\"owner
evolutions (SLE).
