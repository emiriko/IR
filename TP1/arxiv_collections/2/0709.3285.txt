Many promising schemes for quantum information processing (QIP) rely on
few-photon interference effects. In these proposals, the photons are treated as
being indistinguishable particles. However, single photon sources are typically
subject to variation from device to device. Thus the photons emitted from
different sources will not be perfectly identical, and there will be some
variation in their frequencies. Here, we analyse the effect of this frequency
mismatch on QIP schemes. As examples, we consider the distributed QIP protocol
proposed by Barrett and Kok, and Hong-Ou-Mandel interference which lies at the
heart of many linear optical schemes for quantum computing. In the distributed
QIP protocol, we find that the fidelity of entangled qubit states depends
crucially on the time resolution of single photon detectors. In particular,
there is no reduction in the fidelity when an ideal detector model is assumed,
while reduced fidelities may be encountered when using realistic detectors with
a finite response time. We obtain similar results in the case of Hong-Ou-Mandel
interference -- with perfect detectors, a modified version of quantum
interference is seen, and the visibility of the interference pattern is reduced
as the detector time resolution is reduced. Our findings indicate that problems
due to frequency mismatch can be overcome, provided sufficiently fast detectors
are available.
