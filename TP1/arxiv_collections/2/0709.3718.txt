We analyze and clarify the transport properties of a one-dimensional metallic
nanoparticle array with interaction between charges restricted to charges
placed in the same conductor. We study the threshold voltage, the I-V curves
and the potential drop through the array and their dependence on the array
parameters including the effect of charge and resistance disorder. We show that
very close to threshold the current depends linearly on voltage with a slope
independent on the array size. At intermediate bias voltages, for which a
Coulomb staircase is observed we find that the average potential drop through
the array oscillates with position. At higher voltages I-V curves are linear
but have a finite offset voltage. We show that the slope is given by the
inverse of the resistances added in series and estimate the voltage at which
this linear regime is reached. We also calculate the offset voltage and relate
it to the potential drop through the array.
