We consider axial torsion fields which appear in higher derivative quantum
gravity. It is shown, in general, that the torsion field possesses states with
two spins, one and zero, with different masses. The first-order formulation of
torsion fields is performed. Projection operators extracting pure spin and mass
states are given. We obtain the Lagrangian in the framework of the first order
formalism and energy-momentum tensor. The effective interaction of torsion
fields with electromagnetic fields is discussed. The Hamiltonian form of the
first order torsion field equation is given.
