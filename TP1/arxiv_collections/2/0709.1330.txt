Tweaking the properties of carbon nanotubes is a prerequisite for their
practical applications. Here we demonstrate fine-tuning the electronic
properties of single-wall carbon nanotubes via filling with ferrocene
molecules. The evolution of the bonding and charge transfer within the tube is
demonstrated via chemical reaction of the ferrocene filler ending up as
secondary inner tube. The charge transfer nature is interpreted well within
density functional theory. This work gives the first direct observation of a
fine-tuned continuous amphoteric doping of single-wall carbon nanotubes.
