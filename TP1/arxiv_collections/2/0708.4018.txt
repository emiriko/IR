We study the teleportation scheme performed by means of a partially entangled
pure state. We found that the information belonging to the quantum channel can
be distributed into both the system of the transmitter and the system of the
receiver. Thus, in order to complete the teleportation process it is required
to perform an "unambiguous non-orthogonal quantum states discrimination" and an
"extraction of the quantum information" processes. This general scheme allows
one to design a strategy for concealing the unknown information of the
teleported state. Besides, we showed that the teleportation and the "concealing
the quantum information" process, can be probabilistically performed even
though the bipartite quantum channel is maximally entangled.
