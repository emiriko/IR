There are three experimentally observed effects in rotating superconductors
that are so far unexplained. Some authors have tried to interpret such a
phenomena as possible new gravitational properties of coherent quantum systems:
in particular, they suggest that the gravitomagnetic field of that kind of
matter may be many orders of magnitude stronger than the one expected in the
standard theory. Here I show that this interpretation would be in conflict with
the common belief that neutron stars have neutrons in superfluid state and
protons in superconductive one.
