Recent advances in ultra-cold atomic Fermi gases make it possible to achieve
a fermionic superfluid with multiple spin components. In this context, any
mean-field description is expected to fail, owing to the presence of tightly
bound clusters or molecules that consist of more than two particles. Here we
present a detailed study of a strongly interacting multi-component Fermi gas in
a highly elongated or quasi-one-dimensional harmonic trap, which could be
readily obtained in experiment. By using the exact Bethe ansatz solution and a
local density approximation treatment of the harmonic trap, we investigate the
equation of state of the multi-component Fermi gas in both a homogeneous and
trapped environment, as well as the density profiles and low-energy collective
modes. The binding energy of multi-component bound clusters is also given. We
show that there is a peak in the collective mode frequency at the critical
density for a deconfining transition to a many-body state that is analogous to
the quark color superconductor state expected in neutron stars.
