In a minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model (MSSM) with
explicit CP violation a mass of the lightest Higgs boson H_1 in the range 7
GeV} < M_{H_1} < 10 GeV is experimentally allowed by present accelerator
limits. In the same scenario a lightest neutralino as light as 2.9 GeV can be a
viable dark matter candidate, provided that a departure from the usual GUT
relation among gaugino masses is assumed.
