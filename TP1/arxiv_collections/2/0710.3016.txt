A benchmark CP-violating supersymmetric scenario (known in the literature as
`CPX-scenario') is studied in the context of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).
It is shown that the LHC, with low to moderate accumulated luminosity, will be
able to probe the existing `hole' in the $m_{h_1}$-$\tan\beta$ plane, which
cannot be ruled out by the Large Electron Positron Collider data. This can be
done through associated production of Higgs bosons with top quark and top
squark pairs leading to the signal \emph{dilepton + $\leq{5}$ jets (including 3
b-jets) + missing ${p_T}$}. Efficient discrimination of such a CP-violating
supersymmetric scenario from other contending ones is also possible at the LHC
with a moderate volume of data.
