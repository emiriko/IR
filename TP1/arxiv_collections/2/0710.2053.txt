The normalization condition, average values and reduced distribution
functions can be generalized by fractional integrals. The interpretation of the
fractional analog of phase space as a space with noninteger dimension is
discussed. A fractional (power) system is described by the fractional powers of
coordinates and momenta. These systems can be considered as non-Hamiltonian
systems in the usual phase space. The generalizations of the Bogoliubov
equations are derived from the Liouville equation for fractional (power)
systems. Using these equations, the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation is
obtained.
