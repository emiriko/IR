We describe $\kappa$-Minkowski space and its relation to group theory. The
group theoretical picture makes it possible to analyze the symmetries of this
space. As an application of this analysis we analyze in detail free field
theory on $\kappa$-Minkowski space and the Noether charges associated with
deformed spacetime symmetries.
