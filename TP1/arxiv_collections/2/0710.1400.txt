This paper presents a new suction-temperature controlled isotropic cell that
can be used to study the thermo-mechanical behavior of unsaturated expansive
clays. The vapor equilibrium technique is used to control the soil suction; the
temperature of the cell is controlled using a thermostat bath. The isotropic
pressure is applied using a volume/pressure controller that is also used to
monitor the volume change of soil specimen. Preliminary experimental results
showed good performance of the cell.
