An ab initio, three-dimensional quantum mechanical calculation has been
performed for the time-evolution of continuum electrons in the fields of moving
charges. Here the essential singularity associated with the diverging phase
factor in the continuum wave function is identified and removed analytically.
As a result, the continuum components of the regularized wave function are
slowly varying with time. Therefore, one can propagate continuum electrons to
asymptotically large times and obtain numerically stable, well-converged
ejected electron momentum spectra with very low numerical noise. As a
consequence, our approach resolves outstanding controversies concerning
structures in electron momentum distributions. The main conclusions are general
and are illustrated here for ionization of atomic hydrogen by proton impact.
Our results show that in order to obtain correct long-time free-particle
propagation, the essential singularity identified here should be removed from
the continuum components of solutions to the time-dependent Schrodinger
equation.
