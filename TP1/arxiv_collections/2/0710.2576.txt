We have solved exactly the two-component Dirac equation in the presence of a
spatially one-dimensional Hulth\'en potential, and presented the Dirac spinors
of scattering states in terms of hypergeometric functions. We have calculated
the reflection and transmission coefficients by the matching conditions on the
wavefunctions, and investigated the condition for the existence of transmission
resonances. Furthermore, we have demonstrated how the transmission-resonance
condition depends on the shape of the potential.
