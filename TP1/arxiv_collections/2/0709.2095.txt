The lateral Casimir-Polder force between an atom and a corrugated surface
should allow one to study experimentally non trivial geometrical effects in
quantum vacuum. Here, we derive the theoretical expression of this force in a
scattering approach that accounts for the optical properties of the corrugated
surface. We show that large corrections to the ``proximity force
approximation'' could be measured using present-day technology with a
Bose-Einstein condensate used as a vacuum field sensor.
