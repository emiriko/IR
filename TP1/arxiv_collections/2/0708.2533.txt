We derive an effectively three-dimensional relativistic spin precession
formalism. The formalism is applicable to any spacetime where an arbitrary
timelike reference congruence of worldlines is specified. We employ what we
call a stopped spin vector which is the spin vector that we would get if we
momentarily make a pure boost of the spin vector to stop it relative to the
congruence. Starting from the Fermi transport equation for the standard spin
vector we derive a corresponding transport equation for the stopped spin
vector. Employing a spacetime transport equation for a vector along a
worldline, corresponding to spatial parallel transport with respect to the
congruence, we can write down a precession formula for a gyroscope relative to
the local spatial geometry defined by the congruence. This general approach has
already been pursued by Jantzen et. al. (see e.g. Jantzen, Carini and Bini,
Ann. Phys. 215 (1997) 1), but the algebraic form of our respective expressions
differ. We are also applying the formalism to a novel type of spatial parallel
transport introduced in Jonsson (Class. Quantum Grav. 23 (2006) 1), as well as
verifying the validity of the intuitive approach of a forthcoming paper
(Jonsson, Am. Journ. Phys. 75 (2007) 463) where gyroscope precession is
explained entirely as a double Thomas type of effect. We also present the
resulting formalism in explicit three-dimensional form (using the boldface
vector notation), and give examples of applications.
