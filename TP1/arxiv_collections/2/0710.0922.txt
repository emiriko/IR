This paper is devoted to a discussion of Gromov-Witten-Welschinger (GWW)
classes and their applications. In particular, Horava's definition of quantum
cohomology of real algebraic varieties is revisited by using GWW-classes and it
is introduced as a DG-operad. In light of this definition, we speculate about
mirror symmetry for real varieties.
