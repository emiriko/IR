We give examples of finitely presented groups containing elements with
irrational (in fact, transcendental) stable commutator length, thus answering
in the negative a question of M. Gromov. Our examples come from 1-dimensional
dynamics, and are related to the generalized Thompson groups studied by M.
Stein, I. Liousse and others.
