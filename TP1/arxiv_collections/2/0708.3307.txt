During his lifetime, Ramanujan provided many formulae relating binomial sums
to special values of the Gamma function. Based on numerical computations, Van
Hamme recently conjectured $p$-adic analogues to such formulae. Using a
combination of ordinary and Gaussian hypergeometric series, we prove one of
these conjectures.
