I discuss why and how powerful is the two-detector setting in neutrino
oscillation experiments. I cover three concrete examples: (1) reactor
\theta_{13} experiments, (2) T2KK, Tokai-to-Kamioka-Korea two-detector complex
for measuring CP violation, determining the neutrino mass hierarchy, and
resolving the eight-fold parameter degeneracy, (3) two-detector setting in a
neutrino factory at baselines 3000 km and 7000 km for detecting effects of
non-standard interactions (NSI) of neutrinos.
