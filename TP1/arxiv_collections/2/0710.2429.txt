The experimental determination of the muon magnetic moment and its
theoretical prediction within the Standard Model and the MSSM are reviewed. A 3
sigma deviation between experiment and Standard Model prediction has been
established, and supersymmetry could provide a natural explation of this
deviation. Possible future improvements and the case for a new experiment are
discussed.
