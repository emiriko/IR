We present predictions for heavy-quark production for proton-lead collisions
at LHC energy 5.5 TeV from Glauber-Gribov theory of nuclear shadowing. We have
also made predictions for baseline cold-matter (in other words inital-state)
nuclear effects in lead-lead collisions at the same energy that has to be taken
into account to understand properly final-state effects.
