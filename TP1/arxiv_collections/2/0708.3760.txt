The interaction of the ionic lattice with the superconducting condensate is
treated in terms of the electrostatic force in superconductors. It is shown
that this force is similar but not identical to the force suggested by the
volume difference of the normal and superconducting states. The BCS theory
shows larger deviations than the two-fluid model.
