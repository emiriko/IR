We propose to apply ``worldline numerics'' to a numerical calculation of
quark determinants. The Gross-Neveu model with a U(1) chiral symmetry is
considered as a first test. The worldline approach allows for an analytic
renormalisation, and only finite parts of the determinant require a numerical
calculation. It is shown that the discretisation of the worldlines, which is
central to the numerical treatment, preserves chiral symmetry exactly.
Numerical results for a kink configuration as a scalar background field are
shown and compared with analytical results. The case of finite fermion chemical
potential is also briefly discussed.
