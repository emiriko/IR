We present a general procedure for determining quasi-exact solvability of the
Dirac and the Pauli equation with an underlying $sl(2)$ symmetry. This
procedure makes full use of the close connection between quasi-exactly solvable
systems and supersymmetry. The Dirac-Pauli equation with spherical electric
field is taken as an example to illustrate the procedure.
