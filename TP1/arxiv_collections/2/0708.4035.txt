Ultra-low density polymers, metals, and ceramic nanofoams are valued for
their high strength-to-weight ratio, high surface area and insulating
properties ascribed to their structural geometry. We obtain the labrynthine
internal structure of a tantalum oxide nanofoam by X-ray diffractive imaging.
Finite element analysis from the structure reveals mechanical properties
consistent with bulk samples and with a diffusion limited cluster aggregation
model, while excess mass on the nodes discounts the dangling fragments
hypothesis of percolation theory.
