We define reduced zeta functions of Lie algebras, which can be derived from
motivic zeta functions using the Euler characteristic. We show that reduced
zeta functions of Lie algebras possessing a suitably well-behaved basis are
easy to analyse. We prove that reduced zeta functions are multiplicative under
certain conditions and investigate which reduced zeta functions have functional
equations.
