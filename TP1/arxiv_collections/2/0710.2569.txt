We present a graphical representation of the supersymmetry and the graphical
calculation. Calculation is demonstrated for 4D Wess-Zumino model and for Super
QED. The chiral operators are graphically expressed in an illuminating way. The
tedious part of SUSY calculation, due to manipulating chiral suffixes, reduces
considerably. The application is diverse.
