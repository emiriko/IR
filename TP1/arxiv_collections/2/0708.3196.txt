A fit to world data on the photon-proton cross section sigma L+T and the
unpolarised structure function F2 is presented. The 23-parameter ALLM model
based on Reggeon and Pomeron exchange is used. Cross section data were
reconstructed to avoid inconsistencies with respect to R of the published F2
data base. Parameter uncertainties and correlations are obtained.
