Starting from the spectrum of the radially symmetric quantum harmonic
oscillator in two dimensions, we create a large set of nonlinear solutions. The
relevant three principal branches, with $n_r=0,1$ and 2 radial nodes
respectively, are systematically continued as a function of the chemical
potential and their linear stability is analyzed in detail, in the absence as
well as in the presence of topological charge $m$, i.e., vorticity. It is found
that for repulsive interatomic interactions {\it only} the ground state is {\it
linearly stable} throughout the parameter range examined. Furthermore, this is
true for topological charges $m=0$ or $m=1$; solutions with higher topological
charge can be unstable even in that case. All higher excited states are found
to be unstable in a wide parametric regime. However, for the
focusing/attractive case the ground state with $n_r=0$ and $m=0$ can only be
stable for a sufficiently low number of atoms. Once again, excited states are
found to be generically unstable. For unstable profiles, the dynamical
evolution of the corresponding branches is also followed to monitor the
temporal development of the instability.
