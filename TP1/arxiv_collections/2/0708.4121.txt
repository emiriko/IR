On the basis of the confinement mechanism earlier proposed by author the
electric formfactor of $\pi^0$-meson is nonperturbatively calculated. The
latter is then applied to describing electromagnetic decays $\pi^0\to2\gamma$
and $\pi^0\to e^+e^-\gamma$ which entails estimates for parameters of the
confining SU(3)-gluonic field in $\pi^0$-meson. The corresponding estimates of
the gluon concentrations, electric and magnetic colour field strengths are also
adduced for the mentioned field.
