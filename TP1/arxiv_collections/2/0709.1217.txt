We study long Josephson junctions with the critical current density
alternating along the junction. New equilibrium states, which we call the field
synchronized or FS states, are shown to exist if the applied field is from
narrow intervals centered around equidistant series of resonant fields, $H_m$.
The values of $H_m$ are much higher than the flux penetration field, $H_s$. The
flux per period of the alternating critical current density, $\phi_i$, is fixed
for each of the FS states. In the $m$-th FS state the value of $\phi_i$ is
equal to an integer amount of flux quanta, $\phi_i =m\phi_0$. Two types of
single Josephson vortices carrying fluxes $\phi_0$ or/and $\phi_0/2$ can exist
in the FS states. Specific stepwise resonances in the current-voltage
characteristics are caused by periodic motion of these vortices between the
edges of the junction.
