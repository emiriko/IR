The results received in works [Centsov N.N. [N.N. Chentsov], Statistical
decision rules and optimal inference, 1982 Amer. Math. Soc. (Translated from
Russian); Morozova, E. A., Chentsov, N. N. Natural geometry of families of
probability laws. 1991 Probability theory, 8, 133--265, 270--274, 276 (in
Russian)] for statistical distributions at studying algebra of decision rules
and natural geometry generated by her, are applied to estimations of the
nonequilibrium statistical operator and superstatistics. Expressions for the
nonequilibrium statistical operator and superstatistics are received as special
cases of the weighed average geodetic of distributions of probabilities.
