This paper deals with the identification of the flux for a system of
conservation laws in the specific example of analytic chromatography. The
fundamental equations of chromatographic process are highly non linear. The
state-of-the-art Evolution Strategy, CMA-ES (the Covariance Matrix Adaptation
Evolution Strategy), is used to identify the parameters of the so-called
isotherm function. The approach was validated on different configurations of
simulated data using either one, two or three components mixtures. CMA-ES is
then applied to real data cases and its results are compared to those of a
gradient-based strategy.
