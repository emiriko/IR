In this paper, we establish uniform-in-bandwidth limit laws of the logarithm
for nonparametric Inverse Probability of Censoring Weighted (I.P.C.W.)
estimators of the multivariate regression function under random censorship. A
similar result is deduced for estimators of the conditional distribution
function. The uniform-in-bandwidth consistency for estimators of the
conditional density and the conditional hazard rate functions are also derived
from our main result. Moreover, the logarithm laws we establish are shown to
yield almost sure simultaneous asymptotic confidence bands for the functions we
consider. Examples of confidence bands obtained from simulated data are
displayed.
