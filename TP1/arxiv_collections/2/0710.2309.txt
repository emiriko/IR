The pure gauge theory in 2+1 dimensions is explored, through both a
phenomenological model and a lattice calculation. The Isgur-Paton model is
extended to include a curvature term and various mixing mechanisms. The method
of inferential statistics is used to extract the parameters of best fit and to
compare the likelihoods of the various models when compared to existing lattice
data. The conventional assignment of spin 0 to the pseudoscalar state is called
into question by the proximity of a spin 4 state in the model, which motivates
calculating the mass of the spin 4 state on the lattice. Novel lattice
operators are constructed from a matrix of effective Greens functions which
attempt to overcome the lattice rotational ambiguities. Correlation functions
are presented for the channels with even J, and effective masses extracted. The
resulting masses compare well with the extended Isgur-Paton model.
