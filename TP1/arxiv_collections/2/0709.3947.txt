The properties of Lorentz transformations in de Sitter relativity are
studied. It is shown that, in addition to leaving invariant the velocity of
light, they also leave invariant the length-scale related to the curvature of
the de Sitter spacetime. The basic conclusion is that it is possible to have an
invariant length parameter without breaking the Lorentz symmetry. This result
may have important implications for the study of quantum kinematics, and in
particular for quantum gravity.
