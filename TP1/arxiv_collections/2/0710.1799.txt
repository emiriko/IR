The effect of the right-left asymmetry is considered in the predicted earlier
electric dipole radiation from fission fragments arising due to the
Strutinski-Denisov induced polarisation mechanism. The magnitude of the
asymmetry parameter is on the level of 10^-3. That is in agreement with the
recent experimental data on the radiative ROT effect in ^{235}U fission induced
by cold polarised neutrons.
