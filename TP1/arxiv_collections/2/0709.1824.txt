We present an extension of the Monte Carlo Event Generator Whizard which
includes chargino production at the ILC at NLO. We include photons using both a
fixed order and a resummation approach. In the latter, leading higher order
corrections are automatically included. We present results for cross sections
and event generation for both methods.
