We present a quantum-theoretical treatment of biphoton generation in
single-resonant type-II parametric down-conversion. The nonlinear medium is
continuously pumped and is placed inside a cavity which is resonant for the
signal field, but nonresonant for the idler deflected by an intra-cavity
polarizing beam splitter. The intensity of the classical pump is assumed to be
sufficiently low in order to yield a biphoton production rate that is small
compared to the cavity loss rate. Explicit expressions are derived for the rate
of biphoton generation and for the biphoton wave function. The output spectra
of the signal and idler field are determined, as well as the second-order
signal-idler cross-correlation function which is shown to be asymmetric with
respect to the time delay. Due to frequency entanglement in the signal-idler
photon pair, the idler spectrum is found to reveal the longitudinal mode
structure of the cavity, even though the idler field is not resonant.
