The possibility of observing neutrinoless double beta decay offers the
opportunity of determining the neutrino mass IF the nuclear matrix element were
known. Theoretical calculations are uncertain and measurements of the
occupations of valence orbits by nucleons active in the decay can be important.
The occupation of valence neutron orbits in the ground states of 76Ge and 76Se
were determined by precisely measuring cross sections for both neutron-adding
and removing transfer reactions. Our results indicate that the Fermi surface is
much more diffuse than in theoretical (QRPA) calculations. We find that the
populations of at least three orbits change significantly between these two
ground states while in the calculations the changes are confined primarily to
one orbit.
