Using a Feshbach resonance, we create ultracold fermionic molecules starting
from a Bose-Fermi atom gas mixture. The resulting mixture of atoms and weakly
bound molecules provides a rich system for studying few-body collisions because
of the variety of atomic collision partners for molecules; either bosonic,
fermionic, or distinguishable atoms. Inelastic loss of the molecules near the
Feshbach resonance is dramatically affected by the quantum statistics of the
colliding particles and the scattering length. In particular, we observe a
molecule lifetime as long as 100 ms near the Feshbach resonance.
