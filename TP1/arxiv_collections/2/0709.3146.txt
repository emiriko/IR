This paper concentrates on a study where finite conductivity corrections are
included in the theoretical description of the effects of roughness on the
Casimir force. The roughness data were taken from gold films evaporated onto
Silicon and polysterene spheres. We conclude that for a detailed comparison
with experimental data, i.e. at the level of at least 5 % at short separations
below 200 nm, the lateral dimensions of roughness for real films should be
included in the theoretical considerations. Moreover, if the RMS roughness is
considerable, high local surface slopes are shown to have a significant effect
on the Casimir force.
