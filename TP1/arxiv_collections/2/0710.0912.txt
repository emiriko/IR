We theoretically compare transport properties of Fano-Kondo effect with those
of Fano effect. We focus on shot noise characteristics of a triple quantum dot
(QD) system in the Fano-Kondo region at zero temperature, and discuss the
effect of strong electric correlation in QDs. We found that the modulation of
the Fano dip is strongly affected by the on-site Coulomb interaction in QDs.
