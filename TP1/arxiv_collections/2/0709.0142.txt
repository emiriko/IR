We give a convenient representation for any map that is covariant with
respect to an irreducible representation of SU(2), and use this representation
to analyze the evolution of a quantum directional reference frame when it is
exploited as a resource for performing quantum operations. We introduce the
moments of a quantum reference frame, which serve as a complete description of
its properties as a frame, and investigate how many times a quantum directional
reference frame represented by a spin-j system can be used to perform a certain
quantum operation with a given probability of success. We provide a
considerable generalization of previous results on the degradation of a
reference frame, from which follows a classification of the dynamics of spin-j
system under the repeated action of any covariant map with respect to SU(2).
