A method is presented for generation of a subwavelength (0.43 lambda)
longitudinally polarized beam, which propagates without divergence over lengths
of about 4 lambda in free space. This is achieved by controlling the amplitude,
phase and polarization property of the Bessel-Gaussian field on the aperture of
a high numerical aperture focusing lens.
