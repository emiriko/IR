We provide evidence, based on direct simulation of the quantum Fisher
information, that 1/N scaling of the sensitivity with the number of atoms N in
an atomic magnetometer can be surpassed by double-passing a far-detuned laser
through the atomic system during Larmor precession. Furthermore, we predict
that for N>>1, the proposed double-pass atomic magnetometer can essentially
achieve 1/N scaling without requiring any appreciable amount of entanglement.
