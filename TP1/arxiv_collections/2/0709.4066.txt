The newly found states Y(4260), Y(4361), Y(4664) and Z$^\pm$(4430) stir broad
interest in the study of spectroscopy in a typical charmonium scale. The
Y(4260) which was observed earlier has been interpreted as hybrid, molecular
state, and baryonium, etc. In this note we show for the first time that these
new structures, which are hard to be interpreted as charmonium states, can be
systematically embedded into an extended baryonium picture. According to this
assignment, the so far known characters of these states are understandable.
And, in the same framework, we make some predictions for experimenters to
measure in the future.
