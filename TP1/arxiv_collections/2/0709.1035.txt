The presence of the aging phenomenon in the homogeneous cooling state (HCS)
of a granular fluid composed of inelastic hard spheres or disks is
investigated. As a consequence of the scaling property of the $N$-particle
distribution function, it is obtained that the decay of the normalized two-time
correlation functions slows down as the time elapsed since the beginning of the
measurement increases. This result is confirmed by molecular dynamics
simulations for the particular case of the total energy of the system. The
agreement is also quantitative in the low density limit, for which an explicit
analytical form of the time correlation function has been derived. The reported
results also provide support for the existence of the HCS as a solution of the
N-particle Liouville equation.
