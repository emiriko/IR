In a previous paper [S. Ghosal, Phys. Rev. E 74, 041901 (2006)] a
hydrodynamic model for determining the electrophoretic speed of a
polyelectrolyte through an axially symmetric slowly varying nanopore was
presented in the limit of a vanishingly small Debye length. Here the case of a
finite Debye layer thickness is considered while restricting the pore geometry
to that of a cylinder of length much larger than the diameter. Further, the
possibility of a uniform surface charge on the walls of the nanopore is taken
into account. It is thereby shown that the calculated transit times are
consistent with recent measurements in silicon nanopores.
