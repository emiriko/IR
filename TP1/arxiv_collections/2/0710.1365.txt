At low temperatures the configurational phase space of a macroscopic complex
system (e.g., a spin-glass) of $N\sim 10^{23}$ interacting particles may split
into an exponential number $\Omega_s \sim \exp({\rm const} \times N)$ of
ergodic sub-spaces (thermodynamic states). Previous theoretical studies assumed
that the equilibrium collective behavior of such a system is determined by its
ground thermodynamic states of the minimal free-energy density, and that the
equilibrium free energies follow the distribution of exponential decay. Here we
show that these assumptions are not necessarily valid. For some complex
systems, the equilibrium free-energy values may follow a Gaussian distribution
within an intermediate temperature range, and consequently their equilibrium
properties are contributed by {\em excited} thermodynamic states. This work
will help improving our understanding of the equilibrium statistical mechanics
of spin-glasses and other complex systems.
