The complex-field approach is developed to derive analytical expressions of
the magnetic field distributions around superconducting strips on ferromagnetic
substrates (SC/FM strips). We consider the ferromagnetic substrates as ideal
soft magnets with an infinite magnetic permeability, neglecting the
ferromagnetic hysteresis. On the basis of the critical state model for a
superconducting strip, the ac susceptibility $\chi_1'+i\chi_1''$ of a SC/FM
strip exposed to a perpendicular ac magnetic field is theoretically
investigated, and the results are compared with those for superconducting
strips on nonmagnetic substrates (SC/NM strips). The real part $\chi_1'$ for
$H_0/j_cd_s\to 0$ (where $H_0$ is the amplitude of the ac magnetic field, $j_c$
is the critical current density, and $d_s$ is the thickness of the
superconducting strip) of a SC/FM strip is 3/4 of that of a SC/NM strip. The
imaginary part $\chi_1''$ (or ac loss $Q$) for $H_0/j_cd_s<0.14$ of a SC/FM
strip is larger than that of a SC/NM strip, even when the ferromagnetic
hysteresis is neglected, and this enhancement of $\chi_1''$ (or $Q$) is due to
the edge effect of the ferromagnetic substrate.
