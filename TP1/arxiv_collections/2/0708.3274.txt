In this Letter, we present two analytic expressions that most generally
simulate $n$-qubit controlled-$U$ gates with standard one-qubit gates and CNOT
gates using exponential and polynomial complexity respectively. Explicit
circuits and general expressions of decomposition are derived. The exact
numbers of basic operations in these two schemes are given using gate counting
technique.
