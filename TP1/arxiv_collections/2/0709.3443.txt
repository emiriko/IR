We study the motion of the steady compressible heat conducting viscous fluid
in a bounded three dimensional domain governed by the compressible
Navier-Stokes-Fourier system. Our main result is the existence of a weak
solution to these equations for arbitrarily large data. A key element of the
proof is a special approximation of the original system guaranteeing pointwise
uniform boundedness of the density. Therefore the passage to the limit omits
tedious technical tricks required by the standard theory. Basic estimates on
the solutions are possible to obtain by a suitable choice of physically
reasonable boundary conditions.
