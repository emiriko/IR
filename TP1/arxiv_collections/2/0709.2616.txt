Entropy production due to shear viscosity during the continuous freeze-out of
a longitudinally expanding dissipative fluid is addressed. Assuming the
validity of the fluid dynamical description during the continuous removal of
interacting matter we estimated a small entropy production as function of the
freeze-out duration and the ratio of dissipative to non-dissipative quantities
in case of a relativistic massless pion fluid.
