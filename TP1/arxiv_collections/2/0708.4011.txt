The determination of a patient's DNA sequence can, in principle, reveal an
increased risk to fall ill with particular diseases [1,2] and help to design
"personalized medicine" [3]. Moreover, statistical studies and comparison of
genomes [4] of a large number of individuals are crucial for the analysis of
mutations [5] and hereditary diseases, paving the way to preventive medicine
[6]. DNA sequencing is, however, currently still a vastly time-consuming and
very expensive task [4], consisting of pre-processing steps, the actual
sequencing using the Sanger method, and post-processing in the form of data
analysis [7]. Here we propose a new approach that relies on functionalized
nanopore-embedded electrodes to achieve an unambiguous distinction of the four
nucleic acid bases in the DNA sequencing process. This represents a significant
improvement over previously studied designs [8,9] which cannot reliably
distinguish all four bases of DNA. The transport properties of the setup
investigated by us, employing state-of-the-art density functional theory
together with the non-equilibrium Green's Function method, leads to current
responses that differ by at least one order of magnitude for different bases
and can thus provide a much more robust read-out of the base sequence. The
implementation of our proposed setup could thus lead to a viable protocol for
rapid DNA sequencing with significant consequences for the future of genome
related research in particular and health care in general.
