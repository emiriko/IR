One of the primary goals of modern condensed matter physics is to elucidate
the nature of the ground state in various electronic systems. Many correlated
electron materials, such as high temperature superconductors, geometrically
frustrated oxides, and low-dimensional magnets are still the objects of
fruitful study because of the unique properties which arise due to poorly
understood many-body effects. Heavy fermion metals - materials which have high
effective electron masses due to these effects - represent a class of materials
with exotic properties, such as unusual magnetism, unconventional
superconductivity, and "hidden order" parameters. The heavy fermion
superconductor URu2Si2 has held the attention of physicists for the last two
decades due to the presence of a "hidden order" phase below 17.5 K. Neutron
scattering measurements indicate that the ordered moment is 0.03 $\mu_{B}$,
much too small to account for the large heat capacity anomaly at 17.5 K. We
present recent neutron scattering experiments which unveil a new piece of this
puzzle - the spin excitation spectrum above 17.5 K exhibits well-correlated,
itinerant-like spin excitations up to at least 10 meV emanating from
incommensurate wavevectors. The gapping of these excitations corresponds to a
large entropy release and explains the reduction in the electronic specific
heat through the transition.
