We prove the Jarzynski relation for general stochastic processes including
non-Markovian systems with memory. The only requirement for our proof is the
existence of a stationary state, therefore excluding non-ergodic systems. We
then show how the concepts of stochastic thermodynamics can be used to prove
further exact non-equilibrium relations like the Crooks relation and the
fluctuation theorem on entropy production for non-Markovian dynamics.
