We investigate few-boson tunneling in a one-dimensional double well, covering
the full crossover from weak interactions to the fermionization limit of strong
correlations. Based on exact quantum-dynamical calculations, it is found that
the tunneling dynamics of two atoms evolves from Rabi oscillations to
correlated pair tunneling as we increase the interaction strength. Near the
fermionization limit, fragmented-pair tunneling is observed and analyzed in
terms of the population imbalance and two-body correlations. For more atoms,
the tunneling dynamics near fermionization is shown to be sensitive to both
atom number and initial configuration.
