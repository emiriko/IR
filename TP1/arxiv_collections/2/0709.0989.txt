We report a novel phenomenon in carbon nanotube (CNT) based devices, the
transphonon effects, which resemble the transonic effects in aerodynamics. It
is caused by dissipative resonance of nanotube phonons similar to the radial
breathing mode, and subsequent drastic surge of the dragging force on the
sliding tube, and multiple phonon barriers are encountered as the intertube
sliding velocity reaches critical values. It is found that the transphonon
effects can be tuned by applying geometric constraints or varying chirality
combinations of the nanotubes.
