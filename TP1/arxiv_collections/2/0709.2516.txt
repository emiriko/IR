The CALICE Si-W electromagnetic calorimeter has been tested with electron
beams (1 to 6 GeV) at DESY in May 2006, as well as electrons (6 to 45 GeV) and
hadrons (6 to 80 GeV) at CERN in August and October 2006. Several millions of
events have been taken at different incident angles and three beam impact
positions. The ECAL calibration is performed with muon beams and shows a good
uniformity for nearly all channels. The large statistics available allows not
only to characterise the ECAL physics performance, but also to identify subtle
hardware effects.
