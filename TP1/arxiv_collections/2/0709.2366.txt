We present, in a pedagogical style, many instances of reduction procedures
appearing in a variety of physical situations, both classical and quantum. We
concentrate on the essential aspects of any reduction procedure, both in the
algebraic and geometrical setting, elucidating the analogies and the
differences between the classical and the quantum situations.
