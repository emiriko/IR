We argue that there may be no intermediate particle physics energy scale
between the Planck mass $M_{Pl}\sim 10^{19}$ GeV and the electroweak scale $M_W
\sim 100$ GeV. At the same time, the number of problems of the Standard Model
(neutrino masses and oscillations, dark matter, baryon asymmetry of the
Universe, strong CP-problem, gauge coupling unification, inflation) could find
their solution at $M_{Pl}$ or $M_W$. The crucial experimental predictions of
this point of view are outlined.
