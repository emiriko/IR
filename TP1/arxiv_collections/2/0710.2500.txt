This paper considers estimation of a univariate density from an individual
numerical sequence. It is assumed that (i) the limiting relative frequencies of
the numerical sequence are governed by an unknown density, and (ii) there is a
known upper bound for the variation of the density on an increasing sequence of
intervals. A simple estimation scheme is proposed, and is shown to be $L_1$
consistent when (i) and (ii) apply. In addition it is shown that there is no
consistent estimation scheme for the set of individual sequences satisfying
only condition (i).
