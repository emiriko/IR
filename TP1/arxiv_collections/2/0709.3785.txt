Several results in tropical geometry have related the j-invariant of an
algebraic plane curve of genus one to the cycle length of a tropical curve of
genus one. In this paper, we prove that for a plane cubic over the field of
Puiseux series the negative of the generic valuation of the $j$-invariant is
equal to the cycle length of the tropicalization of the curve, if there is a
cycle at all.
