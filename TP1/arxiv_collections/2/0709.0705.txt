We report on a search for narrow-width particles decaying to a top and
antitop quark pair. The data set used in the analysis corresponds to an
integrated luminosity of 680 pb^{-1} collected with the Collider Detector at
Fermilab in Run II. We present 95% confidence level upper limits on the cross
section times branching ratio. Assuming a specific topcolor-assisted
technicolor production model, the leptophobic Z' with width
\Gamma_{Z'}=0.012M_{Z'}, we exclude the mass range M_{Z'} < 725 GeV/c^2 at the
95% confidence level.
