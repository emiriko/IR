In this work, we consider the Cauchy problem for $u' - Au = f$ with $A$ the
Laplacian operator on some Riemannian manifolds or a sublapacian on some Lie
groups or some second order elliptic operators on a domain. We show the
boundedness of the operator of maximal regularity $f\mapsto Au$ and its adjoint
on appropriate Hardy spaces which we define and study for this purpose. As a
consequence we reobtain the maximal $L^q$ regularity on $L^p$ spaces for $p,q$
between 1 and $\infty$.
