Atomistic simulations using an EAM potential are carried out to investigate
the first stages of plasticity in aluminum slabs, in particular the effect of
both temperature and step geometry on the nucleation of dislocations from
surface steps. Temperature is shown to significantly reduce the elastic limit,
and to activate the nucleation of dislocation half-loops. Twinning occurs by
successive nucleations in adjacent glide planes. The presence of a kinked step
is shown to have no influence on the nucleation mechanisms.
