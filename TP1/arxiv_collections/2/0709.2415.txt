The known possibility to consider the (vacuum) Maxwell equations in a curved
space-time as Maxwell equations in flat space-time(Mandel'stam L.I., Tamm I.E.)
taken in an effective media the properties of which are determined by metrical
structure of the curved model is studied. Metrical structure of the curved
space-time generates effective constitutive equations for electromagnetic
fields, the form of four corresponding symmetrical tensors is found explicitly
for general case of an arbitrary Riemannian space - time. Four constitutive
tensors are not independent and obey some additional constraints between them.
Several simple examples are specified in detail:itis given geometrical modeling
of the anisotropic media (magnetic crystals) and the geometrical modeling of a
uniform media in moving reference frame in the Minkowsky electrodynamics -- the
latter is realized trough the use of a non-diagonal metrical tensor determined
by 4-vector velocity of the moving uniform media. Also the effective material
equations generated by geometry of space of constant curvature (Lobachevsky and
Riemann models) are determined.
