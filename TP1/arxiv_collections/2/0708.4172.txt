Monogenic functions are basic to Clifford analysis. On Euclidean space they
are defined as smooth functions with values in the corresponding Clifford
algebra satisfying a certain system of first order differential equations,
usually referred to as the Dirac equation. There are two equally natural
extensions of these equations to a Riemannian spin manifold only one of which
is conformally invariant. We present a straightforward exposition.
