We consider the renormalization group evolution for the operators in the
$\Delta S=1$ effective Hamiltonian with 3 active quark flavors, which is needed
in the numerical analysis of data sets for $\epsilon'/\epsilon$ calculated in
lattice QCD. Singularities are present in the original solution of Buras et al.
at next-to-leading order. We show how these can be eradicated through a method
of analytic continuation to obtain the correct finite solution in this case.
Furthermore, we trace the origin of the singularities to a breakdown of the
approach of Buras et al. in the 3 flavour case, and show how it can be
rectified so that singularitites are absent from the beginning.
