We consider the phenomenological implications of the assumption that baryons
are systems of three quarks connected through gluon string junction. The
transfer of baryon number in rapidity space due to the string junction
propagation is considered in detail. At high energies this process leads to a
significant effect on the net baryon production in hN collisions at
mid-rapidities. The numerical results for midrapidity inclusive densities of
different secondaries in the framework of the Quark-Gluon String Model are in
reasonable agreement with the experimental data. One universal value lambda ~
0.25 for the strangeness suppression parameter correctly describes the yield
ratios of Lambda/p, Xi/Lambda, and Omega/Xi. The predictions for pp collisions
at LHC energies are also presented.
