On the basis of the general character and operation of the process of
perception, a formalism is sought to mathematically describe the subjective or
abstract/mental process of perception. It is shown that the formalism of
orthodox quantum theory of measurement, where the observer plays a key role, is
a broader mathematical foundation which can be adopted to describe the dynamics
of the subjective experience. The mathematical formalism describes the
psychophysical dynamics of the subjective or cognitive experience as
communicated to us by the subject. Subsequently, the formalism is used to
describe simple perception processes and, in particular, to describe the
probability distribution of dominance duration obtained from the testimony of
subjects experiencing binocular rivalry. Using this theory and parameters based
on known values of neuronal oscillation frequencies and firing rates, the
calculated probability distribution of dominance duration of rival states in
binocular rivalry under various conditions is found to be in good agreement
with available experimental data. This theory naturally explains an observed
marked increase in dominance duration in binocular rivalry upon periodic
interruption of stimulus and yields testable predictions for the distribution
of perceptual alteration in time.
