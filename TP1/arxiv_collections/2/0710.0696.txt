In the previous paper, the number distribution of the low-lying spectra
around Gaussian solutions representing various dimensional fuzzy tori of a
tensor model was numerically shown to be in accordance with the general
relativity on tori. In this paper, I perform more detailed numerical analysis
of the properties of the modes for two-dimensional fuzzy tori, and obtain
conclusive evidences for the agreement. Under a proposed correspondence between
the rank-three tensor in tensor models and the metric tensor in the general
relativity, conclusive agreement is obtained between the profiles of the
low-lying modes in a tensor model and the metric modes transverse to the
general coordinate transformation. Moreover, the low-lying modes are shown to
be well on a massless trajectory with quartic momentum dependence in the tensor
model. This is in agreement with that the lowest momentum dependence of metric
fluctuations in the general relativity will come from the R^2-term, since the
R-term is topological in two dimensions. These evidences support the idea that
the low-lying low-momentum dynamics around the Gaussian solutions of tensor
models is described by the general relativity. I also propose a renormalization
procedure for tensor models. A classical application of the procedure makes the
patterns of the low-lying spectra drastically clearer, and suggests also the
existence of massive trajectories.
