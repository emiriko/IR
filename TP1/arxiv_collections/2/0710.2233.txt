We globally classify two-component evolution equations, with homogeneous
diagonal linear part, admitting infinitely many approximate symmetries.
Important ingredients are the symbolic calculus of Gel'fand and Dikii, the
Skolem-Mahler-Lech theorem, results on diophantine equations in roots of unity
by F. Beukers, and an algorithm of C.J. Smyth.
