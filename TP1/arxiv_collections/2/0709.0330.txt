We present an overview of Dr. Penrose's model of a cyclic universe, minus the
big crunch which relies upon black hole collection of matter after an a long
term expansion phase from an initial big bang . We affirm that the suggested
evolution equation presented at his lecture for his model meets requirements as
to an emergent quintessence field from a vacuum state . We try to offer
suggestions as to how to investigate his controversial conformal mapping of
matter/energy via Hawkings radiation from a potentially infinite number of
black holes to a new big bang. This is his 'ripples in a pond' effect which we
find highly unusual but worth serious study and investigation.
