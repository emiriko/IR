Spin relaxation in undoped quasi-spherical CdS quantum dots at zero magnetic
fields is investigated using time- and polarization-resolved transient
absorption measurements. Unlike in previous studies of these systems, the
measured signals were corrected for spin-insensitive contributions to the
exciton bleaching dynamics, {allowing us to determine} the pure spin-related
exciton dynamics. To explain the observed room-temperature spin-relaxation time
of several nanoseconds, we propose a novel mechanism based on intralevel
exciton transitions with the emission of one LO phonon, the absorption of
another LO phonon, and an electron spin flip, which is driven by the
electron-hole exchange interaction. The transition rates, calculated in the
present work for different sizes of quantum dots and temperatures, are in fair
agreement with our experimental results.
