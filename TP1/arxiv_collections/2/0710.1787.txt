Delbrueck scattering is an elastic scattering of a photon in the Coulomb
field of a nucleus via a virtual electron loop. The contribution of this
virtual subprocess to the emission of a photon in the collision of
ultra-relativistic nuclei Z_1 Z_2 -> Z_1 Z_2 gamma is considered. We identify
the incoming virtual photon as being generated by one of the relativistic
nuclei involved in the binary collision and the scattered photon as being
emitted in the process. The energy and angular distributions of the photons are
calculated. The discussed process has no infrared divergence. The total cross
section obtained is 14 barn for Au-Au collisions at the RHIC collider and 50
barn for Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC collider. These cross sections are
considerably larger than those for ordinary tree-level nuclear bremsstrahlung
in the considered photon energy range m_e << E_\gamma << m_e gamma, where gamma
is the Lorentz factor of the nucleus. Finally, photon emission in
electron-nucleus collisions e Z -> e Z gamma is discussed in the context of the
eRHIC option.
