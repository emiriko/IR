For an arbitrary infinite field k of characteristic p > 0, we describe the
structure of a block of the algebraic monoid M_n(k) (all n x n matrices over
k), or, equivalently, a block of the Schur algebra S(n,p), whose simple modules
are indexed by p-hook partitions. The result is known; we give an elementary
and self-contained proof, based only on a result of Peel and Donkin's
description of the blocks of Schur algebras. The result leads to a character
formula for certain simple GL_n(k)-modules, valid for all n and all p. This
character formula is a special case of one found by Brundan, Kleshchev, and
Suprunenko and, independently, by Mathieu and Papadopoulo.
