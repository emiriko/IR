Given a minimum measurable length underlying spacetime, the latter may be
effectively regarded as discrete, at scales of order the Planck length. A
systematic discretization of continuum physics may be effected most efficiently
through the umbral deformation. General functionals yielding such deformations
at the level of solutions are furnished and illustrated, and broad features of
discrete oscillations and wave propagation are outlined.
