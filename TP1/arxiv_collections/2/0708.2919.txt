Salt-induced aggregation of 20 nm colloidal silica is followed by light
transmission, which shows an a kinetic form exp[-(t/t_0)^{\alpha}], where
\alpha = 2.6 and t_0 is an empirical time constant which reflects the colloidal
stability. We found a power law dependence of t_0 on ionic strength, which can
be explained by the classical DLVO theory. The neutral polymers polyethylene
glycol (PEG) accelerate the aggregation rate, and those with higher molecular
weight are more effective in inducing the aggregation with similar stretched
exponential form of kinetics. Current theories of polymer-mediated interactions
provide a reasonable interpretation of the effect of PEG. The stretched
exponential kinetics of the light transmission is found to be consistent with a
cluster-size dynamic scaling model of aggregation.
