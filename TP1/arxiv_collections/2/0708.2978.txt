After a brief introduction to the concept of entanglement in quantum systems,
I apply these ideas to many-body systems and show that the von Neumann entropy
is an effective way of characterising the entanglement between the degrees of
freedom in different regions of space. Close to a quantum phase transition it
has universal features which serve as a diagnostic of such phenomena. In the
second part I consider the unitary time evolution of such systems following a
`quantum quench' in which a parameter in the hamiltonian is suddenly changed,
and argue that finite regions should effectively thermalise at late times,
after interesting transient effects.
