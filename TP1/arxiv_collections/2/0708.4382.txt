We study the sensitivity of fiber grating sensors in the applications of
strain, temperature, internal label-free biosensing, and internal refractive
index sensing. It is shown that optical dispersion plays a central role in
determining the sensitivity, and the dispersion may enhance or suppress
sensitivity as well as change the sign of the resonant wavelength shifts. We
propose a quality factor, $Q$, for characterizing LPGs.
