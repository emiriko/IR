The photoionization spectrum of an atom in a magnetic field is calculated by
combining R-matrix propagation with local adiabatic basis expansions. This
approach considerably increases the speed and the energy range over which
calculations can be performed compared to previous methods, allowing one to
obtain accurate partial and total cross sections over an extended energy range
for an arbitrary magnetic field strength. In addition, the cross sections for
all atoms of interest can be calculated simultaneously in a single calculation.
Multichannel quantum defect theory allows for a detailed analysis of the
resonance structure in the continuum. Calculated cross sections for a range of
atoms in both laboratory and astrophysical field strengths are presented.
