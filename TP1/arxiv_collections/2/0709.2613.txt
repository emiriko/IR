Positive and negative features of the Copenhagen interpretation are
discussed. As positive features can be mentioned its pragmatism and its
awareness of the crucial role of measurement. However, the main part of the
contribution is devoted to the negative features, to wit, its pragmatism (once
again), its confounding of preparation and measurement, its classical account
of measurement, its completeness claims, the ambiguity of its notion of
correspondence, its confused notion of complementarity. It is demonstrated how
confusions and paradoxes stemming from the negative features of the Copenhagen
interpretation can be dealt with in an amended interpretation, to be referred
to as `neo-Copenhagen interpretation', in which the role of the measuring
instrument is taken seriously by recognizing the quantum mechanical character
of its interaction with the microscopic object. The ensuing necessity of
extending the notion of a quantum mechanical observable from the Hermitian
operator of the standard formalism to the positive operator-valued measure of a
generalized formalism is demonstrated to yield a sound mathematical basis for a
transition from the Copenhagen contextualistic-realist interpretation to the
neo-Copenhagen empiricist one. Applications to the uncertainty relations and to
the Bell inequalities are briefly discussed.
