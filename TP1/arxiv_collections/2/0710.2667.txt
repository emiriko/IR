The standard text-book Jacobi equation (equation of geodesic deviation)
arises by linearizing the geodesic equation around some chosen geodesic, where
the linearization is done with respect to the coordinates and the velocities.
The generalized Jacobi equation, introduced by Hodgkinson in 1972 and further
developed by Mashhoon and others, arises if the linearization is done only with
respect to the coordinates, but not with respect to the velocities. The
resulting equation has been studied by several authors in some detail for
timelike geodesics in a Lorentzian manifold. Here we begin by briefly
considering the generalized Jacobi equation on affine manifolds, without a
metric; then we specify to lightlike geodesics in a Lorentzian manifold. We
illustrate the latter case by considering particular lightlike geodesics (a) in
Schwarzschild spacetime and (b) in a plane-wave spacetime.
