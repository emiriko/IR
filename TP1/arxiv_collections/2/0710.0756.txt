The Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) is the QCD phase of matter expected to be formed
at small proper-times in the collision of heavy-ions at high energy.
Experimental observations seem to favor a strongly coupled QCD plasma with the
hydrodynamic properties of a quasi-perfect fluid, i.e. rapid thermalization (or
isotropization) and small viscosity. The theoretical investigation of such
properties is not obvious, due to the the strong coupling. The Gauge/Gravity
correspondence provides a stimulating framework to explore the strong coupling
regime of gauge theories using the dual string description. After a brief
introduction to Gauge/Gravity duality, and among various existing studies, we
focus on challenging problems of QGP hydrodynamics, such as viscosity and
thermalization, in terms of gravitational duals of both the static and
relativistically evolving plasma. We show how a Black Hole geometry arises
naturally from the dual properties of a nearly perfect fluid and explore the
lessons and prospects one may draw for actual heavy ion collisions from the
Gauge/Gravity duality approach.
