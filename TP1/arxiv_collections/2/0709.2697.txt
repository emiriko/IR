If the quantum numbers of the X(3872) are J^{PC}=1^{++}, the measurement of
its mass implies that it is either a loosely-bound hadronic molecule whose
constituents are a superposition of the charm mesons pairs D^{*0} Dbar^0 and
D^0 Dbar^{*0} or else it is a virtual state of these charm mesons. Its binding
energy is small enough that the decay width of a constituent D^{*0} or
Dbar^{*0} has a significant effect on the line shapes of the X resonance. We
develop a simple approximation to the line shapes that takes into account the
effect of the D^{*0} width as well as inelastic scattering channels of the
charm mesons. We carry out a simultaneous fit to the line shapes in the J/psi
pi^+ pi^- and D^0 Dbar^0 pi^0 channels measured in the decays B^+ to K^+ + X by
the Belle Collaboration. The best fit corresponds to the X(3872) being a bound
state just below the D^{*0} Dbar^0 threshold, but a virtual state just above
the D^{*0} D-ar^0 threshold is not excluded.
