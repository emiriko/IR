A free quantum field in 1+1 dimensions admits unitary Schrodinger picture
dynamics along any foliation of spacetime by Cauchy curves. Kuchar showed that
the Schrodinger picture state vectors, viewed as functionals of spacelike
embeddings, satisfy a functional Schrodinger equation in which the generators
of time evolution are the scalar field energy-momentum densities with a
particular normal-ordering and with a (non-unique) c-number contribution. The
c-number contribution to the Schrodinger equation, called the ``anomaly
potential'', is needed to make the equation integrable in light of the
Schwinger terms present in the commutators of the normal-ordered
energy-momentum densities. Here we give a quantum geometric interpretation of
the anomaly potential. In particular, we show the anomaly potential corresponds
to the expression in a gauge of the natural connection on the bundle of vacuum
states over the space of embeddings of Cauchy curves into the spacetime. The
holonomy of this connection is the geometric phase associated with dynamical
evolution along a closed path in the space of embeddings generated by the
normal-ordered energy-momentum densities. The presence of the anomaly potential
in the functional Schrodinger equation provides a dynamical phase which removes
this holonomy, so that there is no net phase change for quantum transport
around closed loops in the space of embeddings.
