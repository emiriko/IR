Beginning with a straightforward formulation of electromagnetic cloaking that
reduces to a boundary value problem involving a single Maxwell first-order
differential equation, explicit formulae for the relative
permittivity-permeability dyadic and fields of spherical and circular
cylindrical annular cloaks are derived in terms of general compressed radial
coordinate functions. The general formulation is based on the requirements that
the cloaking occurs for all possible incident fields and that the cloaks with
frequency w > 0 have continuous tangential E and H fields across their outer
surfaces, and zero normal D and B fields at their inner material surfaces. The
tangential-field boundary conditions at the outer surface of the cloak ensure
zero scattered fields, and the normal-field boundary conditions at the inner
surface of the cloak are compatible with zero total fields inside the interior
cavity of the cloak. For spherical cloaks, unlike cylindrical cloaks, these
boundary conditions lead to all the tangential components of the E and H fields
being continuously zero across their inner surfaces -- cylindrical cloaks
having delta functions in polarization densities at their inner surfaces. For
bodies with no interior free-space cavities, the formulation is used to derive
nonscattering spherical and cylindrical concentrators that magnify the incident
fields near their centers. For static fields (w = 0), the boundary value
formulation is appropriately modified to obtain a permeability dyadic that will
cloak magnetostatic fields. Causality conditions imply that, unlike
magnetostatic cloaking, electrostatic cloaking as well as low-frequency
cloaking for w > 0 is not realizable.
