Isotope temperatures from double ratios of hydrogen, helium, lithium,
beryllium, and carbon isotopic yields, and excited-state temperatures from
yield ratios of particle-unstable resonances in 4He, 5Li, and 8Be, were
determined for spectator fragmentation, following collisions of 197Au with
targets ranging from C to Au at incident energies of 600 and 1000 MeV per
nucleon. A deviation of the isotopic from the excited-state temperatures is
observed which coincides with the transition from residue formation to
multi-fragment production, suggesting a chemical freeze-out prior to thermal
freeze-out in bulk disintegrations.
