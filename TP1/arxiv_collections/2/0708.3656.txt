I worked on String Theory over a period of five years during the First String
Era, the most intellectually satisfying years of my scientific life. One of the
early prospectors in the String Theory Mine, I was fortunate enough to
contribute to the birth of this subject, which retains after these many years,
its magical hold on our imaginations and expectations.
