We perform an analysis of transverse-momentum dependent parton distribution
functions, making use of their renormalization properties in terms of their
leading-order anomalous dimensions. We show that the appropriate Wilson line in
the light-cone gauge, associated with such quantities, is a cusped one. To
cancel the ensuing cusp anomalous dimension, we include in the definition of
the transverse-momentum dependent parton distribution functions an additional
soft counter term (gauge link) along that contour. We demonstrate that this is
tantamount to an ``intrinsic (Coulomb) phase'', which accumulates the full
gauge history of the color-charged particle.
