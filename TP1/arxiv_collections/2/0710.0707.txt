We found a new branch of solutions in Freund-Rubin type flux
compactifications. The geometry of these solutions is described as the external
space which has a de Sitter symmetry and the internal space which is
topologically spherical. However, it is not a simple form of dS_p x S^q but a
warped product of de Sitter space and a deformed sphere. We explicitly
constructed numerical solutions for a specific case with p=4 and q=4. We show
that the new branch of solutions emanates from the marginally stable solution
in the branch of dS_4 x S^4 solutions.
