We review some of the properties of higher-dimensional superstatistical
stochastic models. As an example, we analyse the stochastic properties of a
superstatistical model of 3-dimensional Lagrangian turbulence, and compare with
experimental data. Excellent agreement is obtained for various measured
quantities, such as acceleration probability densities, Lagrangian scaling
exponents, correlations between acceleration components, and time decay of
correlations. We comment on how to proceed from superstatistics to a
thermodynamic description.
