The best laboratory constraints on strongly coupled chameleon fields come not
from tests of gravity per se but from precision measurements of the Casimir
force. The chameleonic force between two nearby bodies is more akin to a
Casimir-like force than a gravitational one: The chameleon force behaves as an
inverse power of the distance of separation between the surfaces of two bodies,
just as the Casimir force does. Additionally, experimental tests of gravity
often employ a thin metallic sheet to shield electrostatic forces, however this
sheet mask any detectable signal due to the presence of a strongly coupled
chameleon field. As a result of this shielding, experiments that are designed
to specifically test the behaviour of gravity are often unable to place any
constraint on chameleon fields with a strong coupling to matter. Casimir force
measurements do not employ a physical electrostatic shield and as such are able
to put tighter constraints on the properties of chameleons fields with a strong
matter coupling than tests of gravity. Motivated by this, we perform a full
investigation on the possibility of testing chameleon model with both present
and future Casimir experiments. We find that present days measurements are not
able to detect the chameleon. However, future experiments have a strong
possibility of detecting or rule out a whole class of chameleon models.
