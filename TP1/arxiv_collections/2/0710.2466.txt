We study left orderable groups by using dynamical methods. We apply these
techniques to study the space of orderings of these groups. We show for
instance that for the case of (non-Abelian) free groups, this space is
homeomorphic to the Cantor set. We also study the case of braid groups (for
which the space of orderings has isolated points but contains homeomorphic
copies of the Cantor set). To do this we introduce the notion of the Conradian
soul of an order as the maximal subgroup which is convex and restricted to
which the original ordering satisfies the so called conradian property, and we
elaborate on this notion.
