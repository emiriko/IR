The Lagrangian formalism for the N=2 supersymmetric sinh-Gordon model with a
jump defect is considered. The modified conserved momentum and energy are
constructed in terms of border functions. The supersymmetric Backlund
transformation is given and an one-soliton solution is obtained.
  The Lax formulation based on the affine super Lie algebra $sl(2,2)$ within
the space split by the defect leads to the integrability of the model and
henceforth to the existence of an infinite number of constants of motion.
