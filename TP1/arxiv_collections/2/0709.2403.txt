Based on recent work [L. Machura, M. Kostur, P. Talkner, J. Luczka, and P.
Hanggi, Phys. Rev. Lett. 98, 040601 (2007)], we extend the study of inertial
Brownian motors to the case of an asymmetric potential. It is found that some
transport phenomena appear in the presence of an asymmetric potential. Within
tailored parameter regimes, there exists two optimal values of the load at
which the mean velocity takes its maximum, which means that a load can
facilitate the transport in the two parameter regimes. In addition, the
phenomenon of multiple current reversals can be observed when the load is
increased.
