I present two new renormalizable grand unified theories where the neutrino
masses are generated through the type I and type III seesaw mechanisms. These
theories can be considered as the simplest (SUSY) renormalizable grand unified
theories based on the SU(5) gauge symmetry. Several phenomenological and
cosmological aspects of these proposals are discussed.
