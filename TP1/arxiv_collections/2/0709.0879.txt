The symmetry group analysis is applied to classify the phonon modes of
$N$-stacked graphene layers (NSGL's) with AB- and AA-stacking, particularly
their infra-red and Raman properties. The dispersions of various phonon modes
are calculated in a multi-layer vibrational model, which is generalized from
the lattice vibrational potentials of graphene to including the inter-layer
interactions in NSGL's. The experimentally reported red shift phenomena in the
layer number dependence of the intra-layer optical C-C stretching mode
frequencies are interpreted. An interesting low frequency inter-layer optical
mode is revealed to be Raman or Infra-red active in even or odd NSGL's
respectively. Its frequency shift is sensitive to the layer number and
saturated at about 10 layers.
