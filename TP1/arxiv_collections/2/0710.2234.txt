In Randall-Sundrum models, the Kaluza-Klein (KK) excitations of the gluon,
g_{KK} have enhanced couplings to the right-handed quarks. In the absence of a
gg g_{KK} coupling in these models, the single production of a g_{KK} from an
initial gg state is not possible. The search for other production mechanisms at
the LHC, therefore, becomes important. We suggest that the associated
production of a g_{KK} with a t t(bar) pair is such a mechanism. Our study
shows that through this process the LHC can probe KK gluon masses in the range
of 2.8 -- 2.9 TeV.
