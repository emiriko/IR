We investigate analytically and numerically the Multiple Quantum (MQ) NMR
dynamics in systems of nuclear spins 1/2 coupled by the dipole-dipole
interactions in the case of the dipolar ordered initial state. We suggest two
different methods of MQ NMR. One of them is based on the measurement of the
dipolar temperature in the quasi-equilibrium state which establishes after the
time of order T2 after the MQ NMR experiment. The other method uses an
additional resonance 45^0 -pulse after the preparation period of the standard
MQ NMR experiment in solids. Many-spin clusters and correlations are created
faster in such experiments than in the usual MQ NMR experiments and can be used
for the investigation of many-spin dynamics of nuclear spins in solids.
