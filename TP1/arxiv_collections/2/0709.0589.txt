In equilibrium, the number of conduction electrons in a solid substance
depends on the conformation of the atoms in the substance. When a magnetic
field is applied, it takes time for the system to come to a new equilibrium
with a new conformation. During such times, current may flow. But, unless
superconduction is involved, the new equilibrium contains no current. It is
shown that the transitory currents are consistent with experiments involving
magnetization of small rings at low temperatures.
