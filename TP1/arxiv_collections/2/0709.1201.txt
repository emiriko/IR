We obtain two results about the proof complexity of deep inference: 1)
deep-inference proof systems are as powerful as Frege ones, even when both are
extended with the Tseitin extension rule or with the substitution rule; 2)
there are analytic deep-inference proof systems that exhibit an exponential
speed-up over analytic Gentzen proof systems that they polynomially simulate.
