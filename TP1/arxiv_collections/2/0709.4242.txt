This work suggests modifications to a previously introduced class of
heterogeneous agent models that allow for the inclusion of different types of
agent motivations and behaviours in a unified way. The agents operate within a
highly simplified environment where they are only able to be long or short one
unit of the asset. The price of the asset is influenced by both an external
information stream and the demand of the agents. The current strategy of each
agent is defined by a pair of moving thresholds straddling the current price.
When the price crosses either of the thresholds for a particular agent, that
agent switches position and a new pair of thresholds is generated.
  Different kinds of threshold motion correspond to different sources of
motivation, running the gamut from purely rational information-processing,
through rational (but often undesirable) behaviour induced by perverse
incentives and moral hazards, to purely psychological effects. As with the
previous class of models, the fact that the simplest model of this kind
precisely conforms to the Efficient Market Hypothesis allows causal
relationships to be established between properties at the agent level and
violations of EMH price statistics at the global level.
