We have observed tunneling suppression and photon-assisted tunneling of
Bose-Einstein condensates in an optical lattice subjected to a constant force
plus a sinusoidal shaking. For a sufficiently large constant force, the ground
energy levels of the lattice are shifted out of resonance and tunneling is
suppressed; when the shaking is switched on, the levels are coupled by
low-frequency photons and tunneling resumes. Our results agree well with
theoretical predictions and demonstrate the usefulness of optical lattices for
studying solid-state phenomena.
