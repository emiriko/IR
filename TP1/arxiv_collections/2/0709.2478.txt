We have considered the di-photon production with unparticle at LHC. The
contributions of spin-0 and spin-2 unparticle to the di-photon production are
studied in the invariant mass and other kinematical distributions, along with
their dependencies on the model dependent parameters. The signal corresponding
to the unparticle is significant for moderate coupling constant values.
