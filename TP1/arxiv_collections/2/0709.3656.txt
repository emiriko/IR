In the gauge invariant formulation of U(1) chiral lattice gauge theories
based on the Ginsparg-Wilson relation, the gauge field dependence of the
fermion measure is determined through the so-called measure term. We derive a
closed formula of the measure term on the finite volume lattice. The Wilson
line degrees of freedom (torons) of the link field are treated separately to
take care of the global integrability. The local counter term is explicitly
constructed with the local current associated with the cohomologically trivial
part of the gauge anomaly in a finite volume. The resulted formula is very
close to the known expression of the measure term in the infinite volume with a
single parameter integration, and would be useful in practical implementations.
