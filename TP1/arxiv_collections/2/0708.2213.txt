Here, we present a family of time series with a simple growth constraint.
This family can be the basis of a model to apply to emerging computation in
business and micro-economy where global functions can be expressed from local
rules. We explicit a double statistics on these series which allows to
establish a one-to-one correspondence between three other ballot-like
strunctures.
