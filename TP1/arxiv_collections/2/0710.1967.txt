We study numerically the behavior of qubit coupled to a quantum dissipative
driven oscillator (resonator). Above a critical coupling strength the qubit
rotations become synchronized with the oscillator phase. In the synchronized
regime, at certain parameters, the qubit exhibits tunneling between two
orientations with a macroscopic change of number of photons in the resonator.
The life times in these metastable states can be enormously large. The
synchronization leads to a drastic change of qubit radiation spectrum with
appearance of narrow lines corresponding to recently observed single
artificial-atom lasing [O. Astafiev {\it et al.} Nature {\bf 449}, 588 (2007)].
