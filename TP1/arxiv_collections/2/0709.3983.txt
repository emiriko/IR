Two distinct classes of realistic inflationary models consistent with present
observations are reviewed. The first example relies on the Coleman-Weinberg
potential and is readily realized within the framework of spontaneously broken
global symmetries (for instance, global U(1)_B-L). Depending on the parameters
either new or large field inflation is possible. The second example exploits
supersymmetry which makes implementation of inflation within local gauge
theories much more accessible. An example based on spontaneously broken local
U(1)_B-L is discussed. Leptogenesis is naturally realized in both cases.
