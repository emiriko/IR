We present a statistical mechanical study of stiff polymers, motivated by
experiments on actin filaments and the considerable current interest in polymer
networks. We obtain simple, approximate analytical forms for the
force-extension relations and compare these with numerical treatments. We note
the important role of boundary conditions in determining force-extension
relations. The theoretical predictions presented here can be tested against
single molecule experiments on neurofilaments and cytoskeletal filaments like
actin and microtubules. Our work is motivated by the buckling of the
cytoskeleton of a cell under compression, a phenomenon of interest to biology.
