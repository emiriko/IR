We report the presence of a correlation between the bulk and interfacial
properties of electrostatic coacervate complexes. Complexes were obtained by
co-assembly between cationic-neutral diblocks and oppositely charged surfactant
micelles or 7 nm cerium oxide nanoparticles. Light scattering and reflectometry
measurements revealed that the hybrid nanoparticle aggregates were more stable
both through dilution and rinsing (from either a polystyrene or a silica
surfaces) than their surfactant counterparts. These findings were attributed to
a marked difference in critical association concentration between the two
systems and to the frozen state of the hybrid structures.
