In the dynamics of open quantum systems, the interaction with the external
environment usually leads to a contraction of the set of reachable states for
the system as time increases, eventually shrinking to a single stationary
point. In this contribution we describe to what extent it is possible to modify
this asymptotic state by means of indirect control, that is by using an
auxiliary system coupled to the target system in order to affect its dynamics,
when there is a purely dissipative coupling between the two systems. We prove
that, also in this restrictive case, it is possible to modify the asymptotic
state of the relevant system, give necessary conditions for that and provide
physical examples. Therefore, in indirect control schemes, the environmental
action has not only a negative impact on the dynamics of a system, it is rather
possible to make use of it for control purposes.
