We study UV properties of the two-dimensional supersymmetric CP^{N-1} model
on non(anti)commutative superspace. We show that the deformed model has the
same UV property as the ordinary model in the leading order of 1/N and the
deformation give rise to UV divergence which cannot be dealt with in the
next-to-leading order.
