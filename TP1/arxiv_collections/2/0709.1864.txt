The high dissipation of integrated circuits means serious problems for
packaging and for the design of complex electronic systems. Another important
area of research and development nowadays is the integration of sensors and
micromechanical systems (MEMS) with electronic circuits. The original
Successive Node Reduction (SUNRED) algorithm handles well the first area but
require revision for electro-thermal or mechanical fields. As a first stage the
updated algorithm is able to solve thermal fields as the original, but with the
application of flexible boundary connection handling, it can be much faster
than the original. By using object-oriented program model the algorithm can
handle non-rectangular 3D fields, and SUNRED mesh resolution is arbitrary, not
have to be the power of two anymore.
