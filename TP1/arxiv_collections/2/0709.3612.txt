The CMS experiment at the LHC features the largest Silicon Strip Detector
ever built. The impact of the operating conditions and physics requirements on
the design choices of the CMS Silicon Tracker is reviewed. The readiness of the
Silicon Strip Tracker for the tentatively scheduled CMS commissioning in Summer
2008 is briefly described.
