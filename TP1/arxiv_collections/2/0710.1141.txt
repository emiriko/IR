We address an issue what kind of tuning realizes a flat potential for
inflaton in supergravity. We restrict ourselves to the case that inflationary
dynamics is not affected by separate supersymmetry-breaking effects, and
consider examples of a single chiral superfield as an inflaton with its vacuum
of the vanishing cosmological constant. The examples potentially include the
cases of Polonyi field or right-handed sneutrino as an inflaton.
