A theorem of Leibman asserts that a polynomial orbit
$(g(1),g(2),g(3),\ldots)$ on a nilmanifold $G/\Gamma$ is always equidistributed
in a union of closed sub-nilmanifolds of $G/\Gamma$. In this paper we give a
quantitative version of Leibman's result, describing the uniform distribution
properties of a finite polynomial orbit $(g(1),\ldots,g(N))$ in a nilmanifold.
More specifically we show that there is a factorization $g = \epsilon
g'\gamma$, where $\epsilon(n)$ is "smooth", $\gamma(n)$ is periodic and
"rational", and $(g'(a),g'(a+d),\ldots,g'(a + d(l-1)))$ is uniformly
distributed (up to a specified error $\delta$) inside some subnilmanifold
$G'/\Gamma'$ of $G/\Gamma$, for all sufficiently dense arithmetic progressions
$a,a+d,\ldots,a+d(l-1)$ inside $\{1,..,N\}$.
  Our bounds are uniform in $N$ and are polynomial in the error tolerance
delta. In a subsequent paper we shall use this theorem to establish the Mobius
and Nilsequences conjecture from our earlier paper "Linear equations in
primes".
