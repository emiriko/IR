A critique on the interpretation of the double prism experiment on the
evanescent microwave modes (arXiv:0708.0681) is presented. It is argued that
these experiments do not give any evidence of superluminal photons. A physical
mechanism based on the inhomogeneous waves of classical electromagnetic fields
is proposed.
