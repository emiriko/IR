Electroweak Sudakov corrections of the form alpha^n log^m s/M_{W,Z}^2 are
summed using renormalization group evolution in soft-collinear effective theory
(SCET). Results are given for the scalar, vector and tensor form-factors for
fermion and scalar particles. The formalism for including massive gauge bosons
in SCET is developed.
