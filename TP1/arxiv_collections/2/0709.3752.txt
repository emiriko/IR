We show that the homogeneous approximation property and the comparison
theorem hold for arbitrary coherent frames. This observation answers some
questions about the density of frames that are not covered by the theory of
Balan, Casazza, Heil, and Landau. The proofs are a variation of the method
developed by Ramanathan and Steger.
