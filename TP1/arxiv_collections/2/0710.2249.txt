The total cross sections of the pp -> pK+ Lambda reaction near threshold
measured at the COSY(Juelich) synchrotron using the internal target facility
COSY-11 are described in the frame of the model taking into account the one
pion and one kaon exchange as well as the final state interaction mechanisms.
