I review the Lee-Nauenberg thereom and discuss its inclusion of photons which
are disconnected at the level of the S-matrix but connected at the level of the
cross-section when there are initial and final state charged particles. I then
expose a new set of soft collinear divergences in massless gauge theories which
are omitted in the standard Lee-Nauenberg approach. It seems that highly
questionable assumptions are needed to obtain finite cross-sections.
