The CERN Neutrino to Gran Sasso (CNGS) project aims to produce a high energy,
wide band $\nu_{\mu}$ beam at CERN and send it toward the INFN Gran Sasso
National Laboratory (LNGS), 732 km away. Its main goal is the observation of
the $\nu_{\tau}$ appearance, through neutrino flavour oscillation. The beam
started its operation in August 2006 for about 12 days: a total amount of
$7.6~10^{17}$ protons were delivered to the target. The LVD detector, installed
in hall A of the LNGS and mainly dedicated to the study of supernova neutrinos,
was fully operating during the whole CNGS running time. A total number of 569
events were detected in coincidence with the beam spill time. This is in good
agreement with the expected number of events from Montecarlo simulations.
