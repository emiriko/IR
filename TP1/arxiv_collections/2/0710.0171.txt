In recent work, we have proven uniform decay bounds for solutions of the wave
equation $\Box_g\phi=0$ on a Schwarzschild exterior, in particular, the uniform
pointwise estimate $|\phi|\le Cv_+^{-1}$, which holds throughout the domain of
outer communications, where $v$ is an advanced Eddington-Finkelstein
coordinate, $v_+=\max\{v,1\}$, and $C$ is a constant depending on a Sobolev
norm of initial data. A crucial estimate in the proof required a decomposition
into spherical harmonics. We here give an alternative proof of this estimate
not requiring such a decomposition.
