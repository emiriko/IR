The Higgs sector may play an important role in detecting the mirror
particles, which can be the candidates of the dark matter and appear as missing
energy in the detectors at the LHC. In this paper we worked out the Higgs boson
spectrum and the Higgs couplings for the symmetric vacuum, namely $v_1=v_2=v$,
in the mirror model, and investigated the constraints from electro-weak
precision observable (EWPO). Our study showed that the EWPO has already
constrained the Higgs boson sector severely. We then explored the Higgs boson
phenomenology, and focused on the scenario that the heavier Higgs boson $H$ can
decay into a pair of lighter Higgs boson $h$. We proposed to study the
invisible decay of the Higgs boson via the pair production of them, in which
one Higgs boson decays into bottom quarks and the other decays invisibly. Our
detail simulation for signals and backgrounds showed that the observation of
signal can reach $5\sigma$ significance for $m_H=260$ GeV and $m_h=115$ GeV
with $10 fb^{-1}$integrated luminosity at the LHC. Moreover the possible method
to further suppress dominant $Zb\bar{b}$ background was discussed. We also
simulated the signals and backgrounds for $H \to h h \to 4b$. Our results
showed that it is very difficult to isolate the signals from huge QCD continuum
backgrounds.
