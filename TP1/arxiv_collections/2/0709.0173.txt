Recent results on measurements of the strong coupling $\alpha_S$ from LEP are
reported. These include analyses of the 4-jet rate using the Durham or
Cambridge algorithm, of hadronic $Z^0$ decays with hard final state photon
radiation, of scaling violations of the fragmentation function, of the
longitudinal cross section, of the $Z^0$ lineshape and of hadronic $\tau$
lepton decays.
