Partons produced in the early stage of non-central heavy-ion collisions can
develop a longitudinal fluid shear because of unequal local number densities of
participant target and projectile nucleons. Under such fluid shear, local
parton pairs with non-vanishing impact parameter have finite local relative
orbital angular momentum along the direction opposite to the reaction plane.
Such finite relative orbital angular momentum among locally interacting quark
pairs can lead to global quark polarization along the same direction due to
spin-orbital coupling. Local longitudinal fluid shear is estimated within both
Landau fireball and Bjorken scaling model of initial parton production. Quark
polarization through quark-quark scatterings with the exchange of a thermal
gluon is calculated beyond small-angle scattering approximation in a
quark-gluon plasma. The polarization is shown to have a non-monotonic
dependence on the local relative orbital angular momentum dictated by the
interplay between electric and magnetic interaction. It peaks at a value of
relative orbital angular momentum which scales with the magnetic mass of the
exchanged gluons. With the estimated small longitudinal fluid shear in
semi-peripheral $Au+Au$ collisions at the RHIC energy, the final quark
polarization is found to be small $|P_q|<0.04$ in the weak coupling limit.
Possible behavior of the quark polarization in the strong coupling limit and
implications on the experimental detection of such global quark polarization at
RHIC and LHC are also discussed.
