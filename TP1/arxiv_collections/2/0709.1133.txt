We use a coarse grained solvent model to study the self assembly of two
nano-scale hydrophobic particles in water. We show how solvent degrees of
freedom are involved in the process. By using tools of transition path
sampling, we elucidate the reaction coordinates describing the assembly. In
accord with earlier expectations, we find that fluctuations of the
liquid-vapor-like interface surrounding the solutes are significant, in this
case leading to the formation of a vapor tunnel between the two solute
particles. This tunnel accelerates assembly. While considering this specific
model system, the approach we use illustrates a methodology that is broadly
applicable.
