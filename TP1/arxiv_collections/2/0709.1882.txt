In this paper we apply the formalism of the analytical signal theory to the
Schrodinger wavefunction. Making use exclusively of the wave-particle duality
and the principle of relativistic covariance, we actually derive the form of
the quantum energy and momentum operators for a single nonrelativistic
particle. Without using any more quantum postulates, and employing the
formalism of the characteristic function, we also derive the quantum-mechanical
prescription for the measurement probability in such cases.
