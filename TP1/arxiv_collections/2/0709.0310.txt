We study pluricanonical systems on smooth projective varieties of positive
Kodaira dimension, following the approach of Hacon-McKernan, Takayama and Tsuji
succesfully used in the case of varieties of general type. We prove a
uniformity result for the Iitaka fibration of smooth projective varieties of
positive Kodaira dimension, provided that the base of the Iitaka fibration is
not uniruled, the variation of the fibration is maximal, and the generic fiber
has a good minimal model.
