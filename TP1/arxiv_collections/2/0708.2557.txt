We consider the problem of secure identification: user U proves to server S
that he knows an agreed (possibly low-entropy) password w, while giving away as
little information on w as possible, namely the adversary can exclude at most
one possible password for each execution of the scheme. We propose a solution
in the bounded-quantum-storage model, where U and S may exchange qubits, and a
dishonest party is assumed to have limited quantum memory. No other restriction
is posed upon the adversary.
  An improved version of the proposed identification scheme is also secure
against a man-in-the-middle attack, but requires U and S to additionally share
a high-entropy key k. However, security is still guaranteed if one party loses
k to the attacker but notices the loss. In both versions of the scheme, the
honest participants need no quantum memory, and noise and imperfect quantum
sources can be tolerated. The schemes compose sequentially, and w and k can
securely be re-used.
  A small modification to the identification scheme results in a
quantum-key-distribution (QKD) scheme, secure in the bounded-quantum-storage
model, with the same re-usability properties of the keys, and without assuming
authenticated channels. This is in sharp contrast to known QKD schemes (with
unbounded adversary) without authenticated channels, where authentication keys
must be updated, and unsuccessful executions can cause the parties to run out
of keys.
