A systematic expansion of the Boltzmann equation for the diffusion of dilute
tracers, in powers of the Knudsen number, carried out to next-to-leading order
(NLO), gives the relativistic causal diffusion equation (Kelly's equation).
Using dimensionless combinations of dynamical quantities, we show when the
small NLO term plays a crucially important role. We proceed to show that a
derivation of Kelly's equation from a microscopic theory of the correlation
function of the number density of diffusers is possible. The correlator fulfils
the Green-Kubo relation for the diffusion constant, as well as an f-sum which
goes beyond a purely phenomenological causal theory. We argue that the
construction generalizes to the full hydrodynamic equations.
