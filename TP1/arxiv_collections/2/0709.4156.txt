We present spatially resolved Raman images of the G and 2D lines of
single-layer graphene flakes. The spatial fluctuations of G and 2D lines are
correlated and are thus shown to be affiliated with local doping domains. We
investigate the position of the 2D line -- the most significant Raman peak to
identify single-layer graphene -- as a function of charging up to |n|~4 10^12
cm^-2. Contrary to the G line which exhibits a strong and symmetric stiffening
with respect to electron and hole-doping, the 2D line shows a weak and slightly
asymmetric stiffening for low doping. Additionally, the line width of the 2D
line is, in contrast to the G line, doping-independent making this quantity a
reliable measure for identifying single-layer graphene.
