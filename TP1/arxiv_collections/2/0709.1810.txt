We demonstrate experimentally the tunable control of the joint spectrum, i.e.
waveform and degree of frequency correlations, of paired photons generated in
spontaneous parametric downconversion. This control is mediated by the spatial
shape of the pump beam in a type-I noncollinear configuration. We discuss the
applicability of this technique to other sources of frequency entangled
photons, such as electromagnetically induced Raman transitions.
