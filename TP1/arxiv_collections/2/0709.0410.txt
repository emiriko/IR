The transport of excitation probabilities amongst weakly coupled subunits is
investigated for a class of finite quantum systems. It is demonstrated that the
dynamical behavior of the transported quantity depends on the considered length
scale, e. g., the introduced distinction between diffusive and ballistic
transport appears to be a scale-dependent concept, especially since a
transition from diffusive to ballistic behavior is found in the limit of small
as well as in the limit of large length scales. All these results are derived
by an application of the time-convolutionless projection operator technique and
are verified by the numerical solution of the full time-dependent Schroedinger
equation which is obtained by exact diagonalization for a range of model
parameters.
