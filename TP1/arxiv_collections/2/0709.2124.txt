Mechanical losses of crystalline silicon and calcium fluoride have been
analyzed in the temperature range from 5 to 300 K by our novel mechanical
spectroscopy method, cryogenic resonant acoustic spectroscopy of bulk materials
(CRA spectrocopy). The focus lies on the interpretation of the measured data
according to phonon-phonon interactions and defect induced losses in
consideration of the excited mode shape.
