We consider the perturbation of elliptic operators of the form
  $P(\bx,\bD)$ by random, rapidly varying, sufficiently mixing, potentials of
the form $q(\frac{\bx}\eps,\omega)$. We analyze the source and spectral
problems associated to such operators and show that the properly renormalized
difference between the perturbed and unperturbed solutions may be written
asymptotically as $\eps\to0$ as explicit Gaussian processes. Such results may
be seen as central limit corrections to the homogenization (law of large
numbers) process. Similar results are derived for more general elliptic
equations in one dimension of space. The results are based on the availability
of a rapidly converging integral formulation for the perturbed solutions and on
the use of classical central limit results for random processes with
appropriate mixing conditions.
