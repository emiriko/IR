We study robustness of bipartite entangled states that are positive under
partial transposition (PPT). It is shown that almost all PPT entangled states
are unconditionally robust, in the sense, both inseparability and positivity
are preserved under sufficiently small perturbations in its immediate
neighborhood. Such unconditionally robust PPT entangled states lie inside an
open PPT entangled ball. We construct examples of such balls whose radii are
shown to be finite and can be explicitly calculated. This provides a lower
bound on the volume of all PPT entangled states. Multipartite generalization of
our constructions are also outlined.
