We consider error correction procedures designed specifically for the
amplitude damping channel. We analyze amplitude damping errors in the
stabilizer formalism. This analysis allows a generalization of the [4,1]
`approximate' amplitude damping code of quant-ph/9704002. We present this
generalization as a class of [2(M+1),M] codes and present quantum circuits for
encoding and recovery operations. We also present a [7,3] amplitude damping
code based on the classical Hamming code. All of these are stabilizer codes
whose encoding and recovery operations can be completely described with
Clifford group operations. Finally, we describe optimization options in which
recovery operations may be further adapted according to the damping probability
gamma.
