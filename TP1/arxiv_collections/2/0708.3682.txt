Entanglement is a physical resource of a quantum system just like mass,
charge or energy. Moreover it is an essential tool for many purposes of
nowadays quantum information processing, e.g. quantum teleportation, quantum
cryptography or quantum computation. In this work we investigate an extended
system of N qubits. In our system a qubit is the absence or presence of an
electron at a site of a tight-binding system. Several measures of entanglement
between a given qubit and the rest of the system and also the entanglement
between two qubits and the rest of the system is calculated in a one-electron
picture in the presence of disorder. We invoke the power law band random matrix
model which even in one dimension is able to produce multifractal states that
fluctuate at all length scales. The concurrence, the tangle and the
entanglement entropy all show interesting scaling properties.
