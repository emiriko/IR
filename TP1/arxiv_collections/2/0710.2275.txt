We describe the present status of the pion distribution amplitude (DA) as it
originates from several sources: (i) a nonperturbative approach based on QCD
sum rules with nonlocal condensates, (ii) an $O(\alpha_s)$ QCD analysis of the
CLEO data on F^{\gamma\gamma^*\pi}(Q^2) with asymptotic and renormalon models
for higher twists, and (iii) recent high-precision lattice QCD calculations of
the second moment of the pion DA. We show predictions for the pion
electromagnetic form factor, obtained in analytic QCD perturbation theory, and
compare it with the JLab data on F_{\pi}(Q^2). We also discuss in this context
an improved model for nonlocal condensates in QCD and show its consequences for
the pion DA and the \gamma\gamma^*\to\pi transition form factor. We include a
brief analysis of meson-induced massive lepton (muon) Drell--Yan production for
the process \pi^{-}N\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}X, considering both an unpolarized nucleon
target and longitudinally polarized protons.
