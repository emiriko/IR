The most exciting recent development in nonlinear dynamics is realization
that chaos can be useful. One application involves "Secure Communication". Two
piecewise linear systems with switching nonlinearities have been taken as chaos
generators. In the present work the phenomenon of secure communication with
chaos masking has been investigated experimentally. In this investigation chaos
which is generated from two chaos generators is masked with the massage signal
to be transmitted, thus makes communication is more secure.
