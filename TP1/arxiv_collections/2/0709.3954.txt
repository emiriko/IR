We simulate cluster formation of model colloidal particles interacting via
DLVO (Derjaguin, Landau, Vervey, Overbeek) potentials. The interaction
potentials can be related to experimental conditions, defined by the pH-value,
the salt concentration and the volume fraction of solid particles suspended in
water. The system shows different structural properties for different
conditions, including cluster formation, a glass-like repulsive structure, or a
liquid suspension. Since many simulations are needed to explore the whole
parameter space, when investigating the properties of the suspension depending
on the experimental conditions, we have developed a steering approach to
control a running simulation and to detect interesting transitions from one
region in the configuration space to another. The advantages of the steering
approach and the restrictions of its applicability due to physical constraints
are illustrated by several example cases.
