In this paper we show that the Hausdorff dimension of the set of singular
pairs is 4/3. We also show that the action of diag(e^t,e^t,e^{-2t}) on
SL(3,R)/SL(3,Z) admits divergent trajectories that exit to infinity at
arbitrarily slow prescribed rates, answering a question of A.N. Starkov. As a
by-product of the analysis, we obtain a higher dimensional generalisation of
the basic inequalities satisfied by convergents of continued fractions. As an
illustration of the techniques used to compute Hausdorff dimension, we show
that the set of real numbers with divergent partial quotients has Hausdorff
dimension 1/2.
