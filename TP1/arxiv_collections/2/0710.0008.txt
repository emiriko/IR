We present the results of calculations defining global, three-dimensional
representations of the complex-valued potential-energy surfaces of the doublet
B1, doublet A1, and doublet B2 metastable states of the water anion that
underlie the physical process of dissociative electron attachment to water. The
real part of the resonance energies is obtained from configuration-interaction
calculations performed in a restricted Hilbert space, while the imaginary part
of the energies (the widths) is derived from complex Kohn scattering
calculations. A diabatization is performed on the 2A1 and 2B2 surfaces, due to
the presence of a conical intersection between them. We discuss the
implications that the shapes of the constructed potential-energy surfaces will
have upon the nuclear dynamics of dissociative electron attachment to H2O.
