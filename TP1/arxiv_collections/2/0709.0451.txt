The physics objectives of SuperB, an asymmetric electron-positron collider
with a luminosity above 10^36/cm^2/s are described, together with the
conceptual design of a novel low emittance design that achieves this
performance with wallplug power comparable to that of the current B Factories,
and an upgraded detector capable of doing the physics in the SuperB
environment.
