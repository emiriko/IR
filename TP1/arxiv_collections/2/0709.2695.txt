We demonstrate occurrence of bimodality and dynamical hysteresis in a system
describing an overdamped quartic oscillator perturbed by additive white and
asymmetric L\'evy noise. Investigated estimators of the stationary probability
density profiles display not only a turnover from unimodal to bimodal character
but also a change in a relative stability of stationary states that depends on
the asymmetry parameter of the underlying noise term. When varying the
asymmetry parameter cyclically, the system exhibits a hysteresis in the
occupation of a chosen stationary state.
