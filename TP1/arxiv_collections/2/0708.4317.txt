The Hasegawa-Wakatani equations, coupling plasma density and electrostatic
potential through an approximation to the physics of parallel electron motions,
are a simple model that describes resistive drift wave turbulence. We present
numerical analyses of bifurcation phenomena in the model that provide new
insights into the interactions between turbulence and zonal flows in the
tokamak plasma edge region. The simulation results show a regime where, after
an initial transient, drift wave turbulence is suppressed through zonal flow
generation. As a parameter controlling the strength of the turbulence is tuned,
this zonal flow dominated state is rapidly destroyed and a turbulence-dominated
state re-emerges. The transition is explained in terms of the Kelvin-Helmholtz
stability of zonal flows. This is the first observation of an upshift of
turbulence onset in the resistive drift wave system, which is analogous to the
well-known Dimits shift in turbulence driven by ion temperature gradients.
