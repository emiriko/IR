We give a simple recipe for translating walks on Cayley graphs of a group G
into a quantum operation on any irrep of G. Most properties of the classical
walk carry over to the quantum operation: degree becomes the number of Kraus
operators, the spectral gap becomes the gap of the quantum operation (viewed as
a linear map on density matrices), and the quantum operation is efficient
whenever the classical walk and the quantum Fourier transform on G are
efficient. This means that using classical constant-degree constant-gap
families of Cayley expander graphs on e.g. the symmetric group, we can
construct efficient families of quantum expanders.
