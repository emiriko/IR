In the context of low-energy Supersymmetry, a model of Grand Unification with
right-handed neutrinos, based on the group SU(5), is discussed and its
implications for neutralino dark matter (DM) are studied and compared with the
constrained MSSM. RG effects in this model modify the sparticle spectrum such
that the WMAP limit on the DM relic density cannot be satisfied for small
values of $\tan\beta$ ($\tan\beta \lesssim 35$) and the region of the parameter
space allowed by efficient neutralino-stau coannihilation presents a peculiar
phenomenology and an upper bound on the neutralino mass for most of the
parameters choices.
