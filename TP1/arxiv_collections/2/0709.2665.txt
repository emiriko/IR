The Tevatron proton-antiproton collider at Fermilab with its centre of mass
energy of 1.96 TeV is currently the only source for the production of top
quarks. Its increased luminosity and centre of mass energy in Run II allow both
collider detectors CDF and D0 to study top quarks with unprecedented scrutiny.
  Recent results on the top quark's pair production cross section and its
properties such as mass, electric charge, helicity of the W boson in its decay
and branching fraction B(t->Wb) are presented and probe the validity of the
Standard Model.
