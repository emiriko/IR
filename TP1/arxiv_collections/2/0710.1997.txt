The dominance of $h\to \eta \eta$ decay mode for the intermediate mass Higgs
boson is highly motivated to solve the little hierarchy problem and to ease the
tension with the precision data. However, the discovery modes for $m_h \alt
150$ GeV, $h \to \gamma\gamma$ and $W/Z h \to (\ell\nu/\ell \bar \ell) (b\bar
b)$, will be substantially affected. We show that $h \to \eta \eta \to 4b$ is
complementary and we can use this decay mode to detect the intermediate Higgs
boson at the LHC, via $Wh$ and $Zh$ production. Requiring at least one charged
lepton and 4 $B$-tags in the final state, we can identify a clean Higgs boson
signal for $m_h \alt 150$ GeV with a high significance and with a full Higgs
mass reconstruction. We use the next-to-minimal supersymmetric standard model
and the simplest little Higgs model for illustration.
