The quantised Josephson junction equation that underpins the behaviour of
charge qubits and other tunnel devices is usually derived through cannonical
quantisation of the classical macroscopic Josephson relations. However, this
approach may neglect effects due to the fact that the charge qubit consists of
a superconducting island of finite size connected to a large superconductor.
  We show that the well known quantised Josephson equation can be derived
directly and simply from a microscopic many-body Hamiltonian. By choosing the
appropriate strong coupling limit we produce a highly simplified Hamiltonian
that nevertheless allows us to go beyond the mean field limit and predict
further finite-size terms in addition to the basic equation.
