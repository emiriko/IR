We propose a BEC stirring device which can be regarded as the incorporation
of a quantum pump into a closed circuit: it produces a DC circulating current
in response to a cyclic adiabatic change of two control parameters of an
optical trap. We demonstrate the feasibility of this concept and point out that
such device can be utilized in order to probe the interatomic interactions.
