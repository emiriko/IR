We report measurements of the evolution of lines, planes, and volumes in an
intensely turbulent laboratory flow using high-speed particle tracking. We find
that the classical characteristic time scale of an eddy at the initial scale of
the object considered is the natural time scale for the subsequent evolution.
The initial separation may only be neglected if this time scale is much smaller
than the largest turbulence time scale, implying extremely high turbulence
levels.
