It is shown that lines of adsorbed hydrogen pair atoms divide the graphene
sheet into strips and form hydrogen-based superlattice structures (2HG-SL). We
show that the forming of 2HG-SL drastically changes the electronic properties
of graphene from semimetal to semiconductor. The electronic spectra of "zigzag"
(n,0) 2HG-SL is similar to that of (n,0) carbon nanotubes and have a similar
oscillation of band gap with number n, but with non-zero minimal values. The
composite dual-periodic (n,0)+(m,0) 2HG-SLs of "zigzag" strips are analyzed,
with the conclusion that they may be treated as quasi-two-dimensional
heterostructures. We also suggest an experimental way of fabricating hydrogen
superlattices.
