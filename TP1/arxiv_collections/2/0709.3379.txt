We present a version of the Luescher-Weisz multilevel algorithm ideally
suited for studying excited states of the QCD flux tube. While the original
version achieved error reduction only in the temporal direction, the new
algorithm reduces fluctuations in the sources as well. We report on the
implementation of this algorithm as well as improvement over the older method.
We also present first results, where we see a good agreement with theoretical
predictions from bosonic string models.
