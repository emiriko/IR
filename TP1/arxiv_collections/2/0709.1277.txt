Plutarchus, circa 100 AD, in his early book on "astrophysics" --in which he
exposed, in a sense, a general theory of gravitation-- wrote the noticeable
passage: <<The Moon gets the guarantee of not falling down just from its motion
and from the dash associated with its revolution, exactly as stones in slings
cannot fall due to their circular whirling motion; in fact, each thing is
dragged by its mere natural motion only if it isn't deviated by something else.
The Moon, therefore, is not dragged down by its weight, because its natural
tendency is frustrated by its revolution. And, on the contrary, it would be
really amazing if it could remain at rest always at the same place, like the
Earth>>. While Posidonius (circa 135-51 BC) had written: <<Matter is endowed
with a cohesion that keeps it together and against which the surrounding vacuum
has no power. Indeed, the material world is supported by an immense force, and
alternately contracts and expands in the vacuum following its own physical
processes, now consumed by fire, now, instead, giving rise to a new creation of
the cosmos>>. These two examples show how "modern" was part of the ancient
Greek physics, frequently overlooked since it is sometimes known through the
praiseworthy translations of scholars often competent in humanities, more than
in science. [A more extended English summary appears at the beginning of this
