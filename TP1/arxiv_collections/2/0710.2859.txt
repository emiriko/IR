We recently shown, using tight-binding calculations, that nonequilibrium
valley polarization can be realized in graphene, when the current is injected
through "valley filter": a ballistic point contact with zigzag edges. Here we
demonstrate, that the effect is surprisingly robust against changing the
crystallographic orientation of the filter axis. Namely, the output current
remains polarized unless a point contact has perfect armchair edges, at which
two subblattices are equally represented. The polarization is inverted when the
filter orientation crosses the amchair line and, subsequently, dominating
subblattice index of terminal atoms changes. In a bended graphene strip, the
valley-polarized current can be directed towards one edge providing a
theoretical possibility to observe a zero-magnetic-field analogue of the
well-known Hall effect. For the valley valve, build of two valley filters in
series and controlled elecrostatically by a gate voltage, the
conductance-to-gate characteristic is inverted when $\pi/3$ vertex is placed
between two filters.
