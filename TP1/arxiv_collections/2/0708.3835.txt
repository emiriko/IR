A model universe is proposed in the framework of 5-dimensional noncompact
Kaluza-Klein cosmology which is not Ricci flat. The 4D part as the
Robertson-Walker metric is coupled to conventional perfect fluid, and its
extra-dimensional part is coupled to a dark pressure through a scalar field. It
is shown that neither early inflation nor current acceleration of the 4D
universe would happen if the non-vacuum states of the scalar field would
contribute to 4D cosmology.
