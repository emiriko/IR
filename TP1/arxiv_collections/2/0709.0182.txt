A robust scheme for state preparation and state trapping for the spins of two
electrons in a semiconductor double quantum dot is presented. The system is
modeled by two spins coupled to two independent bosonic reservoirs. Decoherence
effects due to this environment are minimized by application of optimized
control fields which make the target state to the ground state of the isolated
driven spin system. We show that stable spin entanglement with respect to pure
dephasing is possible. Specifically, we demonstrate state trapping in a
maximally entangled state (Bell state) in the presence of decoherence.
