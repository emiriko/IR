We present simulation results for the 2-flavour Schwinger model with
dynamical overlap fermions. In particular we apply the overlap hypercube
operator at seven light fermion masses. In each case we collect sizable
statistics in the topological sectors 0 and 1. Since the chiral condensate
Sigma vanishes in the chiral limit, we observe densities for the microscopic
Dirac spectrum, which have not been addressed yet by Random Matrix Theory
(RMT). Nevertheless, by confronting the averages of the lowest eigenvalues in
different topological sectors with chiral RMT in unitary ensemble we obtain --
for the very light fermion masses -- values for Sigma that follow closely the
analytical predictions in the continuum.
