We use quantum discord to characterize the correlations present in the
quantum computational model DQC1, introduced by Knill and Laflamme [Phys. Rev.
Lett. 81, 5672 (1998)]. The model involves a collection of qubits in the
completely mixed state coupled to a single control qubit that has nonzero
purity. The initial state, operations, and measurements in the model all point
to a natural bipartite split between the control qubit and the mixed ones.
Although there is no entanglement between these two parts, we show that the
quantum discord across this split is nonzero for typical instances of the DQC1
ciruit. Nonzero values of discord indicate the presence of nonclassical
correlations. We propose quantum discord as figure of merit for characterizing
the resources present in this computational model.
