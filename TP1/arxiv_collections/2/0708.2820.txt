In this paper a search for associated charm production both in neutral and
charged current $\nu$-nucleus interactions is presented. The improvement of
automatic scanning systems in the {CHORUS} experiment allows an efficient
search to be performed in emulsion for short-lived particles. Hence a search
for rare processes, like the associated charm production, becomes possible
through the observation of the double charm-decay topology with a very low
background. About 130,000 $\nu$ interactions located in the emulsion target
have been analysed. Three events with two charm decays have been observed in
the neutral-current sample with an estimated background of 0.18$\pm$0.05. The
relative rate of the associated charm cross-section in deep inelastic $\nu$
interactions, $\sigma(c\bar{c}\nu)/\sigma_\mathrm{NC}^\mathrm{DIS}=
(3.62^{+2.95}_{-2.42}({stat})\pm 0.54({syst}))\times 10^{-3}$ has been
measured. One event with two charm decays has been observed in charged-current
$\nu_\mu$ interactions with an estimated background of 0.18$\pm$0.06 and the
upper limit on associated charm production in charged-current interactions at
90% C.L. has been found to be $\sigma (c\bar{c} \mu^-)/\sigma_\mathrm{CC} <
9.69 \times 10^{-4}$.
