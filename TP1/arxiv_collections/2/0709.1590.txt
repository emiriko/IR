The homogeneous shear of the {111} planes along the <110> direction of bulk
silicon has been investigated using ab initio techniques, to better understand
the strain properties of both shuffle and glide set planes. Similar
calculations have been done with three empirical potentials, Stillinger-Weber,
Tersoff and EDIP, in order to find the one giving the best results under large
shear strains. The generalized stacking fault energies have also been
calculated with these potentials to complement this study. It turns out that
the Stillinger-Weber potential better reproduces the ab initio results, for the
smoothness and the amplitude of the energy variation as well as the
localization of shear in the shuffle set.
