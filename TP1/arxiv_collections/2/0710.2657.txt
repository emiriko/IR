The particle and momentum balance equations can be solved on concentric
circular flux surfaces to determine the effective viscous drag present in a
magnetized tokamak plasma in the low aspect ratio limit. An analysis is
developed utilizing the first-order Fourier expansion of the poloidal variation
of quantities on the flux surface akin to that by Stacey and Sigmar [Phys.
Fluids, 28, 9 (1985)]. Expressions to determine the poloidal variations of
density, poloidal velocity, toroidal velocity, radial electric field, poloidal
electric field, and other radial profiles are presented in a multi-species
setting. Using as input experimental data for the flux surface averaged
profiles of density, temperature, toroidal current, toroidal momentum
injection, and the poloidal and toroidal rotations of at least one species of
ion, one may solve the equations numerically for the remaining profiles. The
resultant effective viscosities are compared to those predicted by Stacey and
Sigmar and Shaing, et al., [Nuclear Fusion, 25, 4 (1985)]. A velocity
dependence of the effective viscosity is observed, indicating the presence of
non-Newtonian fluid behavior in magnetized plasma.
