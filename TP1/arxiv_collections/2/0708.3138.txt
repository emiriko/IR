The dynamics of liquid condensation on a substrate or within a capillary is
studied when the wetting film grows via interface-limited growth. We use a
phenomenological time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL)-type model with
long-range substrate potential. Using an order parameter, which does not
directly represent the density, we can derive an analytic formula for the
interfacial growth velocity that is directly related to the substrate
potential. Using this analytic expression the growth of wetting film is shown
to conform to a power-law-type growth, which is due to the presence of a
long-range dispersion force.
