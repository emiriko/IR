We study topological properties of quasi-particle states in the non-Abelian
quantum Hall states. We apply a skein-theoretic method to the Read--Rezayi
state whose effective theory is the SU(2)_K Chern--Simons theory. As a
generalization of the Pfaffian (K=2) and the Fibonacci (K=3) anyon states, we
compute the braiding matrices of quasi-particle states with arbitrary spins.
Furthermore we propose a method to compute the entanglement entropy
skein-theoretically. We find that the entanglement entropy has a nontrivial
contribution called the topological entanglement entropy which depends on the
quantum dimension of non-Abelian quasi-particle intertwining two subsystems.
