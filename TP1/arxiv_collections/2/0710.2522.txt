Recently, a homogeneous superfluid state with a single gapless Fermi surface
was predicted to be the ground state of an ultracold Fermi gas with spin
population imbalance in the regime of molecular Bose-Einstein condensation. We
study vortices in this novel state using a symmetry-based effective field
theory, which captures the low-energy physics of gapless fermions and
superfluid phase fluctuations. This theory is applicable to all spin-imbalanced
ultracold Fermi gases in the superfluid regime, regardless of whether the
original fermion pairing interaction is weak or strong. We find a remarkable,
unconventional form of the interaction between vortices. The presence of
gapless fermions gives rise to a spatially oscillating potential, akin to the
RKKY indirect-exchange interaction in non-magnetic metals. We compare the
parameters of the effective theory to the experimentally measurable quantities
and further discuss the conditions for the verification of the predicted new
feature. Our study opens up an interesting question as to the nature of the
vortex lattice resulting from the competition between the usual repulsive
logarithmic (2D Coulomb) and predominantly attractive fermion-induced
interactions.
