We report first STAR measurement on two heavy-flavor particle correlations in
p+p collisions at RHIC. Heavy-flavor (charm and bottom) events are identified
and separated on a statistical basis by the azimuthal correlation of their
decay electrons and open charm mesons, which yield important information about
the underlying production mechanism. The azimuthal correlation distribution
exhibits a two-peak structure which can be attributed to B decays on the
near-side and predominantly charm pair production on the away-side. These
assumptions are supported by dedicated simulations using PYTHIA and MC@NLO
event generators. This novel correlation technique will allow comprehensive
energy-loss measurements of heavy quarks in heavy-ion collisions.
