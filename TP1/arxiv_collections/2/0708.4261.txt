We construct a sigma model in two dimensions with Galilean symmetry in flat
target space similar to the sigma model of the critical string theory with
Lorentz symmetry in 10 flat spacetime dimensions. This is motivated by the
works of Gomis and Ooguri\cite{Gomis:2000bd} and Danielsson et. al.
\cite{Danielsson:2000gi, Danielsson:2000mu}. Our theory is much simpler than
their theory and does not assume a compact coordinate. This non-relativistic
string theory has a bosonic matter $\beta\gamma$ CFT with the conformal weight
of $\beta$ as 1. It is natural to identify time as a linear combination of
$\gamma$ and $\bar{\gamma}$ through an explicit realization of the Galilean
boost symmetry. The angle between $\gamma$ and $\bar{\gamma}$ parametrizes one
parameter family of selection sectors. These selection sectors are responsible
for having a non-relativistic dispersion relation without a nontrivial topology
in the non-relativistic setup, which is one of the major differences from the
previous works\cite{Gomis:2000bd, Danielsson:2000gi, Danielsson:2000mu}. This
simple theory is the non-relativistic analogue of the critical string theory,
and there are many different avenues ahead to be investigated. We mention a
possible consistent generalization of this theory with different conformal
weights for the $\beta\gamma$ CFT. We also mention supersymmetric
generalizations of these theories.
