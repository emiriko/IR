We study orthogonality relations for Fourier frequencies and complex
exponentials in Hilbert spaces $L^2(\mu)$ with measures $\mu$ arising from
iterated function systems (IFS). This includes equilibrium measures in complex
dynamics. Motivated by applications, we draw parallels between analysis of
fractal measures on the one hand, and the geometry of wavelets on the other.
  We are motivated by spectral theory for commuting partial differential
operators and related duality notions. While stated initially for bounded and
open regions in $\br^d$, they have since found reformulations in the theory of
fractals and wavelets. We include a historical sketch with questions from early
operator theory.
