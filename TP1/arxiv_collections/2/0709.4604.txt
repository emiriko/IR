Analytical treatment of time transfer problem for Earth-Satellite system is
presented. The development was made in a complete relativistic framework. In
accordance with modern clock precision and for low altitude orbits, we neglect
the other bodies and consider only the 1/c^2 Earth potential developed up to
the J_2 term in spherical harmonics.
