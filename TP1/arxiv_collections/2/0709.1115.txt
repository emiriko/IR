In the chain compound PrBa$_2$Cu$_4$O$_8$ localization appears simultaneously
with a dimensional crossover in the electronic ground state when the scattering
rate in the chains exceeds the hopping rate between the chains. Here we report
the discovery of a large, transverse magnetoresistance in PrBa$_2$Cu$_4$O$_8$
in the localized regime. This result suggests a novel form of localization
whereby electrons retain their metallic (quasi-one-dimensional) character over
a microscopic length scale despite the fact that macroscopically, they exhibit
localized (one-dimensional) behavior.
