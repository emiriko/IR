These proceedings describe Sleuth, a quasi-model-independent search strategy
targeting new electroweak scale physics, and its application to 927 pb^-1 of
CDF II data. Exclusive final states are analyzed for an excess of data beyond
the Standard Model prediction at large summed scalar transverse momentum. This
analysis of high-pT data represents one of the most encompassing searches so
far conducted for new physics at the energy frontier.
