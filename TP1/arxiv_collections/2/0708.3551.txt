We analyzed the yield and fidelity of the quantum state transfer (QST) from a
photon polarization qubit to an electron spin qubit in a spin-coherent photo
detector consisting of a semiconductor quantum dot. We used a model consisting
of the quantum dot, where the QST is carried out, coupled with a photonic
cavity. We determined the optimal conditions that allow the realization of both
high-yield and high-fidelity QST.
