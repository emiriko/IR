We have analyzed the angular distributions of the b- particles emitted in
Kr+Em -reaction at 0.95 A GeV and in Au+Em -reaction at 10.7 A GeV and compared
these with lighter projectile experiments for which some structure in the
angular distribution of slow particles was observed. The same structure for the
b-particles almost disappears by increasing the projectile mass. We believe
that it is connected with increasing rates of internuclear secondary
interactions which could lead mainly to disappearance of the information about
intermediate baryon system formation. We suggest that it should be taken into
account at event generation for heavy ion interactions to restore the
information on the intermediate baryon system formation.
