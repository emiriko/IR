Quantum game theory, whatever opinions may be held due to its abstract
physical formalism, have already found various applications even outside the
orthodox physics domain. In this paper we introduce the concept of a quantum
auction, its advantages and drawbacks. Then we describe the models that have
already been put forward. A general model involves Wigner formalism and
infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces - we envisage that the implementation might
not be an easy task. But a restricted model advocated by the Hewlett-Packard
group seems to be much easier to implement. Simulations involving humans have
already been performed. We will focus on problems related to combinatorial
auctions and technical assumptions that are made. Quantum approach offers at
least two important developments. Powerful quantum algorithms for finding
solutions would extend the range of possible applications. Quantum strategies,
being qubits, can be teleported but are immune from cloning - therefore extreme
privacy of agent's activity could in principle be guaranteed. Then we point out
some key problem that have to be solved before commercial use would be
possible. With present technology, optical networks, single photon sources and
detectors seems to be sufficient for experimental realization in the near
future. We conclude by describing potential customers, estimating the potential
market size and possible timing.
