Under the effect of common perturbations, the multiple-soliton solution of
the KdV equation is transformed into a sum of an elastic and a first-order
inelastic component. The elastic component is a perturbation series, identical
in structure to the perturbed single-soliton solution. It preserves the
soliton-scattering picture. The inelastic component is generated by
perturbation terms that represent coupling between KdV solitons and
inelastically generated soliton-anti-soliton waves. It asymptotes into solitons
and anti-solitons, that evolve along the characteristic lines of the KdV
solitons. This is demonstrated in the two-soliton case.
