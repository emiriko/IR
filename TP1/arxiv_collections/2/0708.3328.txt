We study the relaxation of a non-equilibrium carrier distribution under the
influence of the electron-electron interaction in the presence of disorder.
Based on the Anderson model, our Hamiltonian is composed from a single particle
part including the disorder and a two-particle part accounting for the Coulomb
interaction. We apply the equation-of-motion approach for the density matrix,
which provides a fully microscopic description of the relaxation. Our results
show that the nonequlibrium distribution in this closed and internally
interacting system relaxes exponentially fast during the initial dynamics. This
fast relaxation can be described by a phenomenological damping rate. The total
single particle energy decreases in the redistribution process, keeping the
total energy of the system fixed. It turns out that the relaxation rate
decreases with increasing disorder.
