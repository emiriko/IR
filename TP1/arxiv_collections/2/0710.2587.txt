The electronic structure of a prototype dilute magnetic semiconductor (DMS),
Ga1-xMnxAs, is studied by magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) spectroscopy. We
prove that the optical transitions originated from impurity bands cause the
strong positive MCD background. The MCD signal due to the E0 transition from
the valence band to the conduction band is negative indicating that the p-d
exchange interactions between the p-carriers and d-spin is antiferromagnetic.
The negative E0 MCD signal also indicates that the hole-doping of the valence
band is not so large as previously assumed. The impurity bands seem to play
important roles for the ferromagnetism of Ga1-xMnxAs.
