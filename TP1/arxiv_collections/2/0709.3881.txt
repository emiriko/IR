In this article we prove that the complement of a very generic curve of
degree at least equal to 14 in the complex projective plane is hyperbolic in
the sense of Kobayashi. Thus, using a new method, we improve the former known
bound obtained by El Goul. We also improve the case of a very generic curve
with two components.
