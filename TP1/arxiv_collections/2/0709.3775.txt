A resonator can be effectively used as a cooler for another linear oscillator
with a much smaller frequency. A huge cooling effect, which could be used to
cool a mechanical oscillator below the energy of quantum fluctuations, has been
predicted by several authors. However, here we show that there is a lower limit
T* on the achievable temperature that was not considered in previous works and
can be higher than the quantum limit in realistic experimental realizations. We
also point out that the decay rate of the resonator, which previous studies
stress should be small, must be larger than the decay rate of the cooled
oscillator for effective cooling.
