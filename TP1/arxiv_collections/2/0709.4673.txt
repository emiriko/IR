In this short note we apply methods of Aspinwall-Katz to compute
superpotentials of D-branes wrapped on more general obstructed rational curves
in Calabi-Yau threefolds. We find an a priori unexpected match between
superpotentials from certain such curves and the superpotentials of
Landau-Ginzburg models corresponding to minimal models.
