Synchronization in an array of mutually coupled systems with a finite
time-delay in coupling is studied using Josephson junction as a model system.
The sum of the transverse Lyapunov exponents is evaluated as a function of the
parameters by linearizing the equation about the synchronization manifold. The
dependence of synchronization on damping parameter, coupling constant and
time-delay is studied numerically. The change in the dynamics of the system due
to time-delay and phase difference between the applied fields is studied. The
case where a small frequency detuning between the applied fields is also
discussed.
