This paper presents a very straightforward method to compute the transient
thermal response to arbitrary power dissipation profiles in electronic devices
with multiple heat sources. Using cubic spline interpolation of simulated or
measured unit power step response curves (Zth-functions), additional errors due
to model reduction can be avoided. No effort has to be spent on the generation
of compact models. The simple analytic form of the interpolating splines can be
exploited to evaluate the convolution integral of the Zth-functions with
arbitrary power profiles at low computational costs. An implementation of the
algorithm in a spreadsheet program (EXCEL) is demonstrated. The results are in
very good agreement with temperature profiles computed by transient Finite
Element simulation but can be obtained in a fraction of the time.
