Linear optics is a promising candidate to enable the construction of quantum
computers. A number of quantum protocols gates based on linear optics have been
demonstrated. However, it is well-known that these gates are non-deterministic
and that higher order nonlinearity is necessary for deterministic operations.
We found the quantum leader election protocol (QLE) can be operated
deterministically only with linear optics, and we have demonstrated the nearly
deterministic operation which overcomes classical limit.
