The data collected during 2005 by the resonant bar Explorer are divided into
segments and incoherently summed in order to perform an all-sky search for
periodic gravitational wave signals. The parameter space of the search spanned
about 40 Hz in frequency, over 23927 positions in the sky. Neither source
orbital corrections nor spindown parameters have been included, with the result
that the search was sensible to isolated neutron stars with a frequency drift
less than 6 X 10^{-11} Hz/s.
  No gravitational wave candidates have been found by means of the present
analysis, which led to a best upper limit of 3.1 X 10^{-23} for the
dimensionless strain amplitude.
