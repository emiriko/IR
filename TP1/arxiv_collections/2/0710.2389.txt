We present a new method of analytically deriving the entanglement of
formation of the bipartite mixed state. The method realizes the optimal
decomposition families of states. Our method can lead to many new results
concerning entanglement of formation, its additivity and entanglement cost. We
illustrate it by investigating the two-qubit state, the separable state, the
maximally correlated state, the isotropic state and the Werner state.
