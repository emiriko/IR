The universality class, even the order of the transition, of the
two-dimensional Ising model depends on the range and the symmetry of the
interactions (Onsager model, Baxter-Wu model, Turban model, etc.), but the
critical temperature is generally the same due to self-duality. Here we
consider a sudden change in the form of the interaction and study the
nonequilibrium critical dynamical properties of the nearest-neighbor model. The
relaxation of the magnetization and the decay of the autocorrelation function
are found to display a power law behavior with characteristic exponents that
depend on the universality class of the initial state.
