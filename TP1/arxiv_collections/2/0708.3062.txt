In the first part of this thesis Bell's theorem is revisited. It points at a
difference between the quantum and the classical world. This difference is
often behind the advantages of solutions using quantum mechanics. New and more
general versions of Bell inequalities are presented. These inequalities involve
multiple settings per observer. Compared with the two-setting inequalities, the
new ones reveal the non-classical character of a broader class of states. Some
of them are also proven to be optimal (tight). Next, we go beyond Bell's
theorem. It is shown, both in theory and in experiment, that incompatibility
between quantum mechanics and realistic theories can be extended into an
important class of nonlocal models. We also show that the violation of Bell
inequalities disqualifies local realistic models with a limited lack of the
experimenter's freedom. This, at first glance quite philosophical result, has
its down-to-earth implications for quantum communication. In the second part of
the thesis well-known examples of quantum communication are reviewed. Next, new
results concerning quantum cryptography and quantum communication complexity
are given.
