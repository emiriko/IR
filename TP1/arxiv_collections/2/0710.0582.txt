Recent theory predicted that the Quantum Spin Hall Effect, a fundamentally
novel quantum state of matter that exists at zero external magnetic field, may
be realized in HgTe/(Hg,Cd)Te quantum wells. We have fabricated such sample
structures with low density and high mobility in which we can tune, through an
external gate voltage, the carrier conduction from n-type to the p-type,
passing through an insulating regime. For thin quantum wells with well width d
< 6.3 nm, the insulating regime shows the conventional behavior of vanishingly
small conductance at low temperature. However, for thicker quantum wells (d >
6.3 nm), the nominally insulating regime shows a plateau of residual
conductance close to 2e^2/h. The residual conductance is independent of the
sample width, indicating that it is caused by edge states. Furthermore, the
residual conductance is destroyed by a small external magnetic field. The
quantum phase transition at the critical thickness, d = 6.3 nm, is also
independently determined from the magnetic field induced insulator to metal
transition. These observations provide experimental evidence of the quantum
spin Hall effect.
