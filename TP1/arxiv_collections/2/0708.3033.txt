We present a method to integrate the equations of motion that govern bound,
accelerated orbits in Schwarzschild spacetime. At each instant the true
worldline is assumed to lie tangent to a reference geodesic, called an
osculating orbit, such that the worldline evolves smoothly from one such
geodesic to the next. Because a geodesic is uniquely identified by a set of
constant orbital elements, the transition between osculating orbits corresponds
to an evolution of the elements. In this paper we derive the evolution
equations for a convenient set of orbital elements, assuming that the force
acts only within the orbital plane; this is the only restriction that we impose
on the formalism, and we do not assume that the force must be small. As an
application of our method, we analyze the relative motion of two massive
bodies, assuming that one body is much smaller than the other. Using the hybrid
Schwarzschild/post-Newtonian equations of motion formulated by Kidder, Will,
and Wiseman, we treat the unperturbed motion as geodesic in a Schwarzschild
spacetime whose mass parameter is equal to the system's total mass. The force
then consists of terms that depend on the system's reduced mass. We highlight
the importance of conservative terms in this force, which cause significant
long-term changes in the time-dependence and phase of the relative orbit. From
our results we infer some general limitations of the radiative approximation to
the gravitational self-force, which uses only the dissipative terms in the
force.
