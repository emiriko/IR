We investigate the phase diagram of asymmetric two-component Fermi gases at
zero temperature as a function of polarization and interaction strength. The
equations of state of the uniform superfluid and normal phase are determined
using quantum Monte Carlo simulations. We find three different mixed states,
where the superfluid and the normal phase coexist in equilibrium, corresponding
to phase separation between: (a) the polarized superfluid and the fully
polarized normal gas, (b) the polarized superfluid and the partially polarized
normal gas and (c) the unpolarized superfluid and the partially polarized
normal gas.
