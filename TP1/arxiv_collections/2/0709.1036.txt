Electron scattering form factors from $^{12}$C have been studied in the
framework of the particle-hole shell model. Higher configurations are taken
into account by allowing particle-hole excitations from the 1$s$ and 1$p$
shells core orbits up to the 1$f-2p$ shell. The inclusion of the higher
configurations modifies the form factors markedly and describes the
experimental data very well in all momentum transfer regions.
