Experimental investigations of diluted magnetic semiconductors indicate a
strong relation between Curie temperature and conductivity. Both quantities
depend non trivially on the concentration of magnetic impurities, the carrier
density, and the presence of compensating defects. We calculate both Curie
temperature and conductivity of (Ga,Mn)As alloys in a selfconsistent manner
based on the same first principles Hamiltonian in which the presence of
compensating defects is taken into account. The effect of As-antisites and
Mn-interstitials is determined separately and a good agreement between theory
and experiment exists only in the case where the dominating mechanism of is due
to the Mn-interstitials.
