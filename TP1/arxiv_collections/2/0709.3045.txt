The phenomenon of human language is widely studied from various points of
view. It is interesting not only for social scientists, antropologists or
philosophers, but also for those, interesting in the network dynamics. In
several recent papers word web, or language as a graph has been investigated.
  In this paper I revise recent studies of syntactical word web. I present a
model of growing network in which such processes as node addition, edge
rewiring and new link creation are taken into account. I argue, that this model
is a satisfactory minimal model explaining measured data.
