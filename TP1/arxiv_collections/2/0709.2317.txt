To estimate the emission parameters in hidden Markov models one commonly uses
the EM algorithm or its variation. Our primary motivation, however, is the
Philips speech recognition system wherein the EM algorithm is replaced by the
Viterbi training algorithm. Viterbi training is faster and computationally less
involved than EM, but it is also biased and need not even be consistent. We
propose an alternative to the Viterbi training -- adjusted Viterbi training --
that has the same order of computational complexity as Viterbi training but
gives more accurate estimators. Elsewhere, we studied the adjusted Viterbi
training for a special case of mixtures, supporting the theory by simulations.
This paper proves the adjusted Viterbi training to be also possible for more
general hidden Markov models.
