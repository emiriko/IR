We have analyzed the behavior of different characteristics of hadron-nuclear
and nuclear-nuclear interactions as a function of centrality to get a signal on
the formation of intermediate baryon systems. We observed that the data
demonstrate the regime change and saturation. The angular distributions of slow
particles exhibit some structure in the above mentioned reactions at low
energy. We believe that the structure could be connected with the formation and
decay of the percolation cluster. With increasing the mass of colliding nuclei,
the structure starts to become weak and almost disappears ultimately. This
shows that the number of secondary internuclear interactions increases with
increasing the mass of the colliding nuclei. The latter could be a reason of
the disintegration of any intermediate formations as well as clusters, which
decrease their influence on the angular distribution of the emitted particles.
