The variation in the quasiparticle weight $Z$ on moving around the fermi
surface in correlated metals is studied theoretically. Our primary example is a
heavy Fermi liquid treated within the standard hybridization mean field theory.
The most dramatic variation in the quasiparticle weight happens in situations
where the hybridization vanishes along certain directions in momentum space.
Such a "hybridization node" is demonstrated for a simplified model of a
Cerium-based cubic heavy electron metal. We show that the quasiparticle weight
varies from almost unity in some directions, to values approaching zero in
others. This is accompanied by a similar variation in the quasiparticle
effective mass. Some consequences of such hybridization nodes and the
associated angle dependence are explored. Comparisons to somewhat similar
phenomena in the normal metallic state of the cuprate materials are discussed.
A phenomenological picture of the pseudogap state in the cuprates with a large
Fermi surface with a severely anisotropic spectral weight is explored.
