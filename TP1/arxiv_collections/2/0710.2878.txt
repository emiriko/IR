We studied the interaction between a single hydrogen atom and a single
graphene using classical molecular dynamics simulation with modified Brenner
REBO potential. Three interactions, which are adsorption, reflection,
penetration, were observed. Overhang structure appears and creates an
adsorption site on the backside of the graphene. It is considered that backside
adsorption occurs under the two conditions that an incident hydrogen atom
should have incident energy which is larger than the potential barrier of a
hexagonal hole of the graphene and that after the hydrogen atom passes through
the graphene, it does not keep its kinetic energy to be trapped by the
adsorption site. The conditions explained that as the incident energy
increased, the incident point of the backside adsorption shifted to the
periphery of a hexagonal hole of the graphene in the simulation. Moreover, when
a hexagonal hole of the graphene was expanded by the hydrogen atom incidence to
the periphery of the hexagonal hole, its potential barrier was reduced.
