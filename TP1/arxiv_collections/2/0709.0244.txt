We investigate neutrino-nucleus collisions at intermediate energies
incorporating quasi-elastic scattering and the excitation of 13 resonances as
elementary processes, taking into account medium effects such as Fermi motion,
Pauli blocking, mean-field potentials and in-medium spectral functions. A
coupled-channel treatment of final state interactions is achieved with the
GiBUU transport model. Results for inclusive reactions, neutrino- and
electron-induced, as well as for pion production and nucleon knockout are
presented.
