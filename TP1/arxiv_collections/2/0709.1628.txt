During the past few years, nonextensive statistics has been successfully
applied to explain many different kinds of systems. Through these studies some
interpretations of the entropic parameter q, which has major role in this
statistics, in terms of physical quantities have been obtained. The aim of the
present work is to yield an overview of the applications of nonextensive
statistics to complex problems such as inhomogeneous magnetic systems.
