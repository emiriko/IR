The precessional magnetization dynamics of a chromium dioxide$(100)$ film is
examined in an all-optical pump-probe setup. The frequency dependence on the
external field is used to extract the uniaxial in-plane anisotropy constant.
The damping shows a strong dependence on the frequency, but also on the laser
pump fluency, which is revealed as an important experiment parameter in this
work: above a certain threshold further channels of energy dissipation open and
the damping increases discontinuously. This behavior might stem from spin-wave
instabilities.
