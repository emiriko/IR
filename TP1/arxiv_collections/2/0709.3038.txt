Nuclear parton distribution functions (NPDFs) are determined by global
analyses of experimental data on structure-function ratios F_2^A/F_2^{A'} and
Drell-Yan cross-section ratios \sigma_{DY}^A/\sigma_{DY}^{A'}. The analyses are
done in the leading order (LO) and next-to-leading order (NLO) of running
coupling constant \alpha_s. Uncertainties of the NPDFs are estimated in both LO
and NLO for finding possible NLO improvement. Valence-quark distributions are
well determined, and antiquark distributions are also determined at x<0.1.
However, the antiquark distributions have large uncertainties at x>0.2. Gluon
modifications cannot be fixed at this stage. Although the advantage of the NLO
analysis, in comparison with the LO one, is generally the sensitivity to the
gluon distributions, gluon uncertainties are almost the same in the LO and NLO.
It is because current scaling-violation data are not accurate enough to
determine precise nuclear gluon distributions. Modifications of the PDFs in the
deuteron are also discussed by including data on the proton-deuteron ratio
F_2^D/F_2^p in the analysis. A code is provided for calculating the NPDFs and
their uncertainties at given x and Q^2 in the LO and NLO.
