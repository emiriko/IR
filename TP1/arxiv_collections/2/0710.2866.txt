In semiconductors with inversion asymmetry, spin-orbit coupling gives rise to
the well-known Dresselhaus and Rashba effects. If one considers quantum wells
with two or more conduction subbands, an additional, intersubband-induced
spin-orbit term appears whose strength is comparable to the Rashba coupling,
and which remains finite for symmetric structures. We show that the conduction
band spin splitting due to this intersubband spin-orbit coupling term is
negligible for typical III-V quantum wells.
