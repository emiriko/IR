In a recent paper [C. Marr, M. Mueller-Linow, and M.-T. Huett, Phys. Rev. E
75, 041917 (2007)] we discuss the pronounced potential of real metabolic
network topologies, compared to randomized counterparts, to regularize complex
binary dynamics. In their comment [P. Holme and M. Huss, arXiv:0705.4084v1],
Holme and Huss criticize our approach and repeat our study with more realistic
dynamics, where stylized reaction kinetics are implemented on sets of pairwise
reactions. The authors find no dynamic difference between the reaction sets
recreated from the metabolic networks and randomized counterparts. We reproduce
the author's observation and find that their algorithm leads to a dynamical
fragmentation and thus eliminates the topological information contained in the
graphs. Hence, their approach cannot rule out a connection between the topology
of metabolic networks and the ubiquity of steady states.
