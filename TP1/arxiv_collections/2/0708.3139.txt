We have used the light-cone formulation of Chiral-Quark Soliton Model to
investigate the vector and axial content of octet, decuplet and the
hypothetical antidecuplet in the flavor SU(3) symmetry limit. We have extended
previous works by computing the 7Q contribution to vector and axial charges for
the octet and antidecuplet but stayed at the 5Q sector for the decuplet where
the full computation needs much more time. As expected the 7Q component has a
weaker impact on the quantities but still changes them by a few percent. We
give also a detailed decomposition of those charges into flavor, valence quark,
sea quark and antiquark contributions. Many of them are of course not (yet)
measured or estimated and constitute then a theoretical estimation. Among the
different interesting observations made in this work are the explicit
quadrupole deformation of decuplet baryons due to the pion field and the sum of
quark spins larger than the pentaquark one.
