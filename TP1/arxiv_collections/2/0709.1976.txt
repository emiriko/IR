The fluctuations in nonequilibrium systems are under intense theoretical and
experimental investigation. Topical ``fluctuation relations'' describe
symmetries of the statistical properties of certain observables, in a variety
of models and phenomena. They have been derived in deterministic and, later, in
stochastic frameworks. Other results first obtained for stochastic processes,
and later considered in deterministic dynamics, describe the temporal evolution
of fluctuations. The field has grown beyond expectation: research works and
different perspectives are proposed at an ever faster pace. Indeed,
understanding fluctuations is important for the emerging theory of
nonequilibrium phenomena, as well as for applications, such as those of
nanotechnological and biophysical interest. However, the links among the
different approaches and the limitations of these approaches are not fully
understood. We focus on these issues, providing: a) analysis of the theoretical
models; b) discussion of the rigorous mathematical results; c) identification
of the physical mechanisms underlying the validity of the theoretical
predictions, for a wide range of phenomena.
