We calculate the Chern classes and Chern numbers for the natural almost
Hermitian structures of the partial flag manifolds F_n=SU(n+2)/S(U(n)\times
U(1)\times U(1)). For all n>1 there are two invariant complex algebraic
structures, which arise from the projectivizations of the holomorphic tangent
and cotangent bundles of complex projective spaces. The projectivization of the
cotangent bundle is the twistor space of a Grassmannian considered as a
quaternionic K\"ahler manifold. There is also an invariant nearly K\"ahler
structure, because F_n is a 3-symmetric space. We explain the relations between
the different structures and their Chern classes, and we prove that F_n is not
geometrically formal.
