In this article, we analyze some nuclear structure aspects of the
neutrinoless double beta decay nuclear matrix elements (NME), in the framework
of the Interacting Shell Model. We give results for the decays of 48Ca, 76Ge,
82Se, 124Sn, 128Te, 130Te, and 136Xe, using improved effective interactions and
valence spaces. We examine the dependence of the NME's on the effective
interaction and the valence space, and analyze the effects of the short range
correlations and the finite size of the nucleon. Finally we study the influence
of the deformation on the values of the NME's.
