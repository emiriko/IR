QCD with fermions in the adjoint representation (aQCD) is a model for which a
deconfinement and a chiral phase transition take place at different
temperatures. In this work, we present a study of the deconfinement transition
in the dual superconductor picture based on the evaluation of an operator which
carries magnetic charge. The expectation value of this operator signals
monopole condensation and is an order parameter for deconfinement as in the
case of fermions in the fundamental representation. We find a sharp first order
deconfinement transition. We also study the effects of the chiral transition on
the monopole order parameter and find them negligible.
