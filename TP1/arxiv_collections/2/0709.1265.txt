A nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) study is reported of multiple (30)
Al$_{0.13}$Ga$_{0.87}$As quantum well (QW) sample near the Landau level filling
factor $\nu =1$. In these Al$_{0.13}$Ga$_{0.87}$As QWs the effective $g$ factor
is nearly zero. This can lead to two effects: vanishing electronic polarization
$(P)$ and skyrmionic excitations composed of a huge number of spins. As small
$P$ values cause an overlap of the NMR signals from the QW and barriers, a
special technique was employed to allow these two signals to be distinguished.
The QW signal corresponds to a small, negative, and very broad distribution of
spin polarization that exhibits thermally induced depolarization. Such a
distribution can be attributed to sample inhomogeneities and/or to large
skyrmions, the latter possibility being favored by observation of a very fast
$T_{2}^{-1}$ rate.
