Long-range magnetic interactions in highly magnetised liquids
(laser-polarised 3He-4He dilute mixtures at 1 K in our experiment) introduce a
significant non-linear and non-local contribution to the evolution of nuclear
magnetisation that leads to instabilities during free precession. We recently
demonstrated that a multi-echo NMR sequence, based on the magic sandwich pulse
scheme developed for solid-state NMR, can be used to stabilise the
magnetisation against the effect of distant dipolar fields. Here, we report
investigations of echo attenuation in an applied field gradient that show the
potential of this NMR sequence for spin diffusion measurements at high
magnetisation densities.
