The high mass spectrum of lepton and photon pairs is sensitive to a broad
array of new physics. Examples include searches for extra dimensions in the
dielectron and diphoton channels. A direct search for electron compositeness is
possible in the production of excited electrons decaying into an electron and a
photon. In addition, the electron plus missing transverse energy data sample
can be searched for a W' boson. Latest results in searches in the high mass
dielectron, diphoton, electron plus photon, and electron plus missing
transverse energy channels obtained by the D0 experiment at the Tevatron are
reported, using a data set corresponding to an integrated luminosity of about 1
inverse femtobarn. Since no significant excess is observed in the data in all
cases, limits are set which improve on previous searches.
