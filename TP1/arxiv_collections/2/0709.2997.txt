In the context of algebraic statistics an experimental design is described by
a set of polynomials called the design ideal. This, in turn, is generated by
finite sets of polynomials. Two types of generating sets are mostly used in the
literature: Groebner bases and indicator functions. We briefly describe them
both, how they are used in the analysis and planning of a design and how to
switch between them. Examples include fractions of full factorial designs and
designs for mixture experiments.
