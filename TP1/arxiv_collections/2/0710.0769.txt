The scattering of a weakly bound three-body system by a target is discussed.
A transformed harmonic oscillator basis is used to provide an appropriate
discrete and finite basis for treating the continuum part of the spectrum of
the projectile. The continuum-discretized coupled channels framework is used
for the scattering calculations. The formalism is applied to different
reactions, 6He+12C at 229.8 MeV, 6He+64Zn at 10 and 13.6 MeV, and 6He+208Pb at
22 MeV, induced by the Borromean nucleus 6He. Both the Coulomb and nuclear
interactions with a target are taken into account.
