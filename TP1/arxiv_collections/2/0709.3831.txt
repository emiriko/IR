We construct a perturbative solution to classical noncommutative gauge theory
on ${\mathbb{R}}^{3}$ minus the origin using the Groenewald-Moyal star product.
The result describes a noncommutative point charge. Applying it to the quantum
mechanics of the noncommutative hydrogen atom gives shifts in the $1S$
hyperfine splitting which are first order in the noncommutativity parameter.
