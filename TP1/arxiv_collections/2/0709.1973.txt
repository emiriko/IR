Accurate analytical expressions for the state densities of liquid He-4
droplets are derived, incorporating the ripplon and phonon degrees of freedom.
The microcanonical temperature and the ripplon angular momentum level density
are also evaluated. The approach is based on inversions and systematic
expansions of canonical thermodynamic properties.
