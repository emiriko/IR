We explain in a consistent manner the set of seemingly conflicting
experiments on the finite temperature Mott critical point, and demonstrate that
the Mott transition is in the Ising universality class. We show that, even
though the thermodynamic behavior of the system near such critical point is
described by an Ising order parameter, the global conductivity can depend on
other singular observables and, in particular, on the energy density. Finally,
we show that in the presence of weak disorder the dimensionality of the system
has crucial effects on the size of the critical region that is probed
experimentally.
