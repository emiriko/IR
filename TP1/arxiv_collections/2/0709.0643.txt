We study the conductance through a ring described by the Hubbard model (such
as an array of quantum dots), threaded by a magnetic flux and subject to Rashba
spin-orbit coupling (SOC). We develop a formalism that is able to describe the
interference effects as well as the Kondo effect when the number of electrons
in the ring is odd. In the Kondo regime, the SOC reduces the conductance from
the unitary limit, and in combination with the magnetic flux, the device acts
as a spin polarizer.
