Dynamic equations of non-relativistic mechanics are written in
covariant-coordinate form in terms of relative velocities and accelerations
with respect to an arbitrary reference frame. The notions of the
non-relativistic reference frame, inertial force, free motion equation, and
inertial frame are discussed.
