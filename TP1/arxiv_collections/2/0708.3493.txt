The searches of impulsive gravitational waves (GW) in the data of the
ground-based interferometers focus essentially on two types of waveforms: short
unmodeled bursts and chirps from inspiralling compact binaries. There is room
for other types of searches based on different models. Our objective is to fill
this gap. More specifically, we are interested in GW chirps with an arbitrary
phase/frequency vs. time evolution. These unmodeled GW chirps may be considered
as the generic signature of orbiting/spinning sources. We expect quasi-periodic
nature of the waveform to be preserved independent of the physics which governs
the source motion. Several methods have been introduced to address the
detection of unmodeled chirps using the data of a single detector. Those
include the best chirplet chain (BCC) algorithm introduced by the authors. In
the next years, several detectors will be in operation. The joint coherent
analysis of GW by multiple detectors can improve the sight horizon, the
estimation of the source location and the wave polarization angles. Here, we
extend the BCC search to the multiple detector case. The method amounts to
searching for salient paths in the combined time-frequency representation of
two synthetic streams. The latter are time-series which combine the data from
each detector linearly in such a way that all the GW signatures received are
added constructively. We give a proof of principle for the full sky blind
search in a simplified situation which shows that the joint estimation of the
source sky location and chirp frequency is possible.
