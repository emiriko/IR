We studied the growth of an epitaxial graphene monolayer on Ru(0001). The
graphene monolayer covers uniformly the Ru substrate over lateral distances
larger than several microns reproducing the structural defects of the Ru
substrate. The graphene is rippled with a periodicity dictated by the
difference in lattice parameter between C and Ru. The theoretical model predict
inhomogeneities in the electronic structure. This is confirmed by measurements
in real space by means of scanning tunnelling spectroscopy. We observe electron
pockets at the higher parts of the ripples.
