The regions in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model with the minimal
amount of fine-tuning of electroweak symmetry breaking are presented for
general messenger scale. No a priori relations among the soft supersymmetry
breaking parameters are assumed and fine-tuning is minimized with respect to
all the important parameters which affect electroweak symmetry breaking. The
superpartner spectra in the minimally tuned region of parameter space are quite
distinctive with large stop mixing at the low scale and negative squark soft
masses at the high scale. The minimal amount of tuning increases enormously for
a Higgs mass beyond roughly 120 GeV.
