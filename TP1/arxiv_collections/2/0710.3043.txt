The method of the quantum probability theory only requires simple structural
data of graph and allows us to avoid a heavy combinational argument often
necessary to obtain full description of spectrum of the adjacency matrix. In
the present paper, by using the idea of calculation of the probability
amplitudes for continuous-time quantum walk in terms of the quantum probability
theory, we investigate quantum central limit theorem for continuous-time
quantum walks on odd graphs.
