Energy and angular dependence of double differential cross sections
d$^2\sigma$/d$\Omega$dE was measured for reactions induced by 2.5 GeV protons
on Au target with isotopic identification of light products (H, He, Li, Be, and
B) and with elemental identification of heavier intermediate mass fragments (C,
N, O, F, Ne, Na, Mg, and Al). It was found that two different reaction
mechanisms give comparable contributions to the cross sections. The
intranuclear cascade of nucleon-nucleon collisions followed by evaporation from
an equilibrated residuum describes low energy part of the energy distributions
whereas another reaction mechanism is responsible for high energy part of the
spectra of composite particles. Phenomenological model description of the
differential cross sections by isotropic emission from two moving sources led
to a very good description of all measured data. Values of the extracted
parameters of the emitting sources are compatible with the hypothesis claiming
that the high energy particles emerge from pre-equilibrium processes consisting
in a breakup of the target into three groups of nucleons; small, fast and hot
fireball of $\sim$ 8 nucleons, and two larger, excited prefragments, which
emits the light charged particles and intermediate mass fragments. The smaller
of them contains $\sim$ 20 nucleons and moves with velocity larger than the CM
velocity of the proton projectile and the target. The heavier prefragment
behaves similarly as the heavy residuum of the intranuclear cascade of
nucleon-nucleon collisions. %The mass and charge dependence of the total
production cross %sections was extracted from the above analysis for all
observed %reaction products. This dependence follows the power low behavior
%(A$^{-\tau}$ or Z$^{-\tau}$).
