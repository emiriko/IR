In this paper we present the results from the measurements made with the MUNU
TPC at 1bar pressure of CF4 in the energy region below 1 MeV. Electron events
down to 80 keV are successfully measured. The electron energy and direction are
reconstructed for every contained single electron above 200 keV. As test the
137Cs photopeak is reconstructed by measuring both the energy and direction of
the Compton electrons in the TPC.
