The path-dependent magnetizations (polarizations) and susceptibilities in
dipole- and spin-glasses are described analytically for the standard protocols
of temperature and field variations using the phenomenological Landau-type
description of multiple metastable states in the nonergodic phases. The
immediate manifestation of metastable states' multiplicity as staircases of
magnetizations (polarizations) curves in the temperature cycling experiments is
explained and described. The obtained results are in a reasonable qualitative
agreement with the existing experimental data.
