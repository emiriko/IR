This study investigates the influence of the fourth generation quarks on the
double lepton polarizations in B \rar K \ell^+ \ell^- decay. Taking
|V_{t's}V_{t'b}|\sim \{0.01-0.03\} with phase about 100^\circ, which is
consistent with the b\to s\ell^+\ell^- rate and the B_s mixing parameter Delta
m_{B_s}$, we obtain that the double lepton(muon and tau) polarizations are
quite sensitive to the existence of fourth generation. It can serve as a good
tool to search for new physics effects, precisely, to indirect search for the
fourth generation quarks(t', b').
