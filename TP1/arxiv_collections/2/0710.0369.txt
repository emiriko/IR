We construct a mean-field formulation of the thermodynamics of ion solvation
in immiscible polar binary mixtures. Assuming an equilibrium planar interface
separating two semi-infinite regions of different constant dielectric medium,
we study the electrostatic phenomenon of differential adsorption of ions at the
interface. Using general thermodynamic considerations, we construct the
mean-field $\Omega$-potential and demonstrate the spontaneous formation of an
electric double-layer around the interface necessarily follow. In our
framework, we can also relate both the bulk ion densities in the two phases and
the distribution potential across the interface to the fundamental Born free
energy of ion polarization. We further illustrate this selective ion adsorption
phenomenon in respective examples of fully permeable membranes that are
neutral, negative, or positive in charge polarity.
