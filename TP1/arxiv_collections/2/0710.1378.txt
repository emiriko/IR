The 2-body system of a superconducting sphere levitated in the magnetic field
generated by a persistent current in a superconducting ring, can possibly
convert gravitational waves into electromagnetic waves, and vice versa.
Faraday's law of induction implies that the time-varying distance between the
sphere and the ring caused by the tidal force of an incident gravitational wave
induces time-varying electrical currents, which are the source of an
electromagnetic wave at the same frequency as the incident gravitational wave.
At sufficiently low temperatures, the internal degrees of freedom of the
superconductors are frozen out because of the superconducting energy gap, and
only external degrees of freedom, which are coupled to the radiation fields,
remain. Hence this wave-conversion process is loss-free and therefore
efficient, and by time-reversal symmetry, so is the reverse process. A
Hertz-like experiment at microwave frequencies should therefore be practical to
perform. This would open up observations of the gravitational-wave analog of
the Cosmic Microwave Background from the extremely early Big Bang, and also
communications directly through the interior of the Earth.
