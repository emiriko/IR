In linearized quantum gravity, a shift of the average energy-momentum can be
compensated by a shift of the average gravitational field. This allows a
renormalization scheme that naturally removes the contribution of quantum
vacuum fluctuations to the cosmological constant, solving the old
cosmological-constant problem for weak gravitational fields.
