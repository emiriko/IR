This work points out an application of the regular theory of charge-monopole
electrodynamics to the new experiments of very high energy. Using this theory,
it is explained why the new regions of high energy interactions that will be
explored by CERN's Large Hadron Collider may show a significant increase of the
cross section. This conclusion illustrates the significance of the extension of
electrodynamics that takes the form of the regular charge-monopole theory.
