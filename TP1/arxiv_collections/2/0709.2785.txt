We perform a three-dimensional study of steady state viscous fingers that
develop in linear channels. By means of a three-dimensional Lattice-Boltzmann
scheme that mimics the full macroscopic equations of motion of the fluid
momentum and order parameter, we study the effect of the thickness of the
channel in two cases. First, for total displacement of the fluids in the
channel thickness direction, we find that the steady state finger is
effectively two-dimensional and that previous two-dimensional results can be
recovered by taking into account the effect of a curved meniscus across the
channel thickness as a contribution to surface stresses. Secondly, when a thin
film develops in the channel thickness direction, the finger narrows with
increasing channel aspect ratio in agreement with experimental results. The
effect of the thin film renders the problem three-dimensional and results
deviate from the two-dimensional prediction.
