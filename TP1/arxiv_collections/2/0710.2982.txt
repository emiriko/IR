LEP and SLC provide accurate data on the process (e^+e^- -> f bar f) at the Z
resonance. The GigaZ option at a future linear e^+e^- collider (ILC) will
further improve these measurements. As a consequence, theory predictions with
sufficiently smaller errors are necessary in order to fully exploit the
experimental accuracies and to derive indirect bounds on the scales of new
physics. Here we review the currently most accurate predictions of the Z pole
observables (e.g. sin^2 theta_eff, Gamma_Z, sigma^0_had) in the context of the
Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). These predictions contain the
complete one-loop results including the full complex phase dependence, all
available MSSM two-loop corrections, as well as all relevant Standard Model
contributions.
