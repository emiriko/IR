We studied the electric and magnetic resonance of U-shaped SRRs. We showed
that higher order excitation modes exist in both of the electric and magnetic
resonances. The nodes in the current distribution were found for all the
resonance modes. It turns out that the magnetic resonances are the modes with
odd-number of half-wavelength of the current wave, i.e. 1/2, 3/2 and 5/2
wavelengths modes, and the electric resonances are modes with integer number of
whole-wavelength of current wave, i.e. 1, 2 and 3 wavelengths modes. We
discussed the electric moment and magnetic moment of the electric and magnetic
resonances, and their dependence to the length of two parallel side arms. We
show that the magnetic moment of magnetic resonance vanishes as the length side
arms of the SRR reduces to zero, i.e. a rod does not give any magnetic moment
or magnetic resonance.
