We are communicating with computers on two different levels. On upper level
we have a very flexible system of windows: we can move them, resize, overlap or
put side by side. At any moment we decide what would be the best view and
reorganize the whole view easily. Then we start any application, go to the
inner level, and everything changes. Here we are stripped of all the
flexibility and can work only inside the scenario, developed by the designer of
the program. Interface will allow us to change some tiny details, but in
general everything is fixed: graphics is neither moveable, nor resizable, and
the same with controls. Author designed an extremely powerful mechanism of
turning graphical objects and controls into moveable and resizable. This can
not only significantly improve the existing applications, but this will bring
the applications to another level. (To estimate the possible difference, try to
imagine the Windows system without its flexibility and compare it with the
current one.) This article explains in details the construction and use of
moveable and resizable graphical objects.
