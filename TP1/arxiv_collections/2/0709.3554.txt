The problem of wireless localization asks to place and orient stations in the
plane, each of which broadcasts a unique key within a fixed angular range, so
that each point in the plane can determine whether it is inside or outside a
given polygonal region. The primary goal is to minimize the number of stations.
In this paper we establish a lower bound of 2n/3 - 1 stations for polygons in
general position, for the case in which the placement of stations is restricted
to polygon vertices, improving upon the existing n/2 lower bound.
