Vortices in the simplest superconducting state of graphene contain very low
energy excitations, whose existence is connected to an index theorem that
applies strictly to an approximate form of the relevant Bogoliubov-deGennes
equations. When Zeeman interactions are taken into account, the zero modes
required by the index theorem are (slightly) displaced. Thus the vortices
acquire internal structure, that plausibly supports interesting dynamical
phenomena.
