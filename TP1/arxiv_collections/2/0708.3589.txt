A method to calculate NMR J-coupling constants from first principles in
extended systems is presented. It is based on density functional theory and is
formulated within a planewave-pseudopotential framework. The all-electron
properties are recovered using the projector augmented wave approach. The
method is validated by comparison with existing quantum chemical calculations
of solution-state systems and with experimental data. The approach has been
applied to verify measured J-coupling in a silicophosphate structure,
Si5O(PO4)6
