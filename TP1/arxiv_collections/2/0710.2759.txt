The diamagnetic-paramagnetic and insulator-metal transitions in LnCoO3
perovskites (Ln = La, Y, rare earths) are reinterpreted and modeled as a
two-level excitation process. In distinction to previous models, the present
approach can be characterized as a LS-HS-IS (low-high-intermediate spin)
scenario. The first level is the local excitation of HS Co3+ species in the LS
ground state. The second excitation is based on the interatomic electron
transfer between the LS/HS pairs, leading finally to a stabilization of the
metallic phase based on IS Co3+. The model parameters have been quantified for
Ln = La, Pr and Nd samples using the powder neutron diffraction on the thermal
expansion of Co-O bonds, that is associated with the two successive spin
transitions. The same model is applied to interpret the magnetic susceptibility
of LaCoO3 and YCoO3.
