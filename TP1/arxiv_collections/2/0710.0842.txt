We propose a software architecture for interactive systems which allows
integrating the user's emotion. Emotion can be involved in interaction at
several levels. In our application case - ballet dance - emotions is
explicitely manipulated by the interactive system to produce emotion-wise
output. Our architecture model to develop emotion-wise applications is based on
the PAC-Amodeus model. We add a branch to this model, divided into three
components: Data capture, analysis and cue extraction, and finally
interpretation of those cues. We show the different data flows between this
architecture's components depending on the entry point of the emotion branch
within the system. We then illustrate our model by describing our application
case: capturing a ballet dancer's movement to extract the emotions he expresses
and use these emotions to generate graphical content that is displayed on
stage.
