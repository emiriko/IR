The coupling of multiple degrees of freedom - charge, spin, and lattice - in
manganites has mostly been considered at the microscopic level. However, on
larger length scales, these correlations may be affected by strain and
disorder, which can lead to short range order in these phases and affect the
coupling between them. To better understand these effects, we explore the
dynamics of orbitally ordered domains in a half-doped manganite near the
orbital ordering phase transition. Our results suggest that the domains are
largely static, and exhibit only slow fluctuations near domain boundaries.
