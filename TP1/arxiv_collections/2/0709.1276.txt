When considering DLA on a cylinder it is natural to ask how many particles it
takes to clog the cylinder, e.g. modeling clogging of arteries. In this note we
formulate a very simple DLA clogging model and establish an exponential lower
bound on the number of particles arriving before clogging appears.
