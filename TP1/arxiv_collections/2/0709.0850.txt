We study the module category of a certain Galois covering of a cluster-tilted
algebra which we call the cluster repetitive algebra. Our main result compares
the module categories of the cluster repetitive algebra of a tilted algebra C
and the repetitive algebra of C, in the sense of Hughes and Waschbuesch.
