We present a class of numerical algorithms which adapt a quantum error
correction scheme to a channel model. Given an encoding and a channel model, it
was previously shown that the quantum operation that maximizes the average
entanglement fidelity may be calculated by a semidefinite program (SDP), which
is a convex optimization. While optimal, this recovery operation is
computationally difficult for long codes. Furthermore, the optimal recovery
operation has no structure beyond the completely positive trace preserving
(CPTP) constraint. We derive methods to generate structured channel-adapted
error recovery operations. Specifically, each recovery operation begins with a
projective error syndrome measurement. The algorithms to compute the structured
recovery operations are more scalable than the SDP and yield recovery
operations with an intuitive physical form. Using Lagrange duality, we derive
performance bounds to certify near-optimality.
