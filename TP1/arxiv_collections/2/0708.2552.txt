We have obtained the solutions of two dimensional singular oscillator which
is known as the quantum Calogero-Sutherland model both in cartesian and
parabolic coordinates within the framework of quantum Hamilton Jacobi
formalism. Solvability conditions and eigenfunctions are obtained by using the
singularity structures of quantum momentum functions under some conditions. New
potentials are generated by using the first two states of singular oscillator
for parabolic coordinates.
