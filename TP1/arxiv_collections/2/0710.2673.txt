We investigate higher derivative corrections in M-theory by applying
Noether's method. Cancellation of variations, which contain linear terms in
4-form field strength, under local supersymmetry is executed with the aid of
computer programming. Structure of $R^4$ terms is uniquely determined and
exactly matches with one-loop effective terms in type IIA superstring theory.
