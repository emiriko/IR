We investigate the enhancement of spin polarization in a quantum wire in the
presence of a constriction and a spin-orbit coupling segment. It is shown that
the spin-filtering effect is significantly heightened in comparison with the
configuration without the constriction. It is understood in the studies that
the constriction structure plays a critical role in enhancing the spin
filtering by means of confining the incident electrons to occupy one channel
only while the outgoing electrons occupy two channels. The enhancement of
spin-filtering has also been analyzed within the perturbation theory. Because
the spin polarization arises mainly from the scattering between the
constriction and the segment with spin-orbit coupling, the sub-band mixing
induced by spin-orbit interaction in the scattering process and the
interferences result in higher spin-filtering effect.
