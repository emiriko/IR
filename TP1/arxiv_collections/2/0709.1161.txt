Diamond-based photonic devices offer exceptional opportunity to study cavity
QED at room temperature. Here we report fabrication and optical
characterization of high quality photonic crystal (PC) microcavities based on
nanocrystalline diamond. Fundamental modes near the emission wavelength of
negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (N-V) centers (637 nm) with quality factors
(Qs) as high as 585 were observed. Three-dimensional Finite-Difference
Time-Domain (FDTD) simulations were carried out and had excellent agreement
with experimental results in the values of the mode frequencies. Polarization
measurements of the modes were characterized; their anomalous behavior provides
important insights to scattering loss in these structures.
