We study the combinatorics of two classes of basic hypergeometric series. We
first show that these series are the generating functions for certain
overpartition pairs defined by frequency conditions on the parts. We then show
that when specialized these series are also the generating functions for
overpartition pairs with bounded successive ranks, overpartition pairs with
conditions on their Durfee dissection, as well as certain lattice paths. When
further specialized, the series become infinite products, leading to numerous
identities for partitions, overpartitions, and overpartition pairs.
