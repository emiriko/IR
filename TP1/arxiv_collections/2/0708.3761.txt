A set of many identical interacting agents obeying a global additive
constraint is considered. Under the hypothesis of equiprobability in the
high-dimensional volume delimited in phase space by the constraint, the
statistical behavior of a generic agent over the ensemble is worked out. The
asymptotic distribution of that statistical behavior is derived from
geometrical arguments. This distribution is related with the Gamma
distributions found in several multi-agent economy models. The parallelism with
all these systems is established. Also, as a collateral result, a formula for
the volume of high-dimensional symmetrical bodies is proposed.
