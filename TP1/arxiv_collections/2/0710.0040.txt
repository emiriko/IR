Study of resonances with their short life-times provides useful tools to
probe the properties of hot and dense matter produced in relativistic heavy ion
collisions. The high density and/or high temperature of the medium can modify
resonance properties such as mass and width. Therefore, measurement of these
properties can reveal important information about the evolution dynamics in
heavy ion collisions. We report the measurements of $K^{*}$ transverse
momentum($p_T$) spectra at mid-rapidity via its hadronic decay channel up to
intermediate $p_{T}$ of 2.9 GeV/c using the STAR detector in Au+Au and Cu+Cu
collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}$= 62.4 GeV and 200 GeV. These results are
compared to previously reported $K^{*}$ results from Au+Au collisions at RHIC.
Integrated yield ratios of $K^{*}/K$ and $K^{*}/\phi$ are used to understand
the rescattering and regeneration effects on $K^{*}$ production.
