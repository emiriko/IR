We discuss the classical and quantum mechanical evolution of systems
described by a Hamiltonian that is a function of a solvable one, both
classically and quantum mechanically. The case in which the solvable
Hamiltonian corresponds to the harmonic oscillator is emphasized. We show that,
in spite of the similarities at the classical level, the quantum evolution is
very different. In particular, this difference is important in constructing
coherent states, which is impossible in most cases. The class of Hamiltonians
we consider is interesting due to its pedagogical value and its applicability
to some open research problems in quantum optics and quantum gravity.
