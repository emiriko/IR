In this paper, we calculate the decay rates of $D^+ \to D^0 e^+ \nu$, $D^+_S
\to D^0 e^+ \nu$, $B^0_S \to B^+ e^- \bar{\nu}$, $D^+_S \to D^+ e^- e^+$ and
$B^0_S \to B^0 e^-e^+$ semileptonic decay processes, in which only the light
quarks decay, while the heavy flavors remain unchanged. The branching ratios of
these decay processes are calculated with the flavor SU(3) symmetry. The
uncertainties are estimated by considering the SU(3) breaking effect. We find
that the decay rates are very tiny in the framework of the Standard Model. We
also estimate the sensitivities of the measurements of these rare decays at the
future experiments, such as BES-III, super-$B$ and LHC-$b$.
