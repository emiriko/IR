The process of cascaded downconversion and sum-frequency generation inside an
optical cavity has been predicted to be a potential source of three-mode
continuous-variable entanglement. When the cavity is pumped by two fields, the
threshold properties have been analysed, showing that these are more
complicated than in well-known processes such as optical parametric
oscillation. When there is only a single pumping field, the entanglement
properties have been calculated using a linearised fluctuation analysis, but
without any consideration of the threshold properties or critical operating
points of the system. In this work we extend this analysis to demonstrate that
the singly pumped system demonstrates a rich range of threshold behaviour when
quantisation of the pump field is taken into account and that asymmetric
polychromatic entanglement is available over a wide range of operational
parameters.
