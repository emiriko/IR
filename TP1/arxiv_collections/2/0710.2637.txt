It is experimentally shown that, depending on the carrier-concentration of
the system $n$, the dynamics of electron-glasses either \textit{slows down
}with increasing temperature or it is \textit{independent} of it. This also
correlates with the dependence of a typical relaxation time (or `viscosity') on
$n$. These linked features are argued to be consistent with a model for
dissipative tunneling. The slow relaxation of the electron glass may emerge
then as a manifestation of friction in a many-body quantum system. Our
considerations may also explain why strongly-localized granular metals are
likely to show electron-glass effects while semiconductors are not.
