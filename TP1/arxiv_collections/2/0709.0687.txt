Within the past fifteen years the use of the concept of "relativistic mass"
has been on the decline and has been replaced by the concept of "proper mass"
(aka "rest mass") - ?simply referred to as "mass" and labeled "m" by its
proponents. This decline in usage appears to be due to arguments presented in
several journal articles over the last thirty-five years, as well as to
standard practices in the field of particle physics. The aforementioned debate
consists of arguments as to how the term "mass" should be defined to maximize
logic as well as to be less confusing to the layman and people just starting to
learn relativity. Lacking in the debate is a clear definition of all types of
mass and all its usages in a wide variety of cases. The purpose in this article
is to bring a unifying perspective to the subject. In doing so I will explore
those things omitted from previous articles on this subject including the
importance of point particles vs. extended objects; open vs. closed systems and
gravitational mass. Although I argue for the usage of relativistic mass I do
"not" argue that proper mass is not an important tool in relativistic dynamics.
