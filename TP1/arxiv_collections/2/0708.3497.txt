If the Higgs does not propagate into an otherwise universal extra dimension,
then tree-level Kaluza-Klein number is not conserved in the Yukawa
interactions. This leads to mixing between zero-mode fermions and their
associated Kaluza-Klein excitations. The effect can be quite large for the top
quark, since its mass (171.4 plus or minus 2.1 GeV) is approximately one-half
the current Tevatron mass bound (about 350-400 GeV) for Kaluza-Klein
excitations of quarks with one universal extra dimension. In contrast to the
SM, the bi-unitary transformation that diagonalizes the mass matrix does not
diagonalize the effective 4D Yukawa coupling matrix because of the presence of
the 5D kinetic terms. This leads to violation of tree-level Kaluza-Klein number
conservation in the gauge sector due to a unique feature of the 5D theory. This
allows Kaluza-Klein excitations of the fermions to be produced singly, and
opens up new decay channels in the gauge sector. We compute the cross section
for the production of the lowest-lying Kaluza-Klein excitations of the top and
bottom quarks in the non-universal Higgs model at the Large Hadron Collider,
and consider their subsequent decays. The effect is quite large: For example,
pair production of Kaluza-Klein excitations of the bottom quark will lead to a
pair of top quarks plus a pair of charged weak gauge bosons. Since the
production is via the strong interaction, such final states stand out well
against the Standard Model background, and are observable at the LHC for a wide
range of compactification scales. Finally, we discuss the effects that such a
model has on the T- parameter, and propose a model with maximal mixing where
the compactification scale may be as large as a universal extra dimension.
