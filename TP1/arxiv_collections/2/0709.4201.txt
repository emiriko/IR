We examine the production and decay of extremely heavy magnetically charged
leptons, (tau_g and mu_g), to their own very heavy mu_g and e_g plus their own
new species of neutrinos, nu_g and nubar_g, at some time early in the universe
which could be present in space and, attracted gravitationally towards and
passing through astronomical objects, annihilated with each other to produce
large numbers of photons. Further, we describe the possibility of presently
detecting the bursts of such photons, of three different total energies, in the
seas or oceans on earth.
