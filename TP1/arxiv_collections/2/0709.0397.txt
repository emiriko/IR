The masses of negative parity $(70,1^-)$ charmed nonstrange baryons are
calculated in the relativistic quark model. The relativistic three-quark
equations of the $(70,1^-)$ charmed baryon multiplet are found in the framework
of the dispersion relation technique. The approximate solutions of these
equations using the method based on the extraction of leading singularities of
the amplitude are obtained. The calculated mass values of the $(70,1^-)$
charmed baryons are in good agreement with the experimental data.
