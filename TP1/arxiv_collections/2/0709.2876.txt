We compute the static potential associated to the locally 1/2 BPS Wilson loop
in ${\cal N}$=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with ${\cal O}(\lambda^2/r)$
accuracy. We also resum the leading logarithms, of ${\cal
O}(\lambda^{n+1}\ln^n\lambda/r)$, and show the structure of the renormalization
group equation at next-to-leading order in the multipole expansion. In order to
obtain these results it is crucial the use of an effective theory for the
ultrasoft degrees of freedom. We develop this theory up to next-to-leading
order in the multipole expansion. Using the same formalism we also compute the
leading logarithms, of ${\cal O}(\lambda^{n+3}\ln^n\lambda/r)$, of the static
potential associated to an ordinary Wilson loop in the same theory.
