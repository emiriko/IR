The CMS and ATLAS collaborations have performed detailed studies of the
discovery potential for the Higgs boson in MSSM. Different benchmarks scenarios
have been studied both for the CP-conserving case and for the CP-violating one.
Results are presented of the discovery potential in the parameter space of
MSSM.
