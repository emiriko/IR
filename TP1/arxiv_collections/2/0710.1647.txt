We report recent results obtained with the Belle detector using a 23.6
fb^{-1} data sample collected on the Y(5S) resonance at the KEKB asymmetric
energy e^+ e^- collider. Inclusive semileptonic B_s^0 -> X^+ l^- \nu decays are
studied for the first time and the branching fraction is measured. Combining
the electron and muon channels, we obtain Bf(B_s^0 -> X^+ l^- \nu) = (10.2 \pm
0.8 \pm 0.9)%. Also, the radiative penguin decay B_s^0 -> \phi \gamma is
observed for the first time, and an improved upper limit for the decay B_s^0
\to \gamma \gamma is obtained.
