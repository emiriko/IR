The zeroth theorem of the history of science (enunciated by E. P. Fischer)
and widely known in the mathematics community as Arnol'd's Principle (decreed
by M. V. Berry), states that a discovery (rule, regularity, insight) named
after someone (often) did not originate with that person. I present five
examples from physics: the Lorentz condition defining the Lorentz gauge of the
electromagnetic potentials; the Dirac delta function (x); the Schumann
resonances of the earth-ionosphere cavity; the Weizsacker-Williams method of
virtual quanta; the BMT equation of spin dynamics. I give illustrated thumbnail
sketches of both the true and reputed discoverers and quote from their
"discovery" publications.
