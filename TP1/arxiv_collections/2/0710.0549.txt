We reconsider the lattice measurement of Green functions in Coulomb gauge,
both in 2+1 and 3+1 dimensions, using an improved gauge fixing scheme. The
influence of Gribov copies is examined and we find clear indications that Green
functions are more strongly affected than previously assumed, in particular for
low momenta. Qualitatively, our improved lattice results in the infra-red
compare more favourably with recent continuum calculations in the Hamiltonian
approach.
