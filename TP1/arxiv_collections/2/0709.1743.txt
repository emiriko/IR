We have studied natural parity states in $^{26}$Mg via the
$^{22}$Ne($^{6}$Li,d)$^{26}$Mg reaction. Our method significantly improves the
energy resolution of previous experiments and, as a result, we report the
observation of a natural parity state in $^{26}$Mg. Possible spin-parity
assignments are suggested on the basis of published $\gamma$-ray decay
experiments. The stellar rate of the $^{22}$Ne($\alpha$,$\gamma$)$^{26}$Mg
reaction is reduced and may give rise to an increase in the production of
s-process neutrons via the $^{22}$Ne($\alpha$,n)$^{25}$Mg reaction.
