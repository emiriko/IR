We present exact, analytic and simple solutions of relativistic perfect fluid
hydrodynamics. The solutions allow us to calculate the rapidity distribution of
the particles produced at the freeze-out, and fit them to the measured rapidity
distribution data. We also give an advanced estimation of the energy density
reached in heavy ion collisions, and an improved estimation of the life-time of
the reaction.
