Using Monte Carlo simulations of the Lebwohl--Lasher model we study the
director ordering in a nematic cell where the top and bottom surfaces are
patterned with a lattice of $\pm 1$ point topological defects of lattice
spacing $a$. We find that the nematic order depends crucially on the ratio of
the height of the cell $H$ to $a$. When $H/a \gtrsim 0.9$ the system is very
well--ordered and the frustration induced by the lattice of defects is relieved
by a network of half--integer defect lines which emerge from the point defects
and hug the top and bottom surfaces of the cell. When $H/a \lesssim 0.9$ the
system is disordered and the half--integer defect lines thread through the cell
joining point defects on the top and bottom surfaces. We present a simple
physical argument in terms of the length of the defect lines to explain these
results. To facilitate eventual comparison with experimental systems we also
simulate optical textures and study the switching behavior in the presence of
an electric field.
