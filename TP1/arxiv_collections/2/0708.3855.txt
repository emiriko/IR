We show for the Ising model that is possible construct a discrete time
stochastic model analogous to the Langevin equation that incorporates an
arbitrary amount of damping. It is shown to give the correct equilibrium
statistics and is then used to investigate nonequilibrium phenomena, in
particular, magnetic avalanches. The value of damping can greatly alter the
shape of hysteresis loops, and for small damping and high disorder, the
morphology of large avalanches can be drastically effected. Small damping also
alters the size distribution of avalanches at criticality.
