We study the relativistic quantum mechanical problem of a Dirac particle
tunneling through two successive electrostatic barriers. Our aim is to study
the emergence of the so-called \emph{Generalized Hartman Effect}, an effect
observed in the context of nonrelativistic tunneling as well as in its
electromagnetic counterparts, and which is often associated with the
possibility of superluminal velocities in the tunneling process. We discuss the
behavior of both the phase (or group) tunneling time and the dwell time, and
show that in the limit of opaque barriers the relativistic theory also allows
the emergence of the Generalized Hartman Effect. We compare our results with
the nonrelativistic ones and discuss their interpretation.
