We study the effect of anomalous optical transmission through an array of
vortices in a type-II superconducting film subjected to a strong magnetic
field. The mechanism responsible for this effect is resonance transmission
between two surface plasmon polaritons (SPP) in the system. The SPP band gap in
the system is studied as a function of magnetic field and temperature. Control
of transmission by varying magnetic field and/or temperature is analyzed.
