The effects of isolated residual-gas adsorbates on the local electronic
structure of the Dy(0001) surface were spatially mapped by scanning tunneling
microscopy and spectroscopy at 12 K. Less than 15 A away from an adsorbate, a
strong reduction of the intensity and a significant increase of the width of
the majority component of the surface state due to impurity scattering were
observed, with essentially no change of the minority component; this reflects a
high lateral localization of the Tamm-like surface state. Furthermore, an
adsorbate-induced state was found that behaves metastable.
