We study stability of a generalized sine-Gordon model with two coupled scalar
fields in two dimensions. Topological soliton solutions are found from the
first-order equations that solve the equations of motion. The perturbation
equations can be cast in terms of a Schrodinger-like operators for fluctuations
and their spectra are calculated.
