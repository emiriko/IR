We study the relation between the lagrangian field-antifield formalism and
the BRST invariant phase space formulation of gauge theories. Starting from the
Batalin-Fradkin-Vilkovisky unitarized action, we demonstrate in a deductive way
the equivalence of the phase space, and the lagrangian field-antifield
partition functions for the case of irreducible first rank theories.
