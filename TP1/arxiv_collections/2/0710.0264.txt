In a space with some sufficiently small compact dimension (with non-trivial
cycles) and with periodic boundary conditions for the fermions, the charge
conjugation (C), spatial parity (P), time reversal (T) and CPT symmetries are
spontaneously broken in QCD. We have investigated what are the physical
consequences of the breaking of these discrete symmetries, that is what local
observables can be used to detect it. We show that the breaking induces the
generation of baryon currents, propagating along the compact dimensions.
