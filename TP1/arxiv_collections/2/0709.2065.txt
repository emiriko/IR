We try to perform geometrization of psychology by representing mental states,
<<ideas>>, by points of a metric space, <<mental space>>. Evolution of ideas is
described by dynamical systems in metric mental space. We apply the mental
space approach for modeling of flows of unconscious and conscious information
in the human brain. In a series of models, Models 1-4, we consider cognitive
systems with increasing complexity of psychological behavior determined by
structure of flows of ideas. Since our models are in fact models of the
AI-type, one immediately recognizes that they can be used for creation of
AI-systems, which we call psycho-robots, exhibiting important elements of human
psyche. Creation of such psycho-robots may be useful improvement of domestic
robots. At the moment domestic robots are merely simple working devices (e.g.
vacuum cleaners or lawn mowers) . However, in future one can expect demand in
systems which be able not only perform simple work tasks, but would have
elements of human self-developing psyche. Such AI-psyche could play an
important role both in relations between psycho-robots and their owners as well
as between psycho-robots. Since the presence of a huge numbers of
psycho-complexes is an essential characteristic of human psychology, it would
be interesting to model them in the AI-framework.
