We introduce a new observable, 'gluino stransverse mass', which is an
application of the Cambridge $m_{T2}$ variable to the process where gluinos are
pair produced in proton-proton collision and each gluino subsequently decays
into two quarks and one LSP, $i.e. \tilde{g}\tilde{g} \to qq\tilde\chi_1^0\
qq\tilde\chi_1^0$. We show that the gluino stransverse mass can be utilized to
measure the gluino and the lightest neutralino masses separately, and also the
(1st and 2nd generation) squark masses if lighter than the gluino mass, thereby
providing a good first look at the pattern of sparticle masses experimentally.
