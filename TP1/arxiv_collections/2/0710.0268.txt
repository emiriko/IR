We introduce a class of Schur type functions associated with polynomial
sequences of binomial type. This can be regarded as a generalization of the
ordinary Schur functions and the factorial Schur functions. This generalization
satisfies some interesting expansion formulas, in which there is a curious
duality. Moreover this class includes examples which are useful to describe the
eigenvalues of Capelli type central elements of the universal enveloping
algebras of classical Lie algebras.
