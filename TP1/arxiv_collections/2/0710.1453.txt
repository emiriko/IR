We calculate nuclear modification factors $R_{dAu}$, central-to-peripheral
ratios, $R_{CP}$, and pseudorapidity asymmetries $Y_{Asym}$ in deuteron-gold
collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 200$ GeV in the framework of leading-order (LO)
perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics. We use the Eskola-Kolhinen-Salgado (EKS),
the Frankfurt-Guzey-Strikman (FGS) and the Hirai-Kumano-Nagai (HKN) nuclear
parton distribution functions and the Albino-Kramer-Kniehl (AKK) fragmentation
functions in our calculations. Results are compared to experimental data from
the BRAHMS and STAR collaborations.
