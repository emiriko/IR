A recent work [1] proposed a type of cluster entangled coherent states and
its generation. Here we present an alternative experimental arrangement for its
generation in bimodal QED cavities. The scheme employs a single two-level atom
that interacts dispersively with cavity modes initially prepared in coherent
states. The fidelity and success probability of the state preparation are
obtained considering the influence of atomic velocity spread and atomic
efficiency detection.
