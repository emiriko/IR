We investigate distribution of magnetic fields around dense solid plasmas
generated by intense p-polarized laser (~10^{16} W.cm^{-2}, 100 fs) irradiation
of magnetic tapes, using high sensitivity magneto optical microscopy. We
present evidence for giant axial magnetic fields and map out for the first time
the spatial distribution of these fields. By using the axial magnetic field
distribution as a diagnostic tool we uncover evidence for angular momentum
associated with the plasma. We believe this study holds significance for
investigating the process under which a magnetic material magnetizes or
demagnetizes under the influence of ultrashort intense laser pulses.
