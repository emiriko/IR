We revisit Nagaoka ferromagnetism in the U=oo Hubbard model within the
dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) using the recently developed continuous time
quantum Monte Carlo method as the impurity solver. The stability of Nagaoka
ferromagnetism is studied as a function of the temperature, the doping level,
and the next-nearest-neighbor lattice hopping t'. We found that the nature of
the phase transition as well as the stability of the ferromagnetic state is
very sensitive to the t' hopping. Negative t'=-0.1t stabilizes ferromagnetism
up to higher doping levels. The paramagnetic state is reached through a first
order phase transition. Alternatively, a second order phase transition is
observed at t'=0. Very near half-filling, the coherence temperature T_{coh} of
the paramagnetic metal becomes very low and ferromagnetism evolves out of an
incoherent metal rather than conventional Fermi liquid. We use the DMFT results
to benchmark slave-boson method which might be useful in more complicated
geometries.
