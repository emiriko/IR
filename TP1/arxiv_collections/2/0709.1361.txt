We consider several models with long-range interactions evolving via
Hamiltonian dynamics. The microcanonical dynamics of the basic Hamiltonian Mean
Field (HMF) model and perturbed HMF models with either global anisotropy or an
on-site potential are studied both analytically and numerically. We find that
in the magnetic phase, the initial zero magnetization state remains stable
above a critical energy and is unstable below it. In the dynamically stable
state, these models exhibit relaxation time scales that increase algebraically
with the number $N$ of particles, indicating the robustness of the
quasistationary state seen in previous studies. In the unstable state, the
corresponding time scale increases logarithmically in $N$.
