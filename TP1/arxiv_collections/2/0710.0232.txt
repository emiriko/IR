In this paper, we distinguish two levels for the plane-filling property. We
consider a simple and a strong one. In this paper, we give the construction
which proves that the simple plane-filling property also holds for the
hyperbolic plane. The plane-filling property was established for the Euclidean
plane by J. Kari, in 1994, in the strong version.
