We have developed an analytical model of angle-dependent magnetoresistance
oscillations (AMROs) in a quasi-two-dimensional metal in which magnetic
breakdown occurs. The model takes account of all the contributions from
quasiparticles undergoing both magnetic breakdown and Bragg reflection at each
junction and allows extremely efficient simulation of data which can be
compared with recent experimental results on the organic metal
kappa-ET2Cu(NCS)2. AMROs resulting from both closed and open orbits emerge
naturally at low field, and the model enables the transition to breakdown-AMROs
with increasing field to be described in detail.
