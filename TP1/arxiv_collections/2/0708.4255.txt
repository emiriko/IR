From an N=1 supersymmetric electric gauge theory with the gauge group SU(N_c)
x SU(N_c') x SU(N_c'') with fundamentals for each gauge group and the
bifundamentals, we apply Seiberg dual to each gauge group and obtain the N=1
supersymmetric dual magnetic gauge theories with dual matters including the
additional gauge singlets. By analyzing the F-term equations of the dual
magnetic superpotentials, we describe the intersecting brane configurations of
type IIA string theory corresponding to the meta-stable nonsupersymmetric vacua
of this gauge theory. We apply also to the case for N=1 supersymmetric electric
gauge theory with the gauge group Sp(N_c) x SO(2N_c') x Sp(N_c'') with flavors
for each gauge group and the bifundamentals. Finally, we describe the
meta-stable brane configurations of multiple product gauge groups.
