We perform a Noether analysis for a description of translation
transformations in 4D kappa-Minkowski noncommutative spacetime which is based
on the structure of a 5D differential calculus. Taking properly into account
the properties of the differential calculus we arrive at an explicit formula
for the conserved charges. We also propose a choice of basis for the 5D
calculus which leads to an intuitive description of time derivatives.
