The physical reasons why the Drude dielectric function is not compatible with
the Lifshitz formula, as opposed to the generalized plasma-like permittivity,
are presented. Essentially, the problem is connected with the finite size of
metal plates. It is shown that the Lifshitz theory combined with the
generalized plasma-like permittivity is thermodynamically consistent.
