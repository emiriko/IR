It is commonly thought that a state-dependent quantity, after being averaged
over a classical ensemble of random Hamiltonians, will always become
independent of the state. We point out that this is in general incorrect: if
the ensemble of Hamiltonians is time reversal invariant, and the quantity
involves the state in higher than bilinear order, then we show that the
quantity is only a constant over the orbits of the invariance group on the
Hilbert space. Examples include fidelity and decoherence in appropriate models.
