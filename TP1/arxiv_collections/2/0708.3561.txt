Nambu-Goto model is investigated by using the canonical Monte Carlo
simulation technique on dynamically triangulated surfaces of spherical
topology. We find that the model has four distinct phases; crumpled,
branched-polymer, linear, and tubular. The linear phase and the tubular phase
appear to be separated by a first-order transition. It is also found that there
is no long-range two-dimensional order in the model. In fact, no smooth surface
can be seen in the whole region of the curvature modulus \alpha, which is the
coefficient of the deficit angle term in the Hamiltonian. The bending energy,
which is not included in the Hamiltonian, remains large even at sufficiently
large \alpha in the tubular phase. On the other hand, the surface is
spontaneously compactified into a one-dimensional smooth curve in the linear
phase; one of the two degrees of freedom shrinks, and the other degree of
freedom remains along the curve. Moreover, we find that the rotational symmetry
of the model is spontaneously broken in the tubular phase just as in the same
model on the fixed connectivity surfaces.
