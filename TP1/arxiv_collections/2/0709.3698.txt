This paper deals with quon algebras or deformed oscillator algebras, for
which the deformation parameter is a root of unity. We show the interest of
such algebras for fractional supersymmetric quantum mechanics, angular momentum
theory and quantum information. More precisely, quon algebras are used for (i)
a realization of a generalized Weyl-Heisenberg algebra from which it is
possible to associate a fractional supersymmetric dynamical system, (ii) a
polar decomposition of SU_2 and (iii) a construction of mutually unbiased bases
in Hilbert spaces of prime dimension. We also briefly discuss (symmetric
informationally complete) positive operator valued measures in the spirit of
(iii).
