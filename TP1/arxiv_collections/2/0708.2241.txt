The measurement of joint signal-idler photon-number distribution of a field
obtained from spontaneous parametric downconversion using an intensified CCD
camera is presented. It is shown that a classicality criterion is violated
directly by the measured data. Characteristic dimensions of the area of
correlation are determined in the same experimental setup.
