Using only the current empirical information on the nucleon electromagnetic
form factors we map out the transverse charge density in proton and neutron as
viewed from a light front moving towards a transversely polarized nucleon.
These charge densities are characterized by a dipole pattern, in addition to
the monopole field corresponding with the unpolarized density. Furthermore, we
use the latest empirical information on the $N \to \Delta$ transition form
factors to map out the transition charge density which induces the $N \to
\Delta$ excitation. This transition charge density in a transversely polarized
$N$ and $\Delta$ contains both monopole, dipole and quadrupole patterns, the
latter corresponding with a deformation of the hadron's charge distribution.
