This paper delineates the first steps in a systematic quantitative study of
the spacetime fluctuations induced by quantum fields in an evaporating black
hole under the stochastic gravity program. The central object of interest is
the noise kernel, which is the symmetrized two-point quantum correlation
function of the stress tensor operator. As a concrete example we apply it to
the study of the spherically-symmetric sector of metric perturbations around an
evaporating black hole background geometry. For macroscopic black holes we find
that those fluctuations grow and eventually become important when considering
sufficiently long periods of time (of the order of the evaporation time), but
well before the Planckian regime is reached. In addition, the assumption of a
simple correlation between the fluctuations of the energy flux crossing the
horizon and far from it, which was made in earlier work on
spherically-symmetric induced fluctuations, is carefully scrutinized and found
to be invalid. Our analysis suggests the existence of an infinite amplitude for
the fluctuations when trying to localize the horizon as a three-dimensional
hypersurface, as in the classical case, and, as a consequence, a more accurate
picture of the horizon as possessing a finite effective width due to quantum
fluctuations. This is supported by a systematic analysis of the noise kernel in
curved spacetime smeared with different functions under different conditions,
the details are collected in the appendices. This case study shows a pathway
for probing quantum metric fluctuations near the horizon and understanding
their physical meaning.
