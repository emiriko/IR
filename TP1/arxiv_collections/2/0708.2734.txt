We treat the trapped two-component Fermi system, in which unlike fermions
interact through a two-body short-range potential having no bound state but an
infinite scattering length. By accurately solving the Schroedinger equation for
up to N=6 fermions, we show that no many-body bound states exist other than
those bound by the trapping potential, and we demonstrate unique universal
properties of the system: Certain excitation frequencies are separated by
$2\hbar\omega$, the wavefunctions agree with analytical predictions and a
virial theorem is fulfilled. Further calculations up to N=30 determine the
excitation gap, an experimentally accessible universal quantity, and it agrees
with recent predictions based on a density functional approach.
