The interplay of charmonium production and suppression in In+In and Pb+Pb
reactions at 158 AGeV and in Au+Au reactions at sqrt(s)=200 GeV is investigated
with the HSD transport approach within the `hadronic comover model' and the
`QGP melting scenario'. The results for the J/Psi suppression and the Psi' to
J/Psi ratio are compared to the recent data of the NA50, NA60, and PHENIX
Collaborations. We find that, at 158 AGeV, the comover absorption model
performs better than the scenario of abrupt threshold melting. However, neither
interaction with hadrons alone nor simple color screening satisfactory
describes the data at sqrt(s)=200 GeV. A deconfined phase is clearly reached at
RHIC, but a theory having the relevant degrees of freedom in this regime
(strongly interacting quarks/gluons) is needed to study its transport
properties.
