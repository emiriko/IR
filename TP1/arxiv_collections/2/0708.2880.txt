We present a scheme by which projective homodyne measurement of a microwave
resonator can be used to generate entanglement between two superconducting
charge qubits coupled to this resonator. The non-interacting qubits are
initialised in a product of their ground states, the resonator is initialised
in a coherent field state, and the state of the system is allowed to evolve
under a rotating wave Hamiltonian. Making a homodyne measurement on the
resonator at a given time projects the qubits into an state of the form (|gg> +
exp(-i phi)|ee>)/sqrt(2). This protocol can produce states with a fidelity as
high as required, with a probability approaching 0.5. Although the system
described is one that can be used to display revival in the qubit oscillations,
we show that the entanglement procedure works at much shorter timescales.
