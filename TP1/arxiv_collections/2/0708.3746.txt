We measure the electron escape-rate from surface-acoustic-wave dynamic
quantum dots (QDs) through a tunnel barrier. Rate-equations are used to extract
the tunnelling rates, which change by an order of magnitude with tunnel-barrier
gate voltage. We find that the tunnelling rates depend on the number of
electrons in each dynamic QD because of Coulomb energy. By comparing this
dependence to a saddle-point-potential model, the addition energies of the
second and third electron in each dynamic QD are estimated. The scale (a few
meV) is comparable to those in static QDs as expected.
