We compute the initial ideals, with respect to certain conveniently chosen
term orders, of ideals of tangent cones at torus fixed points to Schubert
varieties in orthogonal Grassmannians. The initial ideals turn out to be
square-free monomial ideals and therefore Stanley-Reisner face rings of
simplicial complexes. We describe these complexes. The maximal faces of these
complexes encode certain sets of non-intersecting lattice paths.
