Quantum computation is based on tensor products and entangled states. We
discuss an alternative to the quantum framework where tensor products are
replaced by geometric products and entangled states by multivectors. The
resulting theory is analogous to quantum computation but does not involve
quantum mechanics. We discuss in detail similarities and differences between
the two approaches and illustrate the formulas by explicit geometric objects
where multivector versions of the Bell-basis, GHZ, and Hadamard states are
visualized by means of colored oriented polylines.
