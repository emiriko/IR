We discuss the current status of our calculation of the physics of pi and K
mesons using three dynamical flavors of improved staggered quarks. This year,
we have a new ensemble with a lattice spacing of 0.06 fm and a light sea mass
of 0.2 m_s, as well as significant increases in statistics at several coarser
lattice spacings and/or heavier sea masses. Results for decay constants, quark
masses, low energy constants, condensates, and V_{us} are presented.
