The compatibility of the pure power law infrared solution of QCD
Dyson-Schwinger equations (DSE) and lattice data for the gluon and ghost
propagators in Landau gauge is discussed. For the gluon propagator, the lattice
data is compatible with the DSE infrared solution with an exponent
$\kappa\sim0.53$, measured using a technique that suppresses finite volume
effects and allows to model these corrections to the lattice data. For the
ghost propagator, the lattice data does not seem to follow the infrared DSE
power law solution.
