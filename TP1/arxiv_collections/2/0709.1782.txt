Experimental results on the dislocation dynamics in a two-dimensional plasma
crystal are presented. Edge dislocations were created in pairs in lattice
locations where the internal shear stress exceeded a threshold and then moved
apart in the glide plane at a speed higher than the sound speed of shear waves,
$C_T$. The experimental system, a plasma crystal, allowed observation of this
process at an atomistic (kinetic) level. The early stage of this process is
identified as a stacking fault. At a later stage, supersonically moving
dislocations generated shear-wave Mach cones.
