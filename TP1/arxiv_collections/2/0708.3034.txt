The characterization of Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) dust shows that bubble
burst at the liquid steel surface is the principal source of dust emission. We
have therefore developed an experimental device for studying this phenomenon.
As in the case of the air-water system, the bubble-burst gives birth to two
types of droplets: film drops and jet drops. The jet drop formation is observed
with high-speed video. The film drop aerosol is collected on filters and then
characterized by means of SEM, granulometric and gravimetric analyses. Results
are presented and discussed. The quantification of both types of projections
leads to the conclusion that the film drop projections represent the major
source of dust. The amount of film drops greatly decreases with the parent
bubble size. Under 4.5 mm in bubble diameter, no film drops are formed.
Decreasing enough the bubble size would therefore represent an effective
solution for reducing drastically the EAF dust emission.
