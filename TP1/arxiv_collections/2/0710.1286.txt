A propagation-based x-ray phase-contrast imaging (PBI) setup using a
conventional x-ray source (LFF Cu target) is presented. A virtual x-ray source
of 40 x 50 $\mu$$m^2$ was created by using, horizontally, a $6^o$ take-off
angle (with the x-ray tube working in the line focus geometry) and, vertically,
a 50 $\mu$m slit . The sample was set 12 $m$ from the source. Propagation-based
x-ray phase-contrast (PB) image and conventional radiography (CR) of a
polypropylene tube were acquired. Edge enhanced effects and a crack, not
detected in CR, were clearly seen in the PB image. Contrast, visibility of the
object edges and signal to noise ratio of the acquired images were exploited.
The results show that PB images can be acquired by using normal focus (macro
focus) conventional x-ray sources. This apparatus can be used as an standard
phase-contrast imaging setup to analyze different kind of samples with large
field of view (75 x 75 $mm^2$), discarding the use of translators for sample
and detector.
