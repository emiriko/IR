We analyzed the enhancement of the Gilbert damping constant due to spin
pumping in non-collinear ferromagnet / non-magnet / ferromagnet trilayer
systems. We show that the Gilbert damping constant depends both on the
precession angle of the magnetization of the free layer and on the direction of
the magntization of the fixed layer. We find the condition to be satisfied to
realize strong enhancement of the Gilbert damping constant.
