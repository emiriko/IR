In this article we determine the structure of a twisted first cohomology
group of the first homology of a trivalent graph with a coefficient associated
with the quantum Clebsch-Gordan condition. As an application we give a
characterization of a combinatorial property, the external edge condition,
which is defined by the author in the study of the Heisenberg representation on
the TQFT-module.
