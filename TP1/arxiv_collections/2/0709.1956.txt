We analyze the bipartite and multipartite entanglement for the ground state
of the one-dimensional XY model in a transverse magnetic field in the
thermodynamical limit. We explicitly take into account the spontaneous symmetry
breaking in order to explore the relation between entanglement and quantum
phase transitions. As a result we show that while both bipartite and
multipartite entanglement can be enhanced by spontaneous symmetry breaking deep
into the ferromagnetic phase, only the latter is affected by it in the vicinity
of the critical point. This result adds to the evidence that multipartite, and
not bipartite, entanglement is the fundamental indicator of long range
correlations in quantum phase transitions.
