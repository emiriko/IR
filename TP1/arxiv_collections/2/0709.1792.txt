A crucial point in the debate on feasibility of earthquake prediction is the
dependence of an earthquake magnitude from past seismicity. Indeed, whilst
clustering in time and space is widely accepted, much more questionable is the
existence of magnitude correlations. The standard approach generally assumes
that magnitudes are independent and therefore in principle unpredictable. Here
we show the existence of clustering in magnitude: earthquakes occur with higher
probability close in time, space and magnitude to previous events. More
precisely, the next earthquake tends to have a magnitude similar but smaller
than the previous one. A dynamical scaling relation between magnitude, time and
space distances reproduces the complex pattern of magnitude, spatial and
temporal correlations observed in experimental seismic catalogs.
