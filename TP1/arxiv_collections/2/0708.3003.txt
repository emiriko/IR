A profound change occurs in the stability of quantized vortices in externally
applied flow of superfluid 3He-B at temperatures ~ 0.6 Tc, owing to the rapidly
decreasing damping in vortex motion with decreasing temperature. At low damping
an evolving vortex may become unstable and generate a new independent vortex
loop. This single-vortex instability is the generic precursor to turbulence. We
investigate the instability with non-invasive NMR measurements on a rotating
cylindrical sample in the intermediate temperature regime (0.3 - 0.6) Tc. From
comparisons with numerical calculations we interpret that the instability
occurs at the container wall, when the vortex end moves along the wall in
applied flow.
