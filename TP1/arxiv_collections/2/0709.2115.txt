New methods of solutions of the DGLAP equation and their implementation
through NNLO in QCD are briefly reviewed. We organize the perturbative
expansion that describes in $x$-space the evolved parton distributions in terms
of scale invariant functions, which are determined recursively, and logarithms
of the ratio of the running couplings at the initial and final evolution
scales. Resummed solutions are constructed within the same approach and involve
logarithms of more complex functions, which are given in the non-singlet case.
Differences in the evolution schemes are shown to be numerically sizeable and
intrinsic to perturbation theory. We illustrate these points in the case of
Drell-Yan lepton pair production near the Z resonance, analysis that can be
extended to searches of extra $Z^{\prime}$. We show that the reduction of the
NNLO cross section compared to the NLO prediction may be attributed to the NNLO
evolution.
