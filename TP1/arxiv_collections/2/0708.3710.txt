I propose a new class of interpretations, {\it real world interpretations},
of the quantum theory of closed systems. These interpretations postulate a
preferred factorization of Hilbert space and preferred projective measurements
on one factor. They give a mathematical characterisation of the different
possible worlds arising in an evolving closed quantum system, in which each
possible world corresponds to a (generally mixed) evolving quantum state. In a
realistic model, the states corresponding to different worlds should be
expected to tend towards orthogonality as different possible quasiclassical
structures emerge or as measurement-like interactions produce different
classical outcomes. However, as the worlds have a precise mathematical
definition, real world interpretations need no definition of quasiclassicality,
measurement, or other concepts whose imprecision is problematic in other
interpretational approaches. It is natural to postulate that precisely one
world is chosen randomly, using the natural probability distribution, as the
world realised in Nature, and that this world's mathematical characterisation
is a complete description of reality.
