We observe a strong reduction of the field induced thin film surface
resistance measured at high microwave frequency ($\nu=$47.7 GHz) in
YBa$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$O$_{7-\delta}$ thin films grown on SrTiO$_3$ substrates, as a
consequence of the introduction of sub-micrometric BaZrO$_3$ particles. The
field increase of the surface resistance is smaller by a factor of $\sim$3 in
the film with BaZrO$_3$ inclusions, while the zero-field properties are not
much affected. Combining surface resistance and surface reactance data we
conclude (a) that BaZrO$_3$ inclusions determine very deep and steep pinning
wells and (b) that the pinning changes nature with respect to the pure film.
