We study the effects of unparticle physics in the pair productions of top
quarks at the LHC and ILC. By considering vector, tensor and scalar unparticle
operators, as appropriate, we compute the total cross sections for pair
production processes depending on scale dimension $d_{\U}$. We find that the
existence of unparticles would lead to measurable enhancements on the SM
predictions at the LHC. In the case of ILC this may become two orders of
magnitude larger than that of SM, for smaller values of $d_\U$, a very striking
signal for unparticles.
