We have investigated the neutrino induced coherent pion production reaction
at low and intermediate energies including pion, nucleon and Delta(1232)
resonance. Medium effects in the production mechanism and the distortion of the
pion wave function are included in the calculation. We find a strong reduction
of the cross section due to these effects and also substantial modifications in
the energy distributions of the final pion. The dependence on the atomic number
is discussed.
