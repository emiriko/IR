In this paper the methodology and the results of a quasi real-time thermal
characterization tool and method for the temperature mapping of circuits and
boards based on sensing the infrared radiation will be introduced. With the
proposed method the IR radiation-distribution of boards from the close
proximity of the sensor card is monitored in quasi real-time. The proposed
method is enabling in situ IR measurement among operating cards of a system
e.g. in a rack, enabling the immediate detection of potential hot spots in the
system. . The elevated temperature encountered in different packaged electronic
devices, like digital processors, high power amplifier, high power switches,
etc., demands the application of careful temperature-aware design methodologies
and the electro-thermal simulations of PCBs. The results of different
electro-thermal simulations and modeling in most of the cases give good
approximating results and consider the coupled effects of the real surroundings
of these cards and other dissipation elements in an operating system. However
the simulation time may take hours, and different systems, different
surroundings should be simulated again and again. In our expectation, by using
contactless temperature measurement procedure the heat distribution and the
places of high dissipation elements on an operating PCB board (PCI or AGP cards
in a rack-house of a PC) can be measured and localized in a dense rack system,
where only a thin measuring board can be inserted between the cards during
operation.
