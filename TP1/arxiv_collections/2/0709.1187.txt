We present an extension of the local moment approach to the Anderson impurity
model with spin-dependent hybridization. By employing the two-self-energy
description, as originally proposed by Logan and co-workers, we applied the
symmetry restoration condition for the case with spin-dependent hybridization.
Self-consistent ground states were determined through variational minimization
of the ground state energy. The results obtained with our spin-dependent local
moment approach applied to a quantum dot system coupled to ferromagnetic leads
are in good agreement with those obtained from previous work using numerical
renormalization group calculations.
