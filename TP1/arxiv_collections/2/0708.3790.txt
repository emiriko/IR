The model of radiative neutrino mass with dark matter proposed by one of us
is extended to include a real singlet scalar field. There are then two
important new consequences. One is the realistic possibility of having the
lightest neutral singlet fermion (instead of the lightest neutral component of
the dark scalar doublet) as the dark matter of the Universe. The other is a
modification of the effective Higgs potential of the Standard Model, consistent
with electroweak baryogenesis.
