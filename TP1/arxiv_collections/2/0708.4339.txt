We investigate the effects of all flavor blind CP-conserving unparticle
operators on 5th force experiments, stellar cooling, supernova explosions and
compare the limits with each other and with those obtainable from collider
experiments. In general, astrophysical bounds are considerably stronger,
however they depend strongly on the dimension d_U of the unparticle operator.
While for d_U=1, 5th force experiments yield exceedingly strong bounds, the
bounds from stellar and supernova cooling are more comparable for d_U=2, with
stellar cooling being most restrictive. Bounds on vectorial unparticle
couplings are generally stronger than those on scalar ones.
