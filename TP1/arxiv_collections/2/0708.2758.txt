We continue the study of twisted automorphisms of Hopf algebras started in
"Twisted automorphisms of Hopf algebras". In this paper we concentrate on the
group algebra case. We describe the group of twisted automorphisms of the group
algebra of a group of order coprime to 6. The description turns out to be very
similar to the one for the universal enveloping algebra given in "Twisted
automorphisms of Hopf algebras".
