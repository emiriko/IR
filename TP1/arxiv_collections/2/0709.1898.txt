Spectra, triple and quartic gauge couplings of the Higgsless model with gauge
group $SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_R\times U(1)_{B-L}$ defined in warped space are
explored with numerical method. We extend the equation of motions, boundary
conditions and formalism of multi-gauge-boson vertices to the Hirn-Sanz
scenario. By assuming the ideally delocalized fermion profile, we study the
spectra of vector bosons as well as the triple and quartic gauge couplings
among vector bosons. It is found that mass spectra can be greatly modified by
the parameters of QCD power corrections. Meanwhile, the triple and quartic
gauge couplings can deviate from the values of the standard model to at least
$\pm 10%$ and can saturate the LEP2 bounds. We find the triple gauge couplings
of $Z{\bar W}W$ can be $ 50 %$ smaller than the unitarity bounds. While the
triple gauge couplings of ${\bar Z}WW$ is 20% smaller than the unitarity
bounds, which might challenge the detection of ${\bar Z}$ via s channel at LHC
if $m_{\bar Z}> 500$ GeV.
