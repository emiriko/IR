We investigate the meson mass spectrum in the strong coupling limit of
lattice QCD with one species of staggered fermion for the SU(N_c) color gauge
group, including N_c=3. We analytically derive meson masses as functions of
temperature and chemical potential via chiral condensates. We show that meson
masses quickly decrease to zero when the chemical potential or the temperature
approaches to the critical value.
