This paper approaches the definition and properties of dynamic convex risk
measures through the notion of a family of concave valuation operators
satisfying certain simple and credible axioms. Exploring these in the simplest
context of a finite time set and finite sample space, we find natural
risk-transfer and time-consistency properties for a firm seeking to spread its
risk across a group of subsidiaries.
