We introduce a mapping between a variety of superconducting circuits and a
family of Hamiltonians describing localized magnetic impurities interacting
with conduction bands. This includes the Anderson model, the single impurity
one- and two-channel Kondo problem, as well as the 1D Kondo lattice. We compare
the requirements for performing quantum simulations using the proposed circuits
to those of universal quantum computation with superconducting qubits, singling
out the specific challenges that will have to be addressed.
