We discuss an implementation of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on a
graphic processing unit (GPU) in the NVIDIA CUDA language. We tested our code
on a modern GPU, the NVIDIA GeForce 8800 GTX. Results for two MD algorithms
suitable for short-ranged and long-ranged interactions, and a congruential
shift random number generator are presented. The performance of the GPU's is
compared to their main processor counterpart. We achieve speedups of up to 80,
40 and 150 fold, respectively. With newest generation of GPU's one can run
standard MD simulations at 10^7 flops/$.
