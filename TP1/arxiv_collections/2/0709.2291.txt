We present the numerical investigation of the fermionic two-body decays of
squarks in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model with complex parameters.
In the analysis we particularly take into account the cosmological bounds
imposed by WMAP data. We find that the phase dependences of the decay widths of
the third family squarks, as well as those of the first and second families,
are quite significant which can provide viable probes of additional CP sources.
We plot the CP phase dependences for each fermionic two-body decay channel of
squarks $\tilde q_i$ (i=1,2, q=u,d;c,s;t,b) and speculate about the branching
ratios and total (two-body) decay widths.
