The influence of the phase fluctuation of the pump laser on the
phase-correlation between the signal and idler modes of the output fields from
as non-degenerate optical parametric oscillator operating above oscillation
threshold was experimentally investigated. The noise spectra of the
intensity-difference and the phase-sum of the entangled optical beams were
measured with a pair of unbalanced fiber Match-Zehnder interferometers
specifically designed. The experimental results proved the previously
theoretical prediction and are in reasonable agreement with the calculation
based on semiclassical theory involving the phase fluctuation of pump laser.
