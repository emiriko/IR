It is shown that the limit $t-t'\to\infty$ of the equilibrium dynamic
self-energy can be computed from the $n\to 1$ limit of the static self-energy
of a $n$-times replicated system with one step replica symmetry breaking
structure. It is also shown that the Dyson equation of the replicated system
leads in the $n\to 1$ limit to the bifurcation equation for the glass
ergodicity breaking parameter computed from dynamics. The equivalence of the
replica formalism to the long time limit of the equilibrium relaxation dynamics
is proved to all orders in perturbation for a scalar theory.
