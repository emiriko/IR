The claw finding problem has been studied in terms of query complexity as one
of the problems closely connected to cryptography. For given two functions, f
and g, as an oracle which have domains of size N and M (N<=M), respectively,
and the same range, the goal of the problem is to find x and y such that
f(x)=g(y). This paper describes an optimal algorithm using quantum walk that
solves this problem. Our algorithm can be generalized to find a claw of k
functions for any constant integer k>1, where the domains of the functions may
have different size.
