In this paper new nuclear and subnuclear exotic decays are investigated. Some
theoretical problems of the pionic radioactivity, such as fission-like models,
applicable to all kind of exotic nuclear and subnuclear decays are presented.
The induced nuclear and subnuclear decays are discussed. Moreover, using the
recent results on the spontaneous fission half lives T of the heavy nuclei with
Z new predictions on the pionic yields in the region of superheavy elements are
presented.
