Potentially influential spaces in the spatial networks of cities can be
detected by means of the entropy participation ratios. Local (connectivity) and
global (centrality) entropies are considered. While the connectivity entropy
has a tendency to increase with the city size, the centrality entropy is
decreasing that reflects the global connectedness of cities. In urban networks,
the local and global properties of nodes are positively correlated that
indicates the intelligibility of cities. Correlations between entropy
participation ratios can be used in purpose of intelligibility measurements and
city networks comparisons.
