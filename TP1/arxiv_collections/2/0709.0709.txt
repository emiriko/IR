We investigate competition between one- and two-dimensional topological
excitations - phase slips and vortices - in formation of resistive states in
quasi-two-dimensional superconductors in a wide temperature range below the
mean-field transition temperature $T_{C0}$. The widths $w$ = 100 nm of our
ultrathin NbN samples is substantially larger than the Ginzburg-Landau
coherence length $\xi$ = 4nm and the fluctuation resistivity above $T_{C0}$ has
a two-dimensional character. However, our data shows that the resistivity below
$T_{C0}$ is produced by one-dimensional excitations, - thermally activated
phase slip strips (PSSs) overlapping the sample cross-section. We also
determine the scaling phase diagram, which shows that even in wider samples the
PSS contribution dominates over vortices in a substantial region of
current/temperature variations. Measuring the resistivity within seven orders
of magnitude, we find that the quantum phase slips can only be essential below
this level.
