There is a growing appreciation that hidden sector dynamics may affect the
supersymmetry breaking parameters in the visible sector (supersymmetric
standard model), especially when the dynamics is strong and superconformal. We
point out that there are effects that have not been previously discussed in the
literature. For example, the gaugino masses are suppressed relative to the
gravitino mass. We discuss their implications in the context of various
mediation mechanisms. The issues discussed include anomaly mediation with
singlets, the mu (B mu) problem in gauge and gaugino mediation, and distinct
mass spectra for the superparticles that have not been previously considered.
