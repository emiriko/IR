The notion of ``fundamental constant'' is heavily theory-laden. A natural,
fairly precise formulation is possible in the context of the standard model
(here defined to include gravity). Some fundamental constants have profound
geometric meaning. The ordinary gravitational constant parameterizes the
stiffness, or resistance to curvature, of space-time. The cosmological term
parameterizes space-time's resistance to expansion -- which may be, and
apparently is at present, a {\it negative} resistance, i.e. a tendency toward
expansion. The three gauge couplings of the strong, electromagnetic, and weak
interactions parameterize resistance to curvature in internal spaces. The
remaining fundamental couplings, of which there are a few dozen, supply an
ungainly accommodation of inertia. The multiplicity and variety of fundamental
constants are esthetic and conceptual shortcomings in our present understanding
of foundational physics. I discuss some ideas for improving the situation. I
then briefly discuss additional constants, primarily cosmological, that enter
into our best established present-day world model. Those constants presently
appear as macroscopic state parameters, i.e. as empirical ``material
constants'' of the Universe. I mention a few ideas for how they might become
fundamental constants in a future theory. In the course of this essay I've
advertised several of my favorite speculations, including a few that might be
tested soon.
