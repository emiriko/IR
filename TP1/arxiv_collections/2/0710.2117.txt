The Euclidean interpretation of special relativity which has been suggested
by the author is a formulation of special relativity in ordinary 4D Euclidean
space-time geometry. The natural and geometrically intuitive generalization of
this view involves variations of the speed of light (depending on location and
direction) and a Euclidean principle of general covariance. In this article, a
gravitation model by Jan Broekaert, which implements a view of relativity
theory in the spirit of Lorentz and Poincare, is reconstructed and shown to
fulfill the principles of the Euclidean approach after an appropriate
reinterpretation.
