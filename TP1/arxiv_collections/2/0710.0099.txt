We analyze the existence, stability, and mobility of gap solitons in a
periodic photonic structure with nonlocal nonlinearity. Within the Bragg region
of band gaps, gap solitons exhibit better stability and higher mobility due to
the combinations of non-locality effect and the oscillation nature of Bloch
waves. Using linear stability analysis and calculating the Peierls-Nabarro
potentials, we demonstrate that gap solitons can revive a non-trivial
elastic-like collision even in the periodic systems with the help of nonlocal
nonlinearity. Such interesting behaviors of gap solitons in nonlocal nonlinear
photonic crystals are believed to be useful in optical switching devices.
