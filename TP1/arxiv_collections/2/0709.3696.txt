The Frascati Phi-factory DAFNE has successfully completed experimental runs
for the three main detectors, KLOE, FINUDA and DEAR. The best peak luminosity
achieved so far is 1.6x10^32 cm-2s-1, while the best daily integrated
luminosity is 10 pb-1. At present the DAFNE team is preparing an upgrade of the
collider based on the novel crab waist collision scheme. The upgrade is aimed
at pushing the luminosity towards 10^33 cm-2s-1. In this paper we describe
present collider performance and discuss ongoing preparatory work for the
upgrade.
