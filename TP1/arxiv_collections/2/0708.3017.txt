We argue that the highly studied black hole signatures based on thermal
multiparticle final states are very unlikely and only occur in a very limited
parameter regime if at all. However, we show that if the higher-dimensional
quantum gravity scale is low, it should be possible to study quantum gravity in
the context of higher dimensions through detailed compositeness-type searches.
