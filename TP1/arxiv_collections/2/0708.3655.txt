We give dimension-free regularity conditions for a class of possibly
degenerate sub-elliptic equations in the Heisenberg group exhibiting
super-quadratic growth in the horizontal gradient; this solves an issue raised
by Manfredi & Mingione (Math. Ann. 2007) where only dimension dependent bounds
for the growth exponent are given. We also obtain explicit a priori local
regularity estimates, and cover the case of the horizontal p-Laplacean
operator, extending some regularity proven by Domokos & Manfredi (Cont. Math.
2005). In turn, the a priori estimates found are shown to imply the suitable
local Calderon-Zygmund theory for the related class of non-homogeneous,
possibly degenerate equations involving discontinuous coefficients. These last
results extend to the sub-elliptic setting a few classical non-linear Euclidean
results of Iwaniec and Dibenedetto & Manfredi, and to the non-linear case
estimates of the same nature that were available in the sub-elliptic setting
only for solutions to linear equations.
