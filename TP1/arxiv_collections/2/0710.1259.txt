We examine the performance of several molecular simulation techniques aimed
at evaluation of the surface tension through its thermodynamic definition. For
all methods explored, the surface tension is calculated by approximating the
change in Helmholtz free energy associated with a change in interfacial area
through simulation of a liquid slab at constant particle number, volume, and
temperature. The methods explored fall within three general classes:
free-energy perturbation, the Bennett acceptance-ratio scheme, and the expanded
ensemble technique. Calculations are performed for both the truncated
Lennard-Jones and square-well fluids at select temperatures spaced along their
respective liquid-vapor saturation lines. Overall, we find that Bennett and
expanded ensemble approaches provide the best combination of accuracy and
precision. All of the methods, when applied using sufficiently small area
perturbation, generate equivalent results for the Lennard-Jones fluid. However,
single-stage free-energy-perturbation methods and the closely related test-area
technique recently introduced by Gloor et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 123, 134703
(2005)], generate surface tension values for the square-well fluid that are not
consistent with those obtained from the more robust expanded ensemble and
Bennett approaches, regardless of the size of the area perturbation.
Single-stage perturbation methods fail also for the Lennard-Jones system when
applied using large area perturbations. Here an analysis of phase-space overlap
produces a quantitative explanation of the observed inaccuracy, and shows that
the satisfactory results obtained in these cases from the test-area method
arise from a cancellation of errors that cannot be expected in general.
