We show how multi-partite entanglement, such as of W-state form, can be
created in branched spin chain systems. We also discuss the preservation of
such entanglement, once created. The technique could be applied to actual spin
chain systems, or to other physical systems such as strings of coupled quantum
dots, molecules or atoms.
