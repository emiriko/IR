In cosmography, cosmokinetics, and cosmology it is quite common to encounter
physical quantities expanded as a Taylor series in the cosmological redshift z.
Perhaps the most well-known exemplar of this phenomenon is the Hubble relation
between distance and redshift. However, we now have considerable high-z data
available, for instance we have supernova data at least back to redshift
z=1.75. This opens up the theoretical question as to whether or not the Hubble
series (or more generally any series expansion based on the z-redshift)
actually converges for large redshift? Based on a combination of mathematical
and physical reasoning, we argue that the radius of convergence of any series
expansion in z is less than or equal to 1, and that z-based expansions must
break down for z>1, corresponding to a universe less than half its current
size.
  Furthermore, we shall argue on theoretical grounds for the utility of an
improved parameterization y=z/(1+z). In terms of the y-redshift we again argue
that the radius of convergence of any series expansion in y is less than or
equal to 1, so that y-based expansions are likely to be good all the way back
to the big bang y=1, but that y-based expansions must break down for y<-1, now
corresponding to a universe more than twice its current size.
