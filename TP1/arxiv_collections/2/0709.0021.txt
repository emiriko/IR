We outline a proposal for a method of preparing an encoded two-state system
(logical qubit) that is immune to collective noise acting on the Hilbert space
of the states supporting it. The logical qubit is comprised of three photonic
three-state systems (qutrits) and is generated by the process of spontaneous
parametric down conversion. The states are constructed using linear optical
elements along with three down-conversion sources, and are deemed successful by
the simultaneous detection of six events. We also show how to select a
maximally entangled state of two qutrits by similar methods. For this maximally
entangled state we describe conditions for the state to be decoherence-free
which do not correspond to collective errors.
