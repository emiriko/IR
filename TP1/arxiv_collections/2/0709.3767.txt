Assuming that the neutrino mass matrix is dominated by a term with the
permutation symmetry $S_{\scriptscriptstyle 3}$ it is possible to explain
neutrino data only if the masses are quasi-degenerate. A sub-dominant term with
an approximate $\mu -\tau$ symmetry leads to an approximate tri-bimaximal form.
Experimental consequences are discussed.
