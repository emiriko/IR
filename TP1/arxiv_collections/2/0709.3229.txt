We investigated the disentanglement dynamics of two-qubit system in
Non-Markovian approach. We showed that only the couple strength with the
environment near to or less than fine-structure constant 1/137, entanglement
appear exponential decay for a certain class of two-qubit entangled state.
While the coupling between qubit and the environment is much larger, system
always appears the sudden-death of entanglement even in the vacuum environment.
