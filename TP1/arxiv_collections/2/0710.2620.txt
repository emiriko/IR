Proofs are given that the quantum-mechanical description of the LC -circuit
with a time dependent external source can be readily established by starting
from a more general discretization rule of the electric charge. For this
purpose one resorts to an arbitrary but integer-dependent real function F(n)
instead of n. This results in a nontrivial generalization of the discrete time
dependent Schrodinger-equation established before via F(n)=n, as well as to
modified charge conservation laws. However, selected descriptions can also be
done by looking for a unique derivation of the effective inductance. This leads
to site independent inductances, but site dependent ones get implied by
accounting for periodic solutions to F(n) in terms of Jacobian elliptic
functions. Many-charge generalizations of quantum circuits, including the
modified continuity equation for total charge and current densities, have also
been discussed.
