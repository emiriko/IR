Combining experiments and ab initio models we report on $\rm SrPt_4Ge_{12}$
and $\rm BaPt_4Ge_{12}$ as members of a novel class of superconducting
skutterudites, where Sr or Ba atoms stabilize a framework entirely formed by
Ge-atoms. Below $T_c=5.35$ K, and 5.10 K for $\rm BaPt_4Ge_{12}$ and $\rm
SrPt_4Ge_{12}$, respectively, electron-phonon coupled superconductivity
emerges, ascribed to intrinsic features of the Pt-Ge framework, where Ge-$p$
states dominate the electronic structure at the Fermi energy.
