Using 462/fb of e+e- annihilation data recorded by the Belle detector, we
report the first observation of the decay Ds1(2536)+ -> D+pi-K+. The ratio of
branching fractions B(Ds1+ -> D+pi-K+)/B(Ds1+ -> D*+K0) is measured to be
(3.27+-0.18+-0.37)%. We also study the angular distributions in the Ds1(2536)+
-> D*+K0S decay and measure the ratio of D- and S-wave amplitudes. The S-wave
dominates, with a partial width of Gamma_S/Gamma_total=0.72+-0.05+-0.01.
