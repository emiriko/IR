This paper is aimed at introducing an algebraic model for physical scales and
units of measurement. This goal is achieved by means of the concept of
``positive space'' and its rational powers. Positive spaces are 1-dimensional
``semi-vector spaces'' without the zero vector. A direct approach to this
subject might be sufficient. On the other hand, a broader mathematical
understanding requires the notions of sesqui- and semi-tensor products between
semi-vector spaces and vector spaces. So, the paper is devoted to an original
contribution to the algebraic theory of semi-vector spaces, to the algebraic
analysis of positive spaces and, eventually, to the algebraic model of physical
scales and units of measurement in terms of positive spaces.
