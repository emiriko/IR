The differential isospin-fractionation (IsoF) during the liquid-gas phase
transition in dilute asymmetric nuclear matter is studied as a function of
nucleon momentum. Within a self-consistent thermal model it is shown that the
neutron/proton ratio of the gas phase becomes {\it smaller} than that of the
liquid phase for energetic nucleons, although the gas phase is overall more
neutron-rich. Clear indications of the differential IsoF consistent with the
thermal model predictions are demonstrated within a transport model for
heavy-ion reactions. Future comparisons with experimental data will allow us to
extract critical information about the momentum dependence of the isovector
strong interaction.
