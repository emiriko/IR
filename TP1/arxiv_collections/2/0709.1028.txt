A simple master equation for the static perturbation of charged black strings
is derived while employing the gauge proposed by Kol. As the charge is varied
it is found that the potential in the master equation for the perturbations
becomes positive exactly when the specific heat turns positive thus forbidding
a bound state and the onset of the Gregory-Laflamme instability. It can safely
be said that this is the first analytic and explicit evidence for the
Gubser-Mitra conjecture, correlating the classical and thermodynamic
instabilities of black branes. Possible generalizations of the analysis are
also discussed.
