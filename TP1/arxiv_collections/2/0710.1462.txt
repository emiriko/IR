Entropy functionals (i.e. convex integral functionals) and extensions of
these functionals are minimized on convex sets. This paper is aimed at reducing
as much as possible the assumptions on the constraint set. Dual equalities and
characterizations of the minimizers are obtained with weak constraint
qualifications.
