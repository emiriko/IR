We calculate full one-loop corrections to the genuine three-body decays of
the light chargino \chi_1^\pm to \chi^0_1 l^\pm \nu in the Minimal
Supersymmetric Standard Model. We find that the corrections to the decay width
can be of the order of a few percent. We show also how radiative corrections
affect energy and angular distributions of the final lepton.
