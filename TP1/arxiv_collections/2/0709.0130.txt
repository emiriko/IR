Extensive calculations of the electric-dipole matrix elements in alkali-metal
atoms are conducted using the relativistic all-order method. This approach is a
linearized version of the coupled-cluster method, which sums infinite sets of
many-body perturbation theory terms. All allowed transitions between the lowest
ns, np_1/2, np_3/2 states and a large number of excited states are considered
in these calculations and their accuracy is evaluated. The resulting
electric-dipole matrix elements are used for the high-precision calculation of
frequency-dependent polarizabilities of the excited states of alkali-metal
atoms. We find magic wavelengths in alkali-metal atoms for which the ns and
np_1/2 and np_3/2 atomic levels have the same ac Stark shifts, which
facilitates state-insensitive optical cooling and trapping.
