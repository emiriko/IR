Partial Quantum Nearest Neighbor Probability Density Functions (PQNNPDF's)
are formulated for the purpose of determining the behavior of quantum mixed
systems in equilibrium in a manner analogous to that provided for classical
multi-component systems. Developments in partial quantum m-tuplet distribution
functions, a generalization of the partial quantum radial distribution
function, along with their relationship to PQNNPDF's, are briefly elucidated.
The calculation of statistical thermodynamic properties of quantum mixtures is
presented for arbitrary material systems. Application to the limiting case of
dilute, weakly correlated quantum gas mixtures has been outlined and the second
virial coefficient is derived. The case of dilute strongly degenerate mixtures
is also addressed, providing an expression for the PQNNPDF applicable in this
thermodynamic regime.
