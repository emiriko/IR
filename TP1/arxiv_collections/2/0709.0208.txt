We determine how the differences in the treatment of the subfilter-scale
physics affect the properties of the flow for three closely related
regularizations of Navier-Stokes. The consequences on the applicability of the
regularizations as SGS models are also shown by examining their effects on
superfilter-scale properties. Numerical solutions of the Clark-alpha model are
compared to two previously employed regularizations, LANS-alpha and Leray-alpha
(at Re ~ 3300, Taylor Re ~ 790) and to a DNS. We derive the Karman-Howarth
equation for both the Clark-alpha and Leray-alpha models. We confirm one of two
possible scalings resulting from this equation for Clark as well as its
associated k^(-1) energy spectrum. At sub-filter scales, Clark-alpha possesses
similar total dissipation and characteristic time to reach a statistical
turbulent steady-state as Navier-Stokes, but exhibits greater intermittency. As
a SGS model, Clark reproduces the energy spectrum and intermittency properties
of the DNS. For the Leray model, increasing the filter width decreases the
nonlinearity and the effective Re is substantially decreased. Even for the
smallest value of alpha studied, Leray-alpha was inadequate as a SGS model. The
LANS energy spectrum k^1, consistent with its so-called "rigid bodies,"
precludes a reproduction of the large-scale energy spectrum of the DNS at high
Re while achieving a large reduction in resolution. However, that this same
feature reduces its intermittency compared to Clark-alpha (which shares a
similar Karman-Howarth equation). Clark is found to be the best approximation
for reproducing the total dissipation rate and the energy spectrum at scales
larger than alpha, whereas high-order intermittency properties for larger
values of alpha are best reproduced by LANS-alpha.
