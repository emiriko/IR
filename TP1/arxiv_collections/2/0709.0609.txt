We describe an intrinsic spin-Hall effect in $n$-type bulk zinc-blende
semiconductors with topological origin. When electron transport is confined to
a waveguide structure, and the applied electric field is such that the spins of
electrons remain as eigenstates of the Dresselhaus spin-orbit field with
negligible subband mixing, a gauge structure appears in the momentum space of
the system. In particular, the momentum space exhibits a non-trivial Berry
curvature which affects the transverse motion of electrons anisotropically in
spin, thereby producing a finite spin-Hall effect. The effect should be
detectable using standard techniques in the literature such as Kerr rotation,
and be readily distinguishable from other mechanisms of the spin-Hall effect.
