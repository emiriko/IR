A simple and accurate method of calculating phonon spectra in mixed
semiconductors alloys, on the basis of preliminarily (from first principles)
relaxed atomic structure, is proposed and tested for (Zn,Be)Se and (Ga,In)As
solid solutions. The method uses an observation that the interatomic force
constants, calculated ab initio for a number of microscopic configurations in
the systems cited, show a clear linear variation of the main (diagonal) values
of the interatomic force constants with the corresponding bond length. We
formulate simple rules about how to recover the individual 3x3 subblocks of the
force constants matrix in their local (bonds-related) coordinate systems and
how to transform them into a global (crystal cell-related) coordinate system.
Test calculations done for 64-atom supercells representing different
concentrations of (Zn,Be)Se and (Ga,In)As show that the phonon frequencies and
compositions of eigenvectors are faithfully reproduced in a linearized force
constants calculation, as compared to true ab initio calculations.
