Results on the rheological behavior of novel CHO cell suspensions in a large
range of concentrations are reported. The concentration dependent yield stress
and elastic plateau modulus are formalized in the context of fractal aggregates
under shear, and quite different exponents are found as compared to the case of
red blood cell suspensions. This is explained in terms of intrinsic microscopic
parameters such as the cell-cell adhesion energy and cell elasticity but also
the cell individual dynamic properties, found to correlate well with
viscoelastic data at large concentrations (phi>0.5).
