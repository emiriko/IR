Given a sequence of complex square matrices, $a_n$, consider the sequence of
their partial products, defined by $p_n=p_{n-1}a_{n}$. What can be said about
the asymptotics as $n\to\infty$ of the sequence $f(p_n)$, where $f$ is a
continuous function? A special case of our most general result addresses this
question under the assumption that the matrices $a_n$ are an $l_1$ perturbation
of a sequence of matrices with bounded partial products. We apply our theory to
investigate the asymptotics of the approximants of continued fractions. In
particular, when a continued fraction is $l_1$ limit 1-periodic of elliptic or
loxodromic type, we show that its sequence of approximants tends to a circle in
$\hat{\mathbb{C}}$, or to a finite set of points lying on a circle. Our main
theorem on such continued fractions unifies the treatment of the loxodromic and
elliptic cases, which are convergent and divergent, respectively. When an
approximating sequence tends to a circle, we obtain statistical information
about the limiting distribution of the approximants. When the circle is the
real line, the points are shown to have a Cauchy distribution with parameters
given in terms of modifications of the original continued fraction. As an
example of the general theory, a detailed study of a $q$-continued fraction in
five complex variables is provided. The most general theorem in the paper holds
in the context of Banach algebras. The theory is also applied to $(r,s)$-matrix
continued fractions and recurrence sequences of Poincar\'e type and compared
with closely related literature.
