It will be discussed the statistics of the extreme values in time series
characterized by finite-term correlations with non-exponential decay.
Precisely, it will be considered the results of numerical analyses concerning
the return intervals of extreme values of the fluctuations of resistance and
defect-fraction displayed by a resistor with granular structure in a
nonequilibrium stationary state. The resistance and defect-fraction are
calculated as a function of time by Monte Carlo simulations using a resistor
network approach. It will be shown that when the auto-correlation function of
the fluctuations displays a non-exponential and non-power-law decay, the
distribution of the return intervals of extreme values is a stretched
exponential, with exponent largely independent of the threshold. Recently, a
stretched exponential distribution of the return intervals of extreme values
has been identified in long-term correlated time series by Bunde et al. (2003)
and Altmann and Kantz (2005). Thus, the present results show that the stretched
exponential distribution of the return intervals is not an exclusive feature of
long-term correlated time series.
