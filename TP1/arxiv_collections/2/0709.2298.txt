A recently introduced relativistic nuclear energy density functional,
constrained by features of low-energy QCD, is extended to describe the
structure of hypernuclei. The density-dependent mean field and the spin-orbit
potential of a $\Lambda$-hyperon in a nucleus, are consistently calculated
using the SU(3) extension of in-medium chiral perturbation theory. The leading
long-range $\Lambda N$ interaction arises from kaon-exchange and
$2\pi$-exchange with a $\Sigma$-hyperon in the intermediate state. Scalar and
vector mean fields, originating from in-medium changes of the quark
condensates, produce a sizeable {\em short-range} spin-orbit interaction. The
model, when applied to oxygen as a test case, provides a natural explanation
for the smallness of the effective $\Lambda$ spin-orbit potential: an almost
complete cancellation between the background contributions (scalar and vector)
and the long-range terms generated by two-pion exchange.
