The properties of perfect screw dislocations have been investigated for
several zinc-blende materials such as diamond, Si, $\beta$-SiC, Ge and GaAs, by
performing first principles calculations. For almost all elements, a core
configuration belonging to shuffle set planes is favored, in agreement with low
temperature experiments. Only for diamond, a glide configuration has the lowest
defect energy, thanks to an sp$^2$ hybridization in the core.
