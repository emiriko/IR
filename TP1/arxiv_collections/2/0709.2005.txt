We want to answer the question of whether the divergence in the effective
mass in metal-insulator transition (MIT) in 2DEG is in the same universality
class as percolation. We use a model to make Percolated state in 2D and then
calculate the effective mass in a super-cell and the Bloch Theorem. It is seen
that the effective mass, m*, scales as m*~(P-Pc)^a with a=1 and Pc being the
(classical) percolation threshold.
