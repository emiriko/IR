A generalization of quantum broadcasting protocol is presented. Here the goal
is to copy an unknown input state into two subsystems which partially overlap.
We show that the possibility of implementing these protocols strongly depends
upon the overlap among the subsystems. Conditions for approximated shared
broadcasting are analyzed.
