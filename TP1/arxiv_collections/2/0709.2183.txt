A cylindrical nanopore immersed in a non-additive hard sphere binary fluid is
studied by means of integral equation theories and Monte Carlo simulations. It
is found that at low and intermediate values of the bulk total number density
the more concentrated bulk species is preferentially absorbed by the pore, as
expected. However, further increments of the bulk number density lead to an
abrupt population inversion in the confined fluid and an entropy driven
prewetting transition at the outside wall of the pore. These phenomena are a
function of the pore size, the non-additivity parameter, the bulk number
density, and particles relative number fraction. We discuss our results in
relation to the phase separation in the bulk.
