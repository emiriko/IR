The space-time symmetry of noncommutative quantum field theories with a
deformed quantization is described by the twisted Poincar\'e algebra, while
that of standard commutative quantum field theories is described by the
Poincar\'e algebra. Based on the equivalence of the deformed theory with a
commutative field theory, the correspondence between the twisted Poincar\'e
symmetry of the deformed theory and the Poincar\'e symmetry of a commutative
theory is established. As a by-product, we obtain the conserved charge
associated with the twisted Poincar\'e transformation to make the twisted
Poincar\'e symmetry evident in the deformed theory. Our result implies that the
equivalence between the commutative theory and the deformed theory holds in a
deeper level, i.e., it holds not only in correlation functions but also in
(different types of) symmetries.
