We give an outlook on the future of coherence theory and many-body quantum
dynamics as experiments develop in the arena of ultra-cold atoms. Novel results
on quantum heating of center-of-mass temperature in evaporative cooling and
simulation methods for long-range interactions are obtained, using positive-P
phase-space techniques.
