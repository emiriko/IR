The Bogoliubov-deGennes equations are solved for a proximity model for
YBa_2Cu_3O_{7-\delta} in a magnetic field. The model explicitly includes the
effects of the one-dimensional CuO chains, whose influence on the vortex core
structure is studied. The rapid vortex core contraction as a function of field
which is seen experimentally at low magnetic fields is naturally explained by
the presence of the chains.
