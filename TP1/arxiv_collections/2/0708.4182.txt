A lattice Boltzmann model was proposed to simulate
electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD). The insulative vapor and the electrolyte
liquid droplet were simulated by the lattice Boltzmann method respectively, and
the linear property between cosine of contact angle and the electric field
force confirms the reliability of this model. In the simulation of electrolyte
flowing in a rough-wall channel under an external electric field, we found that
a narrow channel is more sensitive than a broad channel and the flux decreases
monotonously as the electric field increase, but may suddenly increase if the
electric field is strong enough.
