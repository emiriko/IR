We review theoretical results for the adhesion-induced phase behavior of
biomembranes. The focus is on models in which the membranes are represented as
discretized elastic sheets with embedded adhesion molecules. We present several
mechanism that lead to the formation of domains during adhesion, and discuss
the time-dependent evolution of domain patterns obtained in Monte-Carlo
simulations. The simulated pattern dynamics has striking similarities to the
pattern evolution observed during T cell adhesion.
