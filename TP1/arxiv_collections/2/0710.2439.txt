Ab initio computations within the density functional theory are reported for
the spin cross-over complex, [Fe(btz)$_{2}$(NCS)$_{2}$], where 3d$^6$ Fe$^{II}$
is characterized by High Spin (HS t$_{2g}^4$, e$_g^2$) and Low Spin (LS
t$_{2g}^6$, e$_g^0$) states. Results of infra red and Raman spectra for the
isolated molecule are complemented for the crystalline solid with a full
account of the electronic band structure properties: the density of states
assessing the crystal field effects and the chemical bonding assigning a
specific role to the Fe-N interaction within the coordination sphere of
Fe$^{II}$.
