Effect of terahertz radiation (3.6 THz, 81.5 mkm,15 mV) on some behavioral
patterns of intact mice has been investigated. In home cage mice demonstrated
avoidance of laser ray and enhanced replacement activity in free behavior.
Animals irradiated during 30 minutes manifested an increased level of anxiety,
which was evaluated in the plus maze test on the day following the radiation.
