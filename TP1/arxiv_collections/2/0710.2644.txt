Measurement of the top-Yukawa coupling is important to understand the fermion
mass generation mechanism and dynamics of electroweak symmetry breaking. We
discuss the top quark anomalous couplings which can be described by higher
dimensional operators. We investigate the process $e^-e^+ \to W^-W^+\nu\bar\nu
\to t \bar t \nu\bar\nu$ to study the contribution of the anomalous top-Higgs
coupling to the cross section. The effect of the dimension-six top-Higgs
interaction on the cross section can be a few hundred percent greater than the
SM prediction. Such a large effect can be measured at the International Linear
Collider.
