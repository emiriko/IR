The Klein-Gordon equation in the presence of a spatially one-dimensional
Hulth\'en potential is solved exactly and the scattering solutions are obtained
in terms of hypergeometric functions. The transmission coefficient is derived
by the matching conditions on the wavefunctions and the condition for the
existence of transmission resonances are investigated. It is shown how the
zero-reflection condition depends on the shape of the potential.
