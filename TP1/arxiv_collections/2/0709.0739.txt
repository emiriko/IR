The comments raised in Ref. [1] by Mishra et al aim at two papers contained
in Ref. [2]. We show that those comments on Ref. [2] pointed out by Mishra et
al in Ref.[1] are not relevant and the concept used in Ref.[2] is consistent
and in compliance with the classical approximation of the transport
coefficients [3]. We would also like to note that most of the comments in Ref.
[1] were meant for light quarks, but are not even appropriate for heavy quarks.
