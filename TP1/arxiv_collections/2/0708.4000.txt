The exactly solvable scalar-tensor potential of the four-component Dirac
equation has been obtained by the Darboux transformation method. The
constructed potential has been interpreted in terms of nucleon-nucleon and
Schwinger interactions of neutral particles with lattice sites during their
channeling Hamiltonians of a Schwinger type is obtained by means of the Darboux
transformation chain. The analitic structure of the Lyapunov function of
periodic continuation for each of the Hamiltonians of the family is considered.
