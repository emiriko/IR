In the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) telescope [1], [2], the noise temperature
of the first LNA must be reduced in order to reduce the necessary active area
and the total system costs. Cooling the LNA locally would significantly
decrease the noise figure but also the necessary power since not the whole
system has to be cooled. For optimal thermal isolation, an LNA chip which only
needs 6 bondwires has been chosen, 4 Ground and 2 signal wires. Biasing occurs
on-chip. If the bondwires are 1.5mm long, the total heat conduction of the 6
bondwires is 31 mW, which is added to the power consumption of the LNA (30 mW).
With a power of 61 mW to cool, the Peltier element can achieve a -T of 60K.
With this system, a noise reduction of 30% has been measured with 0.5W of
electrical power. For 15% noise reduction, only 35mW of electrical power was
needed.
