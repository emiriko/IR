A network of quantum-mechanical systems showing long lived phase coherence of
its quantum states could be used for processing quantum information. As with
classical information processing, a quantum processor requires information bits
(qubits) that can be independently addressed and read out, long-term memory
elements to store arbitrary quantum states, and the ability to transfer quantum
information through a coherent communication bus accessible to a large number
of qubits. Superconducting qubits made with scalable microfabrication
techniques are a promising candidate for the realization of a large scale
quantum information processor. Although these systems have successfully passed
tests of coherent coupling for up to four qubits, communication of individual
quantum states between qubits via a quantum bus has not yet been demonstrated.
Here, we perform an experiment demonstrating the ability to coherently transfer
quantum states between two superconducting Josephson phase qubits through a
rudimentary quantum bus formed by a single, on chip, superconducting
transmission line resonant cavity of length 7 mm. After preparing an initial
quantum state with the first qubit, this quantum information is transferred and
stored as a nonclassical photon state of the resonant cavity, then retrieved at
a later time by the second qubit connected to the opposite end of the cavity.
Beyond simple communication, these results suggest that a high quality factor
superconducting cavity could also function as a long term memory element. The
basic architecture presented here is scalable, offering the possibility for the
coherent communication between a large number of superconducting qubits.
