We present a status report on a new high statistics study of the high
temperature transition in full QCD at zero chemical potential. Our simulations
use both improved asqtad and p4 staggered quarks on lattices with a temporal
extent N_t = 8 and light quark masses approximately one tenth the strange quark
mass. In this report we describe the setup of our calculations and present a
preliminary analysis of a variety of sources of systematic error and ambiguity
in the determination of the crossover temperature. We propose to present our
final analysis with double the current statistics. These calculations were
carried out on the IBM BlueGene/L supercomputer at Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory.
