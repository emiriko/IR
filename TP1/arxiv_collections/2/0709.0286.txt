A personal selection is made of the highlights of the COSY-11 physics program
undertaken at the COoler SYnchrotron of the Forschungszentrum Juelich. This has
been particularly rich in the field of strange and non-strange meson production
in proton-proton and proton-deuteron collisions. The results are considered in
relation to experiments carried out at other facilities and with respect to
their impact on theory.
