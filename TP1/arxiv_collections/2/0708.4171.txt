We study the heat current J in a classical one-dimensional disordered chain
with on-site pinning and with ends connected to stochastic thermal reservoirs
at different temperatures. In the absence of anharmonicity all modes are
localized and there is a gap in the spectrum. Consequently J decays
exponentially with system size N. Using simulations we find that even a small
amount of anharmonicity leads to a J~1/N dependence, implying diffusive
transport of energy.
