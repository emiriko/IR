The internal structure of hadrons is important for a variety of topics,
including the hadron form factors, proton spin and spin asymmetry in polarized
proton scattering.
  For a systematic study generalized parton distributions (GPDs) encode
important information on hadron structure in the entire impact parameter space.
We report on a computation of nucleon GPDs based on simulations with two
dynamical non-perturbatively improved Wilson quarks with pion masses down to
350MeV. We present results for the total angular momentum of quarks with chiral
extrapolation based on covariant baryon chiral perturbation theory.
