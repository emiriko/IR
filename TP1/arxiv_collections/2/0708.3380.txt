Relativistic models can be successfully applied to the description of compact
star properties in nuclear astrophysics as well as to nuclear matter and finite
nuclei properties, these studies taking place at low and moderate temperatures.
Nevertheless, all results are model dependent and so far it is unclear whether
some of them should be discarded. Moreover, in the regime of hot hadronic
matter very few calculations exist using these relativistic models, in
particular when applied to particle yields in heavy ion collisions.
  In the present work we comment on the known constraints that can help the
selection of adequate models in this regime and investigate the main
differences that arise when the particle production during a Au+Au collision at
RHIC is calculated with different models.
