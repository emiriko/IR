The continuous progress in fabricating low-dimensional systems with large
spin-orbit couplings has reached a point in which nowadays materials may
display spin-orbit splitting energies ranging from a few to hundreds of meV.
This situation calls for a better understanding of the interplay between the
spin-orbit coupling and other interactions ubiquitously present in solids, in
particular when the spin-orbit splitting is comparable in magnitude with
characteristic energy scales such as the Fermi energy and the phonon frequency.
  In this article, the two-dimensional Fr\"ohlich electron-phonon problem is
reformulated by introducing the coupling to a spin-orbit Rashba potential,
allowing for a description of the spin-orbit effects on the electron-phonon
interaction. The ground state of the resulting Fr\"ohlich-Rashba polaron is
studied in the weak and strong coupling limits of the electron-phonon
interaction for arbitrary values of the spin-orbit splitting. The weak coupling
case is studied within the Rayleigh-Schr\"odinger perturbation theory, while
the strong-coupling electron-phonon regime is investigated by means of
variational polaron wave functions in the adiabatic limit. It is found that,
for both weak and strong coupling polarons, the ground state energy is
systematically lowered by the spin-orbit interaction, indicating that the
polaronic character is strengthened by the Rashba coupling. It is also shown
that, consistently with the lowering of the ground state, the polaron effective
mass is enhanced compared to the zero spin-orbit limit. Finally, it is argued
that the crossover between weakly and strongly coupled polarons can be shifted
by the spin-orbit interaction.
