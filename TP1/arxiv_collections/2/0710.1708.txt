In this letter, I have proposed a model of variable modified Chaplygin gas
and shown its role in accelerating phase of the universe. I have shown that the
equation of state of this model is valid from the radiation era to quiessence
model. The graphical representations of statefinder parameters characterize
different phase of evolution of the universe. All results presented in the
letter concerns the case $k=0$.
