We show theoretically that the second layer of 3He adsorbed on graphite and
solidified at 4/7 of the first-layer density is close to the fluid-solid
boundary with substantial density fluctuations on the third layer. The solid
shows a translational symmetry breaking as in charge-ordered insulators of
electronic systems. We construct a minimal model beyond the multiple-exchange
Heisenberg model. An unexpectedly large magnetic field required for the
measured saturation of magnetization is well explained by the density
fluctuations. The emergence of quantum spin liquid is understood from the same
mechanism as in the Hubbard model and in \kappa-(ET)_2Cu_2(CN)_3 near the Mott
transitions.
