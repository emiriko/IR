Dilute frozen solutions of the single molecule magnet Ni$_4$ (S=4) have been
studied using high frequency D-band (130 GHz) EPR. Despite the random
orientation of the molecules, well defined EPR absorption peaks are observed,
due to the strong variation of the splittings between the different spin-states
on magnetic field. Temperature dependent studies above 4 K and comparison with
simulations enable identification of the spin transitions and determination of
the Hamiltonian parameters. The latter are found to be close to those of Ni$_4$
single crystals. No echo was detected from Ni$_4$ in pulsed experiments, which
sets an upper bound of about 50 ns on the spin coherence time.
