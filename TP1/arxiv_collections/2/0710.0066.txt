We study a variant of the Schwarz-preconditioned HMC algorithm. In contrast
to the original proposal of L\"uscher, we apply the domain decomposition in one
lattice direction only. This is sufficient to reduce the condition number of
the fermion matrix restricted to the domains compared with the full fermion
matrix. For the same linear extension of the domain, less links reside on the
boundaries of the domains. Therefore it becomes e.g. practical to iterate the
decomposition. We perform numerical tests for two degenerate flavours of Wilson
fermions. The standard Wilson gauge action at $\beta=5.6$ is used. The
performance of our implementation is compared with other recent studies using
various types of preconditioning.
