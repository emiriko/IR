Thermally induced particle flow in a charged colloidal suspension is studied
in a fluid-mechanical approach. The force density acting on the charged
boundary layer is derived in detail. From Stokes' equation with no-slip
boundary conditions at the particle surface, we obtain the particle drift
velocity and the thermophoretic transport coefficients. The results are
discussed in view of previous work and available experimental data.
