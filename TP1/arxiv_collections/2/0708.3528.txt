Spin pumping in nonmagnetic/ferromagnetic metal multilayers is studied both
theoretically and experimentally. We show that the line widths of the
ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) spectrum depend on the thickness of the
ferromagnetic metal layers, which must not be in resonance with the oscillating
magnetic field. We also show that the penetration depths of the transverse spin
current in ferromagnetic metals can be determined by analyzing the line widths
of their FMR spectra. The obtained penetration depths in NiFe, CoFe and CoFeB
were 3.7 [nm], 2.5 [nm] and 12.0 [nm], respectively.
