We extend the projective covariant bookmaker's bets model to the forecasting
gamblers case. The probability of correctness of forecasts shifts probabilities
of branching. The formula for the shift of probabilities leads to the velocity
addition rule of the special theory of relativity. In the absence of
information about bookmaker's wagers the stochastic logarithmic rates
completely determines the optimal stakes of forecast gambler.
