The radio-frequency spectra of ultracold Fermi atoms are calculated by
including final-state interactions affecting the excited level of the
transition, and compared with the experimental data. A competition is revealed
between pairing-gap effects which tend to push the oscillator strength toward
high frequencies away from threshold, and final-state effects which tend
instead to pull the oscillator strength toward threshold. As a result of this
competition, the position of the peak of the spectra cannot be simply related
to the value of the pairing gap, whose extraction thus requires support from
theoretical calculations.
