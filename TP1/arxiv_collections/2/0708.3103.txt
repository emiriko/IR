Cichlid fishes are one of the best model system for the study of evolution of
the species. Inspired by them, in this paper we simulated the splitting of a
single species into two separate ones via random mutations, with both
populations living together in sympatry, sharing the same habitat. We study the
ecological, mating and genetic conditions needed to reproduce the
polychromatism and polymorphism of three species of the Midas Cichlid species
complex. Our results show two scenarios for the A. Citrinellus speciation
process, one with and the other without disruptive natural selection. In the
first scenario, the ecological and genetic conditions are sufficient to create
two new species, while in the second the mating and genetic conditions must be
synchronized in order to control the velocity of genetic drift.
