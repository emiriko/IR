We consider renormalizable SO(10) Yukawa interactions and put the three
fermionic 16-plets into the 3-dimensional irreducible A_4 representation.
Scanning the possible A_4 representation assignments to the scalars, we find a
unique case which allows to accommodate the down-quark and charged-lepton
masses. Assuming type II seesaw dominance, we obtain a viable scenario with the
Zee-Wolfenstein neutrino mass matrix, i.e., the Majorana mass matrix with a
vanishing diagonal. Contributions from the charged-lepton mass matrix resolve
the well-known problems with lepton mixing arising from the vanishing diagonal.
In our scenario, fermion masses and mixings are well reproduced for both normal
and inverted neutrino mass spectra, and b-tau Yukawa unification and definite
predictions for the effective mass in neutrinoless double-beta decay are
obtained.
