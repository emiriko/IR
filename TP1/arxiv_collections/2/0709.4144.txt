We report on the single crystal growth of the ferromagnetic Kondo lattice
system CeRuPO using a Sn flux method. Magnetic susceptibility and electrical
resistivity measurements indicate strong anisotropy of this structurally
layered compound. They evidence that the magnetic moments order
ferromagnetically along the c-direction of the tetragonal unit cell, whereas
the crystal electric field (CEF) anisotropy favors the ab-plane. Therefore,
CeRuPO presents the unusual case within rare earth systems, where the
anisotropy of the interionic exchange interaction overcomes the single ion
anisotropy due to the CEF interaction.
