Hadron wave functions and form factors can be extracted using four-point
correlators. Stochastic techniques are used to estimate the all to all
propagators, which are required for the exact calculation of four-point
functions. We apply the so called one-end trick to evaluate meson four-point
functions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the technique in the case of the
pion and the $\rho$-meson where we extract their charge distribution, as well
as the form factors.
