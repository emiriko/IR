In many physical systems it is expected that environmental decoherence will
exhibit an asymmetry between dephasing and relaxation that may result in qubits
experiencing discrete phase errors more frequently than discrete bit errors. In
the presence of such an error asymmetry, an appropriately asymmetric quantum
code - that is, a code that can correct more phase errors than bit errors -
will be more efficient than a traditional, symmetric quantum code. Here we
construct fault tolerant circuits to convert between an asymmetric subsystem
code and a symmetric subsystem code. We show that, for a moderate error
asymmetry, the failure rate of a logical circuit can be reduced by using a
combined symmetric asymmetric system and that doing so does not preclude
universality.
