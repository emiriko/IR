In this work it is shown how to obtain, in a simple way, localized (non-
diffractive) subluminal pulses as exact analytic solutions to the wave
equations. These new ideal subluminal solutions, which propagate without
distortion in any homogeneous linear media, are herein obtained for arbitrarily
chosen frequencies and bandwidths, avoiding in particular any recourse to the
non-causal components so frequently plaguing the previously known localized
waves. The new solutions are suitable superpositions of --zeroth-order, in
general-- Bessel beams, which can be performed either by integrating with
respect to (w.r.t.) the angular frequency, or by integrating w.r.t. the
longitudinal wavenumber: Both methods are expounded in this paper. The first
one appears to be powerful enough; we study the second method as well, however,
since it allows dealing even with the limiting case of zero-speed solutions
(and furnishes a new way, in terms of continuous spectra, for obtaining the
so-called "Frozen Waves", so promising also from the point of view of
applications). We briefly treat the case, moreover, of non-axially symmetric
solutions, in terms of higher order Bessel beams. At last, particular attention
is paid to the role of Special Relativity, and to the fact that the localized
waves are expected to be transformed one into the other by suitable Lorentz
Transformations. The analogous pulses with intrinsic finite energy, or merely
truncated, will be constructed in another paper. In this work we fix our
attention especially on electromagnetism and optics: but results of the present
kind are valid whenever an essential role is played by a wave-equation (like in
acoustics, seismology, geophysics, gravitation, elementary particle physics,
etc.)
