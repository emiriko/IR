The Lagrangian constraint analysis of the selfdual massive spin 2 theory in a
2+1 dimensional flat space-time and its extension to a curved one, are
performed. Demanding consistence of degrees of freedom in the model with
gravitational interaction, gives rise to physical restrictions on non minimal
coupling terms and background. Finally, a constant curvature scenario is
explored, showing the existence of forbidden mass values. Causality in these
spaces is discussed. Aspects related with the construction of the reduced
action and the one-particle exchange amplitude, are noted.
