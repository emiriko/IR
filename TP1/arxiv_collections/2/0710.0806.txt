The problem of fermions in the presence of a pseudoscalar plus a mixing of
vector and scalar potentials which have equal or opposite signs is
investigated. We explore all the possible signs of the potentials and discuss
their bound-state solutions for fermions and antifermions. The cases of mixed
vector and scalar P\"{o}schl-Teller-like and pseudoscalar kink-like potentials,
already analyzed in previous works, are obtained as particular cases.
