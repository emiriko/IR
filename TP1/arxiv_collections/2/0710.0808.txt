This note will use Hitchin's generalized geometry and a model of axionic
gravity developed by Warren Siegel in the mid-nineties to show that the
construction of Lagrangians based on the inner product arising from the pairing
of a vector and its dual can lead naturally to the low-energy Lagrangian of the
bosonic string.
