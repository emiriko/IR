We report on simulations of two-dimensional turbulence in the inverse energy
cascade regime. Focusing on the statistics of Lagrangian tracer particles,
scaling behavior of the probability density functions of velocity fluctuations
is investigated. The results are compared to the three-dimensional case. In
particular an analysis in terms of compensated cumulants reveals the transition
from a strong non-Gaussian behavior with large tails to Gaussianity. The
reported computation of correlation functions for the acceleration components
sheds light on the underlying dynamics of the tracer particles.
