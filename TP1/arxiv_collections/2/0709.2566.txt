We report strong variations in the Raman spectra for different single-layer
graphene samples obtained by micromechanical cleavage, which reveals the
presence of excess charges, even in the absence of intentional doping. Doping
concentrations up to ~10^13 cm-2 are estimated from the G peak shift and width,
and the variation of both position and relative intensity of the second order
2D peak. Asymmetric G peaks indicate charge inhomogeneity on the scale of less
than 1 micron.
