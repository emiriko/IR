The problem addressed in this article is the bias to income and expenditure
elasticities estimated on pseudo-panel data caused by measurement error and
unobserved heterogeneity. We gauge empirically these biases by comparing
cross-sectional, pseudo-panel and true panel data from both Polish and American
expenditure surveys. Our results suggest that unobserved heterogeneity imparts
a downward bias to cross-section estimates of income elasticities of at-home
food expenditures and an upward bias to estimates of income elasticities of
away-from-home food expenditures. "Within" and first-difference estimators
suffer less bias, but only if the effects of measurement error are accounted
for with instrumental variables.
