In a previous paper, we derived a recursive formula determining the weight
distributions of the [n=(q^m-1)/(q-1)] Hamming code H(m,q), when (m,q-1)=1.
Here q is a prime power. We note here that the formula actually holds for any
positive integer m and any prime power q, without the restriction (m, q-1)=1.
