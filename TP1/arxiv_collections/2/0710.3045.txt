We theoretically study Fano resonance in a two-level quantum dot side-coupled
to two leads, which are connected by a direct channel. The resonance lineshape
is found to be deformed, from the conventional Fano form, by interlevel Coulomb
interaction and interlevel interference. We derive the connection between the
lineshape deformation and the interaction-induced nonmonotonicity of level
occupation, which may be useful for experimental study. The dependence of the
lineshape on the transmission of the direct channel and on the dot-lead
coupling matrix elements is discussed.
