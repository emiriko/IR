We consider a hidden sector with a vectorlike confining gauge theory like QCD
with $N_{h,c}$ colors and $N_{h,f}$ light quarks ${\cal Q}_h$ in the hidden
sector. Then a scale $\Lambda_H$ would be generated by dimensional
transmutation, and chiral symmetry breaking occurs in the hidden sector. This
scale $\Lambda_H$ can play a role of the SM Higgs mass parameter, triggering
electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB). Furthermore the lightest mesons in the
hidden sector is stable by flavor conservation of the hidden sector strong
interaction, and could be a good cold dark matter (CDM). We study collider
phenomenology, and relic density and direct detection rates of the CDM of this
model.
