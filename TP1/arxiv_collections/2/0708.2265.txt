This paper deals with the solution of unified fractional reaction-diffusion
systems. The results are obtained in compact and elegant forms in terms of
Mittag-Leffler functions and generalized Mittag-Leffler functions, which are
suitable for numerical computation. On account of the most general character of
the derived results, numerous results on fractional reaction, fractional
diffusion, and fractional reaction-diffusion problems scattered in the
literature, including the recently derived results by the authors for
reaction-diffusion models, follow as special cases.
