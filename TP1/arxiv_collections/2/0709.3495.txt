We examine one-dimensional quantum scattering of a Dirac particle off
relativistic potential barriers. With proper considerations of Dirac sea,
existence of anomalous tunneling at zero incident-energy is revealed for a
particular type of relativistic potential having same magnitudes and opposite
signs for scalar and vector components. It is also shown that this leads to an
exotic short range limit of the potentials.
