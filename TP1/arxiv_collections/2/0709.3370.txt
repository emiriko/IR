The electromagnetic form factors provide important insight into the internal
structure of the nucleon and continue to be of major interest for experiment
and phenomenology. For an intermediate range of momenta the form factors can be
calculated on the lattice. However, the reliability of the results is limited
by systematic errors mostly due to the required extrapolation to physical quark
masses. Chiral effective field theories predict a rather strong quark mass
dependence in a range which was yet inaccessible for lattice simulations. We
give an update on recent results from the QCDSF collaboration using gauge
configurations with dynamical Nf=2, non-perturbatively O(a)-improved Wilson
fermions at pion masses as low as 350 MeV.
