The classical gravitational theory of a scalar field with a gradient coupling
to the Ricci tensor is examined. This is a scalar-vector-tensor gravitational
theory, but in the case that the coupling is weak and the scalar evolves like a
quintessence field on cosmological time scales, the field equations within the
solar system are similar to a vector-tensor theory predicting
tightly-constrained preferred-frame effects. In the early universe, it is shown
that strong coupling effects can damp the evolution of the scalar field rolling
down a potential to help drive an inflationary epoch. In the absence of a
potential, the strong coupling effects drive a coasting expansion epoch which
ultimately terminates in a sudden singularity.
