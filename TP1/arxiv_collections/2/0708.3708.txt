We extend the bicharacter construction of quantum vertex algebras first
proposed by Borcherds to the case of super Hopf algebras. We give a bicharacter
description of the charged free fermion super vertex algebra, which allows us
to construct different quantizations of it in the sense of $H_D$-quantum vertex
algebras, or specializations to Etingof-Kazhdan quantum vertex algebras. We
give formulas for the analytic continuation of product of fields, the operator
product expansion and the normal ordered product in terms of the
super-bicharacters.
