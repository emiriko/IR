We study and simulate N=2 supersymmetric Wess-Zumino models in one and two
dimensions. For any choice of the lattice derivative, the theories can be made
manifestly supersymmetric by adding appropriate improvement terms corresponding
to discretizations of surface integrals. In particular, we check that fermionic
and bosonic masses coincide and the unbroken Ward identities are fulfilled to
high accuracy. Equally good results for the effective masses can be obtained in
a model with the SLAC derivative (even without improvement terms). In two
dimensions we introduce a non-standard Wilson term in such a way that the
discretization errors of the kinetic terms are only of order a squared. Masses
extracted from the corresponding manifestly supersymmetric model prove to
approach their continuum values much quicker than those from a model containing
the standard Wilson term. Again, a comparable enhancement can be achieved in a
theory using the SLAC derivative.
