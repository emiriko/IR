The setup of two different small scale teststands for measurements regarding
an electron Cherenkov detector as part of the ILC polarimeters is presented.
Component measurements already carried out are analyzed and others, foreseen
for the near future, are discussed. The larger one of the two teststands
features the old Cherenkov detector of the SLD experiment, which will be used
as a reference for a number of crucial measurements. Especially, the
requirements for the non-linearity of the read-out chain are studied in greater
detail and methods for its precise measurement before and during operation are
being developed accordingly.
