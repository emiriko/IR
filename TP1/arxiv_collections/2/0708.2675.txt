To understand the whole set of positive and null data on the Theta+(1530) -
production, we suggest the hypothesis that multiquark hadrons are mainly
generated from many-quark states, which emerge either as short-term hadron
fluctuations, or as hadron remnants in hard processes. This approach allows us
to describe both non-observation of the Theta+ in current null experiments and
peculiar features of its production in positive experiments. Further, we are
able to propose new experiments that might be decisive for the problem of the
Theta+ existence. Studies of properties and distributions of the Theta+ in such
experiments can give important information on the structure of both
conventional and multiquark hadrons. It would provide better insight into how
QCD works.
