The ATLAS and CMS experiments will take first data soon. I consider here the
prospects for new physics (excluding SUSY) with a few inverse fb of data. This
means processes with signal cross sections of a few 100 fb or less, with clear
and fairly simple signatures - precision comparison of data to Standard Model
tails will take longer, needing more luminosity and very good understanding of
detector calibrations, resolutions and trigger efficiencies. The approach I
take here is signature rather than model based, but examples of models will be
given.
