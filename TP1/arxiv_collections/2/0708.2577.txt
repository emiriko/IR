The objective of this paper is to describe a development of an innovative
approach to enable students studying science, technology, engineering, and
mathematics (STEM) to apply the concepts learned in physics and mathematics to
engineering problem-solving challenges. Our goal is to facilitate students
transfer of knowledge from theory to engineering applications, thereby
increasing student academic performance, retention, persistence, and
graduation. To achieve the goal we are creating a virtual community of students
and faculty as a vehicle for promoting the transfer of knowledge using
e-learning and e-teaching mechanisms.
