In this article we establish an exponential lower bound on the Graver
complexity of integer programs. This provides new type of evidence supporting
the presumable intractability of integer programming. Specifically, we show
that the Graver complexity of the incidence matrix of the complete bipartite
graph $K_{3,m}$ satisfies $g(m)=\Omega(2^m)$, with $g(m)\geq 17\cdot 2^{m-3}-7$
for every $m>3$ .
