The synthesis and characterization of PVA (Poly Vinyl Acetate) doped bulk
MgB2 superconductor is reported here. PVA is used as a Carbon source. PVA
doping effects made two distinguishable contributions: first enhancement of Jc
field performance and second an increase in Hc2 value, both because of carbon
incorporation into MgB2 crystal lattice. The susceptibility measurement reveals
that Tc decreased from 37 to 36 K. Lattice parameter a decreased from 3.085 A
to 3.081 A due to the partial substitution of Carbon at Boron site. PVA doped
sample exhibited the Jc values greater than 10^5 A/cm2 at 5 & 10 K at low
fields; which is almost 3 times higher than the pure one, while at high fields
the Jc is increased by an order of magnitude in comparison to pure MgB2. From
R(T)H measurements we found higher Tc values under magnetic field for doped
sample; indicating an increase in Hc2. Also the magnetization measurements
exhibited a significant enhancement in Hirr value. The improved performance of
PVA doped MgB2 can be attributed to the substitution of carbon at boron site in
parent MgB2 and the resulting impact on the carrier density and impurity
scattering. The improved flux pinning behavior could easily be seen from
reduced flux pinning force plots.
