We present preliminary results of an excited state spectroscopy calculation
in the 2-d lattice Gross-Neveu model. We address the construction of suitable
interpolators for the variational method and their overlap with excitations. We
comment on the role of the eigenvectors as a tool for matching scattering
states on lattices with different volumes.
