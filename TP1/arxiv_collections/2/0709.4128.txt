We study full counting statistics of coherent electron transport through
multi-terminal interacting quantum-dots under a finite magnetic field.
Microscopic reversibility leads to the symmetry of the cumulant generating
function, which generalizes the fluctuation theorem in the context of quantum
transport. Using this symmetry, we derive the Onsager-Casimir relation in the
linear transport regime and universal relations among nonlinear transport
coefficients.
