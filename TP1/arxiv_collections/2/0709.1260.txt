In the course of closing supersymmetry on parallel M2 branes up to a gauge
transformation, following the suggestion in hep-th/0611108 of incorporating a
gauge field which only has topological degrees of freedom, we are led to assume
a certain algebraic structure for the low energy theory supposedly living on
parallel M2 branes.
