Babar Collaboration announced two new excited charmed baryons $\Xi_c(3055)^+$
and $\Xi_c(3123)^+$. We study their strong decays assuming they are D-wave
states. Some assignments are excluded by comparing our numerical results with
the experimental values of the total widths of $\Xi_c(3055)^+$ and
$\Xi_c(3123)^+$. We also suggest some possible decay modes, which will be
helpful to determine the properties of $\Xi_c(3055)^+$ and $\Xi_c(3123)^+$.
