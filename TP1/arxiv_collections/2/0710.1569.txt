The longitudinal double spin asymmetry A_LL in the reaction pp --> pi X has
been measured at RHIC with extremely interesting consequences. If the gluon
polarization in a proton were as big as needed to resolve the famous "spin
crisis" then A_LL would be large and positive. Latest RHIC results indicate
that A_LL is small and disfavour large positive values of the gluon
polarization. We examine whether the soft mechanisms (Collins, Sivers,
Boer-Mulders), essential for generating transverse single spin asymmetries,
have any significant influence on A_LL, and whether they could alter the
conclusion that the gluon polarization is necessarily small. It turns out that
the contribution from these effects is essentially negligible.
