Long-range interactions in finite density QCD necessitate a non-perturbative
approach in order to reliably map out the key features and spectrum of the QCD
phase diagram. However, the complex nature of the fermion determinant in this
sector prohibits the use of established Monte Carlo techniques that utilize
importance sampling. Whilst significant progress has been made in the low
density, high temperature region, this remains a considerable challenge at mid
to high density. At large chemical potential, QCD can be approximated using
high density effective theory which is free from the sign problem at leading
order. We investigate the implementation of this theory on the lattice in
conjunction with existing re-weighting techniques.
