Laughlin quasiparticles are the elementary excitations of a highly-correlated
fractional quantum Hall electron fluid. They have fractional charge and obey
fractional statistics. The quasiparticles can propagate quantum-coherently in
chiral edge channels, and constructively or destructively interfere. Unlike
electrons, the interference condition for Laughlin quasiparticles has a
non-vanishing statistical contribution that can be observed experimentally. Two
kinds of interferometer devices have been realized. In the primary-filling
interferometer, the entire device has filling 1/3, and the e/3 edge channel
quasiparticles encircle identical e/3 island quasiparticles. Here the flux
period is h/e, same as for electrons, but the back-gate charge period is e/3.
In the second kind of interferometer, a lower density edge channel at filling
1/3 forms around a higher density island at filling 2/5, so that e/3 edge
quasiparticles encircle e/5 island quasiparticles. Here we observe
superperiodic oscillations with 5h/e flux and 2e charge periods, both
corresponding to excitation of ten island quasiparticles. These periods can be
understood as imposed by the anyonic braiding statistics of Laughlin
quasiparticles.
