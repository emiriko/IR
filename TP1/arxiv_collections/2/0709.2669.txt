The stochastic motion of a two-dimensional vesicle in linear shear flow is
studied at finite temperature. In the limit of small deformations from a
circle, Langevin-type equations of motion are derived, which are highly
nonlinear due to the constraint of constant perimeter length. These equations
are solved in the low temperature limit and using a mean field approach, in
which the length constraint is satisfied only on average. The constraint
imposes non-trivial correlations between the lowest deformation modes at low
temperature. We also simulate a vesicle in a hydrodynamic solvent by using the
multi-particle collision dynamics technique, both in the quasi-circular regime
and for larger deformations, and compare the stationary deformation correlation
functions and the time autocorrelation functions with theoretical predictions.
Good agreement between theory and simulations is obtained.
