We consider the effect of spin-orbit coupling on the energy levels of a
single-channel Josephson junction below the superconducting gap. We investigate
quantitatively the level splitting arising from the combined effect of
spin-orbit coupling and the time-reversal symmetry breaking by the phase
difference between the superconductors. Using the scattering matrix approach we
establish a simple connection between the quantum mechanical time delay matrix
and the effective Hamiltonian for the level splitting. As an application we
calculate the distribution of level splittings for an ensemble of chaotic
Josephson junctions. The distribution falls off as a power law for large
splittings, unlike the exponentially decaying splitting distribution given by
the Wigner surmise -- which applies for normal chaotic quantum dots with
spin-orbit coupling in the case that the time-reversal symmetry breaking is due
to a magnetic field.
