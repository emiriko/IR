In this talk, results from the gravitational sector of the Standard-Model
Extension (SME) are discussed. The weak-field phenomenology of the resulting
modified gravitational field equations is explored. The application of the
results to a variety of modern gravity experiments, including lunar laser
ranging, Gravity Probe B, binary pulsars, and Earth-laboratory tests, shows
promising sensitivity to gravitational coefficients for Lorentz violation in
the SME.
