Chiral constituent quark model with configuration mixing (\chiCQM_{{\rm
config}}) is known to provide a satisfactory explanation of the ``proton spin
problem'' and related issues. In order to enlarge the scope of \chiCQM_{{\rm
config}}, we have attempted to phenomenologically incorporate x-dependence in
the quark distribution functions. In particular, apart from calculating valence
and sea quark distributions q_{{\rm val}}(x) and \bar q(x), we have carried out
a detailed analysis to estimate the sea quark asymmetries \bar d(x)-\bar u(x),
\bar d(x)/\bar u(x) and \frac{\bar d(x)-\bar u(x)}{u(x)-d(x)} as well as spin
independent structure functions F_2^p(x)-F_2^n(x) and $F_2^n(x)/F_2^p(x)$ as
functions of $x$. We are able to achieve a satisfactory fit for all the above
mentioned quantities simultaneously. The inclusion of effects due to
configuration mixing have also been examined in the case F_2^p(x)-F_2^n(x) and
F_2^n(x)/F_2^p(x) where the valence quark distributions dominate and it is
found that it leads to considerable improvement in the results. Further, the
valence quark structure has also be tested by extrapolating the predictions of
our model in the limit x \to 1 where data is not available.
