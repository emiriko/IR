The quantum adiabatic theorem incorporating the Berry phase phenomenon can be
characterized as a factorization of the time evolution operator into a
path-dependent geometric factor, a usual dynamical factor and a non-adiabatic
factor that approaches the identity in the adiabatic limit. We study a case
where all these three factors can be constructed explicitly and where the
instantaneous Hamiltonian has infinitely degenerate energy eigenstates
associated with magnetic translation symmetry. Significance of the
non-adiabatic factor in terms of transition probabilities is discussed.
