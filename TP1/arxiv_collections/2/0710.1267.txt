We evaluate the cross section for anti-p p -> l+ l- pi0 in the forward
direction and for large lepton pair invariant mass. In this kinematical region,
the leading-twist amplitude factorises into a short-distance matrix element,
long-distance dominated antiproton Distribution Amplitudes and proton to pion
Transition Distribution Amplitudes (TDA). Using a modelling inspired from the
chiral limit for these TDAs, we obtain a first estimate of this cross section,
thus demonstrating that this process can be measured at GSI-FAIR.
