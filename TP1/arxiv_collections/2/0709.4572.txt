The measurement of heavy quark cross-sections provides important tests of the
QCD theory. This paper reviews recent measurements of single b-quark and
correlated b-quark cross-sections at CDF. Two new measurements of the single
b-quark production at CDF agree with the first result from CDF Run II. This
clarifies the experimental situation and confirms the recent agreement of
theoretical prediction with data. A new measurement of the correlated
$b\bar{b}$ cross-section with dimuon events at CDF is presented. It agrees with
theory and it does not confirm the anomalously large $b\bar{b}$ cross-section
seen in Run I by CDF and D${\not {\rm O}}$ in dimuon events.
