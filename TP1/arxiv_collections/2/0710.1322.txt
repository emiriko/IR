Experimentally the charmonium hyperfine splitting is
$M_{J/\psi}-M_{\eta_c}=117$ MeV and current lattice results are generally below
this value. The difference could be due to the effects of the disconnected
flavor singlet diagrams which have not been included in these calculations.
Previous attempts to determine the disconnected flavor singlet corrections have
led just to rough estimates in the range of $\pm 20$ MeV. We present
preliminary results for these corrections calculated on fine ($a\approx 0.09$
fm) Asqtad 2+1 flavor lattices provided by the MILC Collaboration.
