Thermal leptogenesis, that can be viewed as a consequence of the seesaw
model, is a very natural mechanism to explain the matter anti-matter asymmetry
of the Universe. Recently, lepton flavours have been included in the Boltzmann
equations, modifying significantly the evaluation of the efficiency of
leptogenesis to explain the observed baryon asymmetry.
