We describe the effect of vibration on a confined volume of fluid which is
density stratified due to its compressibility. We show that internal
gravity-acoustic waves can be parametrically destabilized by the vibration. The
resulting instability is similar to the classic Faraday instability of surface
waves, albeit modified by the compressible nature of the fluid. It may be
possible to observe experimentally near a gas-liquid critical point.
