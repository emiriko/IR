We study the properties of configurations from which P-vortices on one hand
or Abelian monopoles on the other hand have been removed. We find that the zero
modes and the band of non-zero modes close to zero disappear from the spectrum
of the overlap Dirac operator, confirming the absence of topological charge and
quark condensate. The different behavior of the modified ensembles under
smearing compared to the unmodified Monte Carlo ensemble corroborates these
findings. The gluonic topological susceptibility rapidly approaches zero in
accordance with Q_{index}=0. The remaining (ultraviolet) monopoles without
vortices and -- to a less extent -- the remaining vortices without monopoles
are unstable under smearing whereas smearing of the unmodified Monte Carlo
ensemble effects the monopoles and vortices only by smoothing, reducing the
density only slightly.
