We correct an error in our paper Phys. Rev. B 72, 104404 (2005)
[cond-mat/0502215]. We show that a particular fermion bilinear is not related
to the other ``competing orders'' of the algebraic spin liquid, and does not
possess their slowly decaying correlations. For the square lattice staggered
flux spin liquid (equivalently, d-wave RVB state), this observable corresponds
to the uniform spin chirality.
