Thermoreflectance methods by picosecond pulse heating and by nanosecond pulse
heating have been developed under the same geometrical configuration as the
laser flash method by the National Metrology Institute of JAPAN, AIST. Using
these light pulse heating methods, thermal diffusivity of each layer of
multilayered thin films and boundary thermal resistance between the layers can
be determined from the observed transient temperature curves based on the
response function method. The measurement results of various thin films as
transparent conductive films used for flat panel displays, hard coating films
and multilayered films of the next generation phase-change optical disk will be
presented.
