Coherent backscattering is due to constructive interferences of reciprocal
paths and leads to an enhancement of the intensity of a multiply scattered
field near its source. To observe this enhancement an array of receivers is
conventionally placed close to the source. Our approach here is different. In a
first experiment, we recover the coherent backscattering effect (CBE) within an
array of sources and a distant receiver using time correlation of diffuse
fields. The enhancement cone has an excellent spatial resolution. The dynamics
of the enhancement factor is studied in a second experiment using correlation
of thermal phonons at the same ultrasonic frequencies, without any active
source.
