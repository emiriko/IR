Solid State Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) experiments allow characterizing
the local structure and dynamics of oxide glasses and melts. Thanks to the
development of new experiments, it now becomes possible to evidence not only
the details of the coordination state of the network formers of glasses but
also to characterize the nature of polyatomic molecular motifs extending over
several chemical bonds. We present results involving 31P homonuclear
experiments that allow description of groups of up to three phosphate units and
27Al/17O heteronuclear that allows evidencing &#956;3 oxygen bridges in
aluminate glasses and rediscussion of the structure of high temperature melts.
