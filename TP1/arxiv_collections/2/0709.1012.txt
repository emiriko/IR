The synthesis, characterization and liposome insertion of a novel
magnesium(II) carboranyl-porphyrazine, i.e. [2,3,7,8,12,13,17,18-octakis-
(1,2-dicarba-closo-dodecaboranyl)-hexylthio-5,10,15,20-
porphyrazine]magnesium(II) complex, MgHECSPz, is described. MgHECSPz was
designed to improve the potentiality in multiple approach anticancer therapy.
Liposomal formulations with different surface charge were prepared as
delivering agents. The obtained loaded vectors were characterized by DLS, SAXS,
SANS and \zeta potential measurements in order to define the overall properties
and structural details of loaded liposomes.
