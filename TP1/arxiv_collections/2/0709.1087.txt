We consider polarized Lambda hyperon production in proton-proton scattering,
p p -> (\Lambda^\uparrow jet) jet X, in the kinematical region of the LHC
experiments, in particular the ALICE experiment. We present a new Lambda
polarization observable that arises from the Sivers effect in the fragmentation
process. It can be large even at midrapidity and therefore, is of interest for
high energy hadron collider experiments. Apart from its potential to shed light
on the mechanisms behind the phenomenon of Lambda polarization arising in
unpolarized hadronic collisions, the new observable in principle also allows to
test the possible color flow dependence of single spin asymmetries and the
(non)universality of transverse momentum dependent fragmentation functions.
