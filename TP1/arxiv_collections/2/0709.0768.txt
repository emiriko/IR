Muons can be identified with high efficiency and purity and reconstructed
with high precision is a detector with a dual readout calorimeter and a dual
solenoid to return the flux without iron. We shown CERN test beam data for the
calorimeter and calculations for the magnetic fields and the track
reconstruction. For isolated tracks, the rejection of pions against muons
ranges from $10^3$ at 20 GeV/c to $10^5$ at 300 GeV/c.
