We consider unambiguous discrimination of two separable bipartite states, one
being pure and the other being a rank-2 mixed state. There is a gap between the
optimal success probability under global measurements and the one achieved by
generalized measurements with separable measurement operators. We show that
even the latter success probability cannot be achieved via local operations and
classical communication, leaving a nonzero gap in between.
