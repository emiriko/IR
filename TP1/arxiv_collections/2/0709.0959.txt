Let $f:M \to \mathbb{R}$ be a Morse-Bott function on a compact smooth finite
dimensional manifold $M$. The polynomial Morse inequalities and an explicit
perturbation of $f$ defined using Morse functions $f_j$ on the critical
submanifolds $C_j$ of $f$ show immediately that $MB_t(f) = P_t(M) + (1+t)R(t)$,
where $MB_t(f)$ is the Morse-Bott polynomial of $f$ and $P_t(M)$ is the
Poincar\'e polynomial of $M$. We prove that $R(t)$ is a polynomial with
nonnegative integer coefficients by showing that the number of gradient flow
lines of the perturbation of $f$ between two critical points $p,q \in C_j$
coincides with the number of gradient flow lines between $p$ and $q$ of the
Morse function $f_j$. This leads to a relationship between the kernels of the
Morse-Smale-Witten boundary operators associated to the Morse functions $f_j$
and the perturbation of $f$. This method works when $M$ and all the critical
submanifolds are oriented or when $\mathbb{Z}_2$ coefficients are used.
