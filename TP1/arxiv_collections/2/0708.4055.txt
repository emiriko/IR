Exitation of atomic levels due to interaction with electromagnetic waves has
been the subject of numerous works, both experimental and theoretical. This
topic became of interest in accelerator physics in relation to high efficiency
charge exchange injection into rings for high beam power applications. Taking
equations of resonant atom-wave interaction equations as a basis, this paper
shows that there exist some interesting phenomena which lead to the existence
of trapped electomagnetic waves (photon traps) in a medium that consists of
atoms with transition frequencies in proximity to the wave frequency. These
traps may exist in random and periodic lattices, and may have very low loss
rate. The atomic medium can serve as an excellent wavegiude or tool to form and
transmit electromagnetic waves for applications to accelerators and to
electromagnetic devices in general, where high pressure gas use is acceptable.
In addition, such traps in gases may accumulate substantial energy for a long
period of time, leading to the possibility of creating objects similar (or
equivalent) to ball lightning.
