We study the sample size dependence of the strength of disordered materials
with a flaw, by numerical simulations of lattice models for fracture. We find a
crossover between a regime controlled by the fluctuations due to disorder and
another controlled by stress-concentrations, ruled by continuum fracture
mechanics. The results are formulated in terms of a scaling law involving a
statistical fracture process zone. Its existence and scaling properties are
only revealed by sampling over many configurations of the disorder. The scaling
law is in good agreement with experimental results obtained from notched paper
samples.
