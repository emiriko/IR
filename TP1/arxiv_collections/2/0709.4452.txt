In ultrarelativistic nuclear collisions heavy quarks are produced out of
thermal equilibrium in the very early stage of the reaction and their
thermalization time was expected to be considerably larger than that of light
quarks. On the other hand, a strongly-interacting QGP can be envisaged in the
heavy quark sector due to the presence of heavy-light hadron-like resonances in
the QGP for temperatures up to $\sim$$2 T_{C}$. We investigate the consequences
of such states employing a relativistic Langevin simulation. Hadronization is
modeled by a coalescence-fragmentation scheme. We present the predictions for
the nuclear modification factor and elliptic flow of $D$ and $B$ mesons at LHC
energies and compare the results with the successful predictions of this model
for RHIC conditions. We find similar heavy-quark thermalization effects at LHC
and RHIC.
