Magnetically coupling a nano-mechanical resonator to a double quantum dot
confining two electrons can enable the manipulation of a single electron spin
and the readout of the resonator's natural frequency. When the Larmor frequency
matches the resonator frequency, the electron spin in one of the dots can be
selectively flipped by the magnetised resonator. By simultaneously measuring
the charge state of the two-electron double quantum dots, this transition can
be detected thus enabling the natural frequency of the mechanical resonator to
be determined.
