We theoretically investigate intermodulation distortion in high-Tc
superconductors. We study the effect of nonmagnetic impurities on the real and
imaginary parts of nonlinear conductivity. The nonlinear conductivity is
proportional to the inverse of temperature owing to the dependence of the
damping effect on energy, which arises from the phase shift deviating from the
unitary limit. It is shown that the final-states interaction makes the real
part predominant over the imaginary part. These effects have not been included
in previous theories based on the two-fluid model, enabling a consistent
explanation for the experiments with the rf and dc fields.
