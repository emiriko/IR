Applying the HSD transport approach to charmonium dynamics within the
'hadronic comover model' and the 'QGP melting scenario', we show that the
suppression pattern seen at RHIC cannot be explained by the interaction with
baryons, comoving mesons and/or by color screening mechanism. The interaction
with hadrons in the late stages of the collision (when the energy density falls
below the critical) gives a sizable contribution to the suppression. On the
other hand, it does not account for the observed additional charmonium
dissociation and its dependence on rapidity. Together with the failure of the
hadron-string models to reproduce high v2 of open charm mesons, this suggests
strong pre-hadronic interaction of c-cbar with the medium at high energy
densities.
