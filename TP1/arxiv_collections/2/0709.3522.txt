We study a new type of one-dimensional chiral states that can be created in
bilayer graphene (BLG) by electrostatic lateral confinement. These states
appear on the domain walls separating insulating regions experiencing the
opposite gating polarity. While the states are similar to conventional
solitonic zero-modes, their properties are defined by the unusual chiral BLG
quasiparticles, from which they derive. The number of zero-mode branches is
fixed by the topological vacuum charge of the insulating BLG state. We discuss
how these chiral states can manifest experimentally, and emphasize their
relevance for valleytronics.
