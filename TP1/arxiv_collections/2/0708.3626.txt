New results are presented for total ${\rm pp}/ {\rm \bar p p}$
cross-sections, in the framework of our QCD based model (GGPS). This is an
improved eikonal mini-jet model, where soft gluon radiation tames the fast
energy rise normally present in mini-jet models. We discuss the variability in
our predictions and provide a handy parametrization of our results for the LHC.
We find that our model predictions span the range $\sigma_{tot}^{LHC}=100
^{+10}_{-13} mb$. While this matches nicely with the range of most other
models, it does not agree with recent ones which include a "hard" Pomeron, even
though our model does include hard scattering. We compute the survival
probability for Large Rapidity Gap (LRG) events at the LHC and at the Tevatron.
These events are relevant, for example, for Higgs signal in the $WW$ fusion
process. We also explore whether measurements of the total cross-sections at
the LHC can help us sharpen the model parameters and hence estimates for these
survival probabilities, further.
