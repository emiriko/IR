Preparation, manipulation, and detection of strongly correlated states of
quantum many body systems are among the most important goals and challenges of
modern physics. Ultracold atoms offer an unprecedented playground for
realization of these goals. Here we show how strongly correlated states of
ultracold atoms can be detected in a quantum non-demolition scheme, that is, in
the fundamentally least destructive way permitted by quantum mechanics. In our
method, spatially resolved components of atomic spins couple to quantum
polarization degrees of freedom of light. In this way quantum correlations of
matter are faithfully mapped on those of light; the latter can then be
efficiently measured using homodyne detection. We illustrate the power of such
spatially resolved quantum noise limited polarization measurement by applying
it to detect various standard and "exotic" types of antiferromagnetic order in
lattice systems and by indicating the feasibility of detection of superfluid
order in Fermi liquids.
