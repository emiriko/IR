The present experimental tests have proved high precisely the validity of the
Pauli exclusion principle (PEP) in usual cases. The future experiments should
be combined widely with various theories of hidden and obvious violation of
PEP. Author think that known experiments and theories seem to imply the
violation at high energy. Some possible tests have been proposed in particle
physics, nuclei at high energy and astrophysics, etc., in particular, the
excited high-n atoms and multi-quark states. Moreover, the violation is
possibly relevant to the nonlinear quantum theory, in which the present linear
superposition principle may not hold. Finally, the possible violation at very
low temperature is discussed. These experiments may be connected with tests of
other basic principles, for example, the present wave property, possible
decrease of entropy due to internal interactions in isolated systems, and PCT
invariance, etc.
