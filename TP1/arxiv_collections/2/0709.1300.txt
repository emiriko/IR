Let X be a scheme, and let G be an affine group scheme acting on X. Under
reasonable hypotheses on X and G, we construct a t-structure on the derived
category of G-equivariant coherent sheaves that in many ways resembles the
perverse coherent t-structure, but which incorporates additional information
from the G-action. Under certain circumstances, this t-structure, called the
"staggered t-structure," has an artinian heart, and its simple objects are
particularly easy to describe. We also exhibit two small examples in which the
staggered t-structure is better-behaved than the perverse coherent t-structure.
