Based on spin-charge coupled drift-diffusion equations, which are derived
from kinetic equations for the spin-density matrix in a rigorous manner, the
electric-field-induced nonequilibrium spin polarization is treated for a
two-dimensional electron gas with both Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit
coupling. Most emphasis is put on the consideration of the field-mediated spin
dynamics for a model with equal Rashba and Dresselhaus coupling constants, in
which the spin relaxation is strongly suppressed. Weakly damped
electric-field-induced spin excitations are identified, which remind of
space-charge waves in crystals.
