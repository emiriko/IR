Search strategies based on random walk processes with long-tailed jump length
distributions (Levy walks) on the one hand and intermittent behavior switching
between local search and ballistic relocation phases on the other, have been
previously shown to be beneficial in stochastic target finding problems. We
here study a combination of both mechanisms: an intermittent process with Levy
distributed relocations. We demonstrate how Levy distributed relocations reduce
oversampling and thus further optimize the intermittent search strategy in the
critical situation of rare targets.
