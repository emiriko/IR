In this contribution we show that a suitably defined nonequilibrium entropy
of an N-body isolated system is not a constant of the motion in general and its
variation is bounded, the bounds determined by the thermodynamic entropy, i.e.,
the equilibrium entropy. We define the nonequilibrium entropy as a convex
functional of the set of n-particle reduced distribution functions
(n=0,......., N) generalizing the Gibbs fine-grained entropy formula.
Additionally, as a consequence of our microscopic analysis we find that this
nonequilibrium entropy behaves as a free entropic oscillator. In the approach
to the equilibrium regime we find relaxation equations of the Fokker-Planck
type, particularly for the one-particle distribution function.
