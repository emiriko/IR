We generated configurations with the approximate fixed-point Dirac operator
$D_\mathrm{FP}$ on a $12^4$ lattice with $a \approx 0.13 $fm where the scale
was set by $r_0$. The distributions of the low lying eigenvalues in different
topological sectors were compared with those of the Random Matrix Theory which
leads to a prediction of the chiral condensate.
