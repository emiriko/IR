In the industry, numerous commercial packages provide tools to introduce, and
analyse human behaviour in the product's environment (for maintenance,
ergonomics...), thanks to Virtual Humans. We will focus on control. Thanks to
algorithms newly introduced in recent research papers, we think we can provide
an implementation, which even widens, and simplifies the animation capacities
of virtual manikins. In order to do so, we are going to express the industrial
expectations as for Virtual Humans, without considering feasibility (not to
bias the issue). The second part will show that no commercial application
provides the tools that perfectly meet the needs. Thus we propose a new
animation framework that better answers the problem. Our contribution is the
integration - driven by need ~ of available new scientific techniques to
animate Virtual Humans, in a new control scheme that better answers industrial
expectations.
