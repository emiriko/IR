The kind of supersymmetry that can be discovered at the LHC must be very much
flavor-blind, which used to require very special intelligently designed models
of supersymmetry breaking. This led to the pessimism for some in the community
that it is not likely for the LHC to discover supersymmetry. I point out that
this is not so, because a garden-variety supersymmetric theories actually can
do this job.
