We show that the zeros of random sequences of Gaussian systems of polynomials
of increasing degree almost surely converge to the expected limit distribution
under very general hypotheses. In particular, the normalized distribution of
zeros of systems of m polynomials of degree N, orthonormalized on a regular
compact subset K of C^m, almost surely converge to the equilibrium measure on K
as the degree N goes to infinity.
