We propose a lower bound on bulk viscosity of strongly coupled gauge theory
plasmas. Using explicit example of the N=2^* gauge theory plasma we show that
the bulk viscosity remains finite at a critical point with a divergent specific
heat. We present an estimate for the bulk viscosity of QGP plasma at RHIC.
