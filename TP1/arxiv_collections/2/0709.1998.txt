The theory of internal waves between two layers of immiscible fluids is
important both for its applications in oceanography and engineering, and as a
source of interesting mathematical model equations that exhibit nonlinearity
and dispersion. A Boussinesq system for two-way propagation of interfacial
waves in a rigid lid configuration is derived. In most cases, the nonlinearity
is quadratic. However, when the square of the depth ratio is close to the
density ratio, the coefficients of the quadratic nonlinearities become small
and cubic nonlinearities must be considered. The propagation as well as the
collision of solitary waves and/or fronts is studied numerically.
