For ferromagnet/antiferromagnet bilayers, rotation of the easy axis has been
\textit{for the first time} observed during measurements of training effect and
the recovery of exchange bias using FeNi/FeMn system. These salient phenomena
strongly suggest irreversible motion of antiferromagnet spins during subsequent
measurements of hysteresis loops. It is found that the rotation of the easy
axis can partly account for the training effect and the recovery of the
exchange bias.
