We briefly explain some simple arguments based on pseudo Hermiticity,
supersymmetry and PT-symmetry which explain the reality of the spectrum of some
non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. Subsequently we employ PT-symmetry as a guiding
principle to construct deformations of some integrable systems, the
Calogero-Moser-Sutherland model and the Korteweg deVries equation. Some
properties of these models are discussed.
