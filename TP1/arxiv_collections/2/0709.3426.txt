Graphite is a well-studied material with known electronic and optical
properties. Graphene, on the other hand, which is just one layer of carbon
atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice, has been studied theoretically for quite
some time but has only recently become accessible for experiments. Here we
demonstrate how single- and multi-layer graphene can be unambiguously
identified using Raman scattering. Furthermore, we use a scanning Raman set-up
to image few-layer graphene flakes of various heights. In transport experiments
we measure weak localization and conductance fluctuations in a graphene flake
of about 7 monolayer thickness. We obtain a phase-coherence length of about 2
$\mu$m at a temperature of 2 K. Furthermore we investigate the conductivity
through single-layer graphene flakes and the tuning of electron and hole
densities via a back gate.
