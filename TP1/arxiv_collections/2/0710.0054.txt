In this paper we review basic properties of coupled periodic and aperiodic
nanopillar waveguides. A coupled nanopillar waveguide consists of several rows
of periodically or aperiodically placed dielectric rods (pillars). In such a
waveguide, light confinement is due to the total internal reflection, while
guided modes dispersion is strongly affected by the waveguide structure. We
present a systematic analysis of the optical properties of coupled nanopillar
waveguides and discuss their possible applications for integrated optics.
