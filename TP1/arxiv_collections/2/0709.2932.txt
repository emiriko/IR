We study stabilizations of the supersymmetry breaking runaway quiver in
string embeddings. Calculations are performed in four dimensional effective
supergravity. Constraints on closed string fields in a type IIA construction
are given. The particular case of stabilization by stringy instanton effects in
a type IIB model is considered.
