A network identification by deconvolution (NID) method is applied to the
thermal transient response of packaged and unpackaged microcoolers. A thin film
resistor on top of the device is used as the heat source and the temperature
sensor. The package and the bonding thermal resistances can be easily
identified by comparing structure functions. High-speed coplanar probes are
used to achieve a short time resolution of roughly 100ns in the transient
temperature response. This is used to separate the thermal properties of the
thin film from the substrate. The obtained thermal resistances of the buffer
layer and Silicon substrate are consistent with the theoretical calculations.
In order to estimate the superlattice thermal resistance and separate it from
the thin SiNx layer deposited underneath the thin film resistive sensor, an
order of magnitude faster thermal transient response is needed.
