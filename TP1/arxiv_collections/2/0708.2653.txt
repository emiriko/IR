Superresolution, extraordinary transmission, total absorption, and
localization of electromagnetic waves are currently attracting growing
attention. These phenomena are related to different physical objects and are
usually studied within the context of different, sometimes rather
sophisticated, physical approaches. Remarkably, all these seemingly unrelated
phenomena owe their origin to the same underlying physical mechanism - wave
interaction with an open resonator. Here we show that it is possible to
describe all of these effects in a unified way, mapping each system onto a
simple resonator model. Such description provides a thorough understanding of
the phenomena, explains all the main features of their complex behaviour, and
enables to control the system via the resonator parameters: eigenfrequencies,
Q-factors, and coupling coefficients.
