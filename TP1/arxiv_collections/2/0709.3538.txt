We present new parameterizations of vector and axial nucleon form factors. We
maintain an excellent descriptions of the form factors at low momentum
transfers ($Q^2$), where the spatial structure of the nucleon is important, and
use the Nachtman scaling variable $\xi$ to relate elastic and inelastic form
factors and impose quark-hadron duality constraints at high $Q^2$ where the
quark structure dominates. We use the new vector form factors to re-extract
updated values of the axial form factor from $\numu$ experiments on deuterium.
We obtain an updated world average value from $\numu$d, $\numubar$H and pion
electroproduction experiments of $M_{A}$ = $1.014 \pm 0.014 GeV/c^2$. Our
parameterizations are useful in modeling $\nu$ interactions at low energies
(e.g. for $\numu$ oscillations experiments). The predictions for high $Q^2$ can
be tested in the next generation electron and $\numu$ scattering experiments.
