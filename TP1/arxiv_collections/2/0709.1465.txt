We probe non-equilibrium properties of an active bacterial bath through
measurements of correlations of passive tracer particles and the response
function of a driven, optically trapped tracer. These measurements demonstrate
violation of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem and enable us to extract the
power spectrum of the active stress fluctuations. In some cases, we observe
$1/\sqrt{\omega}$ scaling in the noise spectrum which we show can be derived
from a theoretical model incorporating coupled stress, orientation, and
concentration fluctuations of the bacteria.
