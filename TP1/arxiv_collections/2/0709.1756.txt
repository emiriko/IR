In arXiv:0709.0483 Gunther and Samsonov outline a ``generalization'' of
quantum mechanics that involves simultaneous consideration of Hermitian and
non-Hermitian operators and promises to be ``capable to produce effects beyond
those of standard Hermitian quantum mechanics.'' We give a simple physical
interpretation of Hermiticity and discuss in detail the shortcomings of the
above-mentioned composite quantum theory. In particular, we show that the
corresponding ``generalization of measurement theory'' suffers from a dynamical
inconsistency and that it is by no means adequate to replace the standard
measurement theory.
