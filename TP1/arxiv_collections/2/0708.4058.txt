Hedin's equations for the electron self-energy and the vertex were originally
derived for a many-electron system with Coulomb interaction. In recent years it
has been increasingly recognized that spin interactions can play a major role
in determining physical properties of systems such as nanoscale magnets or of
interfaces and surfaces. We derive a generalized set of Hedin's equations for
quantum many-body systems containing spin interactions, e.g. spin-orbit and
spin-spin interactions. The corresponding spin-dependent GW approximation is
constructed.
