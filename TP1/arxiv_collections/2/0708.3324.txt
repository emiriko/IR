We have successfully grown cm3-size single crystals of the
metallic-ferromagnet Sm2Mo2O7 by the floating-zone method using an infrared-red
image furnace. The growth difficulties and the remedies found using a 2-mirror
image furnace are discussed. Magnetization studies along the three crystalline
axes of the compound are presented and discussed based on our recent proposal
of an ordered spin-ice ground state for this compound
