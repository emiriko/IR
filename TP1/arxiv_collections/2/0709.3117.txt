Motivated by multi-objective optimization, we study extrema of a set of N
points independently distributed inside the d-dimensional hypercube. A point in
this set is k-dominated by another point when at least k of its coordinates are
larger, and is a k-minimum if it is not k-dominated by any other point. We
obtain statistical properties of these partial minima using exact probabilistic
methods and heuristic scaling techniques. The average number of partial minima,
A, decays algebraically with the total number of points, A ~ N^{-(d-k)/k}, when
1<=k<d. Interestingly, there are k-1 distinct scaling laws characterizing the
largest coordinates as the distribution P(y_j) of the jth largest coordinate,
y_j, decays algebraically, P(y_j) ~ (y_j)^{-alpha_j-1}, with
alpha_j=j(d-k)/(k-j) for 1<=j<=k-1. The average number of partial minima grows
logarithmically, A ~ [1/(d-1)!](ln N)^{d-1}, when k=d. The full distribution of
the number of minima is obtained in closed form in two-dimensions.
