Including real-time data collection technology is a common practice to
upgrade physics labs, and the assumption is such technology improves student
learning, yet little has been done to demonstrate the effects of technology.
Specific activities have been shown to be enhanced by technology, but the
effects on the class as a whole has been left unexplored. This paper
investigates the effects of technology on two algebra based introductory
physics classes. In this paper, we use FCI, MPEX, surveys, and ethnographies to
document the improvement in learning as real-time data collection technology is
incorporated into a modeling physics class. The two classes examined differed
only in the inclusion of technology. The results found were significant.
Students in the class with high technology were found to have learned more than
students in the class with no technology. This paper explores the gains in
learning and relates them directly to the addition of technology.
