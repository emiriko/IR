We report about universality of rank-integration distributions of open spaces
in city space syntax similar to the famous rank-size distributions of cities
(Zipf's law). We also demonstrate that the degree of choice an open space
represents for other spaces directly linked to it in a city follows a power law
statistic. Universal statistical behavior of space syntax measures uncovers the
universality of the city creation mechanism. We suggest that the observed
universality may help to establish the international definition of a city as a
specific land use pattern.
