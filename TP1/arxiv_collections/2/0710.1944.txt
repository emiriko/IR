Recently, observational searches for gravitational wave background (GWB) have
developed and given direct and indirect constraints on the energy density of
GWB in a broad range of frequencies. These constraints have already rejected
some theoretical models of large GWB spectra. However, at 100 MHz, there is no
strict upper limit from direct observation, though the indirect limit by He4
abundance due to big-bang nucleosynthesis exists. In this paper, we propose an
experiment with laser interferometers searching GWB at 100 MHz. We considered
three detector designs and evaluated the GW response functions of a single
detector. As a result, we found that, at 100 MHz, the most sensitive detector
is the design, a so-called synchronous recycling interferometer, which has
better sensitivity than an ordinary Fabry-Perot Michelson interferometer by a
factor of 3.3 at 100 MHz. We also give the best sensitivity achievable at 100
MHz with realistic experimental parameters.
