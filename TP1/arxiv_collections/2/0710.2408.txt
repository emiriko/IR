We discuss scalar triplet leptogenesis in a specific left-right symmetric
seesaw model. We show that the Majorana phases that are present in the model
can be effectively used to saturate the existing upper limit on the
CP-asymmetry of the triplets. We solve the relevant Boltzmann equations and
analyze the viability of triplet leptogenesis. It is known for this kind of
scenario that the efficiency of leptogenesis is maximal if there exists a
hierarchy between the branching ratios of the triplet decays into leptons and
Higgs particles. We show that triplet leptogenesis typically favors branching
ratios with not too strong hierarchies, since maximal efficiency can only be
obtained at the expense of suppressed CP-asymmetries.
