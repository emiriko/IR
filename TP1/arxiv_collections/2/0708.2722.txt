A superspace formulation of IIB supergravity which includes the field
strengths of the duals of the usual physical one, three and five-form field
strengths as well as the eleven-form field strength is given. The
superembedding formalism is used to construct kappa-symmetric SL(2,R) covariant
D-brane actions in an arbitrary supergravity background.
