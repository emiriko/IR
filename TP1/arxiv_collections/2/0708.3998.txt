We have extended the range of the high-pressure optical spectroscopy to the
far-infrared region keeping the accuracy of ambient-pressure experiments. The
newly-developed method offers a powerful tool for the study of pressure-induced
phase transitions and electronic-structural changes in correlated electron
systems. The novel-type optical pressure cell, equipped with large
free-aperture diamond window, allows the measurement of optical reflectivity
down to $\omega\approx20-30$ cm$^{-1}$ for hydrostatic pressures up to
$p\approx26$ kbar. The efficiency of the technique is demonstrated by the
investigation of the 2-dimensional charge-density-wave 1$T$-TaS$_2$ whose
electronic structure shows high sensitivity to external pressure. The
room-temperature semi-metallic phase of 1$T$-TaS$_2$ is effectively extended by
application of pressure and stabilized as the ground state above $p=14$ kbar.
The corresponding fully incoherent low-energy optical conductivity is almost
temperature independent below T=300 K. For intermediate pressures, the onset of
the low-temperature insulating phase is reflected by the sudden drop of the
reflectivity and by the emergence of sharp phonon resonances.
