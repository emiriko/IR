We study numerically a spreading of an initially localized wave packet in a
one-dimensional discrete nonlinear Schr\"odinger lattice with disorder. We
demonstrate that above a certain critical strength of nonlinearity the Anderson
localization is destroyed and an unlimited subdiffusive spreading of the field
along the lattice occurs. The second moment grows with time $ \propto
t^\alpha$, with the exponent $\alpha$ being in the range $0.3 - 0.4$. For small
nonlinearities the distribution remains localized in a way similar to the
linear case.
