We develop a variational scheme in a field theoretic approach to a stochastic
process. While various stochastic processes can be expressed using master
equations, in general it is difficult to solve the master equations exactly,
and it is also hard to solve the master equations numerically because of the
curse of dimensionality. The field theoretic approach has been used in order to
study such complicated master equations, and the variational scheme achieves
tremendous reduction in the dimensionality of master equations. For the
variational method, only the Poisson ansatz has been used, in which one
restricts the variational function to a Poisson distribution. Hence, one has
dealt with only restricted fluctuation effects. We develop the variational
method further, which enables us to treat an arbitrary variational function. It
is shown that the variational scheme developed gives a quantitatively good
approximation for master equations which describe a stochastic gene regulatory
network.
