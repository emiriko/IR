The exclusive process e+ e- -> e+ e- rho^0_L rho^0_L allows to study various
dynamics and factorization properties of perturbative QCD. At moderate energy,
we demonstrate how collinear QCD factorization emerges, involving generalized
distribution amplitudes (GDA) and transition distribution amplitudes (TDA). At
higher energies, in the Regge limit of QCD, we show that it offers a promising
probe of the BFKL resummation effects to be studied at the International Linear
Collider (ILC).
