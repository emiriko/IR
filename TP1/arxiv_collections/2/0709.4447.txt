Degree distributions of graph representations for compact urban patterns are
scale-dependent. Therefore, the degree statistics alone does not give us the
enough information to reach a qualified conclusion on the structure of urban
spatial networks. We investigate the statistics of far-away neighbors and
propose the new method for automatic structural classification of cities.
