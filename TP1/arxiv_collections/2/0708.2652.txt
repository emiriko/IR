We consider the use of a pi-junction for flux qubits to realize degenerate
quantum levels without external magnetic field. On the basis of the
Caldeira-Leggett model, we derive an effective spin-Boson model, and study
decoherece of this type of qubits. We estimate the dephasing time by using
parameters from recent experiments of SIFS junctions, and show that high
critical current and large subgap resistance are required for the pi-junction
to realize a long coherent time.
