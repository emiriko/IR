By considering particles as smeared objects, we investigate the effects of
space noncommutativity on the orbits of particles in Schwarzschild spacetime.
The effects of space noncommutativity on the value of the precession of the
perihelion of particle orbit and deflection of light ray in Schwarzschild
geometry are calculated and the stability of circular orbits is discussed.
