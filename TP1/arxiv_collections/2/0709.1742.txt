The paper is mainly devoted to the irreducibility of the polynomial
representation of the double affine Hecke algebra for an arbitrary reduced root
systems and generic "central charge" q. The technique of intertwiners in the
non-semisimple variant is the main tool. We introduce Macdonald's
non-semisimple polynomials and use them to analyze the reducibility of the
polynomial representation in terms of the affine exponents, counterparts of the
classical Coxeter exponents. The focus is on the principal aspects of the
technique of intertwiners, including related problems in the theory of reduced
decompositions on affine Weyl groups.
