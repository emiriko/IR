We investigate Bose-Einstein condensation of noninteracting gases in a
harmonic trap with an off-center dimple potential. We specifically consider the
case of a tight and deep dimple potential which is modelled by a point
interaction. This point interaction is represented by a Dirac delta function.
The atomic density, chemical potential, critical temperature and condensate
fraction, the role of the relative depth and the position of the dimple
potential are analyzed by performing numerical calculations.
