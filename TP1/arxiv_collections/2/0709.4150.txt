We present a simple numerical model for investigating the general properties
of fragmentation. By use of molecular dynamics simulations, we study the impact
fragmentation of a solid disk of interacting particles with a wall. Regardless
of the particular form of the interaction potential, the fragment size
distribution exhibits a power law behaviour with an exponent that increases
logarithmically with the energy deposited in the system, in agreement with
experiments. We expect this behaviour to be generic in fragmentation phenomena.
