We present a Monte Carlo method that allows efficient and unbiased sampling
of Hamiltonian walks on a cubic lattice. Such walks are self-avoiding and visit
each lattice site exactly once. They are often used as simple models of
globular proteins, upon adding suitable local interactions. Our algorithm can
easily be equipped with such interactions, but we study here mainly the
flexible homopolymer case where each conformation is generated with uniform
probability. We argue that the algorithm is ergodic and has dynamical exponent
z=0. We then use it to study polymers of size up to 64^3 = 262144 monomers.
Results are presented for the effective interaction between end points, and the
interaction with the boundaries of the system.
