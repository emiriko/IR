The density matrix, i.e. the Fourier transform of the momentum distribution,
is obtained analytically for all magnetization of the Gutzwiller wave function
in one dimension with exclusion of double occupancy per site. The present
result complements the previous analytic derivation of the density matrix for
the majority spin. The derivation makes use of a determinantal form of the
squared wave function, and multiple integrals over particle coordinates are
performed with the help of a diagrammatic representation. In the thermodynamic
limit, the density matrix at distance x is completely characterized by
quantities v_c x and v_s x, where v_s and v_c are spin and charge velocities in
the supersymmetric t-J model for which the Gutzwiller wave function gives the
exact ground state. The present result then gives the exact density matrix of
the t-J model for all densities and all magnetization at zero temperature.
Discontinuity, slope, and curvature singularities in the momentum distribution
are identified. The momentum distribution obtained by numerical Fourier
transform is in excellent agreement with existing result.
