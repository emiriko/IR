We consider a superconducting/normal/superconducting Josephson junction
modeled through the Ginzburg-Landau theory. When the normal material is
sufficiently thin and the applied magnetic field is below the critical field of
vortex nucleation, we prove to leading order that jump boundary conditions of
the type predicted by de Gennes are satisfied across the junction.
