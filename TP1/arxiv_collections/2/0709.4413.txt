The Littlest Higgs Model with T-Parity (LHT) contains new sources of flavor
and CP violation both in the quark and lepton sector. These have their origin
in interactions of ordinary fermions with mirror fermions mediated by new heavy
gauge bosons. Large deviations from the Standard Model (SM) are to be expected
in the lepton sector where tiny neutrino masses suppress the SM predictions by
many orders of magnitude below the experimentally accessible level. Here we
give a brief summary of LFV processes relevant for the foreseeable future and
point out that correlations between branching ratios of LFV decays in the LHT
exhibit a structure vastly different from their analogues in the MSSM, thus
allowing for a transparent distinction between these two models.
