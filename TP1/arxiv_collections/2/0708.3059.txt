A general method for calculating statistical properties of speckle patterns
of coherent waves propagating in disordered media is developed. It allows one
to calculate speckle pattern correlations in space, as well as their
sensitivity to external parameters. This method, which is similar to the
Boltzmann-Langevin approach for the calculation of classical fluctuations,
applies for a wide range of systems: From cases where the ray propagation is
diffusive to the regime where the rays experience only small angle scattering.
The latter case comprises the regime of directed waves where rays propagate
ballistically in space while their directions diffuse. We demonstrate the
applicability of the method by calculating the correlation function of the wave
intensity and its sensitivity to the wave frequency and the angle of incidence
of the incoming wave.
