The dynamics of transformation twins in SrxBa1-xSnO3 (x=0.6,0.8) perovskite
has been studied by dynamical mechanical analysis in three-point bend geometry.
This material undergoes phase transitions from orthorhombic to tetragonal and
cubic structures on heating. The mechanical loss signatures of the
transformation twins include relaxation and frequency-independent peaks in the
orthorhombic and tetragonal phases, with no observed energy dissipation in the
cubic phase. The macroscopic shape, orientation and relative displacements of
twin walls have been calculated from bending and anisotropy energies. The
mechanical loss angle and distribution of relaxation time are discussed in term
of bending modes of domain walls.
