Storage and retrieval of a squeezed vacuum was successfully demonstrated
using electromagnetically induced transparency. 930ns of the squeezed vacuum
pulse was incident on the laser cooled 87Rb atoms with an intense control light
in a coherent state. When the squeezed vacuum pulse was slowed and spatially
compressed in the cold atoms, the control light was switched off. After 3us of
storage, the control light was switched on again and the squeezed vacuum was
retrieved, as was confirmed using the time-domain homodyne method.
