We use cluster Dynamical Mean Field Theory to study the simplest models of
correlated electrons, the Hubbard model and the t-J model. We use a plaquette
embedded in a medium as a reference frame to compute and interpret the physical
properties of these models. We study various observables such as electronic
lifetimes, one electron spectra, optical conductivities, superconducting
stiffness, and the spin response in both the normal and the superconducting
state in terms of correlation functions of the embedded cluster. We find that
the shortest electron lifetime occurs near optimal doping where the
superconducting critical temperature is maximal. A second critical doping
connected to the change of topology of the Fermi surface is also identified.
The mean field theory provides a simple physical picture of three doping
regimes, the underdoped, the overdoped and the optimally doped regime in terms
of the physics of the quantum plaquette impurity model. We compare the
plaquette Dynamical Mean Field Theory results with earlier resonating valence
bond mean field theories, noting the improved description of the momentum space
anisotropy of the normal state properties and the doping dependence of the
coefficient of the linear temperature dependence of the superfluid density in
the superconducting state.
