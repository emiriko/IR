Recently, several similar protocols[J. Opt. B 4 (2002) 380; Phys. Lett. A 316
(2003) 159; Phys. Lett. A 355 (2006) 285; Phys. Lett. A 336 (2005) 317] for
remotely preparing a class of multi-qubit states (i.e, $\alpha|0 ...
0>+\beta|1... 1>$) are proposed, respectively. In this paper, by applying the
controlled-not (CNOT) gate, a new simple protocol is proposed for remotely
preparing such class of states. Compared to the previous protocols, both
classical communication cost and required quantum entanglement in our protocol
are remarkably reduced. Moreover, the difficulty of identifying some quantum
states in our protocol is also degraded. Hence our protocol is more economical
and feasible.
