A phenomenological model of self-organization explaining the emergence of a
complexity with features that apparently satisfy the specific criteria usually
required for recognizing the appearance of life in laboratory is presented. The
described phenomenology, justified by laboratory experiments, is essentially
based on local self-enhancement and long-range inhibition. The complexity
represents a primitive organism self-assembled in a gaseous medium revealing,
immediately after its "birth", many of the prerequisite features that attribute
them the quality to evolve, under suitable conditions, into a living cell.
