Using the fact that 2D Newton constant is wholly induced by a conformal field
theory, we derive a formula for the entanglement entropy of the anti-de Sitter
black hole in two spacetime dimensions. The leading term in the large black
hole mass expansion of our formula reproduces exactly the Bekenstein-Hawking
entropy S_{BH}, whereas the subleading term behaves as ln S_{BH}. This
subleading term has the universal form typical for the entanglement entropy of
physical systems described by effective conformal fields theories (e.g.
one-dimensional statistical models at the critical point).
