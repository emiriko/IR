We have studied the normal modes of hydrogenated and oxidized silicon
nanocrystals, namely SiH4 (silan), H2SiO (silanon), Si10H16 and Si10H14O. The
small clusters (SiH4 and H2SiO) have been used for convergence tests and their
bondlengths and frequencies have been compared with experimental and
theoretical reference data. For the large clusters (Si10H16 and Si10H14O) we
have investigated the vibrational density of states where we have identified
the oxygen-related spectral features. The vibrational modes have been also
analyzed with respect to the displacement patterns. The calculations have been
carried out within the density-functional and density-functional perturbation
theory using the local-density approximation.
