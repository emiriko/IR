Conductivity of a disorder-free intrinsic graphene is studied to the first
order in the long-range Coulomb interaction and is found to be
\sigma=\sigma_0(1+0.01 g), where 'g' is the dimensionless ("fine structure")
coupling constant. The calculations are performed using three different
methods: i) electron polarization function, ii) Kubo formula for the
conductivity, iii) quantum transport equation. Surprisingly, these methods
yield different results unless a proper ultraviolet cut-off procedure is
implemented, which requires that the interaction potential in the effective
Dirac Hamiltonian is cut-off at small distances (large momenta).
