Monte Carlo simulations of the short-time dynamic behavior are reported for
three-dimensional Ising and XY models with long-range correlated disorder at
criticality, in the case corresponding to linear defects. The static and
dynamic critical exponents are determined for systems starting separately from
ordered and disordered initial states. The obtained values of the exponents are
in a good agreement with results of the field-theoretic description of the
critical behavior of these models in the two-loop approximation and with our
results of Monte Carlo simulations of three-dimensional Ising model in
equilibrium state.
