We consider a longitudinal expansion of a one-dimensional gas of hard-core
bosons suddenly released from a trap. We show that the broken translational
invariance in the initial state of the system is encoded in correlations
between the bosonic occupation numbers in the momentum space. The correlations
are protected by the integrability and exhibit no relaxation during the
expansion.
