We give a brief account of recent developments in the theoretical
understanding of the interaction between electric currents and inhomogeneous
ferromagnetic order parameters. We start by discussing the physical origin of
the spin torques responsible for this interaction and construct a
phenomenological description. We then consider the electric current-induced
ferromagnetic instability and domain-wall motion. Finally, we present a
microscopic justification of the phenomenological description of current-driven
magnetization dynamics, with particular emphasis on the dissipative terms, the
so-called Gilbert damping $\alpha$ and the $\beta$ component of the adiabatic
current-driven torque.
