Quasi-classical picture of motion of spin 1/2 massive particle in a curved
spacetime is built on base of simple Lagrangian model. The one is constructed
due to analogy with Lagrangian of massive vector particle. Equations of motion
and spin propagation coincide with Papapetrou equations describing dynamic of
classical spinning particle in a curved spacetime.
