We propose to use a collective excitation blockade mechanism to identify
errors that occur due to disturbances of single atoms in ensemble quantum
registers where qubits are stored in the collective population of different
internal atomic states. A simple error correction procedure and a simple
decoherence-free encoding of ensemble qubits in the hyperfine states of alkali
atoms are presented.
