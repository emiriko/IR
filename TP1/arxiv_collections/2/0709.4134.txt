Assuming that alpha particles are described by a scalar-isoscalar chiral
invariant heavy field it is shown how chiral symmetry determines the
alpha-alpha interaction at long distances unambiguously from dimensional power
counting of an effective chiral Lagrangean. The leading strong contribution is
given by a two pion exchange potential which turns out to be attractive and
singular at the origin, hence demanding renormalization. When 8Be is treated as
a resonance state a model independent correlation between the Q-factor and
lifetime 1/Gamma for the decay into two alpha particles arises. For parameters
compatible with potential model analyses of low energy pi-alpha scattering it
is found a Breit-Wigner width Gamma = 4.3(3) eV very close to the experimental
value, Gamma= 5.57 (25)eV.
