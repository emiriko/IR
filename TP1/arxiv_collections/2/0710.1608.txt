I present recent results of measurements of branching fractions and
CP-violating asymmetries in B0, Bs, and Lambda_B two-body charmless decays at
the upgraded Collider Detector at the Fermilab Tevatron. Measurements of rates
of flavor-changing neutral current B0, Bs -->mu+mu- and B+/B0/Bs --> mu+mu-
K+/K*0/phi decays are also reported. The results are extracted from samples
corresponding to time-intergrated luminosities ranging from 0.78 to 1 fb-1.
