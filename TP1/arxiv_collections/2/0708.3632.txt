The architectural complexes composed by the two main pyramids of Giza
together with their temples are investigated from an inter-disciplinary point
of view, taking into account their astronomical alignments as well as their
relationships with the visible landscape. Combining already known facts
together with new clues, the work strongly supports the idea that the two
complexes were conceived as parts of a common project.
