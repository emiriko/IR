We present rigorous 3D EMF simulations of isolated features on photomasks
using a newly developed finite-element method. We report on the current status
of the finite-element solver JCMsuite, incorporating higher-order edge
elements, adaptive refinement methods, and fast solution algorithms. We
demonstrate that rigorous and accurate results on light scattering off isolated
features can be achived at relatively low computational cost, compared to the
standard approach of simulations on large-pitch, periodic computational
domains.
