In this paper we define Besov-Lipschitz and Triebel-Lizorkin spaces in the
context of Gaussian harmonic analysis, the harmonic analysis of Hermite
polynomial expansions. We study inclusion relations among them, some
interpolation results and continuity results of some important operators (the
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck and the Poisson-Hermite semigroups and the Bessel
potentials) on them. We also prove that the Gaussian Sobolev spaces
$L^p_\alpha(\gamma_d)$ are contained in them. The proofs are general enough to
allow extensions of these results to the case of Laguerre or Jacobi expansions
and even further in the general framework of diffusions semigroups.
