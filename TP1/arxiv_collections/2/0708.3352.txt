For spherically symmetric relativistic perfect fluid models, the well-known
Buchdahl inequality provides the bound $2 M/R \leq 8/9$, where $R$ denotes the
surface radius and $M$ the total mass of a solution. By assuming that the ratio
$p/\rho$ be bounded, where $p$ is the pressure, $\rho$ the density of
solutions, we prove a sharper inequality of the same type, which depends on the
actual bound imposed on $p/\rho$. As a special case, when we assume the
dominant energy condition $p/\rho \leq 1$, we obtain $2 M/R \leq 6/7$.
