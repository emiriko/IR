Among the models of quantum computation, the One-way Quantum Computer is one
of the most promising proposals of physical realization, and opens new
perspectives for parallelization by taking advantage of quantum entanglement.
Since a one-way quantum computation is based on quantum measurement, which is a
fundamentally nondeterministic evolution, a sufficient condition of global
determinism has been introduced as the existence of a causal flow in a graph
that underlies the computation. A O(n^3)-algorithm has been introduced for
finding such a causal flow when the numbers of output and input vertices in the
graph are equal, otherwise no polynomial time algorithm was known for deciding
whether a graph has a causal flow or not. Our main contribution is to introduce
a O(n^2)-algorithm for finding a causal flow, if any, whatever the numbers of
input and output vertices are. This answers the open question stated by Danos
and Kashefi and by de Beaudrap. Moreover, we prove that our algorithm produces
an optimal flow (flow of minimal depth.)
  Whereas the existence of a causal flow is a sufficient condition for
determinism, it is not a necessary condition. A weaker version of the causal
flow, called gflow (generalized flow) has been introduced and has been proved
to be a necessary and sufficient condition for a family of deterministic
computations. Moreover the depth of the quantum computation is upper bounded by
the depth of the gflow. However, the existence of a polynomial time algorithm
that finds a gflow has been stated as an open question. In this paper we answer
this positively with a polynomial time algorithm that outputs an optimal gflow
of a given graph and thus finds an optimal correction strategy to the
nondeterministic evolution due to measurements.
