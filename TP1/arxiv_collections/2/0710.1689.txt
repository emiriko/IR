The kinetics of main physical processes controlling the growth of nanowires
(NW) via evolution pass " vapor-liquid-solid" is considered. The roles of the
thermodynamics and kinetics of cluster nucleation in the initial stage of NW
formation are studied. Approximate expressions for NW length are obtained in
one-dimensional approximation. The influence of transfer processes in the gas
phase on the growth NW is evaluated. The effect of release of the latent heat
of phase transition and heat conduction along NW is considered. For carbon NW,
grown on Ni catalytic particles, numerical results are obtained. PACS: 64.70Dv,
