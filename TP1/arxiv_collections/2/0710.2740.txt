This paper consider the problem of determining the reliability of a software
system which can be decomposed in a number of modules. We have derived the
expression of the reliability of a system using the Markovian model for the
transfer of control between modules in order. We have given the expression of
reliability by considering both benign and catastrophic failure. The expression
of reliability presented in this work is applicable for some control software
which are designed to detect its own internal errors.
