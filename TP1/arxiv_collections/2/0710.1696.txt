The (light but not-so-light) strange quark may play a special role in the
low-energy dynamics of QCD. The presence of strange quark pairs in the sea may
have a significant impact of the pattern of chiral symmetry breaking : in
particular large differences can occur between the chiral limits of two and
three massless flavours (i.e., whether m_s is kept at its physical value or
sent to zero). This may induce problems of convergence in three-flavour chiral
expansions. To cope with such difficulties, we introduce a new framework,
called Resummed Chiral Perturbation Theory. We exploit it to analyse pi-pi and
pi-K scatterings and match them with dispersive results in a frequentist
framework. Constraints on three-flavour chiral order parameters are derived.
