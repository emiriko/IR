Gravitational decays in particle physics are expected to violate the B and L
quantum numbers. In the standard theory, where gravity is weak because of the
huge value of Planck mass, the observation of the phenomenon is far from
present and probably future experimental sensitivity. On the other hand, in
theories with low gravity scale, where gravity becomes stronger at shorter
distances, these processes may be dangerous, predicting a too short proton
lifetime. Here I discuss a possible picture of gravitational decays, which is
consistent with present experimental bounds for a true gravity scale of few TeV
and suggests the possibility of observing B and L violating decays with a minor
improvement of the present experimental capability.
