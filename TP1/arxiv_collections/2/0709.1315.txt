We firstly address the recent efforts on calculations of the next-to-leading
order corrections to the color-suppressed tree amplitude in QCD factorization
method which may be essential to solve the puzzles in $B\to \pi\pi$ and $\pi K$
decays. Then we discuss the polarization puzzles in $B\to \phi K^*$ and $\rho
K^*$. The impacts of the newly measured $B_s-\bar B_s$ mixing and $B^+\to
\tau^+\nu$ on the CKM unitarity triangle global fitting are mentioned. We also
briefly review the recent measurements of the new resonances at BaBar and
Belle. Finally, some new results from hadron colliders, especially the
$b$-flavored hadron spectra, are discussed.
