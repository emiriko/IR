This paper reports a study of the influence of the step at a silicon surface
under an uniaxial tensile stress, using an empirical potential. Our aim was to
find conditions leading to nucleation of dislocations from the step. We
obtained that no dislocations could be generated with such conditions. This
behaviour, different from the one predicted for metals, could be attributed
either to the covalent bonding or to the cubic diamond structure.
