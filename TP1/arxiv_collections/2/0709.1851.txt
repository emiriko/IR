This work builds on the previous introduction [1] of a coupled
experimental-computational system devised to fully characterize the thermal
behavior of complex 3D submicron electronic devices. The new system replaces
the laser-based surface temperature scanning approach with a CCD camera-based
approach. As before, the thermo-reflectance thermography system is used to
non-invasively measure with submicron resolution the 2D surface temperature
field of an activated device. The measured temperature field is then used as
input for an ultra-fast inverse computational solution to fully characterize
the thermal behavior of the complex three-dimensional device. For the purposes
of this investigation, basic micro-heater devices were built, activated, and
measured. In order to quantitatively validate the coupled
experimental-computational system, the system was used to extract geometric
features of a known device, thus assessing the system's ability to combine
measured experimental results and computations to fully characterize complex 3D
electronic devices.
