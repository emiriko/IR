We summarise recent results for the chiral Random Two-Matrix Theory
constructed to describe QCD in the epsilon-regime with imaginary chemical
potential. The virtue of this theory is that unquenched Lattice simulations can
be used to determine both low energy constants Sigma and F in the leading order
chiral Lagrangian, due to their respective coupling to quark mass and chemical
potential. We briefly recall the analytic formulas for all density and
individual eigenvalue correlations and then illustrate them in detail in the
simplest, quenched case with imaginary isospin chemical potential. Some
peculiarities are pointed out for this example: i) the factorisation of density
and individual eigenvalue correlation functions for large chemical potential
and ii) the factorisation of the non-Gaussian weight function of bi-orthogonal
polynomials into Gaussian weights with ordinary orthogonal polynomials.
