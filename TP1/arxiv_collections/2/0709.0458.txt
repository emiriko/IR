A LED flasher has been developed for TUNKA-133 EAS Cherenkov detector. A blue
ultra bright InGaN LED is used as a light source in the flasher. The flasher's
driver is based on a fast discharge of a small capacitor via a complementary
pair of fast RF transistors. The light yield of the flasher is adjusted in the
wide range of from 0 to up to 10**9 photons per pulse. The results of studies
of the flasher's amplitude and timing parameters and their stability are
presented.
