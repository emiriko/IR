We study the one-dimensional Hubbard model with nearest-neighbor and
next-nearest-neighbor hopping integrals by using the density-matrix
renormalization group (DMRG) method and Hartree-Fock approximation. Based on
the calculated results for the spin gap, total-spin quantum number, and
Tomonaga-Luttinger-liquid parameter, we determine the ground-state phase
diagram of the model in the entire filling and wide parameter region. We show
that, in contrast to the weak-coupling regime where a spin-gapped liquid phase
is predicted in the region with four Fermi points, the spin gap vanishes in a
substantial region in the strong-coupling regime. It is remarkable that a large
variety of phases, such as the paramagnetic metallic phase, spin-gapped liquid
phase, singlet and triplet superconducting phases, and fully polarized
ferromagnetic phase, appear in such a simple model in the strong-coupling
regime.
