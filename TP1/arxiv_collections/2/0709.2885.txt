Competition between the vortex lattice and a lattice of asymmetric artificial
defects is shown to play a crucial role in ratchet experiments in
superconducting films. We present a novel and collective mechanism for current
reversal based on a reconfiguration of the vortex lattice. In contrast to
previous models of vortex current reversal, the mechanism is based on the
global response of the vortex lattice to external forces.
