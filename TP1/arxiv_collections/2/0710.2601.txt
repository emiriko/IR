We discuss the implications of new physics, which modifies the matter effect
in neutrino oscillations, to long baseline experiments, particularly the MINOS
experiment. An analytic formula in the presence of such a new physics
interaction is derived for $P(\nu_\mu\to\nu_e)$, which is exact in the limit
$\Delta m^2_{21}\to0$.
