We demonstrate a flux locking technique using injected heat current to
linearize the output of a superfluid helium-4 interferometer. A rotation flux
through the interferometer loop produces a shift in the phase of the superfluid
order parameter. This shift is nullified via negative feedback by a phase-shift
caused by the injected heat current. The feedback signal is then a linear
function of rotation flux.
