We derive the dynamical mean-field theory equations for transport in an
ordered charge-density-wave phase on a bipartite lattice. The formalism is
applied to the spinless Falicov-Kimball model on a hypercubic lattice at half
filling. We determine the many-body density of states, the dc charge and heat
conductivities, and the optical conductivity. Vertex corrections continue to
vanish within the ordered phase, but the density of states and the transport
coefficients show anomalous behavior due to the rapid development of thermally
activated subgap states. We also examine the optical sum rule and sum rules for
the first three moments of the Green's functions within the ordered phase and
see that the total optical spectral weight in the ordered phase either
decreases or increases depending on the strength of the interactions.
