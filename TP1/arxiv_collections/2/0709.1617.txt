We calculate the frequency and damping of the scissors mode in a classical
gas as a function of temperature and coupling strength. Our results show good
agreement with the main features observed in recent measurements of the
scissors mode in an ultracold gas of $^6$Li atoms. The comparison between
theory and experiment involves no fitting parameters and thus allows an
identification of non-classical effects at and near the unitarity limit.
