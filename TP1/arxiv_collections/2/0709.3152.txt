The visibility of the shell-focusing singularity in Szekeres space-time -
which represents quasi-spherical dust collapse - has been studied on numerous
occasions in the context of the cosmic censorship conjecture. The various
results derived have assumed that there exist radial null geodesics in the
space-time. We show that such geodesics do not exist in general, and so
previous results on the visibility of the singularity are not generally valid.
More precisely, we show that the existence of a radial geodesic in Szekeres
space-time implies that the space-time is axially symmetric, with the geodesic
along the polar direction (i.e. along the axis of symmetry). If there is a
second non-parallel radial geodesic, then the space-time is spherically
symmetric, and so is a Lema\^{\i}tre-Tolman-Bondi (LTB) space-time. For the
case of the polar geodesic in an axially symmetric Szekeres space-time, we give
conditions on the free functions (i.e. initial data) of the space-time which
lead to visibility of the singularity along this direction. Likewise, we give a
sufficient condition for censorship of the singularity. We point out the
complications involved in addressing the question of visibility of the
singularity both for non-radial null geodesics in the axially symmetric case
and in the general (non-axially symmetric) case, and suggest a possible
approach.
