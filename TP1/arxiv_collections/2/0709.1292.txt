We study analytically the metal-insulator transition in a disordered
conductor by combining the self-consistent theory of localization with the one
parameter scaling theory. We provide explicit expressions of the critical
exponents and the critical disorder as a function of the spatial
dimensionality, $d$. The critical exponent $\nu$ controlling the divergence of
the localization length at the transition is found to be $\nu = {1 \over 2}+ {1
\over {d-2}}$. This result confirms that the upper critical dimension is
infinity. Level statistics are investigated in detail. We show that the two
level correlation function decays exponentially and the number variance is
linear with a slope which is an increasing function of the spatial
dimensionality.
