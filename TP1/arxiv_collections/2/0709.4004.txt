We show that the rate of charged-current muon-neutrino events with a hard
internal bremsstrahlung photon is consistent with the excess electron-neutrino
candidate events reported by the MiniBoone and LSND (decay in flight)
experiments. Hard photons radiated by the muon leg in charged-current neutrino
interactions (neutrino-Nucleon->muon+gamma+nucleon) are a significant source of
background that should be considered by current and future muon-neutrino to
electron-neutrino neutrino oscillations appearance experiments (e.g. LSND,
MiniBoone, SuperK, MINOS, T2K and NOVA).
