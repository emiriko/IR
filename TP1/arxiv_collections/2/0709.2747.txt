Spin squeezing of a nonlinear interaction model with Josephson-like coupling
is studied to obtain time scale of maximal squeezing. Based upon two exactly
solvable cases for two and three particles, we find that the maximal-squeezing
time depends on the level spacing between the ground state and its next
neighbor eigenstate.
