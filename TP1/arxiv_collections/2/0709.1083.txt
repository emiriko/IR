The phase structure of neutral two-flavor quark matter at nonzero temperature
is studied. Our analysis is performed within the framework of a gauged
Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model and the mean-field approximation. We compute the free
energy of the gluonic phase (gluonic cylindrical phase II) in a self-consistent
manner and investigate the phase transition from the gluonic phase to the
2SC/g2SC/NQ phases. We briefly consider the phase diagram in the plane of
coupling strength versus temperature and discuss the mixed phase consisting of
the normal quark and 2SC phases.
