I propose a simple explanation of the ``ridge'' seen in the near-side jet
two-particle correlation function in heavy ion collisions at RHIC. This could
be a cumulative shock wave produced in liquid-like matter by an energetic
stopped parton. Splash of liquid in the direction opposite to the fast
penetrating object is a known effect. In nucleus-nucleus collision the trigger
is an escaped non-interacting parton. Partner parton could be stopped in the
medium forming a conical-like shock wave with density depletion behind the
stopped parton. In the proposed scenario shock waves will move in three
directions: two waves will form a correlation structure at angles differ from
phi = 3.14 radians and are usually called a Mach Cone. The other direction is
exactly opposite to the original direction of stopping parton. The wide
rapidity distribution of the ridge is caused by the rapidity swing of the
away-side jet and longitudinal expansion of the system along the beam
direction. The calculation of such a shock wave is very complicated, but some
phenomenological observables could be explained and predicted.
