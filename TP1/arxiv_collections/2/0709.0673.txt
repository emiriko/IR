We present a search for excited neutrinos and electrons using all data
collected by the H1 experiment at HERA at a center-of-mass energy of 320 GeV
with an integrated luminosity of up to 435 pb$^{-1}$. No evidence for excited
neutrino or electron production is found. Mass dependent exclusion limits are
determined for the ratio of the coupling to the compositeness scale,
$f/{\Lambda}$. These limits greatly extend the excluded region to higher masses
than has been possible in previous searches.
