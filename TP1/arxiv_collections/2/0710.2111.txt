If long lived charged particles exist, and produced at the LHC, they may
travel with velocity significantly slower than the speed of light. This unique
signature was not considered during the design of the LHC experiments, ATLAS
and CMS. As a result, hardware and trigger capabilities need to be evaluated.
Model independent approaches for finding long lived particles with the LHC
experiments are introduced. They are tested using two bench marks, one in GMSB
and one in Split SUSY. The focus is on hardware and trigger issues, as well as
reconstruction methods developed by ATLAS and CMS. Both experiments suggest
time of flight (TOF) based methods. However, the implementation is different.
In ATLAS a first beta estimation is done already at the trigger level. CMS also
uses dE/dx to estimate beta.
