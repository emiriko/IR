We investigate the quantum evolution of the metric operators for Bianchi-Type
I model universes in the Heisenberg picture in order to remove the need to
consider the wave function of the universe and interpret its "spin" variables.
The calculation is analogous to that of the Zitterbewegung of the Dirac
electron. We consider the behavior of the metric near the classical
singularity, and consider the curvature there. Although factor ordering
questions preclude the presentation of an unambiguous result for the curvature
invariants, it does seem that the classical $t^{-4}$ divergence of the
Kretschmann scalar is not removed by quantization.
