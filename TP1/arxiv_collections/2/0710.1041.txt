A classical result of Kemperman gives a complete recursive description of the
structure of those subsets $A$ and $B$ of an abelian group that fail to satisfy
the triangle inequality, i.e., $|A+B|<|A|+|B|$. In this paper, we achieve the
complete description in the case when equality holds: $|A+B|=|A|+|B|$.
