In 1926 Emil Rupp published a number of papers on the interference properties
of light emitted by canal ray sources. These articles, particularly one paper
that came into being in collaboration with Albert Einstein, drew quite some
attention as they probed the wave versus particle nature of light. They also
significantly propelled Rupp's career, even though that from the outset they
were highly controversial. This article will review this episode, and in
particular Rupp's collaboration with Einstein. Evidence that Rupp forged his
results is presented and their critical reception in the socially and
politically divided German physics community is discussed. These divisions fail
to explain the full dynamic; the latter is attempted by turning to the role
that theoretical bias on occasion has in assessing experiment. Einstein's
responses in particular are analyzed in this context.
