It is shown that after reflection from a lossy medium the $s$- or
$p$-polarized paraxial light beam carrying the orbital angular momentum suffers
the 2D shift of the beam's centre of gravity relative the geometric optic axis.
The mutually orthogonal components of this shift are expressed through the real
and imaginary parts of the common complex quantity. The features of the 2D
vector, which describes the shift, are analyzed.
