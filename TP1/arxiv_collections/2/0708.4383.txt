We investigate the potential of the ILC for measuring anomalous quartic gauge
couplings, both in production of three electroweak gauge bosons as well as in
vector boson scattering. Any new physics that could possibly couple to the
electroweak gauge bosons is classified according to its spin and isospin
quantum numbers and parameterized in terms of resonance parameters like masses,
widths, magnetic moment form factors etc. By a maximum log-likelihood fit, the
discovery reach of a 1 TeV ILC for scalar, vector and tensor resonances is
examined.
