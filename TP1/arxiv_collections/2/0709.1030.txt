A study is presented illustrating the excellent potential of future
  International Linear Collider (ILC) experiments to detect metastable staus
$\stau$, measure precisely their mass and lifetime, and to determine the mass
of the gravitino $\sG$ from the decay $\stau\to\tau\sG$, thus providing direct
access to the gravitational coupling, respectively Planck scale.
