We explore the quantum-classical crossover in the behaviour of a quantum
field mode. The quantum behaviour of a two-state system - a qubit - coupled to
the field is used as a probe. Collapse and revival of the qubit inversion form
the signature for quantum behaviour of the field and continuous Rabi
oscillations form the signature for classical behaviour of the field. We
demonstrate both limits in a single model for the full coupled system, for
states with the same average field strength, and so for qubits with the same
Rabi frequency.
