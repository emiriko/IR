We do not have the ability to perform precise calculations of long-range
strong interaction effects, because the effective QCD coupling is not small and
so we cannot use perturbation theory. Nevertheless, I show that we know a lot,
though not nearly enough. As a measure of our lack of knowledge, the best
prediction for the total cross section at LHC energy is 125 +/- 25 mb.
