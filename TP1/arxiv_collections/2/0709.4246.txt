We present analysis of the interacting quantum wire problem in the presence
of magnetic field and spin-orbital interaction. We show that an interesting
interplay of Zeeman and spin-orbit terms, facilitated by the electron-electron
interaction, results in the spin-density wave (SDW) state when the magnetic
field and spin-orbit axes are orthogonal. We show that this instability is
enhanced in a closely related problem of Heisenberg spin chain with asymmetric
uniform Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction. Magnetic field in the direction
perpendicular to the DM anisotropy axis results in staggered long-range
magnetic order along the orthogonal to the applied field direction. We explore
consequences of the uniform DM interaction for the electron spin resonance
(ESR) measurements, and point out that they provide way to probe right- and
left-moving excitations of the spin chain separately.
