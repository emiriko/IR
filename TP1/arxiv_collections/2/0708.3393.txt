We study the supersymmetric circular Wilson loops in N=4 Yang-Mills theory.
Their vacuum expectation values are computed in the parameter region that
admits smooth bubbling geometry duals. The results are a prediction for the
supergravity action evaluated on the bubbling geometries for Wilson loops.
