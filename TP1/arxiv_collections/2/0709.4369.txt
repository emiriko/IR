In this letter we study fermionic zero modes in gauge and gravity backgrounds
taking a two dimensional compact manifold $S^2$ as extra dimensions. The result
is that there exist massless Dirac fermions which have normalizable zero modes
under quite general assumptions about these backgrounds on the bulk. Several
special cases of gauge background on the sphere are discussed and some simple
fermionic zero modes are obtained.
