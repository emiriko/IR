A physical-mathematical approach to anomalous diffusion may be based on
fractional diffusion equations and related random walk models. The fundamental
solutions of these equations can be interpreted as probability densities
evolving in time of peculiar self-similar stochastic processes: an integral
representation of these solutions is here presented. A more general approach to
anomalous diffusion is known to be provided by the master equation for a
continuous time random walk (CTRW). We show how this equation reduces to our
fractional diffusion equation by a properly scaled passage to the limit of
compressed waiting times and jump widths. Finally, we describe a method of
simulation and display (via graphics) results of a few numerical case studies.
