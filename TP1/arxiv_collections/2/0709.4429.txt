We introduce an alternative approach to the first-principles calculation of
NMR shielding tensors. These are obtained from the derivative of the orbital
magnetization with respect to the application of a microscopic, localized
magnetic dipole. The approach is simple, general, and can be applied to either
isolated or periodic systems. Calculated results for simple hydrocarbons,
crystalline diamond, and liquid water show very good agreement with established
methods and experimental results.
