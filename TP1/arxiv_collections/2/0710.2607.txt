We present selected recent results of the QCDSF collaboration on the
localization and dimensionality of low overlap eigenmodes and of the
topological density in the quenched SU(3) vacuum. We discuss the correlations
between the topological structure revealed by overlap fermions without
filtering and the confining monopole and P-vortex structure obtained in the
Indirect Maximal Center Gauge.
