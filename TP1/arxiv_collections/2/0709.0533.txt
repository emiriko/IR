Torsional harmonic cantilevers allow measurement of time varying tip-sample
forces in tapping-mode atomic force microscopy. Accuracy of these force
measurements is important for quantitative nanomechanical measurements. Here we
demonstrate a method to convert the torsional deflection signals into a
calibrated force waveform with the use of non-linear dynamical response of the
tapping cantilever. Specifically the transitions between steady oscillation
regimes are used to calibrate the torsional deflection signals.
