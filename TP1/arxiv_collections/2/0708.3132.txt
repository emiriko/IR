We discuss a Casimir force due to zero-temperature quantum fluctuations in a
weakly interacting Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) with a strong harmonic trap.
The results show that the presence of a strong harmonic trap changes the power
law behavior of Casimir force due to the dimensional reduction effect. At
finite temperature, we calculate Casimir force due to thermal fluctuation and
find an exotic temperature dependent behavior in the first order term. Finally,
we speculate some possible experimental realization and detection of the force
in future experiments.
