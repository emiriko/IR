The wavelet transform modulus maxima (WTMM) used in the singularity analysis
of one fractal function is extended to study the fractal correlation of two
multifractal functions. The technique is developed in the framework of joint
partition function analysis (JPFA) proposed by Meneveau et al. [1] and is shown
to be equally effective. In addition, we show that another leading approach
developed for the same purpose, namely, relative multifractal analysis, can be
considered as a special case of JPFA at a particular parameter setting.
