We consider regularisation of a Yang-Mills theory by Dimensional Reduction
(DRED). In particular, the anomalous dimensions of fermion masses and gauge
coupling are computed to four-loop order. We put special emphasis on the
treatment of evanescent couplings which appear when DRED is applied to
non-supersymmetric theories. We highlight the importance of distinguishing
between the evanescent and the real couplings. Considering the special case of
a Super-Yang-Mills theory, we find that Dimensional Reduction is sufficient to
preserve Supersymmetry in our calculations.
