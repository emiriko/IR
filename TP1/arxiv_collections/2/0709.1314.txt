We consider the propagation of a classical electromagnetic wave through a
transmission line, formed by identical superconducting charge qubits inside a
superconducting resonator. Since the qubits can be in a coherent superposition
of quantum states, we show that such a system demonstrates interesting new
effects, such as a ``breathing'' photonic crystal with an oscillating bandgap,
and a ``quantum Archimedean screw'' that transports, at an arbitrary controlled
velocity, Josephson plasma waves through the transmission line. The key
ingredient of these effects is that the optical properties of the Josephson
transmission line are controlled by the quantum coherent state of the qubits.
