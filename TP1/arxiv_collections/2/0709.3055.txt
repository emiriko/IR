The asymptotic survival probability of a spherical target in the presence of
a single subdiffusive trap or surrounded by a sea of subdiffusive traps in a
continuous Euclidean medium is calculated. In one and two dimensions the
survival probability of the target in the presence of a single trap decays to
zero as a power law and as a power law with logarithmic correction,
respectively. The target is thus reached with certainty, but it takes the trap
an infinite time on average to do so. In three dimensions a single trap may
never reach the target and so the survival probability is finite and, in fact,
does not depend on whether the traps move diffusively or subdiffusively. When
the target is surrounded by a sea of traps, on the other hand, its survival
probability decays as a stretched exponential in all dimensions (with a
logarithmic correction in the exponent for $d=2$). A trap will therefore reach
the target with certainty, and will do so in a finite time. These results may
be directly related to enzyme binding kinetics on DNA in the crowded cellular
environment.
