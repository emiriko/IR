Information overload in the modern society calls for highly efficient
recommendation algorithms. In this letter we present a novel diffusion based
recommendation model, with users' ratings built into a transition matrix. To
speed up computation we introduce a Green function method. The numerical tests
on a benchmark database show that our prediction is superior to the standard
recommendation methods.
