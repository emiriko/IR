This article is presented new method of description information systems in
abstract 4-dimensional pseudo-Euclidean information space (4-DPIES) with using
special relativity (SR) methods. This purpose core postulates of existence
4-DPIES are formulated. The theorem setting existence criteria of the invariant
velocity of the information transference is formulated and proved. One more
theorem allowed relating discrete parameters of information and continuous
space-time treating and also row of supplementary theorems is formulated and
proved. For description of dynamics and interaction of information, in article
is introduced general parameter of information - generalized information
emotion (GIE), reminding simultaneously on properties the mass and the charge.
At performing calculation of information observable parameters in the
information space is introduced continual integration methods of Feynman. The
applying idea about existence of GIE as measures of the information inertness
and the interaction carrier, and using continual integration methods of Feynman
can be calculated probability of information process in 4-DPIES. In this frame
presented approach has allowed considering information systems when interest is
presented with information processes, their related with concrete definition
without necessity. The relation between 4-DPIES and real systems parameters is
set at modelling of matching between observable processes and real phenomena
from information interpretation.
