For any classical field configuration or mechanical system with a finite
number of degrees of freedom we introduce the concept of topological spectrum.
It is based upon the assumption that for any classical configuration there
exists a principle fiber bundle that contains all the physical and geometric
information of the configuration. The topological spectrum follows from the
investigation of the corresponding topological invariants. Examples are given
which illustrate the procedure and the significance of the topological spectrum
as a discretization relationship among the parameters that determine the
physical meaning of classical configurations.
