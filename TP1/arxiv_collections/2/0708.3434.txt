We give an example of two rational functions with non-equal Julia sets that
generate a rational semigroup whose completely invariant Julia set is a closed
line segment. We also give an example of polynomials with unequal Julia sets
that generate a non nearly Abelian polynomial semigroup with the property that
the Julia set of one generator is equal to the Julia set of the semigroup.
These examples show that certain conjectures in the field of dynamics of
rational semigroups do not hold as stated and therefore require the allowance
of certain exceptional cases.
