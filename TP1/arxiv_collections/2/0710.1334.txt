The spin anisotropic exchange interaction is suggested to contribute
significantly to the abnormal upturn of the magnetic susceptibility in the
ZnCu$_3$(OH)$_6$Cl$_2$. The saturation of the magnetic susceptibility below 300
mK observed in the muon spin resonance ($\mu$SR) experiment is the quantum
effect of the spin flipping process.
