We establish first parts of a tropical intersection theory. Namely, we define
cycles, Cartier divisors and intersection products between these two (without
passing to rational equivalence) and discuss push-forward and pull-back. We do
this first for fans in R^n and then for "abstract" cycles that are fans
locally. With regard to applications in enumerative geometry, we finally have a
look at rational equivalence and intersection products of cycles and cycle
classes in R^n.
