String landscape ideas and the observation of a positive vacuum energy in the
current universe suggest that there could be a future transition to an exactly
supersymmetric world. Atomic and molecular binding in this susy background
probably require that electroweak symmetry breaking survives the transition.
Among several susy higgs models that have been discussed, one stands out in
this regard. Thus, the higgs structure that is revealed at the LHC could have
strong consequences for the type of bulk matter that may arise in a future susy
universe.
