We study the structure of satisfying assignments of a random 3-SAT formula.
In particular, we show that a random formula of density 4.453 or higher almost
surely has no non-trivial "core" assignments. Core assignments are certain
partial assignments that can be extended to satisfying assignments, and have
been studied recently in connection with the Survey Propagation heuristic for
random SAT. Their existence implies the presence of clusters of solutions, and
they have been shown to exist with high probability below the satisfiability
threshold for k-SAT with k>8, by Achlioptas and Ricci-Tersenghi, STOC 2006. Our
result implies that either this does not hold for 3-SAT or the threshold
density for satisfiability in 3-SAT lies below 4.453.
  The main technical tool that we use is a novel simple application of the
first moment method.
