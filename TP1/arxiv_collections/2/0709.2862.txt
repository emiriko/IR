Electromagnetic metamaterials provide unprecedented freedom and flexibility
to introduce new devices, which control electromagnetic wave propagation in
very unusual ways. Very recently theoretical design of an "invisibility cloak"
has been suggested, which has been realized at microwave frequencies in a
two-dimensional cylindrical geometry. In this communication we report on the
experimental realization of the dielectric permittivity distribution required
for non-magnetic cloaking in the visible frequency range.
