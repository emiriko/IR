We consider two-species of fermions in a rotating trap that interact via an
s-wave Feshbach resonance, at total Landau level filling factor two (or one for
each species). We show that the system undergoes a quantum phase transition
from a fermion integer quantum Hall state to a boson fractional quantum Hall
state as the pairing interaction strength increases, with the transition
occurring near the resonance. The effective field theory for the transition is
shown to be that of a (emergent) massless relativistic bosonic field coupled to
a Chern-Simons gauge field, with the coupling giving rise to semionic
statistics to the emergent particles.
