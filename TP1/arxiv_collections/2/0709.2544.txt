In this paper we compute electroweak contributions to the production of
squark pairs at hadron colliders. These include the exchange of electroweak
gauge bosons in the s-channel as well as electroweak gaugino exchange in the t-
and/or u-channel. In many cases these can interfere with the dominant QCD
contributions. As a result, we find sizable contributions to the production of
two SU(2) doublet squarks. At the LHC, they amount to 10 to 20% for typical
mSUGRA (or CMSSM) scenarios, but in more general scenarios they can vary
between -40 and +55%, depending on size and sign of the SU(2) gaugino mass. The
electroweak contribution to the total squark pair production rate at the LHC is
about 3.5 times smaller.
