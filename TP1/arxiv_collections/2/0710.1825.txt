In this paper we study the first law of thermodynamics for the (2+1)
dimensional charged BTZ black hole considering a pair of thermodinamical
systems constructed with the two horizons of this solution. We show that these
two systems are similar to the right and left movers of string theory and that
the temperature associated with the black hole is the harmonic mean of the
temperatures associated with these two systems.
