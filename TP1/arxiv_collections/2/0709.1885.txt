The local electronic structure on nanoscale chains is investigated
theoretically. We propose a mechanism to explain the even-odd oscillation of
length distribution of atom chains. We study the spatial peak structure as
obtained by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) constant-current topography as
a function of the electron-electron interaction, band filling and temperature.
The site-dependent magnetic moment is also examined.
