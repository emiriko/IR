The deeply virtual Compton scattering reaction has been investigated in the
Hall A of the Jefferson Laboratory by measuring longitudinally polarized
(e,e'gamma) cross sections, in the valence quark region, for protons and
neutrons. In the proton channel, experimental results strongly support the
factorization of the cross section at Q2 as low as 2 GeV2, opening the path to
systematic measurements of generalized parton distributions (GPDs). In the
neutron case, preliminary data show sensitivity to the angular momentum of
quarks.
