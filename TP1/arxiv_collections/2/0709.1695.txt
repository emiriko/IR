We address soliton formation at the edge of chirped optical lattices
imprinted in Kerr-type nonlinear media. We find families of power thresholdless
surface waves that do not exist at other types of lattice interfaces. Such
solitons form due to combined action of internal reflection at the interface,
distributed Bragg-type reflection, and focusing nonlinearity. Remarkably, we
discover that surfaces of chirped lattices are soliton attractors: Below an
energy threshold, solitons launched well within the lattice self-bend toward
the interface, and then stick to it.
