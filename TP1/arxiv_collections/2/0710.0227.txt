We develop a random-matrix model of two-dimensional dielectric resonators
which combines internal wave chaos with the deterministic Fresnel laws for
reflection and refraction at the interfaces. The model is used to investigate
the statistics of the laser threshold and line width (lifetime and Petermann
factor of the resonances) when the resonator is filled with an active medium.
The laser threshold decreases for increasing refractive index $n$ and is
smaller for TM polarization than for TE polarization, but is almost independent
of the number of out-coupling modes $N$. The Petermann factor in the line width
of the longest-living resonance also decreases for increasing $n$ and scales as
$\sqrt{N}$, but is less sensitive to polarization. For resonances of
intermediate lifetime, the Petermann factor scales linearly with $N$. These
qualitative parametric dependencies are consistent with the random-matrix
theory of resonators with small openings. However, for a small refractive index
where the resonators are very open, the details of the statistics become
non-universal. This is demonstrated by comparison with a particular dynamical
model.
