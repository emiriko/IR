A variational ground state of the repulsive Hubbard model on a square lattice
is investigated numerically for an intermediate coupling strength (U = 8t) and
for moderate sizes (from 6 x 6 to 10 x 10). Our ansatz is clearly superior to
other widely used variational wave functions. The results for order parameters
and correlation functions provide new insight for the antiferromagnetic state
at half filling as well as strong evidence for a superconducting phase away
from half filling.
