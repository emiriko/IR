Exact solutions of the Schrodinger equation describing a freely expanding
Lieb-Liniger (LL) gas of delta-interacting bosons in one spatial dimension are
constructed. The many-body wave function is obtained by transforming a fully
antisymmetric (fermionic) time-dependent wave function which obeys the
Schrodinger equation for a free gas. This transformation employs a differential
Fermi-Bose mapping operator which depends on the strength of the interaction
and the number of particles.
