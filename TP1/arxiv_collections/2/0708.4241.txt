We discuss the properties of light pseudoscalar particles, the so-called
pseudoaxions, within Little Higgs models, focusing on their phenomenology at
the ILC. We especially discuss a method of how to distinguish between the two
basic classes of Little Higgs models, the product and simple group models, by a
specific production channel and decay mode. These are strictly forbidden in the
product group models.
