This note states a conjecture for Nevanlinna theory or diophantine
approximation, with a sheaf of ideals in place of the normal crossings divisor.
This is done by using a correction term involving a multiplier ideal sheaf.
This new conjecture trivially implies earlier conjectures in Nevanlinna theory
or diophantine approximation, and in fact is equivalent to these conjectures.
Although it does not provide anything new, it may be a more convenient
formulation for some applications.
