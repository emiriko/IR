The Spiral Model (SM) corresponds to a new class of kinetically constrained
models introduced in joint works with D.S. Fisher [8,9]. They provide the first
example of finite dimensional models with an ideal glass-jamming transition.
This is due to an underlying jamming percolation transition which has
unconventional features: it is discontinuous (i.e. the percolating cluster is
compact at the transition) and the typical size of the clusters diverges faster
than any power law, leading to a Vogel-Fulcher-like divergence of the
relaxation time. Here we present a detailed physical analysis of SM, see [5]
for rigorous proofs. We also show that our arguments for SM does not need any
modification contrary to recent claims of Jeng and Schwarz [10].
