We consider a diffusion process on the edges of a finite network and allow
for feedback effects between different, possibly non-adjacent edges. This
generalizes the setting that is common in the literature, where the only
considered interactions take place at the boundary, i. e., in the nodes of the
network. We discuss well-posedness of the associated initial value problem as
well as contractivity and positivity properties of its solutions. Finally, we
discuss qualitative properties that can be formulated in terms of invariance of
linear subspaces of the state space, i. e., of symmetries of the associated
physical system. Applications to a neurobiological model as well as to a system
of linear Schroedinger equations on a quantum graph are discussed.
