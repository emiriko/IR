It is a matter of common knowledge that the field of gravitation influences
the propagation of light, but the question to which extent electromagnetic
fields do something similar is not completely answered. The birefringence
caused by electric and magnetic fields is subject of several articles in
Quantumelectrodynamics, but the absolute refractive index is discussed rather
rarely.
  Some hypothetical considerations about the feasibility of an experiment to
analyze the refractive index in electromagnetic fields were given in a former
article by the same author. A first experimental test is reported now. Perhaps
an evidence for an influence of an electric field on the refractive index was
found, but the result is not reliable enough to claim already, that the
influence was seen - but it should encourage to perform further measurements
with different methods of higher precision.
