A subspace of a multipartite Hilbert space is completely entangled if it
contains no product states. Such subspaces can be large with a known maximum
size, S, approaching the full dimension of the system, D. We show that almost
all subspaces with dimension less than or equal to S are completely entangled,
and then use this fact to prove that n random pure quantum states are
unambiguously locally distinguishable if and only if n does not exceed D-S.
This condition holds for almost all sets of states of all multipartite systems,
and reveals something surprising. The criterion is identical for separable and
for nonseparable states: entanglement makes no difference.
