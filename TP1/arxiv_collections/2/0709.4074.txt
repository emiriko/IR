We comment on the consistence of the epsilon anti-symmetric tensor adopted in
[R. Banerjee and S. Kulkarni, arXiv:0707.2449] when it is generalized in the
general case where $\sqrt{-g} \neq 1$. It is pointed out that the correct
non-minimal consistent gauge and gravitational anomalies should by multiplied a
factor $\sqrt{-g} \neq 1$. We also sketch the generalization of their work to
the $\sqrt{-g} \neq 1$ case.
