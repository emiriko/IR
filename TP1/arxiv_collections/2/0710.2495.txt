We show a continuity theorem for Stinespring's dilation: two completely
positive maps between arbitrary C*-algebras are close in cb-norm iff we can
find corresponding dilations that are close in operator norm. The proof
establishes the equivalence of the cb-norm distance and the Bures distance for
completely positive maps. We briefly discuss applications to quantum
information theory.
