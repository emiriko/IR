Here, RS-II model of brane-gravity is considerd for phantom universe using
non-linear equation of stste. Phantom fluid is known to violate the weak energy
condition. In this paper, it is found that this characteristic of phantom
energy is affected drastically by the negative brane-tension $\lambda$ of the
RS-II model. It is interesting to see that upto a certain value of energy
density $\rho$ satisfying $\rho/\lambda < 1$, weak energy condition is violated
and universe super-accelerates. But as $\rho$ increases more, only strong
energy condition is violated and universe accelerates. When $1 < \rho/\lambda
<2$, even strong energy condition is not violated and universe decelerates.
Expansion of the universe stops, when $\rho = 2 \lambda$. This is contrary to
earlier results of phantom universe exhibiting acceleration only.
