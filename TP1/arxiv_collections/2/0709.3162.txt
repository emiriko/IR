Some new class of Chaplygin wormholes are investigated in the framework of a
Chaplygin gas with equation of state $ p = - \frac{A}{\rho}$, $A>0$. Since
empty spacetime ($ p = \rho = 0 $) does not follow Chaplygin gas, so the
interior Chaplygin wormhole solutions will never asymptotically flat. For this
reason, we have to match our interior wormhole solution with an exterior vacuum
solution i.e. Schwarzschild solution at some junction interface, say $ r = a $.
We also discuss the total amount of matter characterized by Chaplygin gas that
supplies fuel to construct a wormhole.
