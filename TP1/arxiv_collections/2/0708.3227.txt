We investigate the gel formation from the equilibrium sol phase in a simple
model that has the characteristics of (colloidal) gel-forming systems at a
finite temperature. At low volume fraction and low temperatures, particles are
linked by long-living bonds and form an open percolating network. By means of
molecular dynamics simulations, we study the lifetime of bonds and nodes of the
gel network in order to relate these quantities to the complex relaxation
dynamics observed.
