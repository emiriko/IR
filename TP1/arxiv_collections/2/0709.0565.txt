A Schroedinger type equation on the superspace R^{D|2n} is studied, which
involves a potential inversely proportional to the negative of the osp(D|2n)
invariant "distance" away from the origin. An osp(2,D+1|2n) dynamical
supersymmetry for the system is explicitly constructed, and the bound states of
the system are shown to form an irreducible highest weight module for this
superalgebra. A thorough understanding of the structure of the irreducible
module is obtained. This in particular enables the determination of the energy
eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenspaces as well as their respective
dimensions.
