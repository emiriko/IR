Motivated by a recent measurement of proton-proton elastic scattering
observables up to 3.0 GeV, we investigate the description of those data within
models of the nucleon-nucleon (NN) interaction valid above the pion production
threshold. In addition to including the well known Delta resonance we
incorporate two low-lying N* resonances, the N*(1440) and the N*(1535), and
study their influence on pp and np observables for projectile laboratory
kinetic energies up to 1.5 GeV.
