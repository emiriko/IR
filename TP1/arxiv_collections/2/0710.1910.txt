Coincidence experiments on EPR pairs show strong violations of Bell's
Inequalities at certain filter settings which is widely believed to mean that
local hidden variable models cannot explain these results. In this paper it is
shown that the 'non-separable' singlet density matrix can be represented as a
sum of separable density matrices which are products of individual
non-hermitian spin operator states. This decomposition is consistent with the
intuitive notion that after separation from the singlet the two physical
systems should be described by a product state. In spite of the
non-hermiticity, the values of the relevant spin observables are real. A new
local hidden variable model inspired by this decomposition is discussed.
