The LU-LC conjecture is an important open problem concerning the structure of
entanglement of states described in the stabilizer formalism. It states that
two local unitary equivalent stabilizer states are also local Clifford
equivalent. If this conjecture were true, the local equivalence of stabilizer
states would be extremely easy to characterize. Unfortunately, however, based
on the recent progress made by Gross and Van den Nest, we find that the
conjecture is false.
