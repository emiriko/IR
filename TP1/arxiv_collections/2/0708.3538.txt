Working in the physics of Wilson factor and Aharonov-Bohm effect, we find in
the fluxtube-quark system the topology of a baryon consisting three heavy
flavor quarks resembles that of the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) in
condensed matter. This similarity yields the result that the constituent quarks
of baryon have the "filling factor" 1/3, thus the previous conjecture that
quark confinement is a correlation effect was confirmed. Moreover, by deriving
a Hamiltonian of the system analogous to that of FQHE, we predict an energy gap
for the ground state of a heavy three-quark system.
