LHC predictions for the charm and bottom nuclear modification factors using
pQCD and AdS/CFT drag energy loss models are given. We show that a new
observable, the double ratio of charm to bottom nuclear modification factors,
allows for easy experimental distinction between the two classes of energy loss
models.
