Comparative genomics methods are widely used to aid the functional annotation
of non coding DNA regions. However, aligning non coding sequences requires new
algorithms and strategies, in order to take into account extensive
rearrangements and turnover during evolution. Here we present a novel large
scale alignment strategy which aims at drawing a precise map of conserved non
coding regions between genomes, even when these regions have undergone small
scale rearrangments events and a certain degree of sequence variability. We
applied our alignment approach to obtain a genome-wide catalogue of conserved
non coding blocks (CNBs) between Drosophila melanogaster and 11 other
Drosophila species. Interestingly, we observe numerous small scale
rearrangement events, such as local inversions, duplications and
translocations, which are not observable in the whole genome alignments
currently available. The high rate of observed low scale reshuffling show that
this database of CNBs can constitute the starting point for several
investigations, related to the evolution of regulatory DNA in Drosophila and
the in silico identification of unannotated functional elements.
