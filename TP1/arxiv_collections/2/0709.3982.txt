We consider one-dimensional asymmetric exclusion processes with a simple
attractive interaction, where the distance between consecutive particles is not
allowed to exceed a certain limit and investigate the consequences of this
coupling on the transport properties in the presence of random-force type
disorder by means of a phenomenological random trap picture. In the
phase-separated steady state of the model defined on a finite ring, the
properties of the density profile are studied and the exponent governing the
decay of the current with the system size in the biased phase is derived. In
case all consecutive particles are coupled with each other and form a closed
string, the current is found to be enhanced compared to the model without
coupling, while if groups of consecutive particles form finite strings, the
current is reduced. The motion of a semi-infinite string entering an initially
empty lattice is also studied. Here, the diffusion of the head of the string is
found to be anomalous, and two phases can be distinguished, which are
characterised by different functional dependences of the diffusion exponent on
the bias. The obtained results are checked by numerical simulation.
