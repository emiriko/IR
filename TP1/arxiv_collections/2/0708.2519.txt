Using neutron scattering techniques, we have studied incommensurate spin
ordering as well as low energy spin dynamics in single crystal underdoped \LBCO
with x$\sim$0.095 and 0.08; high temperature superconductors with T$_C \sim$ 27
K and 29 K respectively. Static two dimensional incommensurate magnetic order
appears below T$_N$=39.5 $\pm$ 0.3 K in \LBCO (x=0.095) and a similar
temperature for x=0.08 within the low temperature tetragonal phase. The spin
order is unaffected by either the onset of superconductivity or the application
of magnetic fields of up to 7 Tesla applied along the c-axis in the x=0.095
sample. Such magnetic field {\it independent} behaviour is in marked contrast
with the field induced enhancement of the staggered magnetisation observed in
the related \LSCO system, indicating this phenomenon is not a universal
property of cuprate superconductors. Surprisingly, we find that
incommensurability $\delta $ is only weakly dependent on doping relative to
\LSCO. Dispersive excitations in \LBCO (x=0.095) at the same incommensurate
wavevector persist up to at least 60 K. The dynamical spin susceptibility of
the low energy spin excitations saturates below \tc, in a similar manner to
that seen in the superconducting state of La$_2$CuO$_{4+y}$.
