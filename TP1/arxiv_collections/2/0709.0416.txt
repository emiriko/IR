Three versions of the Freiheitssatz are proved in the context of one-relator
quotients of limit groups, where the latter are equipped with 1-acylindrical
splittings over cyclic subgroups. These are natural extensions of previously
published corresponding statements for one-relator quotients of orientable
surface groups. Two of the proofs are new even in that restricted context.
