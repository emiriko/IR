We study phenomenological consequences of a noncommutative extension of the
standard model in the theta-expanded approach at the ILC. We estimate the
sensitivity of the ILC for the noncommutative scale Lambda_NC. Comparing with
earlier estimates for the LHC, we demonstrate the complementarity of the
experiments at the two colliders.
