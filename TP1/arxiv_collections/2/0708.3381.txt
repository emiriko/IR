This paper addresses the architecture optimization of a 3-DOF translational
parallel mechanism designed for machining applications. The design optimization
is conducted on the basis of a prescribed Cartesian workspace with prescribed
kinetostatic performances. The resulting machine, the Orthoglide, features
three fixed parallel linear joints which are mounted orthogonally and a mobile
platform which moves in the Cartesian x-y-z space with fixed orientation. The
interesting features of the Orthoglide are a regular Cartesian workspace shape,
uniform performances in all directions and good compactness. A small-scale
prototype of the Orthoglide under development is presented at the end of this
paper.
