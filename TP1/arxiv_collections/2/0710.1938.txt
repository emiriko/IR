We suggest that box shape trap enables to observe intrinsic properties of the
repulsive Hubbard model in a fixed doping in contrast to the harmonic trap
bringing about spatial variations of atom density profiles. In order to predict
atomic density profile under the box trap, we apply the directly-extended
density-matrix renormalization group method to 4-leg repulsive Hubbard model
with the open boundary condition. Consequently, we find that stripe formation
is universal in a low hole doping range and the stripe sensitively changes its
structure with variations of $U/t$ and the doping rate. A remarkable change is
that a stripe formed by a hole pair turns to one by a bi-hole pair when
entering a limited strong $U/t$ range. Furthermore, a systematic calculation
reveals that the Hubbard model shows a change from the stripe to the Friedel
like oscillation with increasing the doping rate.
