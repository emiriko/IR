Quantum electrodynamics (QED) fixed in the 't~Hooft-Veltman gauge is
renormalized to three loops in the MSbar scheme. The beta-functions and
anomalous dimensions are computed as functions of the usual QED coupling and
the additional coupling, xi, which is introduced as part of the nonlinear gauge
fixing condition. Similar to the maximal abelian gauge of quantum
chromodynamics, the renormalization of the gauge parameter is singular.
