Using a generalization of the invariant information introduced by Brukner and
Zeilinger [Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{83}, 3354 (1999)] to high-dimensional
systems, we introduce a complementarity relation between the local and nonlocal
information for $d\times d$ systems under the isolated environment, where $d$
is prime or the power of prime. We also analyze the dynamics of the local
information in the decoherence process.
