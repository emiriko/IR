ATLAS experiment, designed to probe the interactions of particles emerging
out of proton proton collisions at energies of up to 14 TeV, will assume
operation at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN in 2007. This paper
discusses the assembly and the quality control tests of forward detector
modules for the ATLAS silicon microstrip detector assembled at the Instituto de
Fisica Corpuscular (IFIC) in Valencia. The construction and testing procedures
are outlined and the laboratory equipment is briefly described. Emphasis is
given on the module quality achieved in terms of mechanical and electrical
stability.
