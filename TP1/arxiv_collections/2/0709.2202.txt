Let $G\subset\GL(V)$ be a complex reductive group where $\dim V<\infty$, and
let $\pi\colon V\to\quot VG$ be the categorical quotient. Let
$\NN:=\pi\inv\pi(0)$ be the null cone of $V$, let $H_0$ be the subgroup of
$\GL(V)$ which preserves the ideal $\I$ of $\NN$ and let $H$ be a Levi subgroup
of $H_0$ containing $G$. We determine the identity component of $H$. In many
cases we show that $H=H_0$. For adjoint representations we have $H=H_0$ and we
determine $H$ completely. We also investigate the subgroup $G_F$ of $\GL(V)$
preserving a fiber $F$ of $\pi$ when $V$ is an irreducible cofree $G$-module.
