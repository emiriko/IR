These notes give an introduction to the physics of the infinite range version
of the Edwards--Anderson model, the so-called Sherrington--Kirkpatrick model.
In a first part, I motivate and introduce the Edwards--Anderson and
Sherrington--Kirkpatrick models. In the second part, I explain the analytical
solution of the Sherrington--Kirkpatrick model, following Giorgio Parisi. I
next give the physical interpretation of this solution. This is a vast subject,
and I concentrate on the major points and give references for more details. The
third part presents the simulation approach and compare its results to
theoretical expectations: thermodynamics, finite size scaling, determination of
the critical temperature using "parameters" like the "Binder parameter", and
fluctuations. The last part gives a summary of our current understanding of
finite size effects for the free energy and internal energy of the
Sherrington--Kirkpatrick model
