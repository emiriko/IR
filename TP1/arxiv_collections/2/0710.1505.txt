We study unparticle physics effects in (Lambda_b -> Lambda + missing energy)
decay with polarized $\Lambda_b$ and $\Lambda$ baryons. The sensitivity of the
branching ratio of this decay and polarizations of (Lambda_b) and (Lambda)
baryons on the scale dimension d_U and effective cut-off parameter (Lambda_U)
are discussed.
