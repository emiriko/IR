The existence and stability of discrete breathers (DBs) in one-dimensional
and two-dimensional magnetic metamaterials (MMs), which consist of periodic
arrangem ents (arrays) of split-ring resonators (SRRs), is investigated
numerically. We consider different configurations of the SRR arrays, which are
related to the relative orientation of the SRRs in the MM, both in one and two
spatial dimensions. In the latter case we also consider anisotropic MMs. Using
standard numerical methods we construct several types of linearly stable
breather excitations both in Hamiltonian and dissipative MMs (dissipative
breathers). The study of stability in both cases is performed using standard
Floquet analysi s. In both cases we found that the increase of dimensionality
from one to two spatial dimensions does not destroy the DBs, which may also
exist in the case of moderate anisotropy (in two dimensions). In dissipative
MMs, the dynamics is governed by a power balance between the mainly Ohmic
dissipation and driving by an alternating magnetic field. In that case it is
demonstrated that DB excitation locally alters the magnetic response of MMs
from paramagnetic to diamagnetic. Moreover, when the frequency of the applied
field approaches the SRR resonance frequency, the magnetic response of the MM
in the region of the DB excitation may even become negative (extreme
diamagnetic).
