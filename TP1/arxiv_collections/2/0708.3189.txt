The study of CP violation in the B system allows us to perform quantitative
tests of the CP symmetry in the Standard Model. Many precise measurements of
the sides and angles of the Unitarity Triangle used to test the theory are made
possible by the abundant experimental data accumulated at the B factories and
the Tevatron. I review the Standard Model description of CP violation and the
key measurements which allow us to use CP violation studies as a probe for New
Physics.
