The $\alpha$-decay half lives of nuclei in the decay from element $^{277}112$
are calculated in a WKB framework using DDM3Y interaction and experimental
Q-values. Theoretical estimation of half lives in the same quantum tunneling
model, using Q-values from the mass formula of
Muntian-Hofmann-Patyk-Sobiczewski, are also presented. Calculated results
furnish corroborating evidence for the experimental findings at RIKEN and GSI.
Certain discrepancies indicate necessity of a better mass formula. Further
experimental data with higher statistics would also be useful.
