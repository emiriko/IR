Lunar Laser Ranging (LLR) measurements are crucial for advanced exploration
of the laws of fundamental gravitational physics and geophysics. Current LLR
technology allows us to measure distances to the Moon with a precision
approaching 1 millimeter. As NASA pursues the vision of taking humans back to
the Moon, new, more precise laser ranging applications will be demanded,
including continuous tracking from more sites on Earth, placing new CCR arrays
on the Moon, and possibly installing other devices such as transponders, etc.
Successful achievement of this goal strongly demands further significant
improvement of the theoretical model of the orbital and rotational dynamics of
the Earth-Moon system. This model should inevitably be based on the theory of
general relativity, fully incorporate the relevant geophysical processes, lunar
librations, tides, and should rely upon the most recent standards and
recommendations of the IAU for data analysis. This paper discusses methods and
problems in developing such a mathematical model. The model will take into
account all the classical and relativistic effects in the orbital and
rotational motion of the Moon and Earth at the sub-centimeter level. The new
model will allow us to navigate a spacecraft precisely to a location on the
Moon. It will also greatly improve our understanding of the structure of the
lunar interior and the nature of the physical interaction at the core-mantle
interface layer. The new theory and upcoming millimeter LLR will give us the
means to perform one of the most precise fundamental tests of general
relativity in the solar system.
