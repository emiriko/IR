One of the main problems in quantum complexity theory is that our
understanding of the theory of QMA-completeness is not as rich as its classical
analogue, the NP- completeness. In this paper we consider the clique problem in
graphs, which is NP- complete, and try to find its quantum analogue. We show
that, quantum clique problem can be defined as follows; Given a quantum
channel, decide whether there are k states that are distinguishable, with no
error, after passing through channel. This definition comes from reconsidering
the clique problem in terms of the zero-error capacity of graphs, and then
redefining it in quantum information theory. We prove that, quantum clique
problem is QMA-complete. In the second part of paper, we consider the same
problem for the Holevo capacity. We prove that computing the Holevo capacity as
well as the minimum entropy of a quantum channel is NP-complete. Also, we show
these results hold even if the set of quantum channels is restricted to
entanglement breaking ones.
