I compute the hard spectator interaction amplitude in $B\to\pi\pi$ at NLO
i.e. at O(\alpha_s^2). This special part of the amplitude, whose LO starts at
O(\alpha_s), is defined in the framework of QCD factorization. QCD
factorization allows to separate the short- and the long-distance physics in
leading power in an expansion in $\lqcd/m_b$, where the short-distance physics
can be calculated in a perturbative expansion in $\alpha_s$.
  In this calculation it is necessary to obtain an expansion of Feynman
integrals in powers of $\Lambda_\text{QCD}/m_b$. I will present a general
method to obtain this expansion in a systematic way once the leading power is
given as an input. This method is based on differential equation techniques and
easy to implement in a computer algebra system.
  The numerical impact on amplitudes and branching ratios is considered. The
NLO contributions of the hard spectator interactions are important but small
enough for perturbation theory to be valid.
