Using the type II near-extremal 3D-branes solution we apply the T-duality and
smeared twist to construct the supergravity backgrounds which dual to the 4D
finite temperature non-commutative dipole field theories. We first consider the
zero-temperature system in which, depending on the property of dipole vectors
it may be N=2, N=1 or N=0 theory. We investigate the rotating D3-brane
configurations moving on the spactimes and show that, for the cases of N=2 and
N =1 the rotating D3-brane could be blowed up to the stable spherical
configuration which is called as giant graviton and has a less energy than the
point-like graviton. The giant graviton configuration is stable only if its
angular momentum was less than a critical value of $P_c$ which is an increasing
function of the dipole strength. For the case of non-supersymmetric theory,
however, the spherical configuration has a larger energy than the point-like
graviton. We also find that the dipole field always render the dual giant
graviton to be more stable than the point-like graviton. The relation of dual
giant graviton energy with its angular momentum, which in the AdS/CFT
correspondence being the operator anomalous dimension is obtained. We
furthermore show that the temperature does not change the property of the giant
graviton, while it will render the dual giant graviton to be unstable.
