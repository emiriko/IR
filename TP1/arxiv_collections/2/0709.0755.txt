By considering distance-regular graphs as spin networks, first we introduce
some particular spin Hamiltonians which are extended version of those of
Refs.\cite{8,9''}. Then, by using spectral analysis techniques and algebraic
combinatoric structure of distance-regular graphs such as stratification
introduced in \cite{obata, js} and Bose-Mesner algebra, we give a method for
finding a set of coupling constants in the Hamiltonians so that a particular
state initially encoded on one site of a network will evolve freely to the
opposite site without any dynamical controls, i.e., we show that how to derive
the parameters of the system so that perfect state transfer (PST) can be
achieved. As examples, the cycle networks with even number of vertices and
$d$-dimensional hypercube networks are considered in details and the method is
applied for some important distance-regular networks in appendix.
