It is shown that there is an overlooked mechanism whereby some kinds of
dissipation can enhance the Benjamin-Feir instability of water waves. This
observation is new, and although it is counterintuitive, it is due to the fact
that the Benjamin-Feir instability involves the collision of modes with
opposite energy sign (relative to the carrier wave), and it is the negative
energy perturbations which are enhanced.
