The purpose of the paper is three-fold: (a) we prove that every sequence
which is a multidimensional sum of a balanced hypergeometric term has an
asymptotic expansion of Gevrey type-1 with rational exponents, (b) we construct
a class of $G$-functions that come from enumerative combinatorics, and (c) we
give a counterexample to a question of Zeilberger that asks whether holonomic
sequences can be written as multisums of balanced hypergeometric terms. The
proofs utilize the notion of a $G$-function, introduced by Siegel, and its
analytic/arithmetic properties shown recently by Andr\'e.
