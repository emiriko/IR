Low-energy electron microscopy (LEEM) was used to measure the reflectivity of
low-energy electrons from graphitized SiC(0001). The reflectivity shows
distinct quantized oscillations as a function of the electron energy and
graphite thickness. Conduction bands in thin graphite films form discrete
energy levels whose wave vectors are normal to the surface. Resonance of the
incident electrons with these quantized conduction band states enhances
electrons to transmit through the film into the SiC substrate, resulting in
dips in the reflectivity. The dip positions are well explained using
tight-binding and first-principles calculations. The graphite thickness
distribution can be determined microscopically from LEEM reflectivity
measurements.
