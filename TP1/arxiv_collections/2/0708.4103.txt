The mixed spin-1/2 and spin-1 Ising-Heisenberg ferromagnet on the decorated
triangular lattice consisting of inter-connected diamonds is investigated
within the framework of an exact decoration-iteration mapping transformation.
It is shown that the diamond-like decoration by a couple of the Heisenberg
spins gives rise to a diverse critical behaviour including reentrant phase
transitions with two consecutive critical points.
