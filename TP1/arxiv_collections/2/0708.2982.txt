A photon-positron conversion target of the undulator or laser based polarized
positron source is optimized using a modified GEANT-3 program adapted to count
the spin transfer. High intensity positron beam with around 0.75 polarisation
could be achieved choosing tungsten conversion target of 0.3 and 0.7 radiation
lengths for the undulator and laser case respectively.
