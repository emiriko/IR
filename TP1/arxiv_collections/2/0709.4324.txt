The hard square model in statistical mechanics has been investigated for the
case when the activity z is -1. For cyclic boundary conditions, the
characteristic polynomial of the transfer matrix has an intriguingly simple
structure, all the eigenvalues $x$ being zero, roots of unity, or solutions of
x^3 = 4 cos^2 (pi*m/N). Here we tabulate the results for lattices of up to 12
columns with cyclic or free boundary conditions and the two obvious
orientations. We remark that they are all unexpectedly simple and that for the
rotated lattice with free or fixed boundary conditions there are obvious likely
generalizations to any lattice size.
