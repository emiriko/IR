The quasifree reaction $np\to pp\pim$ was studied in a kinematically complete
experiment by bombarding a liquid hydrogen target with a deuteron beam of
momentum 1.85 GeV/c and analyzing the data along the lines of the spectator
model. In addition to the three charged ejectiles the spectator proton was also
detected in the large-acceptance time-of-flight spectrometer COSY-TOF. It was
identified by its momentum and flight direction thus yielding access to the
Fermi motion of the bound neutron and to the effective neutron 4-momentum
vector $\mathbb{P}_n$ which differed from event to event. A range of almost 90
MeV excess energy above threshold was covered. Energy dependent angular
distributions, invariant mass spectra as well as fully covered Dalitz plots
were deduced. Sizeable $pp$ FSI effects were found as were contributions of $p$
and $d$ partial waves. The behavior of the elementary cross section
$\sigma_{01}$ close to threshold is discussed in view of new cross section
data. In comparison with existing literature data the results provide a
sensitive test of the spectator model.
