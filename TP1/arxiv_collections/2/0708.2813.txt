We report measurements of the cross section and a complete set of
polarization observables for the Gamow--Teller ${}^{12}{\rm
C}(\vec{p},\vec{n}){}^{12}{\rm N}({\rm g.s.},1^+)$ reaction at a bombarding
energy of 296 MeV.
  The data are compared with distorted wave impulse approximation calculations
employing transition form factors normalized to reproduce the observed
beta-decay $ft$ value.
  The cross section is significantly under-predicted by the calculations at
momentum transfers $q \gtrsim $ 0.5 ${\rm fm^{-1}}$.
  The discrepancy is partly resolved by considering the non-locality of the
nuclear mean field. However, the calculations still under-predict the cross
section at large momentum transfers of $q$ $\simeq$ 1.6 ${\rm fm^{-1}}$.
  We also performed calculations employing random phase approximation response
functions and found that the observed enhancement can be attributed in part to
pionic correlations in nuclei.
