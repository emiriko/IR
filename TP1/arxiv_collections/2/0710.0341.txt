The overlap Dirac operator at nonzero quark chemical potential involves the
computation of the sign function of a non-Hermitian matrix. In this talk we
present an iterative method, first proposed by us in Ref. [1], which allows for
an efficient computation of the operator, even on large lattices. The starting
point is a Krylov subspace approximation, based on the Arnoldi algorithm, for
the evaluation of a generic matrix function. The efficiency of this method is
spoiled when the matrix has eigenvalues close to a function discontinuity. To
cure this, a small number of critical eigenvectors are added to the Krylov
subspace, and two different deflation schemes are proposed in this augmented
subspace. The ensuing method is then applied to the sign function of the
overlap Dirac operator, for two different lattice sizes. The sign function has
a discontinuity along the imaginary axis, and the numerical results show how
deflation dramatically improves the efficiency of the method.
