We present spatially localized nonrotating and rotating (azimuthon)
multisolitons in the two-dimensional (2D) ("pancake-shaped configuration")
Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) with attractive interaction. By means of a
linear stability analysis, we investigate the stability of these structures and
show that rotating dipole solitons are stable provided that the number of atoms
is small enough. The results were confirmed by direct numerical simulations of
the 2D Gross-Pitaevskii equation.
