Confocal time resolved single-molecule spectroscopy using pulsed laser
excitation and synchronized multi channel time correlated single photon
counting (TCSPC) provides detailed information about the conformational changes
of a biological motor in real time. We studied the formation of adenosine
triphosphate, ATP, from ADP and phosphate by FoF1-ATP synthase. The reaction is
performed by a stepwise internal rotation of subunits of the lipid
membrane-embedded enzyme. Using fluorescence resonance energy transfer, FRET,
we detected rotation of this biological motor by sequential changes of
intramolecular distances within a single FoF1-ATP synthase. Prolonged
observation times of single enzymes were achieved by functional immobilization
to the glass surface. The stepwise rotary subunit movements were identified by
Hidden Markov Models (HMM) which were trained with single-molecule FRET
trajectories. To improve the accuracy of the HMM analysis we included the
single-molecule fluorescence lifetime of the FRET donor and used alternating
laser excitation to co-localize the FRET acceptor independently within a photon
burst. The HMM analysis yielded the orientations and dwell times of rotary
subunits during stepwise rotation. In addition, the action mode of bactericidal
drugs, i.e. inhibitors of FoF1-ATP synthase like aurovertin, could be
investigated by the time resolved single-molecule FRET approach.
