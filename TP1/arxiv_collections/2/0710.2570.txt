Tripartite three mode Gaussian state undergoes parametric amplification and
amplitude damping as well as thermal noise is studied. In the case of a state
totally symmetrically interacting with the environment, the time dependent
correlation matrix of the state in evolution is given. The conditions for fully
separability and fully entanglement of the final tripartite three mode Gaussian
state are worked out.
