We study by Monte Carlo simulations a model of knotted polymer ring adsorbing
onto an impenetrable, attractive wall. The polymer is described by a
self-avoiding polygon (SAP) on the cubic lattice. We find that the adsorption
transition temperature, the crossover exponent $\phi$ and the metric exponent
$\nu$, are the same as in the model where the topology of the ring is
unrestricted. By measuring the average length of the knotted portion of the
ring we are able to show that adsorbed knots are localized. This knot
localization transition is triggered by the adsorption transition but is
accompanied by a less sharp variation of the exponent related to the degree of
localization. Indeed, for a whole interval below the adsorption transition, one
can not exclude a contiuous variation with temperature of this exponent. Deep
into the adsorbed phase we are able to verify that knot localization is strong
and well described in terms of the flat knot model.
