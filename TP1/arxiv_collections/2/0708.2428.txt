The Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect is a purely quantum mechanical effect. The
original (classified as Type-I) AB-phase shift exists in experimental
conditions where the electromagnetic fields and forces are zero. It is the
absence of forces that makes the AB-effect entirely quantum mechanical.
Although the AB-phase shift has been demonstrated unambiguously, the absence of
forces in Type-I AB-effects has never been shown. Here, we report the
observation of the absence of time delays associated with forces of the
magnitude needed to explain the AB-phase shift for a macroscopic system.
