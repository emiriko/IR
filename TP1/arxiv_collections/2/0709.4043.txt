Direct measurements of the acceleration of spheres and disks impacting
granular media reveal simple power law scalings along with complex dynamics
which bear the signatures of both fluid and solid behavior. The penetration
depth scales linearly with impact velocity while the collision duration is
constant for sufficiently large impact velocity. Both quantities exhibit power
law dependence on sphere diameter and density, and gravitational acceleration.
The acceleration during impact is characterized by two jumps: a rapid, velocity
dependent increase upon initial contact and a similarly sharp, depth dependent
decrease as the impacting object comes to rest. Examining the measured forces
on the sphere in the vicinity of these features leads to a new experimentally
based granular force model for collision. We discuss our findings in the
context of recently proposed phenomenological models that capture qualitative
dynamical features of impact but fail both quantitatively and in their
inability to capture significant acceleration fluctuations that occur during
penetration and which depend on the impacted material.
