The work investigate a static, isotropic and almost homogeneous Universe
containing a real scalar field modeling the Dark-Energy (quintaessence)
interacting with pressureless matter. It is argued that the interaction between
matter and the Dark Energy, is essential for the very existence of the
considered solution. Assuming the possibility that Dark-Energy can be furnished
by the Dilaton (a scalar field reflecting the condensation of string states
with zero angular momentum) we fix the value of scalar field at the origin to
the Planck scale. It became possible to fix the ratio of the amount of Dark
Energy to matter energy, in the currently estimated value 0.7/0.3, and also the
observed magnitude of the Hubble constant. The value of the mass for the scalar
field chosen for fixing the above ratio and Hubble effect strength, results to
be of the order of 10^{-29}cm^{-1}, a small mass which seems to be compatible
with the zero mass of the Dilaton in the lowest approximations.
