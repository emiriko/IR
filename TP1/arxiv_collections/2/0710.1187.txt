Stochastic thermodynamics provides a framework for describing small systems
like colloids or biomolecules driven out of equilibrium but still in contact
with a heat bath. Both, a first-law like energy balance involving exchanged
heat and entropy production entering refinements of the second law can
consistently be defined along single stochastic trajectories. Various exact
relations involving the distribution of such quantities like integral and
detailed fluctuation theorems for total entropy production and the Jarzynski
relation follow from such an approach based on Langevin dynamics. Analogues of
these relations can be proven for any system obeying a stochastic master
equation like, in particular, (bio)chemically driven enzyms or whole reaction
networks. The perspective of investigating such relations for stochastic field
equations like the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation is sketched as well.
