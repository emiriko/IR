I report the analysis performed on fermion masses and mixing, including
neutrino mixing, within the context of a model with hierarchical radiative mass
generation mechanism for light charged fermions, mediated by exotic scalar
particles at one and two loops, respectively, meanwhile the neutrinos get
Majorana mass terms at tree level through the Yukawa couplings with two SU(2)_L
Higgs triplets. All the resulting mass matrices in the model, for the u, d, and
e fermion charged sectors, the neutrinos and the exotic scalar particles, are
diagonalized in exact analytical form. Quantitative analysis shows that this
model is successful to accommodate the hierarchical spectrum of masses and
mixing in the quark sector as well as the charged lepton masses. The lepton
mixing matrix, V_{PMNS}, is written completely in terms of the neutrino masses
m_1, m_2, and m_3. Large lepton mixing for \theta_{12} and \theta_{23} is
predicted in the range of values 0.7 \lesssim \sin^22\theta_{12}\lesssim 0.7772
and 0.87 \lesssim \sin^22\theta_{23} \lesssim 0.9023 by using 0.033 \lesssim
s_{13}^2 \lesssim 0.04. These values for lepton mixing are consistent with 3
\sigma allowed ranges provided by recent global analysis of neutrino data
oscillation. From \Delta m_{\text{sol}}^2 bounds, neutrino masses are predicted
in the range of values m_1 \thickapprox (1.706 - 2.494) x 10^{- 3} eV, m_2
\thickapprox (6.675 - 12.56) x 10^{- 3} eV, and m_3 \thickapprox (1.215 -
2.188) x 10^{- 2} eV, respectively. The above allowed lepton mixing leads to
the quak-lepton complementary relations \theta_{12}^{CKM} + \theta_{12}^{PMNS}
\thickapprox 41.543^{\circ} - 44.066^{\circ} and
\theta_{23}^{CKM}+\theta_{23}^{PMNS}\thickapprox 36.835^{\circ} -
38.295^{\circ}.
