Polarization mechanism by Strutinsky-Denisov gives rise to the electric
dipole radiation from fragments. Its probability calculated within the LDM
turns out to be ~3.5x10-2 per fission. The radiation occurs during
thermolization of the post-rupture deformation energy of the fragments, but
before the neutron emission.
