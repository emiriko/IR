We present the magnetic dipole($M1$) transitions $V\to P\gamma$ of various
heavy-flavored mesons such as $(D,D^*,D_s,D^{*}_s,\eta_c, J/\psi)$ and
$(B,B^*,B_s,B^*_s,\eta_b,\Upsilon)$ using the light-front quark model
constrained by the variational principle for the QCD-motivated effective
Hamiltonian. The weak decay constants of heavy mesons and the decay widths for
$V\to P\gamma$ are calculated. The radiative decay for
$\Upsilon\to\eta_{b}\gamma$ process is found to be very helpful to determine
the unmeasured mass of $\eta_b$. Our numerical results are overall in good
agreement with the available experimental data as well as other theoretical
model calculations.
