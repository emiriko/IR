We show that there are regions of parameter space in multi-scalar doublet
models where, in the first few hundred inverse femtobarns of data, the new
charged and neutral scalars are not directly observable at the LHC and yet the
Higgs decay rate to b bbar is changed significantly from its standard model
value. For a light Higgs with a mass less than 140 GeV, this can cause a large
change in the number of two photon and tau tau Higgs decay events expected at
the LHC compared to the minimal standard model. In the models we consider, the
principle of minimal flavor violation is used to suppress flavor changing
neutral currents. This paper emphasizes the importance of measuring the
properties of the Higgs boson at the LHC; for a range of parameters the model
considered has new physics at the TeV scale that is invisible, in the first few
hundred inverse femtobarns of integrated luminosity at the LHC, except
indirectly through the measurement of Higgs boson properties.
