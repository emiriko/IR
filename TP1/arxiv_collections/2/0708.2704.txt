We compute the tunneling current in a double point contact geometry of a
Quantum Hall system at filling fraction $\nu=5/2$, as function of voltage and
temeprature, in the weak tunneling regime. We quantitatively compare two
possible candidates for the state at $\nu=5/2$: the Moore-Read Pfaffian state,
and its particle-hole conjugate, the anti-Pfaffian. We find that both
possibilities exhibit the same qualitative behavior, and both have an even-odd
effect that reflects their non-Abelian nature, but differ quantitatively in
their voltage and temperature dependance.
