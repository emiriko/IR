We investigate the effect of incoherent perturbations on atomic
photoionization due to a femtosecond mid-infrared laser pulse by solving the
time-dependent stochastic Schr\"odinger equation. For a weak laser pulse which
causes almost no ionization, an addition of a Gaussian white noise to the pulse
leads to a significantly enhanced ionization probability. Tuning the noise
level, a stochastic resonance-like curve is observed showing the existence of
an optimum noise for a given laser pulse. Besides studying the sensitivity of
the obtained enhancement curve on the pulse parameters, such as the pulse
duration and peak amplitude, we suggest that experimentally realizable
broadband chaotic light can also be used instead of the white noise to observe
similar features. The underlying enhancement mechanism is analyzed in the
frequency-domain by computing a frequency-resolved atomic gain profile, as well
as in the time-domain by controlling the relative delay between the action of
the laser pulse and noise.
