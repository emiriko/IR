We propose a scheme for using spin chain to realize an ideal channel of long
distance entanglement. The results show that there has different entanglement
in different Hilbert subspace, the anisotropic parameter $\Delta$ will
frustrate the entanglement and the magnetic field affect the entanglement
through changing the ground state, the boundary entanglement $C_{1N}$ has the
simplest expression in the simplest subspace and it only depend on the first
item of the ground state, that item can be increased when a local magnetic
field is introduced. Our propose can be handled easily because it only needs a
uniform XX open chain initialized in the simplest Hilbert subspace and a bulk
magnetic field that absent for the boundary qubits.
