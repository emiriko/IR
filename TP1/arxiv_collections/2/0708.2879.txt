The fundamentals of the Maximum Entropy principle as a rule for assigning and
updating probabilities are revisited. The Shannon-Jaynes relative entropy is
vindicated as the optimal criterion for use with an updating rule. A
constructive rule is justified which assigns the probabilities least sensitive
to coarse-graining. The implications of these developments for interpreting
physics laws as rules of inference upon incomplete information are briefly
discussed.
