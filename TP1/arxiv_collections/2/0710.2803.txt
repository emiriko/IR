We report observation of Leggett's collective mode in a multi-band MgB2
superconductor with T_c=39K arising from the fluctuations in the relative phase
between two superconducting condensates. The novel mode is observed by Raman
spectroscopy at 9.4 meV in the fully symmetric scattering channel. The observed
mode frequency is consistent with theoretical considerations based on the first
principle computations.
