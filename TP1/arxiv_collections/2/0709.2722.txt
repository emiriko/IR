We give a diameter bound for fundamental domains for isometric actions of the
fundamental group of a closed hyperbolic surface on a delta-hyperbolic space,
where the bound depends on the hyperbolicity constant delta, the genus of the
surface, and the injectivity radius of the action, which we assume to be
strictly positive.
