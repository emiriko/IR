We show how the imaginary parts of the Higgs-Boson self-energies in the MSSM
are consistenly taken into account in the Higgs-Boson mass determination. In a
numerical example we find effects of 5 GeV in the mass difference of the two
heavy neutral Higgs bosons. The imaginary contributions have been included into
the code FeynHiggs.
