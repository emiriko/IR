We investigate the multiple use of a ferromagnetic spin chain for quantum and
classical communications without resetting. We find that the memory of the
state transmitted during the first use makes the spin chain a qualitatively
different quantum channel during the second transmission, for which we find the
relevant Kraus operators. We propose a parameter to quantify the amount of
memory in the channel and find that it influences the quality of the channel,
as reflected through fidelity and entanglement transmissible during the second
use. For certain evolution times, the memory allows the channel to exceed the
memoryless classical capacity (achieved by separable inputs) and in some cases
it can also enhance the quantum capacity.
