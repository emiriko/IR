We show that the space of polygonizations of a fixed planar point set S of n
points is connected by O(n^2) ``moves'' between simple polygons. Each move is
composed of a sequence of atomic moves called ``stretches'' and ``twangs''.
These atomic moves walk between weakly simple ``polygonal wraps'' of S. These
moves show promise to serve as a basis for generating random polygons.
