Provenance is information recording the source, derivation, or history of
some information. Provenance tracking has been studied in a variety of
settings; however, although many design points have been explored, the
mathematical or semantic foundations of data provenance have received
comparatively little attention. In this paper, we argue that dependency
analysis techniques familiar from program analysis and program slicing provide
a formal foundation for forms of provenance that are intended to show how (part
of) the output of a query depends on (parts of) its input. We introduce a
semantic characterization of such dependency provenance, show that this form of
provenance is not computable, and provide dynamic and static approximation
techniques.
