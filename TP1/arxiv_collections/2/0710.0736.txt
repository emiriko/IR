We propose a new method for the numerical solution of a PDE-driven model for
colour image segmentation and give numerical examples of the results. The
method combines the vector-valued Allen-Cahn phase field equation with initial
data fitting terms. This method is known to be closely related to the
Mumford-Shah problem and the level set segmentation by Chan and Vese. Our
numerical solution is performed using a multigrid splitting of a finite element
space, thereby producing an efficient and robust method for the segmentation of
large images.
