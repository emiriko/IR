In the vortex core of slightly overdoped Bi2Sr2CaCu2Ox, the electron-like and
hole-like states have been found to exhibit spatial modulations in anti-phase
with each other along the Cu-O bonding direction. Some kind of
one-dimensionality has been observed in the vortex core, and it is more clearly
seen in differential conductance maps at lower biases below +-9 mV.
