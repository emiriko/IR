We report detection of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) using an anisotropic
magnetoresistive (AMR) sensor. A ``remote-detection'' arrangement was used, in
which protons in flowing water were pre-polarized in the field of a
superconducting NMR magnet, adiabatically inverted, and subsequently detected
with an AMR sensor situated downstream from the magnet and the adiabatic
inverter. AMR sensing is well suited for NMR detection in microfluidic
``lab-on-a-chip'' applications.
