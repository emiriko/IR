We obtain analytic solution of the time-independent Schrodinger equation in
two dimensions for a charged particle moving in the field of an electric
quadrupole. The solution is written as a series in terms of special functions
that support a tridiagonal matrix representation for the angular and radial
components of the wave operator. This solution is for all energies, the
discrete (for bound states) as well as the continuous (for scattering states).
The expansion coefficients of the wavefunction are written in terms of
orthogonal polynomials satisfying three-term recursion relations. The charged
particle could become bound to the quadrupole only if its moment exceeds a
certain critical value.
