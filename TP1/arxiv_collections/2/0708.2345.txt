We extend Tooru-Cohen analysis for nonequilirium steady state(NSS) of a
Brownian particle to nonequilibrium oscillatory state (NOS) of Brownian
particle by considering time dependent external drive protocol. We consider an
unbounded charged Brownian particle in the presence of an oscillating electric
field and prove work fluctuation theorem, which is valid for any initial
distribution and at all times. For harmonically bounded and constantly dragged
Brownian particle considered by Tooru and Cohen, work fluctuation theorem is
valid for any initial condition(also NSS), but only in large time limit. We use
Onsager-Machlup Lagrangian with a constraint to obtain frequency dependent work
distribution function, and describe entropy production rate and properties of
dissipation functions for the present system using Onsager-Machlup functional.
