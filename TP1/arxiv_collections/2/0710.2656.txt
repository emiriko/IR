The Pioneer 10/11 spacecraft yielded the most precise navigation in deep
space to date. However, their radio-metric tracking data received from the
distances between 20--70 astronomical units from the Sun consistently indicated
the presence of a small, anomalous, Doppler frequency drift. The drift is a
blue frequency shift that can be interpreted as a sunward acceleration of a_P =
(8.74 +/- 1.33) x 10^(-10) m/s^2 for each particular spacecraft. This signal
has become known as the Pioneer anomaly; the nature of this anomaly remains
unexplained.
  New Pioneer 10 and 11 radio-metric Doppler data recently became available.
The much extended set of Pioneer Doppler data is the primary source for new
upcoming investigation of the anomaly. We also have almost entire records of
flight telemetry files received from the the Pioneers. Together with original
project documentation and newly developed software tools, this additional
information is now used to reconstruct the engineering history of both
spacecraft. To that extent, a thermal model of the Pioneer vehicles is being
developed to study possible contribution of thermal recoil force acting on the
two spacecraft. In addition, to improve the accuracy of orbital reconstruction,
we developed a new approach that uses actual flight telemetry data during
trajectory analysis of radio-metric Doppler files. The ultimate goal of these
efforts is to investigate possible contributions of the thermal recoil force to
the detected anomalous acceleration.
