Transmission, reflection and absorption of electromagnetic radiation and
photon dispersion law for 2D photonic crystals with superconducting elements
are studied. The calculation of optical properties of photonic crystals is
studied by layer-by-layer Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker techniques. The results of
numerical calculations performed for an array of superconducting cylinders have
been understood in terms of a simple analytical model. The controlling of
optical properties of superconducting photonic crystal by temperature and
magnetic field is discussed. The variation of superconducting component density
with temperature leads, particularly, to significant reduction of the
transmission peaks and even to a nonmonotonous behavior of some absorbance
peaks.
