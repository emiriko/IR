We study the anomalous quantum Hall effect exhibited by the relativistic
particles living on two-sphere S^2 and submitted to a magnetic monopole. We
start by establishing a direct connection between the Dirac and Landau
operators through the Pauli--Schr\"odinger Hamiltonian H_{s}^{SP}. This will be
helpful in the sense that the Dirac eigenvalues and eigenfunctions will be
easily derived. In analyzing H_{s}^{SP} spectrum, we show that there is a
composite fermion nature supported by the presence of two effective magnetic
fields. For the lowest Landau level, we argue that the basic physics of
graphene is similar to that of two-dimensional electron gas, which is in
agreement with the planar limit. For the higher Landau levels, we propose a
SU(N) wavefunction for different filling factors that captures all symmetries.
Focusing on the graphene case, i.e. N=4, we give different configurations those
allowed to recover some known results.
