We compare two renormalization procedures, one based on the short distance
behavior of heavy quark-antiquark free energies and the other by using bare
Polyakov loops at different temporal extent of the lattice and find that both
prescriptions are equivalent, resulting in renormalization constants that
depend on the bare coupling. Furthermore these renormalization constants show
Casimir scaling for higher representations of the Polyakov loops. The analysis
of Polyakov loops in different representations of the color SU(3) group
indicates that a simple perturbative inspired relation in terms of the
quadratic Casimir operator is realized to a good approximation at temperatures
$T \gsim T_c$ for renormalized as well as bare loops. In contrast to a
vanishing Polyakov loop in representations with non-zero triality in the
confined phase, the adjoint loops are small but non-zero even for temperatures
below the critical one. The adjoint quark-antiquark pairs exhibit screening.
This behavior can be related to the binding energy of gluelump states.
