We obtain exact static solutions of the $(n+1)$-dimensional SU(3) Yang-Mills
equations for both flat and curved space-time cases with $n \le 3$. We find
that the solutions obtained are confining functions for $n = 1, 2, 3$. We apply
the $(3+1)$ curved space-time solution to the anti-de Sitter and Schwarzschild
metrics.
