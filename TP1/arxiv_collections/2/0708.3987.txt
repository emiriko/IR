Germanium detectors have very good capabilities for the investigation of rare
phenomena like the neutrinoless double beta decay. Rejection of the background
entangling the expected signal is one primary goal in this kind of experiments.
Here, the attainable background reduction in the energy region where the
neutrinoless double beta decay signal of 76Ge is expected to appear has been
evaluated for experiments using germanium detectors, taking into consideration
different strategies like the granularity of the detector system, the
segmentation of each individual germanium detector and the application of Pulse
Shape Analysis techniques to discriminate signal from background events.
Detection efficiency to the signal is affected by background rejection
techniques, and therefore it has been estimated for each of the background
rejection scenarios considered. Finally, conditions regarding crystal mass,
radiopurity, exposure to cosmic rays, shielding and rejection capabilities are
discussed with the aim to achieve a background level of 10-3 c keV-1 kg-1 y-1
in the region of interest, which would allow to explore neutrino effective
masses around 40 meV.
