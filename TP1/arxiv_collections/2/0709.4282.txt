We report the results of Molecular Dynamics simulations of electron transfer
activation parameters of plastocyanin metalloprotein involved as electron
carrier in natural photosynthesis. We have discovered that slow, non-ergodic
conformational fluctuations of the protein, coupled to hydrating water, result
in a very broad distribution of donor-acceptor energy gaps far exceeding that
observed for commonly studied inorganic and organic donor-acceptor complexes.
The Stokes shift is not affected by these fluctuations and can be calculated
from solvation models in terms of the response of the solvent dipolar
polarization. The non-ergodic character of large-amplitude protein/water
mobility breaks the strong link between the Stokes shift and reorganization
energy characteristic of equilibrium (ergodic) theories of electron transfer.
This mechanism might be responsible for low activation barriers in natural
electron transfer proteins characterized by low reaction free energy.
