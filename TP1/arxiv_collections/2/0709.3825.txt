We construct a class of scalar field models coupled to matter that lead to
the dependence of masses and coupling constants on the ambient matter density.
Such models predict a deviation of couplings measured on the Earth from values
determined in low-density astrophysical environments, but do not necessarily
require the evolution of coupling constants with the redshift in the recent
cosmological past. Additional laboratory and astrophysical tests of \Delta
\alpha and \Delta(m_p/m_e) as functions of the ambient matter density are
warranted.
