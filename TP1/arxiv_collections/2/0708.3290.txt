Transverse momentum spectra of Lambda and K0Short particles are presented for
Cu+Cu sqrt(s_NN) = 200 GeV collisions observed at STAR, and compared to Au+Au
measurements at the same energy. For both systems, a number of observables are
shown to increase at mid-rapidity (|y| < 0.5) with increasing centrality. These
are the integrated Lambda and K0Short yields, the integrated Lambda and K0Short
yields per participating nucleon, and mid-pT (1 GeV/c -> 4.5 GeV/c)
Lambda/KK0Short ratios. The RCP ratio is found to be higher for the Lambda
yields at mid-pT compared to the K0Short yields for both the Cu+Cu and Au+Au
data. In contrast, when similar numbers of participating nucleons are
considered for the Cu+Cu and Au+Au data, an indication of increased bulk
strangeness production and a higher mid-pT (1 -> 4.5 GeV/c) Lambda/K0Short
ratio are found, for Cu+Cu.
