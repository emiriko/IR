A study of the electron identification and selection efficiency of the L1
Trigger algorithm has been performed using the combined ECAL/HCAL test beam
data. A detailed discussion of the electron isolation and its impact on the
selection efficiency is presented. The L1 electron algorithm is studied for
different beam energies and the results indicate that efficiencies of 98% or
more can be achieved for electrons with energies between 15 and 100 GeV. The
fraction of charged hadrons with energies from 3 up to 100 GeV rejected by the
L1 electron trigger algorithm is estimated to be larger than 93%.
