We discuss the application of general features of intersecting brane model
constructions in cosmology. In particular, we describe a scenario for D-term
inflation which arises straightforwardly in IBM constructions wherein open
non-vectorlike strings play the role of the inflaton. We also show that
baryogenesis driven by hidden sector mixed anomalies can naturally arise in
intersecting brane models.
