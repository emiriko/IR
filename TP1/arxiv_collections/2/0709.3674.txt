In Randall-Sundrum single-brane (RS-II) model, it was conjectured that there
is no static large black hole localized on the brane based on adS/CFT
correspondence. Here we consider the phase diagram of black objects in the
models extended from the RS-II model. We propose a scenario for the phase
diagram consistent with the classical black hole evaporation conjecture. The
proposed scenario indicates the existence of a rich variety of the families of
black objects.
