The results of study of piezoelectrooptic (PEO) effect in the course of
ferroelectric-ferroelastic phase transition in Rochelle salt crystals are
presented. The coefficient of the combined effect is obtained from measurements
of the changes in the electrooptic coefficients under the action of mechanical
stress and the changes in the piezooptic coefficients under the action of
electric field (or spontaneous polarization). It is shown experimentally that
the values of both coefficients are the same, as predicted by the theory. The
temperature dependence of the coefficient of combined PEO effect is obtained.
Its anomalous behaviour at the phase transition appears due to the dielectric
permitivity anomaly. It is also demonstrated that the change in the piezooptic
coefficients at the phase transition in Rochelle salt crystals may be
satisfactorily explained as a result of linear and quadratic PEO effect induced
by spontaneous polarization.
