Motivated by recent experiments in trapped Fermi gas with spin population
imbalance, we discuss the effects of the quantum and thermal fluctuations of
the interface between a fully paired superfluid core and a fully polarized
Fermi gas. We demonstrate that even if there is no true partially polarized
thermodynamic phase in bulk, the interface fluctuation can give rise to a
partially polarized transition regime in trap. Our theory yields a definite
prediction for the functional forms of the spatial profile of spin polarization
and pairing gap, and we show that the spin-resolved density profiles measured
by both the MIT and Rice groups obey this function form. We also show that
sufficient large fluctuation will lead to a visibly unequal density even at the
center of the cloud. We hope this picture can shed lights on the controversial
discrepancies in recent experiments.
