The magnetic domain structure and magnetic properties of a ferromagnetic
(Ga,Mn)As epilayer with perpendicular magnetic easy-axis are investigated. We
show that, despite strong hysteresis, domain theory at thermodynamical
equilibrium can be used to determine the micromagnetic parameters. Combining
magneto-optical Kerr microscopy, magnetometry and ferromagnetic resonance
measurements, we obtain the characteristic parameter for magnetic domains
$\lambda_c$, the domain wall width and specific energy, and the spin stiffness
constant as a function of temperature. The nucleation barrier for magnetization
reversal and the Walker breakdown velocity for field-driven domain wall
propagation are also estimated.
