For a unital C*-algebra A, which is equipped with a spectral triple and an
extension T of A by the compacts, we construct a family of spectral triples
associated to T and depending on the two positive parameters (s,t).
  Using Rieffel's notation of quantum Gromov-Hausdorff distance between compact
quantum metric spaces it is possible to define a metric on this family of
spectral triples, and we show that the distance between a pair of spectral
triples varies continuously with respect to the parameters. It turns out that a
spectral triple associated to the unitarization of the algebra of compact
operators is obtained under the limit - in this metric - for (s,1) -> (0, 1),
while the basic spectral triple, associated to A, is obtained from this family
under a sort of a dual limiting process for (1, t) -> (1, 0).
  We show that our constructions will provide families of spectral triples for
the unitarized compacts and for the Podles sphere. In the case of the compacts
we investigate to which extent our proposed spectral triple satisfies Connes' 7
axioms for noncommutative geometry.
