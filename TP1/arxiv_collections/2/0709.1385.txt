We prove a nonlinear Poisson type formula for the Schrodinger group. Such a
formula had been derived in a previous paper by the authors, as a consequence
of the study of the asymptotic behavior of nonlinear wave operators for small
data. In this note, we propose a direct proof, and extend the range allowed for
the power of the nonlinearity to the set of all short range nonlinearities.
Moreover, energy-critical nonlinearities are allowed.
