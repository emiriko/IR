The in-plane diamagnetism around the Meissner transition was measured in a
Tl$_2$Ba$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{10}$ single crystal of high chemical and structural
quality, which minimizes the inhomogeneity and disorder rounding effects on the
magnetization. When analyzed quantitatively and consistently above and below
the transition in terms of the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) approach with fluctuations
of Cooper pairs and vortices, these data provide a further confirmation that
the observed Meissner transition is a conventional GL superconducting
transition in a homogeneous layered superconductor.
