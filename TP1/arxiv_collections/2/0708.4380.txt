Recent theoretical studies have predicted a new clustering mechanism for soft
matter particles that interact via a certain kind of purely repulsive, bounded
potentials. At sufficiently high densities, clusters of overlapping particles
are formed in the fluid, which upon further compression crystallize into cubic
lattices with density-independent lattice constants. In this work we show that
amphiphilic dendrimers are suitable colloids for the experimental realization
of this phenomenon. Thereby, we pave the way for the synthesis of such
macromolecules, which form the basis for a novel class of materials with
unusual properties.
