In this paper we study the problem of uniqueness for spacelike hypersurfaces
with constant higher order mean curvature in generalized Robertson-Walker (GRW)
spacetimes. In particular, we consider the following question: Under what
conditions must a compact spacelike hypersurface with constant higher order
mean curvature in a spatially closed GRW spacetime be a spacelike slice? We
prove that this happens, esentially, under the so called convergence condition.
Our approach is based on the use of the Newton transformations (and their
associated differential operators) and the Minkowski formulae for spacelike
hypersurfaces.
