Let G be a connected reductive group. To any irreducible G-variety one
assigns the lattice generated by all weights of B-semiinvariant rational
functions on X, where B$ is a Borel subgroup of G. This lattice is called the
weight lattice of X. We establish algorithms for computing weight lattices for
homogeneous spaces and affine homogeneous vector bundles. For affine
homogeneous spaces of rank rk(G) we present a more or less explicit
computation.
