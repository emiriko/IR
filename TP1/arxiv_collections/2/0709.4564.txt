We evaluate properties of neutral mesons in Nf=2 dynamical simulations of
TMQCD at maximal twist. The pion is explored - establishing the size of the
isospin splitting (an order a^2 effect). We investigate the eta' (the Nf=2
flavour singlet pseudoscalar meson) and neutral rho and scalar mesons. We show
that disconnected diagrams can be evaluated very efficiently in TMQCD using
variance reduction methods.
