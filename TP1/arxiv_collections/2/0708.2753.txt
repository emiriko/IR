We present an optical cavity QED configuration that is described by a
dissipative version of the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model of an infinitely
coordinated spin system. This open quantum system exhibits both first- and
second-order non-equilibrium quantum phase transitions as a single, effective
field parameter is varied. Light emitted from the cavity offers measurable
signatures of the critical behavior, including that of the spin-spin
entanglement.
