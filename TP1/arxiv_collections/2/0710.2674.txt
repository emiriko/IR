In this treatment a text is considered to be a series of word impulses which
are read at a constant rate. The brain then assembles these units of
information into higher units of meaning. A classical systems approach is used
to model an initial part of this assembly process. The concepts of linguistic
system response, information energy, and ordering energy are defined and
analyzed. Finally, as a demonstration, information energy is used to estimate
the publication dates of a series of texts and the similarity of a set of
texts.
