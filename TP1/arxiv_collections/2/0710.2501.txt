$\nu$MSM is a minimal renormalizable extension of the Standard Model by right
handed neutrinos. This model explains the neutrino oscillations and provides a
candidate for the Dark Matter and a mechanism of baryon number generation in
the Early Universe. We discuss here existing constraints on the model and
possible consequences for astrophysical and laboratory experiments.
