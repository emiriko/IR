We have investigated the isoscalar giant monopole resonance (GMR) in the Sn
isotopes, using inelastic scattering of 400-MeV $\alpha$-particles at extremely
forward angles, including 0 deg. A value of -550 \pm 100 MeV has been obtained
for the asymmetry term, $K_\tau$, in the nuclear incompressibility.
