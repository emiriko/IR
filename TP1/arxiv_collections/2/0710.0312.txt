We present a relativistic model for electroweak pion production from nuclei,
focusing on the $\Delta$ and the second resonance region. Bound states are
derived in the Hartree approximation to the $\sigma-\omega$ Walecka model.
Final-state interactions of the outgoing pion and nucleon are described in a
factorized way by means of a relativistic extension of the Glauber model. Our
formalism allows a detailed study of neutrino pion production through $Q^2$,
$W$, energy, angle and out-of-plane distributions.
