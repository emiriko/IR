We discuss a new approach for the numerical evaluation of loop integrals. The
fully numerical calculations of an infrared one-loop vertex and a box diagram
are demonstrated. To perform these calculations, we apply an extrapolation
method based on the $\epsilon$-algorithm. In our approach, the super high
precision control in the numerical manipulation is essential to handle the
infrared singularity. We adopt a multi-precision library named {\tt HMLib} for
the precision control in the calculations.
