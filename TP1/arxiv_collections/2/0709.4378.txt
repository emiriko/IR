We reconsider the Feynman-Kislinger-Ravndal model applied to
neutrino-excitation of baryon resonances. The effects of lepton mass are
included, using the formalism of Kuzmin, Lyubushkin and Naumov. In addition we
take account of the pion-pole contribution to the hadronic axial vector
current. Application of this new formalism to the reaction nu(mu) + p --> mu +
Delta at E(nu) approx 1 GeV gives a suppressed cross section at small angles,
in agreement with the screening correction in Adler's forward scattering
theorem. Application to the process nu(tau) + p --> tau + Delta at E(nu) approx
7 GeV leads to the prediction of right-handed tau polarization for
forward-going leptons, in line with a calculation based on an isobar model. Our
formalism represents an improved version of the Rein-Sehgal model,
incorporating lepton mass effects in a manner consistent with PCAC.
