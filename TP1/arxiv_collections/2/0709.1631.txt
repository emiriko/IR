Low-temperature scanning tunneling spectroscopy over Co nanoislands on
Cu(111) showed that the surface states of the islands vary with their size.
Occupied states exhibit a sizeable downward energy shift as the island size
decreases. The position of the occupied states also significantly changes
across the islands. Atomic-scale simulations and ab inito calculations
demonstrate that the driving force for the observed shift is related to
size-dependent mesoscopic relaxations in the nanoislands.
