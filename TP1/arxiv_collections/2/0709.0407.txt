We show that gravitational energy expression simplifies when a new set of
coordinates that satisfies a certain asymptotic gauge condition is used.
Compared to the ADM formula, positivity of the energy is more transparent in
this new construction. Our proof relies on the asymptotic symmetries
(specifically supertranslations) of the asymptotically flat spacetimes at
spatial infinity in four dimensions.
