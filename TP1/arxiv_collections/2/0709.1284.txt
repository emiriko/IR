Parallel to the construction of gauge invariant spin and orbital angular
momentum for QED in paper (I) of this series, we present here an analogous but
non-trivial solution for QCD. Explicitly gauge invariant spin and orbital
angular momentum operators of quarks and gluons are obtained. This was
previously thought to be an impossible task, and opens a more promising avenue
towards the understanding of the nucleon spin structure.
