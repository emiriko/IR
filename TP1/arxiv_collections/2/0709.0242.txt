We introduce a family of compatible Poisson brackets on the space of $2\times
2$ polynomial matrices, which contains the reflection equation algebra bracket.
Then we use it to derive a multi-Hamiltonian structure for a set of integrable
systems that includes the $XXX$ Heisenberg magnet with boundary conditions, the
generalized Toda lattices and the Kowalevski top.
