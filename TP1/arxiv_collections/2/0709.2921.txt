The issue of the mechanism of high-Tc superconductivity remains open. In this
contribution, we propose a new scenario for the mechanism of superconductivity
in cuprates based on analysis of experimental data, mainly tunneling, neutron
scattering and muon-spin-relaxation data, made earlier (see e.g. Mod. Phys.
Lett. B 19 (2005) 743). A specific feature of this scenario is the mechanism of
the establishment of long-range phase coherence among Cooper pairs, based on
recent experimental data obtained in nonsuperconducting materials.
