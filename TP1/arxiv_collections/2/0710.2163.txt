Continuing our previous work(JHEP 0706:030,2007), large--$N_C$ techniques and
partial wave dispersion relations are used to discuss $\pi\pi$ scattering
amplitudes. We get a set of predictions for $O(p^6)$ low-energy chiral
perturbation theory couplings. They are provided in terms of the masses and
decay widths of scalar and vector mesons.
