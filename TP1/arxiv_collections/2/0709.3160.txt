In this paper propagation properties of a parallel-plate waveguide with
tunable artificial impedance surfaces as sidewalls are studied both
analytically and numerically. The impedance surfaces comprise an array of
patches over a dielectric slab with embedded metallic vias. The tunability of
surfaces is achieved with varactors. Simple design equations for tunable
artificial impedance surfaces as well as dispersion equations for the TE and TM
modes are presented. The propagation properties are studied in three different
regimes: a multi-mode waveguide, a single-mode waveguide, and below-cutoff
waveguide. The analytical results are verified with numerical simulations.
