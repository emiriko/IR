The momentum distribution in KD2PO4(DKDP) has been measured using neutron
Compton scattering above and below the weakly first order
paraelectric-ferroelectric phase transition(T=229K). There is very litte
difference between the two distributions, and no sign of the coherence over two
locations for the proton observed in the paraelectric phase, as in KH2PO4(KDP).
We conclude that the tunnel splitting must be much less than 20mev. The width
of the distribution indicates that the effective potential for DKDP is
significantly softer than that for KDP. As electronic structure calculations
indicate that the stiffness of the potential increases with the size of the
coherent region locally undergoing soft mode fluctuations, we conclude that
there is a mass dependent quantum coherence length in both systems.
