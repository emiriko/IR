Solitonic objects play a central role in gauge and string theory (as, e.g.,
monopoles, black holes, D-branes, etc.). Certain string backgrounds produce a
noncommutative deformation of the low-energy effective field theory, which
allows for new types of solitonic solutions. I present the construction, moduli
spaces and dynamics of Moyal-deformed solitons, exemplified in the 2+1
dimensional Yang-Mills-Higgs theory and its Bogomolny system, which is
gauge-fixed to an integrable chiral sigma model (the Ward model).
Noncommutative solitons for various 1+1 dimensional integrable systems (such as
sine-Gordon) easily follow by dimensional and algebraic reduction.
Supersymmetric extensions exist as well and are related to twistor string
theory.
