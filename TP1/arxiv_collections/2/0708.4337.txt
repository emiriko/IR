Mobile robots require basic information to navigate through an environment:
they need to know where they are (localization) and they need to know where
they are going. For the latter, robots need a map of the environment. Using
sensors of a variety of forms, robots gather information as they move through
an environment in order to build a map. In this paper we present a novel
sampling algorithm to solving the simultaneous mapping and localization (SLAM)
problem in indoor environments. We approach the problem from a Bayesian
statistics perspective. The data correspond to a set of range finder and
odometer measurements, obtained at discrete time instants. We focus on the
estimation of the posterior distribution over the space of possible maps given
the data. By exploiting different factorizations of this distribution, we
derive three sampling algorithms based on importance sampling. We illustrate
the results of our approach by testing the algorithms with two real data sets
obtained through robot navigation inside office buildings at Carnegie Mellon
University and the Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile.
