In a recent paper, Albrecht Kyrieleis, Jeff Forshaw and I discovered a new
tower of super-leading logarithms in gaps between jets cross sections. After
discussions with the referee of our paper and further investigation, we have
come to view this as a breakdown of naive coherence for initial state
radiation. In this talk I illustrate this statement in a simple way, and show
how it results in the super-leading logarithms.
