We study the rectification process of interacting quantum particles in a
periodic potential exposed to the action of an external ac driving. The
breaking of spatio-temporal symmetries leads to directed motion already in the
absence of interactions. A hallmark of quantum ratcheting is the appearance of
resonant enhancement of the current (Europhys. Lett. 79 (2007) 10007 and Phys.
Rev. A 75 (2007) 063424). Here we study the fate of these resonances within a
Gross-Pitaevskii equation which describes a mean field interaction between many
particles. We find, that the resonance is i) not destroyed by interactions, ii)
shifting its location with increasing interaction strength. We trace the
Floquet states of the linear equations into the nonlinear domain, and show that
the resonance gives rise to an instability and thus to the appearance of new
nonlinear Floquet states, whose transport properties differ strongly as
compared to the case of noninteracting particles.
