A Brownian pump of particles powered by a stochastic flashing ratchet
mechanism is studied. The pumping device is embedded in a finite region and
bounded by particle reservoirs. In the steady state, we exactly calculate the
spatial density profile, the concentration ratio between both reservoirs and
the particle flux. A simple numerical scheme is presented allowing for the
consistent evaluation of all such observable quantities.
