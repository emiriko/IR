We present evidence showing how antiprotonic hydrogen, the quasistable
antiproton-proton (pbar-p) bound system, has been synthesized following the
interaction of antiprotons with the hydrogen molecular ion (H2+) in a nested
Penning trap environment. From a careful analysis of the spatial distributions
of antiproton annihilation events, evidence is presented for antiprotonic
hydrogen production with sub-eV kinetic energies in states around n=70, and
with low angular momenta. The slow antiprotonic hydrogen may be studied using
laser spectroscopic techniques.
