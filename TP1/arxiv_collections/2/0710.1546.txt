We studied single-crystalline Pr0.5Sr0.5MnO3 by means of measurements of
magnetic susceptibility and specific heat at ambient pressure (P), and
electrical resistivity (r) in hydrostatic pressures up to 2 GPa. This material
displays ferromagnetic (FM) order, with Curie temperature TC ~ 255 K. A
crystallographic transformation from I4/mcm to Fmmm is accompanied by the onset
of antiferromagnetism (AFM), with Neel temperature TN ~ 161 K. The effect of
pressure is to lower TC, and raise TN at the approximate rates of -3.2 K/GPa,
and 14.2 K/GPa, respectively. Although the value of TN increases with P, due to
the enhancement of the superexchange interactions, the AFM-Fmmm state is
progressively suppressed, as pressure stabilizes the FM-I4/mcm phase to lower
temperatures. The r vs T data suggest that the AFM phase should be completely
suppressed near 2.4 GPa.
