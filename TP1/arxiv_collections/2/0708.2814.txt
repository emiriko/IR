Standard density functional approximations greatly over-estimate the static
polarizability of longchain polymers, but Hartree-Fock or exact exchange
calculations do not. Simple self-interaction corrected (SIC) approximations can
be even better than exact exchange, while their computational cost can scale
only linearly with the number of occupied orbitals.
