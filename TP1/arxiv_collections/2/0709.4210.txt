Some possible connection between spin and charge degrees of freedom in
magneto-resistive manganites is investigated through a thorough experimental
study of the magnetic (AC susceptibility and DC magnetization) and transport
(resistivity and thermal conductivity) properties. Measurements are reported in
the case of well characterized polycrystalline La_{0.8}Sr_{0.2}MnO_3 samples.
The experimental results suggest rather strong field-induced polarization
effects in our material, clearly indicating the presence of ordered FM regions
inside the semiconducting phase. Using an analytical expression which fits the
spontaneous DC magnetization, the temperature and magnetic field dependences of
both electrical resistivity and thermal conductivity data are found to be well
reproduced through a universal scenario based on two mechanisms: (i) a
magnetization dependent spin polaron hopping influenced by a Zeeman splitting
effect, and (ii) properly defined thermally excited polaron states which have
to be taken into account in order to correctly describe the behavior of the
less conducting region. Using the experimentally found values of the magnetic
and electron localization temperatures, we obtain L=0.5nm and m_p=3.2m_e for
estimates of the localization length (size of the spin polaron) and effective
polaron mass, respectively.
