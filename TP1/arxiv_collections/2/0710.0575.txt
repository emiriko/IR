Hadronic interactions of two quasi-real photons have been studied extensively
both during the LEP1 and the LEP2 data taking periods. The higher energies
available at LEP2 in particular opened regions of phase space where hadronic
processes can be predicted reliably by perturbative QCD calculations, usually
available to next-to-leading order in the strong coupling constant for the
process concerned. Over a wide range of observables and phase space good
agreement is observed between measurements and theory, however, there are a few
exceptions. The L3 collaboration has found large discrepancies for high
momentum particle and jet production between theory and experiment, and
measurements of open b-quark production by DELPHI, L3, and OPAL are
consistently in excess of the theoretical values. Three new measurements have
now become available and will be discussed in this paper: on jet and hadron
production by OPAL and open beauty production by ALEPH.
