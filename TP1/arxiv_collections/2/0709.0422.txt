Coherent production of lepton pair in muon scattering by nucleus is
considered. With the help of different approaches (equivalent photon
approximation, direct numerical and analytical calculations) we obtain total
cross section of this reaction and distributions over invariant masses of final
leptons. Special attention is paid to influence of final lepton identity on
total and differential cross sections. We also study the role of coherence
condition. Total cross sections of charmonia production in muon interaction
with electromagnetic field of nucleus are also presented.
