We solve a generalization of ordinary N=1 super Yang-Mills theory with gauge
group U(N) and an adjoint chiral multiplet X for which we turn on both an
arbitrary tree-level superpotential term \int d^{2}\theta Tr W(X) and an
arbitrary field-dependent gauge kinetic term \int d^{2}\theta Tr
V(X)W^{\alpha}W_{\alpha}. When W=0, the model reduces to the extended
Seiberg-Witten theory recently studied by Marshakov and Nekrasov. We use two
different points of view: a ''macroscopic'' approach, using generalized anomaly
equations, the Dijkgraaf-Vafa matrix model and the glueball superpotential; and
the recently proposed ''microscopic'' approach, using Nekrasov's sum over
colored partitions and the quantum microscopic superpotential. The two
formalisms are based on completely different sets of variables and statistical
ensembles. Yet it is shown that they yield precisely the same gauge theory
correlators. This beautiful mathematical equivalence is a facet of the
open/closed string duality. A full microscopic derivation of the
non-perturbative N=1 gauge dynamics follows.
