The flavor dependence of the naive time reversal odd (``T-odd'') parton
distributions for $u$- and $d$-quarks are explored in the spectator model. The
flavor dependence of $h_{1}^{\perp}$ is of significance for the analysis of the
azimuthal $\cos(2\phi)$ asymmetries in unpolarized SIDIS and DY-processes, as
well as for the overall physical understanding of the distribution of
transversely polarized quarks in unpolarized nucleons. As a by-product of the
formalism, we calculate the chiral-odd but ``T-even'' function $h_{1L}^{\perp}$
which enables us to present a prediction for the single spin asymmetry
$A_{UL}^{\sin(2\phi)}$ for a longitudinally polarized target in SIDIS.
