Some recent work on the implications of a dilaton in 4d gauge theories are
revisited. In part I of this paper we see how an effective dilaton coupling to
gauge kinetic term provides a simple attractive mechanism to generate
confinement. In particular, we put emphasis on the derivation of confining
analytical solutions and look into the problem how dilaton degrees of freedom
modify Coulom potential and when a confining phase occurs. In part II, we solve
the semi-relativistic wave equation, for Dick interquark potential using the
Shifted l-expansion technique (SLET) in the heavy quarkonium sector. The
results of this phenomenological analysis proves that these effective theories
can be relevant to model quark confinement and may shed some light on
confinement mechanism.
