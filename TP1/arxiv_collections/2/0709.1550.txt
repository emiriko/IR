We propose to go away from the electromagnetic wave description of light and
to explain through a purely corpuscular and neutral approach, the phenomenon of
the slowing down of light in a transparent medium. The quantum predictions and
ours are compared against experimental refractive indices. In our framework the
optical Kerr phenomenon finds a very natural interpretation and its numerical
values are obtained easily
