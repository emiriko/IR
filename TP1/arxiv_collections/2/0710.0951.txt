The paper shows that the curvature of RP2 is constant iff all geodesics are
closed. Therefore RP2 is the first known manifold with only one G-structure. It
took quiete a long time to find such a manifold. The author shows only that if
all geodesics are closed then there are infinitely many simple closed
geodesics. This proof is based on the geodesic return map and the theory of
topological dynamics. From important results of Green, Grove and Gromoll one
can conclude the theorem.
