The single-particle dynamics close to a metal-to-insulator transition induced
by strong repulsive interaction between the electrons is investigated. The
system is described by a half-filled Hubbard model which is treated by dynamic
mean-field theory evaluated by high-resolution dynamic density-matrix
renormalization. We provide theoretical spectra with momentum resolution which
facilitate the comparison to photoelectron spectroscopy.
