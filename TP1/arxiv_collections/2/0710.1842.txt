We show how to construct an explicit Hamilton cycle in the directed Cayley
graph Cay({\sigma_n, sigma_{n-1}} : \mathbb{S}_n), where \sigma_k = (1 2 >...
k). The existence of such cycles was shown by Jackson (Discrete Mathematics,
149 (1996) 123-129) but the proof only shows that a certain directed graph is
Eulerian, and Knuth (Volume 4 Fascicle 2, Generating All Tuples and
Permutations (2005)) asks for an explicit construction. We show that a simple
recursion describes our Hamilton cycle and that the cycle can be generated by
an iterative algorithm that uses O(n) space. Moreover, the algorithm produces
each successive edge of the cycle in constant time; such algorithms are said to
be loopless.
