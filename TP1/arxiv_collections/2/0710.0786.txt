By analyzing the data sets of 17.3 pb$^{-1}$ taken at $\sqrt{s}=3.773$ GeV
and 6.5 pb$^{-1}$ taken at $\sqrt{s}=3.650$ GeV with the BESII detector at the
BEPC collider, we have measured the observed cross sections for 12 exclusive
light hadron final states produced in $e^+e^-$ annihilation at the two energy
points. We have also set the upper limits on the observed cross sections and
the branching fractions for $\psi(3770)$ decay to these final states at 90%
