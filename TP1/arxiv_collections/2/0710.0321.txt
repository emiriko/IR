We found that in 156Dy and 162Yb the lowest odd spin gamma-vibrational states
transform to the wobbling excitations after the backbending, associated with
the transition from axially-symmetric to nonaxial shapes. The analysis of
quadrupole electric transitions determines uniquely the sign of the
gamma-deformation in both nuclei after the transition point.
