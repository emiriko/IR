We construct the vector and axial vector currents in Wilson Chiral
Perturbation Theory (WChPT), the low-energy effective theory for lattice QCD
with Wilson fermions.
  Our construction is slightly different compared to ChPT in continuum QCD,
where the currents are essentially the (partially) conserved currents
associated with the chiral symmetries. In WChPT, due to explicit chiral
symmetry breaking at non-zero lattice spacing, there appear O(a) terms in the
expressions for the currents which do not stem from the effective action. In
addition, the finite renormalization of the currents needs to be taken into
account in order to properly match the currents of the effective theory.
  As an illustration we compute f_pi to one loop with the renormalized axial
vector current for a particular renormalization condition. It turns out that
for this particular condition some of the O(a) corrections are taken care of by
the renormalization.
