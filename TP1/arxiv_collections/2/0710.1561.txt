We point out that, in a class of gauge mediation models using metastable
supersymmetry breaking vacua, the minimum of the supersymmetry breaking field
in the early universe is dynamically deviated from the one in the low energy.
The deviation induces coherent oscillations of the supersymmetry breaking
field, which decays into the gravitinos. For certain parameters, it can produce
a right amount of the gravitinos to account for the observed dark matter.
