Experiment E949 at Brookhaven National Laboratory studied the rare decay
\$K^+\to\pi^+\nu\bar{\nu}$ and other processes with an exposure of $1.77\times
10^{12}$ $K^+$'s. The data were analyzed using a blind analysis technique
yielding one candidate event with an estimated background of $0.30\pm0.03$
events. Combining this result with the observation of two candidate events by
the predecessor experiment E787 gave the branching ratio
${\calB}(K^+\to\pi^+\nu\bar{\nu})=(1.47^{+1.30}_{-0.89})\times 10^{-10}$,
consistent with the Standard Model prediction of $(0.74\pm0.20)\times
10^{-10}$. This is a more detailed report of results previously published in
Physical Review Letters.
