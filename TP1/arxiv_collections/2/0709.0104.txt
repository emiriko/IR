We define symmetry classes and commutation symmetries in the Hilbert space H
of the 1D spin-1/2 Heisenberg magnetic ring with N sites and investigate them
by means of tools from the representation theory of symmetric groups S_N such
as decompositions of ideals of the group ring C[S_N], idempotents of C[S_N],
discrete Fourier transforms of S_N, Littlewood-Richardson products. In
particular, we determine smallest symmetry classes and stability subgroups of
both single eigenvectors v and subspaces U of eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian
of the magnet. The determination of the smallest symmetry class for U bases on
an algorithm which calculates explicitely a generating idempotent for a
non-direct sum of right ideals of C[S_N]. Let U be a subspace of eigenvectors
of a a fixed eigenvalue \mu of the Hamiltonian with weight (r_1,r_2). If one
determines the smallest symmetry class for every v in U then one can observe
jumps of the symmetry behaviour. For ''generic'' v all smallest symmetry
classes have the same maximal dimension d and structure. But U can contain
linear subspaces on which the dimension of the smallest symmetry class of v
jumps to a value smaller than d. Then the stability subgroup of v can increase.
We can calculate such jumps explicitely. In our investigations we use computer
calculations by means of the Mathematica packages PERMS and HRing.
