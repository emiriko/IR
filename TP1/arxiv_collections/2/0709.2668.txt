The gluon-gluon induced terms for Higgs production through weak-boson fusion
are calculated. They form a finite and gauge-invariant subset of the NNLO
corrections in the strong coupling constant. This is also the lowest order with
sizeable t-channel colour exchange contributions, leading to additional
hadronic activity between the outgoing jets.
