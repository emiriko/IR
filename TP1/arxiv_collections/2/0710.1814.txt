We consider a multiple integral representation for the finite temperature
density-density correlation functions of the one-dimensional Bose gas with
delta function interaction in the limits of infinite and vanishing repulsion.
In the former case a known Fredholm determinant is recovered. In the latter
case a similar expression appears with permanents replacing determinants.
