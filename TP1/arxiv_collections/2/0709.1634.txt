The effect of Mg $\delta$-doping on the structural, electrical and optical
properties of GaN grown $\textsl{via}$ metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy has
been studied using transmission electron microscopy, secondary ion mass
spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, x-ray diffraction, Hall effect
measurements and photoluminescence. For an average Mg concentration above 2.14
$\times$ 10$^{19}$ cm$^{-3}$, phase segregation occurs, as indicated by the
presence of Mg-rich pyramidal inversion domains in the layers. We show that
$\delta$-doping promotes, in comparison to Mg continuous doping, the
suppression of extended defects on the samples surface and improves
significantly the morphology of the epilayers. Conversely, we can not confirm
the reduction in the threading dislocation density - as a result of
$\delta$-doping - reported by other authors. In the phase separation regime,
the hole concentration is reduced with increasing Mg concentration, due to
self-compensation mechanisms. Below the solubility limit of Mg into GaN at our
growth conditions, potential fluctuations result in a red-shift of the emission
energy of the free-to-bound transition.
