We present a `new generation' model for high energy proton-proton `soft'
interactions. It allows for a full set of multi-Pomeron vertices, as well as
including multichannel eikonal scattering. It describes the behaviour of the
proton-proton total, sigma(total), and elastic dsigma(el)/dt, cross sections
together with those for low and high mass proton dissociation. Although the
model contains a comprehensive set of multi-Pomeron diagrams, it has a simple
partonic interpretation. Including the more complicated multi-Pomeron vertices
reduces the absorptive effects as compared to the predictions in which only the
triple-Pomeron vertex is considered. Tuning the model to describe the available
`soft' data in the CERN ISR - Tevatron energy range, we predict the total,
elastic, single- and double-diffractive dissociation cross sections at the LHC
energy. An inescapable consequence of including multichannel eikonal and
multi-Pomeron effects is that the total cross section is expected to be lower
than before: indeed, we find sigma(total) \simeq 90 mb at the LHC energy. We
also present differential forms of the cross sections. In addition we calculate
soft diffractive central production.
