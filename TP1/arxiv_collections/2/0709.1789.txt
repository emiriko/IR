We present a complete 1-loop study of the electroweak corrections to the
process $ug\to dW^+$ in MSSM and SM.
  The occurrence of a number of remarkable properties in the behavior of the
helicity amplitudes at high energies is stressed, and the crucial role of the
virtual SUSY contributions in establishing them, is emphasized. The approach to
asymptopia of these amplitudes is discussed, comparing the effects of the
logarithmic and constant contributions to the mass suppressed ones, which are
relevant at lower energies. Applying crossing to $ug\to d W^+$, we obtain all
subprocesses needed for the 1-loop electroweak corrections to
$W^\pm$-production at LHC. The SUSY model dependence of such a production is
then studied, and illustrations are given for the transverse $W^{\pm}$ momentum
distribution, as well as the angular distribution in the subprocess center of
mass.
