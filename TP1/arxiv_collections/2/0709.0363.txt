Electromagnetic invisibility cloak requires material with anisotropic
distribution of the constitutive parameters deduced from a geometrical
transformation as first proposed by Pendry et al. [Science 312, 1780 (2006)].
In this paper, we proposed a useful method to realize the required
radius-dependent, anisotropic material parameters and to construct an
electromagnetic cloak through concentric layered structure of thin, alternating
layers of homogeneous isotropic materials. With proper design of the
permittivity or the thickness ratio of the alternating layers, we demonstrated
the low-reflection and power-flow bending properties of the proposed cloaking
structure through rigorous analysis of the scattered electromagnetic fields.
The proposed cloaking structure does not require anisotropy or inhomogeneity of
the material constitutive parameters usually realized by metamaterials with
subwavelength structured inclusions, therefore may lead to a practical path to
an experimental demonstration of electromagnetic cloaking, especially in the
optical range.
