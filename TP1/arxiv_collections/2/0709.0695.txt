A reformulation of the Hoop Conjecture based on the concept of trapped circle
is presented. The problems of severe compactness in every spatial direction,
and of how to superpose the hoops with the surface of the black hole, are
resolved. A new conjecture concerning "peeling" properties of
dynamical/trapping horizons is propounded. A novel geometric Hoop inequality is
put forward. The possibility of carrying over the results to arbitrary
dimension is discussed.
