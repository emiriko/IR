We discuss causality properties of extra-dimensional theories allowing for
effectively superluminal bulk shortcuts. Such shortcuts for sterile neutrinos
have been discussed as a solution to the puzzling LSND and MiniBooNE neutrino
oscillation results. We focus here on the sub-category of asymmetrically warped
brane spacetimes and argue that scenarios with two extra dimensions may allow
for timelike curves which can be closed via paths in the extra-dimensional
bulk. In principle sterile neutrinos propagating in the extra dimension may be
manipulated in a way to test the chronology protection conjecture
experimentally.
