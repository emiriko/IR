We reexamine the time-delay formalism of Wigner, Eisenbud and Smith, which
was developed to analyze both elastic and inelastic resonances. An error in the
paper of Smith has propagated through the literature. We correct this error and
show how the results of Eisenbud and Smith are related. We also comment on some
recent time-delay studies, based on Smith's erroneous interpretation of the
Eisenbud result.
