We study the coarsening of two-dimensional oblique stripe patterns by
numerically solving potential and nonpotential anisotropic Swift-Hohenberg
equations. Close to onset, all models exhibit isotropic coarsening with a
single characteristic length scale growing in time as $t^{1/2}$. Further from
onset, the characteristic lengths along the preferred directions $\hat{x}$ and
$\hat{y}$ grow with different exponents, close to 1/3 and 1/2, respectively. In
this regime, one-dimensional dynamical scaling relations hold. We draw an
analogy between this problem and Model A in a stationary, modulated external
field. For deep quenches, nonpotential effects produce a complicated
dislocation dynamics that can lead to either arrested or faster-than-power-law
growth, depending on the model considered. In the arrested case, small isolated
domains shrink down to a finite size and fail to disappear. A comparison with
available experimental results of electroconvection in nematics is presented.
