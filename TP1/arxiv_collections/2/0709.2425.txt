We propose and study methods for detecting the Unruh effect in a
Bose-Einstein condensate. The Bogoliubov vacuum of a Bose-Einstein condensate
is used here to simulate a scalar field-theory, and accelerated atom dots or
optical lattices as means for detecting phonon radiation due to acceleration
effects. We study Unruh's effect for linear acceleration and circular
acceleration. In particular, we study the dispersive effects of the Bogoliubov
spectrum on the ideal case of exact thermalization. Our results suggest that
Unruh's acceleration radiation can be tested using current accessible
experimental methods.
