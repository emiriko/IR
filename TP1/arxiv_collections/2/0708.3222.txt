In this letter we consider higher-dimensional Yang-Mills theories and examine
their consistent coset space dimensional reduction. Utilizing a suitable ansatz
and imposing a simple set of constraints we determine the four-dimensional
gauge theory obtained from the reduction of both the higher-dimensional
Lagrangian and the corresponding equations of motion. The two reductions yield
equivalent results and hence they constitute an example of a consistent
truncation.
