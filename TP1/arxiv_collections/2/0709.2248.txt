The effect of ions has received one of the highest priorities in R&D for the
damping rings of the International Linear Collider(ILC). It is detrimental to
the performance of the electron damping ring. In this note, an update
concerning the ion studies for the ILC damping ring is given. We investigate
the gap role and irregular fill pattern in the ring.The ion density reduction
in different fills is calculated analytically. Simulation results are also
presented.
