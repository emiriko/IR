Using high-quality gas phase electron scattering calculations and multiple
scattering theory, we attempt to gain insights on the radiation damage to DNA
induced by secondary low-energy electrons in the condensed phase, and to bridge
the existing gap with the gas phase theory and experiments. The origin of
different resonant features (arising from single molecules or diffraction) is
discussed and the calculations are compared to existing experiments in thin
films.
