Superspecies are introduced to provide the nice constructions of all
finite-dimensional superalgebras. All acyclic superspecies, or equivalently all
finite-dimensional (gr-basic) gr-hereditary superalgebras, are classified
according to their graded representation types. To this end, graded
equivalence, graded representation type and graded species are introduced for
finite group graded algebras.
