We describe the fractal solid by a special continuous medium model. We
propose to describe the fractal solid by a fractional continuous model, where
all characteristics and fields are defined everywhere in the volume but they
follow some generalized equations which are derived by using integrals of
fractional order. The order of fractional integral can be equal to the fractal
mass dimension of the solid. Fractional integrals are considered as an
approximation of integrals on fractals. We suggest the approach to compute the
moments of inertia for fractal solids. The dynamics of fractal solids are
described by the usual Euler's equations. The possible experimental test of the
continuous medium model for fractal solids is considered.
