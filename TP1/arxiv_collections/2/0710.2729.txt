The backscattering line shape is analytically predicted for thick disordered
medium films where, remarkably, the medium configuration is periodic along the
direction perpendicular to the incident light. A blunt triangular peak is found
to emerge on the sharp top. The phenomenon roots in the coexistence of quasi-1D
localization and 2D extended states.
