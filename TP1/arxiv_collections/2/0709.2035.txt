We have performed Brownian dynamics simulations on melting of two-dimensional
colloidal crystal in which particles interact with Yukawa potential. The pair
correlation function and bond-orientational correlation function was calculated
in the Yukawa system. An algebraic decay of the bond orientational correlation
function was observed. By ruling out the coexistence region, only a unstable
hexatic phase was found in the Yukawa systems. But our work shows that the
melting of the Yukawa systems is a two-stage melting not consist with the KTHNY
theory and the isotropic liquid and the hexatic phase coexistence region was
found. Also we have studied point defects in two-dimensional Yukawa systems.
