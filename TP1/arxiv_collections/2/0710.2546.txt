Thin nanomagnetic rings have generated interest for fundamental studies of
magnetization reversal and also for their potential in various applications,
particularly as magnetic memories. They are a rare example of a geometry in
which an analytical solution for the rate of thermally induced magnetic
reversal has been determined, in an approximation whose errors can be estimated
and bounded. In this work, numerical simulations of soft ferromagnetic rings
are used to explore aspects of the analytical solution. The evolution of the
energy near the transition states confirms that, consistent with analytical
predictions, thermally induced magnetization reversal can have one of two
intermediate states: either constant or soliton-like saddle configurations,
depending on ring size and externally applied magnetic field. The results
confirm analytical predictions of a transition in thermally activated reversal
behavior as magnetic field is varied at constant ring size. Simulations also
show that the analytic one dimensional model continues to hold even for wide
rings.
