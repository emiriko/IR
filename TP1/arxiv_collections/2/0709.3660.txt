We prove several theorems concerning the connection between the local CR
embeddability of 3-dimensional CR manifolds, and the existence of algebraically
special Maxwell and gravitational fields. We reduce the Einstein equations for
spacetimes associated with such fields to a system of CR invariant equations on
a 3-dimensional CR manifold defined by the fields. Using the reduced Einstein
equations we construct two independent CR functions for the corresponding CR
manifold. We also point out that the Einstein equations, imposed on spacetimes
associated with a 3-dimensional CR manifold, imply that the spacetime metric,
after an appropriate rescaling, becomes well defined on a circle bundle over
the CR manifold. The circle bundle itself emerges as a consequence of
Einstein's equations.
