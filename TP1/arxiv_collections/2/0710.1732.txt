The dynamical systems invariant under gauge transformations with higher order
time derivatives of the gauge parameter are considered from the Hamiltonian
point of view. We investigate the consequences of the basic requirements that
the constraints on the one hand and the Hamiltonian and constraints on the
other hand form two closed algebras. It is demonstrated that these simple
algebraic requirements lead to rigid relations in the constraint algebra.
