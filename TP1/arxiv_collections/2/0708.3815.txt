Flavor physics is about particle mass-degeneracy-deviations (DMD) and mixing
and especially about hierarchies of those deviations. On the one hand there is
no established theory of particle flavor at present; on the other hand there
are growing data indications on interesting empirical flavor regularities that
are described here by two semi-empirical rules: quadratic DMD-hierarchy and
Dirac-Majorana DMD-duality rules. First rule unites neutrino solar-atmospheric
hierarchy parameter with charged lepton (CL) and quark mass-ratio hierarchies
and simultaneously unites the hierarchies in the mixing matrices of quarks and
neutrinos; the second rule predicts quasi-degenerate neutrinos from the fact of
CL and quark large mass hierarchy and explains quark-neutrino complementarity
mixing relations. The neutrino and quark mixing data seem very different, but
it results that small deviations from maximal neutrino mixing are nearly equal
to the small deviations from minimal mixing of quarks. Those deviations are
quantitatively described by only one new small flavor parameter ~0.0067.
