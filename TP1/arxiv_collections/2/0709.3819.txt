Magnetization and torque measurements were performed on CeCoIn$_5$ single
crystals to study the mixed-state thermodynamics. These measurements allow the
determination of both paramagnetic and vortex responses in the mixed-state
magnetization. The paramagnetic magnetization is suppressed in the mixed state
with the spin susceptibility increasing with increasing magnetic field. The
dependence of spin susceptibility on magnetic field is due to the fact that
heavy electrons contribute both to superconductivity and paramagnetism and a
large Zeeman effect exists in this system. No anomaly in the vortex response
was found within the investigated temperature and field range.
