A theorem about asymptotic estimation of multiple integral of a special type
is proved for the case when the integrand peaks at the integration domain
bound, but not at a point of extremum. Using this theorem the asymptotic
expansion of the electromagnetic deuteron form factors at high momentum
transfers is obtained in the framework of two-nucleon model in both
nonrelativistic and relativistic impulse approximations. It is found that
relativistic effects slow down the decrease of deuteron form factors and result
in agreement between the relativistic asymptotics and experimental data at high
momentum transfers.
