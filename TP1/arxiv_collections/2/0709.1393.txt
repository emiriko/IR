We discuss an asymmetry of the decay $\omega->e^+e^-$ in nuclear matter with
respect to the electron and positron energies. This asymmetry is sensitive to
the properties of the $\omega$ meson self-energy and, in particular, it has a
non-trivial dependence on the $\omega$ energy and momentum. Therefore, this
asymmetry may serve as a powerful tool in studying the properties of the
$\omega$ meson in the nuclear medium.
