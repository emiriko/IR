This is a follow-up to our earlier work on the energies and radial
distributions of heavy-light mesons. The heavy quark is taken to be static
(infinitely heavy) and the light quark has a mass about that of the strange
quark. We now concentrate on the energies of the excited states with higher
angular momentum and with a radial node. A new improvement is the use of
hypercubic blocking in the time direction.
  The calculation is carried out with dynamical fermions on a 16 cubed times 32
lattice with a lattice spacing approximately 0.1 fm generated using a
non-perturbatively improved clover action.
  In nature the closest equivalent of this heavy-light system is the B_s meson,
which allows us to compare our lattice calculations to experimental results
(where available) or to give a prediction where the excited states,
particularly P-wave states, should lie. We pay special attention to the
spin-orbit splitting, to see which one of the states (for a given angular
momentum L) has the lower energy. An attempt is made to understand these
results in terms of the Dirac equation.
