Using the techniques developed by Lunin and Maldacena we calaculate the
supergravity solutions of membranes and fivebranes in the presence of a
background C field. All the distinct possible C-field configurations are
explored. Decoupling limits for these branes are then described that preserve
the deformation leading to families of M-theory brane deformation duals. The
decoupled geometry is then explored using probe brane techniques and brane
thermodynamics.
