Ground-state phase diagram of the mixed spin-1/2 and spin-1 Ising-Heisenberg
model on doubly decorated planar lattices is examined using the generalized
decoration-iteration transformation. The main attention is devoted to the
comparison of the ground-state properties of the quantum Ising-Heisenberg model
and its semi-classical Ising analogue.
