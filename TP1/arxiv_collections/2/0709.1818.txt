This paper presents dynamic thermal analyses of a power amplifier. All the
investigations are based on the transient junction temperature measurements
performed during the circuit cooling process. The presented results include the
cooling curves, the structure functions, the thermal time constant distribution
and the Nyquist plot of the thermal impedance. The experiments carried out
demonstrated the influence of the contact resistance and the position of the
entire cooling assembly on the obtained results.
