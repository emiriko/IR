We present the complete set of symmetric and antisymmetric (edge and corner)
surface modes in finite one-- and two--dimensional arrays of waveguides. We
provide classification of the modes based on the anti-continuum limit, study
their stability and bifurcations, and discuss relation between surface and bulk
modes. We put forward existence of surface breathers, which represent
two-frequency modes localized about the array edges.
