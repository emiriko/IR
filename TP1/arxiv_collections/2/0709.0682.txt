We introduce the innovative technologies, based on the concept of "sensory
substitution", we are developing in the fields of biomedical engineering and
human disability. Precisely, our goal is to design, develop and validate
practical assistive biomedical and/or technical devices and/or rehabilitating
procedures for persons with disabilities, using artificial tongue-placed
tactile biofeedback systems. Proposed applications are dealing with: (1)
pressure sores prevention in case of spinal cord injuries (persons with
paraplegia, or tetraplegia); and (2) balance control improvement to prevent
fall in older and/or disabled adults. This paper describes the architecture and
the functioning principle of these biofeedback systems and presents preliminary
results of two feasibility studies performed on young healthy adults.
