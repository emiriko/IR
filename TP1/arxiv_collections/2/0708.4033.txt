An extension of the neutrino sector with two right handed singlet neutrinos
responsible for Dirac neutrino masses is discussed. We show that this setup
with flavor symmetry can give large solar and atmospheric neutrino mixings and
suppressed Theta_13. The flavor symmetry U(1) x S_4 is shown to lead to
Theta_23 = \pi/4 and a new predictive formula for the Theta_13(\simeq 0.015).
