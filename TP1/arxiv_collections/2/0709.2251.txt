Using empirical scheme, atomic structure of a new exotic class of silicon
nanoclusters was elaborated upon the central icosahedral core (Si-IC) and
pentagonal petals (Si-PP) growing from Si-IC vertexes. It was shown that
Si-IC/Si-PP interface formation is energetically preferable. Some experimental
observations of silicon nanostructures can be explained by presence of the
proposed objects. The Extended Huckel Theory electronic structure calculations
demonstrate an ability of the proposed objects to act as nanoscale tunnel
junctions.
