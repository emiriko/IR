We analyze the effect of the long-range interaction on the transport
properties through ordered and disordered one-dimensional metallic nanoparticle
arrays. We discuss how the threshold voltage, the I-V curves and the voltage
drop through the array are modified as compared to the case in which
interactions are restricted to charges placed on the same island. We show that
some of these modifications are due to finite interactions between charges in
different nanoparticles while other ones are due to interactions between
charges in the islands and those at the electrodes, what produces a
polarization potential drop through the array. We study the screening of the
disorder potential due to charges impurities trapped in the substrate and find
that long-range interactions introduce correlations between the disorder
potentials of neighboring islands.
