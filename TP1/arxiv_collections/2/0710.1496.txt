A two-temperature Ising-Schelling model is introduced and studied for
describing human segregation. The self-organized Ising model with Glauber
kinetics simulated by M\"uller et al. exhibits a phase transition between
segregated and mixed phases mimicking the change of tolerance (local
temperature) of individuals. The effect of external noise is considered here as
a second temperature added to the decision of individuals who consider change
of accommodation. A numerical evidence is presented for a discontinuous phase
transition of the magnetization.
