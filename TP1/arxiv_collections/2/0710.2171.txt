We study the properties and behaviour of the quasi-pseudospherical and
quasi-planar Szekeres models, obtain the regularity conditions, and analyse
their consequences. The quantities associated with "radius" and "mass" in the
quasi-spherical case must be understood in a different way for these cases. The
models with pseudospherical foliation can have spatial maxima and minima, but
no origins. The "mass" and "radius" functions may be one increasing and one
decreasing without causing shell crossings. This case most naturally describes
a snake-like, variable density void in a more gently varying inhomogeneous
background, although regions that develop an overdensity are also possible. The
Szekeres models with plane foliation can have neither spatial extrema nor
origins, cannot be spatially flat, and they cannot have more inhomogeneity than
the corresponding Ellis model, but a planar surface can be the boundary between
regions of spherical and pseudospherical foliation.
