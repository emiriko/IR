Let \psi(x) be a polynomial with rational coefficients. Suppose that \psi has
the positive leading coefficient and zero constant term. Let A be a set of
positive integers with the positive upper density. Then there exist x,y\in A
and a prime p such that x-y=\psi(p-1). Furthermore, if P be a set of primes
with the positive relative upper density, then there exist x,y\in P and a prime
p such that x-y=\psi(p-1).
