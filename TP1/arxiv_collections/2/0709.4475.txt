ZnCr2O4 undergoes a first order spin-Peierls-like phase transition at 12.5 K
from a cubic spin liquid phase to a tetragonal Neel state. Using powder
diffraction and single crystal polarized neutron scattering, we determined the
complex spin structure of the Neel phase. This phase consisted of several
magnetic domains with different characteristic wave vectors. This indicates
that the tetragonal phase of ZnCr2O4 is very close to a critical point
surrounded by many different Neel states. We have also studied, using elastic
and inelastic neutron scattering techniques, the effect of nonmagnetic dilution
on magnetic correlations in ZnCr_{2-2x}Ga_{2x}O_4 (x=0.05 and 0.3). For x=0.05,
the magnetic correlations do not change qualitatively from those in the pure
material, except that the phase transition becomes second order. For x= 0.3,
the spin-spin correlations become short range. Interestingly, the spatial
correlations of the frozen spins in the x=0.3 material are the same as those of
the fluctuating moments in the pure and the weakly diluted materials.
