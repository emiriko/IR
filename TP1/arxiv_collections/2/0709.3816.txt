We propose a means to discriminate between the two basic variants of Little
Higgs models, the Product Group and Simple Group models, at the next generation
of colliders. It relies on a special coupling of light pseudoscalar particles
present in Little Higgs models, the pseudoaxions, to the Z and the Higgs boson,
which is present only in Simple Group models. We discuss the collider
phenomenology of the pseudoaxion in the presence of such a coupling at the LHC,
where resonant production and decay of either the Higgs or the pseudoaxion
induced by that coupling can be observed for much of parameter space. The full
allowed range of parameters, including regions where the observability is
limited at the LHC, is covered by a future ILC, where double scalar production
would be a golden channel to look for.
