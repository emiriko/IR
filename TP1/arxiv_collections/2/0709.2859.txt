High energy longitudinal electron polarimetry will be based on Compton
scattering for the International Linear Collider. An unobtrusive measurement
has to include a magnet chicane setup serving as a spectrometer. Current
proposals make use of Cerenkov detectors for electron detection. A fast
simulation has been developed to study the basic properties of scenarios for
the polarimeter setup.
