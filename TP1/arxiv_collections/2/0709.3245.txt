In 1878, Jordan showed that a finite subgroup of GL(n,C) contains an abelian
normal subgroup whose index is bounded by a function of n alone. Previously,
the author has given precise bounds. Here, we consider analogues for finite
linear groups over algebraically closed fields of positive characteristic l. A
larger normal subgroup must be taken, to eliminate unipotent subgroups and
groups of Lie type and characteristic l, and we show that generically the bound
is similar to that in characteristic 0 - being (n+1)!, or (n+2)! when l divides
(n+2) - given by the faithful representations of minimal degree of the
symmetric groups. A complete answer for the optimal bounds is given for all
degrees n and every characteristic l.
