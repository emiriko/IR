Nonlinear field theories can be used to study both standard physics
questions, or to study questions such as the emergence of order and complexity.
These theories are generally derived from the symmetries of a given problem and
the interactions that respect those symmetries. Formally one can then quantize
the system to find the masses of the fundamental excitations, but this
procedure generally destroys much information about solutions of the field
equations with large non-perturbative amplitudes. To get information about the
properties of the solutions to these field theories without perturbative
approximations we use real time lattice simulations where complex
spatiotemporal structures emerge dynamically from excess free energy and a
thermal background. We present results in 2 and 3 dimensions of new interacting
quasi-particle formations from a quench. These objects show an emergent level
of complexity which we attempt to categorize and define in a manner that should
be useful to many different applications.
