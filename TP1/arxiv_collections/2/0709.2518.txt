Contact interactions offer a general framework for describing a new
interaction with a scale above the energy scale probed. These interactions can
occur if the Standard Model particles are composite or if new heavy particles
are exchanged. The discovery potential of contact interactions at the LHC in
dimuon and dijet final states at startup and the asymptotic reach are
presented.
