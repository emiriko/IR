We show that for tripartite quantum pure states of qubits, all the kinds of
entanglement in terms of SLOCC classification are experimentally measurable by
simple projective measurements, provided that four copies of the composite
quantum system are available. In particular, the entanglement of reduced
density matrices, even though they are mixed states, can be exactly determined
in experiment. Concurrence of assistance is also shown to be measurable by
introducing an interesting equations with explicit physical meanings.
