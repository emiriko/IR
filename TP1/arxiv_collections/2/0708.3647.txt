We report on strongly enhanced electron multiplication in thin silicon
membranes. The device is configured as a transmission-type membrane for
electron multiplication. A sub-threshold electric field applied on the emission
side of the membrane enhances the number of electrons emitted by two orders of
magnitude. This enhancement stems from field emitted electrons stimulated by
the incident particles, which suggests that stacks of silicon membranes can
form ultra-sensitive electron multipliers.
