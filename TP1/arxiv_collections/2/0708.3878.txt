By measuring the low temperature specific heat, the low energy quasi-particle
excitation has been derived and analyzed in systematically doped
La$_{2-x}$Sr$_{x}$CuO$_{4}$ single crystals. The Volovik's relation predicted
for a d-wave superconductor has been well demonstrated in wide doping regime,
showing a robust evidence for the d-wave pairing symmetry. Furthermore the
nodal gap slope $v_\Delta$ of the superconducting gap is derived and is found
to follow the same doping dependence of the pseudogap obtained from ARPES and
tunnelling measurement. This strongly suggests a close relationship between the
pseudogap and superconductivity. Taking the entropy conservation into account,
we argue that the ground state of the pseudogap phase should have Fermi arcs
with finite density of states at zero K, and the transport data show that it
behaves like an insulator due to probably weak localization. A nodal metal
picture for the pseudogap phase cannot interpret the data. Based on the Fermi
arc picture for the pseudogap phase it is found that the superconducting energy
scale or $T_c$ in underdoped regime is governed by both the maximum gap and the
spectral weight from the Fermi arcs. This suggests that there are two energy
scales: superconducting energy scale and the pseudogap. The superconductivity
may be formed by the condensation of Fermi arc quasiparticles through pairing
by exchanging virtue bosons.
