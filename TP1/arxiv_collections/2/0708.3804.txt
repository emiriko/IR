Meson-meson reactions A(q_1 \bar{q}_1) + B(q_2 \bar{q}_2) to q_1 + \bar{q}_1
+ q_2 + \bar{q}_2 in high-temperature hadronic matter are found to produce an
appreciable amount of quarks and antiquarks freely moving in hadronic matter
and to establish a new mechanism for deconfinement of quarks and antiquarks in
hadronic matter.
