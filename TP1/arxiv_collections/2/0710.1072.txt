We construct quadratic finite-dimensional Poisson algebras and their quantum
versions related to rank N and degree one vector bundles over elliptic curves
with n marked points. The algebras are parameterized by the moduli of curves.
For N=2 and n=1 they coincide with the Sklyanin algebras. We prove that the
Poisson structure is compatible with the Lie-Poisson structure on the direct
sum of n copies of sl(N). The derivation is based on the Poisson reduction from
the canonical brackets on the affine space over the cotangent bundle to the
groups of automorphisms of vector bundles.
