We investigate the propagation of multidimensional gravitational waves
generated before compactification and observes today as 4-dimensional
gravitational waves and gauge fields by generalizing the investigation of
Alesci and Montani(AM) to the case where the internal space is an n-sphere. We
also derive the 4-dimensional forms of the multidimensional harmonic gauge
condition. The primary difference from the case of AM comes from the effect of
curvature of the internal space which prevent the space to be static. The other
effects are explicitly shown for propagation of the waves in our 4-dimensional
spacetime. Static internal space exists if multidimensional
cosmologicalconstant is present. Then the situation is similar to the
one-dimensional internal space.
