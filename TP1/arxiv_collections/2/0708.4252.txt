This paper considers some fundamental questions concerning marginally trapped
surfaces, or apparent horizons, in Cauchy data sets for the Einstein equation.
An area estimate for outermost marginally trapped surfaces is proved. The proof
makes use of an existence result for marginal surfaces, in the presence of
barriers, curvature estimates, together with a novel surgery construction for
marginal surfaces. These results are applied to characterize the boundary of
the trapped region.
