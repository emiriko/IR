We discuss simulations of a simple model for polymer blends in the framework
of the Rouse model. At odds with standard predictions, large dynamic asymmetry
between the two components induces strong non-exponentiality of the Rouse modes
for the fast component. Despite chains being much shorter than the entanglement
length, it also induces dynamic features resembling a crossover to
entangled-like chain dynamics. This unusual behavior is associated to strong
memory effects which break down the assumption of time uncorrelation of the
external forces acting on the tagged chain.
