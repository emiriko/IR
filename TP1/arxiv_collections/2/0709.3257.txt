Consider partial maps from the free monoid into the field of real numbers
with a rational domain. We show that two families of such series are actually
the same: the unambiguous rational series on the one hand, and the max-plus and
min-plus rational series on the other hand. The decidability of equality was
known to hold in both families with different proofs, so the above unifies the
picture. We give an effective procedure to build an unambiguous automaton from
a max-plus automaton and a min-plus one that recognize the same series.
