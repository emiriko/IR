The motility of motile Amoeba proteus was examined using the technique of
passive particle tracking microrheology, with the aid of newly-developed
particle tracking software, a fast digital camera and an optical microscope. We
tracked large numbers of endogeneous particles in the amoebae, which displayed
subdiffusive motion at short time scales, corresponding to thermal motion in a
viscoelastic medium, and superdiffusive motion at long time scales due to the
convection of the cytoplasm. Subdiffusive motion was characterised by a
rheological scaling exponent of 3/4 in the cortex, indicative of the
semiflexible dynamics of the actin fibres. We observed shear-thinning in the
flowing endoplasm, where exponents increased with increasing flow rate; i.e.
the endoplasm became more fluid-like. The rheology of the cortex is found to be
isotropic, reflecting an isotropic actin gel. A clear difference was seen
between cortical and endoplasmic layers in terms of both viscoelasticity and
flow velocity, where the profile of the latter is close to a Poiseuille flow
for a Newtonian fluid.
