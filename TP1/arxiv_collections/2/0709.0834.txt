We have investigated the pressure dependence of ac and dc susceptibilities of
the heavy-fermion superconductor CePt3Si (Tc= 0.75 K) that coexists with
antiferromagnetism (TN = 2.2 K). As hydrostatic pressure is increased, Tc first
decreases rapidly, then rather slowly near the critical pressure Pc = 0.6 GPa
and shows a stronger decrease again at higher pressures, where Pc is the
pressure at which TN becomes zero. A transition width and a difference in the
two transition temperatures defined in the form of structures in the
out-of-phase component of ac susceptibilities also become small near Pc,
indicating that a double transition observed in CePt3Si is caused by some
inhomogeneous property in the sample that leads to a spatial variation of local
pressure. A sudden increase in the Meissner fraction above Pc suggests the
influence of antiferromagnetism on superconductivity.
