QCDml is an XML-based markup language designed for sharing QCD configurations
and ensembles world-wide via the International Lattice Data Grid (ILDG). Based
on the latest release, we present key ingredients of the QCDml in order to
provide some starting points for colleagues in this community to markup
valuable configurations and submit them to the ILDG.
