Information flow or information transfer is an important concept in dynamical
systems which has applications in a wide variety of scientific disciplines. In
this study, we show that a rigorous formalism can be established in the context
of a generic stochastic dynamical system. The resulting measure of of
information transfer possesses a property of transfer asymmetry and, when the
stochastic perturbation to the receiving component does not rely on the giving
component, has a form same as that for the corresponding deterministic system.
An application with a two-dimensional system is presented, and the resulting
transfers are just as expected. A remarkable observation is that, for two
highly correlated time series, there could be no information transfer from one
certain series, say $x_2$, to the other ($x_1$). That is to say, the evolution
of $x_1$ may have nothing to do with $x_2$, even though $x_1$ and $x_2$ are
highly correlated. Information transfer analysis thus extends the traditional
notion of correlation analysis by providing a quantitative measure of causality
between time series.
