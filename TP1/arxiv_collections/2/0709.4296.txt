The article introduces a new relationship between the chemical system
complexity and deviation of its bifurcation point from thermodynamic
equilibrium. In the formalism of discrete thermodynamics of chemical
equilibria, simulation of numerous equilibrium cases with regards to complexity
of the reaction hosting systems has lead to a conclusion that the system
deviation from thermodynamic equilibrium at the bifurcation point is directly
proportional to logarithm of the system complexity parameter. With this
relationship one can predict the efforts that are sufficient to destabilize the
system thermodynamic branch and achieve the bifurcations area.
