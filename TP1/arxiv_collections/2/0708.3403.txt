The classical bound on image resolution defined by the Rayleigh limit can be
beaten by exploiting the properties of quantum mechanical entanglement. If
entangled photons are used as signal states, the best possible resolution is
instead given by the Heisenberg limit, an improvement proportional to the
number of entangled photons in the signal. In this paper we present a novel
application of entanglement by showing that the resolution obtained by an
imaging system utilizing separable photons can be achieved by an imaging system
making use of entangled photons, but with the advantage of a smaller aperture,
thus resulting in a smaller and lighter system. This can be especially valuable
in satellite imaging where weight and size play a vital role.
