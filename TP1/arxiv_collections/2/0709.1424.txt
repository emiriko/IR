We report the first implementation of a Gauss sum factorization algorithm by
an internal state Ramsey interferometer using cold atoms. A sequence of
appropriately designed light pulses interacts with an ensemble of cold rubidium
atoms. The final population in the involved atomic levels determines a Gauss
sum. With this technique we factor the number N=263193.
