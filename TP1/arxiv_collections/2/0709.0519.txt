A consistent picture of the Au+Au and D+Au, s^1/2 = 200 A GeV measurements at
RHIC obtained with the PHENIX, STAR, PHOBOS and BRAHMS detectors including both
the rapidity and transverse momentum spectra was previously developed with the
simulation LUCIFER. The approach was modeled on the early production of a fluid
of pre-hadrons after the completion of an initial, phase of high energy
interactions. The formation of pre-hadrons is discussed here, in a perturbative
QCD approach as advocated by Kopeliovich, Nemchik and Schmidt. In the second
phase of LUCIFER, a considerably lower energy hadron-like cascade ensues. Since
the dominant collisions occurring in this latter phase are meson-meson in
character while the initial collisions are between baryons, i.e. both involve
hadron sized interaction cross-sections, there is good reason to suspect that
the observed elliptical flow will be produced naturally, and this is indeed
found to be the case.
