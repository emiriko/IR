We investigate the conductivity $\sigma$ of graphene nanoribbons with zigzag
edges as a function of Fermi energy $E_F$ in the presence of the impurities
with different potential range. The dependence of $\sigma(E_F)$ displays four
different types of behavior, classified to different regimes of length scales
decided by the impurity potential range and its density. Particularly, low
density of long range impurities results in an extremely low conductance
compared to the ballistic value, a linear dependence of $\sigma(E_F)$ and a
wide dip near the Dirac point, due to the special properties of long range
potential and edge states. These behaviors agree well with the results from a
recent experiment by Miao \emph{et al.} (to appear in Science).
