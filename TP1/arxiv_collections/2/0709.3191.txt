We discuss a number of fundamental aspects of modern cosmological concepts,
from the phenomenological, observational, theoretical and epistemic points of
view. We argue that the modern cosmology, despite a great advent, in particular
in the observational sector, is yet to solve important problems, posed already
by the classical times. In particular the stress is put on discerning the
scientific features of modern cosmological paradigms from the more speculative
ones, with the latter immersed in some aspects deeply into mythological world
picture. We finally discuss the principal paradigms, which are present in the
modern cosmological studies and evaluate their epistemic merits.
