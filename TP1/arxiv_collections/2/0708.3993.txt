The propagator of linear molecules whose constituents interact through
oscillator potentials can be obtained in a closed form for $N$ atoms as long as
$N \leq 4$. We compute the propagator for arbitrary $N$ in the approximation $N
\gg 1$. Taking advantage of this result it is possible to analyze the limit in
which the molecule has an infinite number of constituents with infinitesimal
length of sepparation, corresponding to the quantization of a string, elastic
rod or the second quantization of a Klein Gordon particle. The evolution of
some specific initial conditions is also studied, namely the time development
of states with minimal dispersion and the effect of sudden perturbations on the
vacuum of the scalar field theory.
