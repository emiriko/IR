We investigate the propagation of spin excitations in a one-dimensional (1D)
ferromagnetic Bose gas. While the spectrum of longitudinal spin waves in this
system is sound-like, the dispersion of transverse spin excitations is
quadratic making a direct application of the Luttinger Liquid (LL) theory
impossible. By using a combination of different analytic methods we derive the
large time asymptotic behavior of the spin-spin dynamical correlation function
for strong interparticle repulsion. The result has an unusual structure
associated with a crossover from the regime of trapped spin wave to an open
regime and does not have analogues in known low-energy universality classes of
quantum 1D systems.
