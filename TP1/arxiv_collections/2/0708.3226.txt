In the constraint satisfaction problem ($CSP$), the aim is to find an
assignment of values to a set of variables subject to specified constraints. In
the minimum cost homomorphism problem ($MinHom$), one is additionally given
weights $c_{va}$ for every variable $v$ and value $a$, and the aim is to find
an assignment $f$ to the variables that minimizes $\sum_{v} c_{vf(v)}$. Let
$MinHom(\Gamma)$ denote the $MinHom$ problem parameterized by the set of
predicates allowed for constraints. $MinHom(\Gamma)$ is related to many
well-studied combinatorial optimization problems, and concrete applications can
be found in, for instance, defence logistics and machine learning. We show that
$MinHom(\Gamma)$ can be studied by using algebraic methods similar to those
used for CSPs. With the aid of algebraic techniques, we classify the
computational complexity of $MinHom(\Gamma)$ for all choices of $\Gamma$. Our
result settles a general dichotomy conjecture previously resolved only for
certain classes of directed graphs, [Gutin, Hell, Rafiey, Yeo, European J. of
Combinatorics, 2008].
