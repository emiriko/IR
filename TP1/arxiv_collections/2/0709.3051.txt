Carbon Nanotube (CNT) appears as a promising candidate to shrink field-effect
transistors (FET) to the nanometer scale. Extensive experimental works have
been performed recently to develop the appropriate technology and to explore DC
characteristics of carbon nanotube field effect transistor (CNTFET). In this
work, we present results of Monte Carlo simulation of a coaxially gated CNTFET
including electron-phonon scattering. Our purpose is to present the intrinsic
transport properties of such material through the evaluation of electron
mean-free-path. To highlight the potential of high performance level of CNTFET,
we then perform a study of DC characteristics and of the impact of capacitive
effects. Finally, we compare the performance of CNTFET with that of Si nanowire
MOSFET.
