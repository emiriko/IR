Recently CDF and D0 collaborations observed several bottom baryons. In this
work we perform a systematic study of the masses of bottom baryons up to
$1/m_Q$ in the framework of heavy quark effective field theory (HQET) using the
QCD sum rule approach. The extracted chromo-magnetic splitting between the
bottom baryon heavy doublet agrees well with the experimental data.
