The coherent control of small quantum system is considered. For a two-level
system coupled to an arbitrary bath we consider a pulse of finite duration. We
derive the leading and the next-leading order corrections to the evolution
operator due to the non-commutation of the pulse and the bath Hamiltonian. The
conditions are computed that make the leading corrections vanish. The pulse
shapes optimized in this way are given for $\pi$ and $\frac{\pi}{2}$ pulses.
