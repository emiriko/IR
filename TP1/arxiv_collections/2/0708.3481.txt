The formation of multipartite quantum entanglement by repeated operation of
one and two qubit gates is examined. The resulting entanglement is evaluated
using two measures: the average bipartite entanglement and the Groverian
measure. A comparison is made between two geometries of the quantum register: a
one dimensional chain in which two-qubit gates apply only locally between
nearest neighbors and a non-local geometry in which such gates may apply
between any pair of qubits. More specifically, we use a combination of random
single qubit rotations and a fixed two-qubit gate such as the controlled-phase
gate. It is found that in the non-local geometry the entanglement is generated
at a higher rate. In both geometries, the Groverian measure converges to its
asymptotic value more slowly than the average bipartite entanglement. These
results are expected to have implications on different proposed geometries of
future quantum computers with local and non-local interactions between the
qubits.
