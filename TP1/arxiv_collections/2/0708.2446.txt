This article is a summary of four introductory lectures on ``Neutrino
Experiments,'' given at the 2006 TASI summer school. The purposes were to
sketch out the present questions in neutrino physics and to discuss the
experimental challenges in addressing them. This article concentrates on
specific, illustrative examples rather than providing a complete overview of
the field of neutrino physics. These lectures were meant to lay the ground-work
for the talks which followed on specific, selected topics in neutrino physics.
