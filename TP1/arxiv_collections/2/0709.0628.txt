We present a numerical investigation of two-dimensional decaying turbulence
in the Lagrangian framework. Focusing on single particle statistics, we
investigate Lagrangian trajectories in a freely evolving turbulent velocity
field. The dynamical evolution of the tracer particles is strongly dominated by
the emergence and evolution of coherent structures. For a statistical analysis
we focus on the Lagrangian acceleration as a central quantity. For more
geometrical aspects we investigate the curvature along the trajectories. We
find strong signatures for self-similar universal behavior.
