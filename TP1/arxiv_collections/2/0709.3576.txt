We calculate the medium dilepton yield from a quark-gluon plasma which has a
time-dependent local momentum-space anisotropy. A phenomenological model for
the hard momentum scale, p_hard(tau), and plasma anisotropy parameter, xi(tau),
is constructed which interpolates between free streaming behavior at early
times (tau << tau_iso) and ideal hydrodynamic behavior at late times (tau >>
tau_iso). We show that high-energy dilepton production is sensitive to the
assumed plasma isotropization time, tau_iso, and can therefore be used to
experimentally determine the time of onset for hydrodynamic expansion of a
quark-gluon plasma and the magnitude of expected early-time momentum-space
anisotropies.
