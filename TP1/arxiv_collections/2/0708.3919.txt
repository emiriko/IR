On the linear level elliptic equilibria of Hamiltonian systems are mere
superpositions of harmonic oscillators. Non-linear terms can produce
instability, if the ratio of frequencies is rational and the Hamiltonian is
indefinite. In this paper we study the frequency ratio 1/2 and its unfolding.
In particular we show that for the indefinite case (1:-2) the frequency ratio
map in a neighbourhood of the origin has a critical point, i.e. the twist
condition is violated for one torus on every energy surface near the energy of
the equilibrium. In contrast, we show that the frequency map itself is
non-degenerate (i.e. the Kolmogorov non-degeneracy condition holds) for every
torus in a neighbourhood of the equilibrium point. As a byproduct we are able
to obtain another proof of fractional monodromy in the 1:-2 resonance.
