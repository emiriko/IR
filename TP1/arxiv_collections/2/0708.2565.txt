Account of an intrinsic spin-orbit coupling in the valence bands of common
semiconductors yields the scalar spin-orbit-rotation term in the effective-mass
Hamiltonian of the conduction-band electron. This result is obtained within the
multiband envelope function approximation. Fundamentally, the
spin-orbit-rotation coupling can be described in purely geometric terms as a
consequence of the difference in the Berry phase acquired by the components of
the spin-orbitally mixed Kramers-doublet during its cyclic evolution in the
reciprocal momentum space.
