We discuss when static Killing vector fields are standard, that is, leading
to a global orthogonal splitting of the spacetime. We prove that such an
orthogonal splitting is unique whenever the natural space is compact. This is
carried out by proving that many notable spacelike submanifolds must be
contained in an orthogonal slice. Possible obstructions to the global splitting
are also considered.
