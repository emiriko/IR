In the companion paper, we measured homology classes and computed the optimal
homology basis. This paper addresses two related problems, namely, localization
and stability. We localize a class with the cycle minimizing a certain
objective function. We explore three different objective functions, namely,
volume, diameter and radius. We show that it is NP-hard to compute the smallest
cycle using the former two. We also prove that the measurement defined in the
companion paper is stable with regard to small changes of the geometry of the
concerned space.
