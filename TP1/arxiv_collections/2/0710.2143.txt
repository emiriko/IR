We offer a complete classification of right coideal subalgebras which contain
all group-like elements for the multiparameter version of the quantum group
$U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_{n+1})$ provided that the main parameter $q$ is not a root
of 1. As a consequence, we determine that for each subgroup $\Sigma $ of the
group $G$ of all group-like elements the quantum Borel subalgebra $U_q^+
(\mathfrak{sl}_{n+1})$ containes $(n+1)!$ different homogeneous right coideal
subalgebras $U$ such that $U\cap G=\Sigma .$ If $q$ has a finite multiplicative
order $t>2,$ the classification remains valid for homogeneous right coideal
subalgebras of the multiparameter version of the Lusztig quantum group $u_q
(\frak{sl}_{n+1}).$ In the paper we consider the quantifications of Kac-Moody
algebras as character Hopf algebras [V.K. Kharchenko, A combinatorial approach
to the quantifications of Lie algebras, Pacific J. Math., 203(1)(2002), 191-
233].
