We first give a short review of the ``local-current approximation'' (LCA),
derived from a general variation principle, which serves as a semiclassical
description of strongly collective excitations in finite fermion systems
starting from their quantum-mechanical mean-field ground state. We illustrate
it for the example of coupled translational and compressional dipole
excitations in metal clusters. We then discuss collective electronic dipole
excitations in C$_{60}$ molecules (Buckminster fullerenes). We show that the
coupling of the pure translational mode (``surface plasmon'') with
compressional volume modes in the semiclasscial LCA yields semi-quantitative
agreement with microscopic time-dependent density functional (TDLDA)
calculations, while both theories yield qualitative agreement with the recent
experimental observation of a ``volume plasmon''.
