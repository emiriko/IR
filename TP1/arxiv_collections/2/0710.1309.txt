Andreev reflection at a superconductor and Klein tunneling through an n-p
junction in graphene are two processes that couple electrons to holes -- the
former through the superconducting pair potential Delta and the latter through
the electrostatic potential U. We derive that the energy spectra in the two
systems are identical, at low energies E<<Delta and for an antisymmetric
potential profile U(-x,y)=-U(x,y). This correspondence implies that bipolar
junctions in graphene may have zero density of states at the Fermi level and
carry a current in equilibrium, analogously to superconducting Josephson
junctions. It also implies that nonelectronic systems with the same band
structure as graphene, such as honeycomb-lattice photonic crystals, can exhibit
pseudo-superconducting behavior.
