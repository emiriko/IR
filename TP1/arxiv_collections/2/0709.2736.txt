A recent paper by G. Nimtz and A. A. Stahlhofen [arXiv:0708.0681v1] makes the
following claims: (1) that the authors have observed a macroscopic violation of
special relativity, (2) that they have demonstrated quantum mechanical behavior
of evanescent modes on a meter-length scale, and (3) that barriers are crossed
in zero time, implying superluminal (faster than light), and indeed, infinite
tunneling velocity. Here I suggest that all these claims are erroneous and are
based on a misinterpretation of a purely classical measurement accurately
described by Maxwell's equations.
