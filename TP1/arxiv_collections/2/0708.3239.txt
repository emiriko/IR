We discuss the validity (or not) of the ring-diagram approximation (i.e. RPA)
in the calculation of graphene self-energy in the weak-coupling ($r_s \ll 1$)
limit, showing that RPA is a controlled and valid approximation for
\textit{extrinsic} graphene where the Fermi level is away from the Dirac point.
