The nucleon electromagnetic form factors continue to be of major interest for
experimentalists and phenomenologists alike. They provide important insights
into the structure of nuclear matter. For a range of interesting momenta they
can be calculated on the lattice. The limiting factor continues to be the value
of the pion mass. We present the latest results of the QCDSF collaboration
using gauge configurations with two dynamical, non-perturbatively improved
Wilson fermions at pion masses as low as 350 MeV.
