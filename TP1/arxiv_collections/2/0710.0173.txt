The numbers game is a one-player game played on a finite simple graph with
certain ``amplitudes'' assigned to its edges and with an initial assignment of
real numbers to its nodes. The moves of the game successively transform the
numbers at the nodes using the amplitudes in a certain way. This game and its
interactions with Coxeter/Weyl group theory and Lie theory have been studied by
many authors. In particular, Eriksson connects certain geometric
representations of Coxeter groups with games on graphs with certain real number
amplitudes. Games played on such graphs are ``E-games.'' Here we investigate
various finiteness aspects of E-game play: We extend Eriksson's work relating
moves of the game to reduced decompositions of elements of a Coxeter group
naturally associated to the game graph. We use Stembridge's theory of fully
commutative Coxeter group elements to classify what we call here the
``adjacency-free'' initial positions for finite E-games. We characterize when
the positive roots for certain geometric representations of finite Coxeter
groups can be obtained from E-game play. Finally, we provide a new Dynkin
diagram classification result of E-game graphs meeting a certain finiteness
requirement.
