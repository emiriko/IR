Inspired by the recent Georgi's unparticle proposal, we study the flavor
structures of the standard model (SM) particles when they couple to
unparticles. At a very high energy scale, we introduce $\BZ$ charges for the SM
particles, which are universal for each generation and allow $\BZ$ fields to
distinguish flavor generations. At the $\Lambda_{\UP}$ scale, $\BZ$ operators
and charges are matched onto unparticle operators and charges, respectively. In
this scenario, we find that tree flavor changing neutral currents (FCNCs) can
be induced by the rediagonalizations of the SM fermions. As an illustration, we
employ the Fritzsch ansatz to the SM fermion mass matrices and we find that the
FCNC effects could be simplified to be associated with the mass ratios denoted
by $\sqrt{m_{i}m_{j}/m^2_{3}}$, where $m_3$ is the mass of the heaviest
particle in each type of fermion generations and $i, j$ are the flavor indices.
In addition, we show that there is no new CP violating phase beside the unique
one in the CKM matrix. We use $\bar B_{q}\to \ell^{+} \ell^{-}$ as examples to
display the new FCNC effects. In particular, we demonstrate that the direct CP
asymmetries in the decays can be $O(10%)$ due to the peculiar CP conserving
phase in the unparticle propagator.
