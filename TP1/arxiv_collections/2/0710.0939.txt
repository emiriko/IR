We study the sandpile model in infinite volume on $\mathbb{Z}^d$. In
particular, we are interested in the question whether or not initial
configurations, chosen according to a stationary measure $\mu$, are
$\mu$-almost surely stabilizable. We prove that stabilizability does not depend
on the particular procedure of stabilization we adopt. In $d=1$ and $\mu$ a
product measure with density $\rho=1$ (the known critical value for
stabilizability in $d=1$) with a positive density of empty sites, we prove that
$\mu$ is not stabilizable. Furthermore, we study, for values of $\rho$ such
that $\mu$ is stabilizable, percolation of toppled sites. We find that for
$\rho>0$ small enough, there is a subcritical regime where the distribution of
a cluster of toppled sites has an exponential tail, as is the case in the
subcritical regime for ordinary percolation.
