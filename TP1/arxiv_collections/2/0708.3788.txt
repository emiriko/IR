Conformal Weyl and Cotton tensors are dimensionally reduced by a Kaluza-Klein
procedure. Explicit formulas are given for reducing from four and three
dimensions to three and two dimensions, respectively. When the higher
dimensional conformal tensor vanishes because the space is conformallly flat,
the lower-dimensional Kaluza-Klein functions satisfy equations that coincide
with the Einstein-Weyl equations in three dimensions and kink equations in two
dimensions.
