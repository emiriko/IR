We show that there exists an entire function f without zeros for which the
associated Newton function N(z)=z-f(z)/f'(z) is a transcendental meromorphic
functions without Baker domains. We also show that there exists an entire
function f with exactly one zero for which the complement of the immediate
attracting basin has at least two components and contains no invariant Baker
domains of N. The second result answers a question of J. Rueckert and D.
Schleicher while the first one gives a partial answer to a question of X. Buff.
