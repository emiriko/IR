We examine the dynamics of bipartite entanglement between a two-level atom
and the electromagnetic field. We treat the Jaynes-Cummings model with a single
field mode and examine in detail the exact time evolution of entanglement,
including cases where the atomic state is initially mixed and the atomic
transition is detuned from resonance. We then explore the effects of other
nearby modes by calculating the exact time evolution of entanglement in more
complex systems with two, three, and five field modes. For these cases we can
obtain exact solutions which include the strong coupling regimes. Finally, we
consider the entanglement of a two-level atom with the infinite collection of
modes present in the intracavity field of a Fabre-Perot cavity. In contrast to
the usual treatment of atom-field interactions with a continuum of modes using
the Born-Markov approximation, our treatment in all cases describes the full
non-Markovian dynamics of the atomic subsystem. Only when an analytic
expression for the infinite mode case is desired do we need to make a weak
coupling assumption which at long times approximates Markovian dynamics.
