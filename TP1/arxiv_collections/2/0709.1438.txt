Entropic uncertainty relations place nontrivial lower bounds to the sum of
Shannon information entropies for noncommuting observables. Here we obtain a
novel lower bound on the entropy sum for general pairs of observables in
finite-dimensional Hilbert space, which improves on the best bound known to
date [Maassen and Uffink, Phys. Rev. Lett. 60, 1103 (1988)] for a wide class of
observables. This result follows from another formulation of the uncertainty
principle, the Landau-Pollak inequality, whose relationship to the
Maassen-Uffink entropic uncertainty relation is discussed.
