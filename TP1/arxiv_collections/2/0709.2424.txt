We investigate the dependence of the intensity of radiation due to
high-harmonic generation (HHG) as a function of the wavelength of the
fundamental driver field. Superimposed on a smooth power-law dependence
observed previously we find surprisingly strong and rapid fluctuations on a
fine wavelength scale. We identify the origin of these fluctuations in terms of
quantum path interferences with up to five returning orbits significantly
contributing.
