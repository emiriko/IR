A number of algorithms for computing the simulation preorder are available.
Let Sigma denote the state space, -> the transition relation and Psim the
partition of Sigma induced by simulation equivalence. The algorithms by
Henzinger, Henzinger, Kopke and by Bloom and Paige run in O(|Sigma||->|)-time
and, as far as time-complexity is concerned, they are the best available
algorithms. However, these algorithms have the drawback of a space complexity
that is more than quadratic in the size of the state space. The algorithm by
Gentilini, Piazza, Policriti--subsequently corrected by van Glabbeek and
Ploeger--appears to provide the best compromise between time and space
complexity. Gentilini et al.'s algorithm runs in O(|Psim|^2|->|)-time while the
space complexity is in O(|Psim|^2 + |Sigma|log|Psim|). We present here a new
efficient simulation algorithm that is obtained as a modification of Henzinger
et al.'s algorithm and whose correctness is based on some techniques used in
applications of abstract interpretation to model checking. Our algorithm runs
in O(|Psim||->|)-time and O(|Psim||Sigma|log|Sigma|)-space. Thus, this
algorithm improves the best known time bound while retaining an acceptable
space complexity that is in general less than quadratic in the size of the
state space. An experimental evaluation showed good comparative results with
respect to Henzinger, Henzinger and Kopke's algorithm.
