We present an explicit convergent iterative solution for the lowest energy
state of the Schroedinger equation with a generalized double well potential
$V=\frac{g^2}{2}(x^2-1)^2(x^2+a)$. The condition for the convergence of the
iteration procedure and the dependence of the shape of the groundstate wave
function on the parameter $a$ are discussed.
