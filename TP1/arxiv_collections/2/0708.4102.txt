The spin-1/2 Ising model on the bow-tie lattice is exactly solved by
establishing a precise mapping relationship with its corresponding free-fermion
eight-vertex model. Ground-state and finite-temperature phase diagrams are
obtained for the anisotropic bow-tie lattice with three different exchange
interactions along three different spatial directions.
