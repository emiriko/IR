We present a simple mechanism by which supersymmetry can be dynamically
broken in intersecting brane models, naturally generating an exponentially
small scale. Rather than utilize either non-Abelian gauge dynamics or
D-instantons, our mechanism uses worldsheet instantons to generate the small
scale in a hidden sector.
