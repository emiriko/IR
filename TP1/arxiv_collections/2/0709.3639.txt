The large number of spectral variables in most data sets encountered in
spectral chemometrics often renders the prediction of a dependent variable
uneasy. The number of variables hopefully can be reduced, by using either
projection techniques or selection methods; the latter allow for the
interpretation of the selected variables. Since the optimal approach of testing
all possible subsets of variables with the prediction model is intractable, an
incremental selection approach using a nonparametric statistics is a good
option, as it avoids the computationally intensive use of the model itself. It
has two drawbacks however: the number of groups of variables to test is still
huge, and colinearities can make the results unstable. To overcome these
limitations, this paper presents a method to select groups of spectral
variables. It consists in a forward-backward procedure applied to the
coefficients of a B-Spline representation of the spectra. The criterion used in
the forward-backward procedure is the mutual information, allowing to find
nonlinear dependencies between variables, on the contrary of the generally used
correlation. The spline representation is used to get interpretability of the
results, as groups of consecutive spectral variables will be selected. The
experiments conducted on NIR spectra from fescue grass and diesel fuels show
that the method provides clearly identified groups of selected variables,
making interpretation easy, while keeping a low computational load. The
prediction performances obtained using the selected coefficients are higher
than those obtained by the same method applied directly to the original
variables and similar to those obtained using traditional models, although
using significantly less spectral variables.
