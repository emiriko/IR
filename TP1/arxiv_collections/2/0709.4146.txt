We address the issue whether the data on optical conductivity and Raman
scattering in electron-doped cuprates below $T_c$ support the idea that the
$d-$wave gap in these materials is non-monotonic along the Fermi surface. We
calculate the conductivity and Raman intensity for elastic scattering, and find
that a non-monotonic gap gives rise to several specific features in optical and
Raman response functions. We argue that all these features are present in the
experimental data on Nd$_{2-x}$Ce$_{x}$CuO$_4$ and Pr$_{2-x}$Ce$_{x}$CuO$_4$
compounds.
