Using 281 /pb of e^+ e^- collisions recorded at the psi(3770) resonance with
the CLEO-c detector at CESR, we determine absolute hadronic branching fractions
of charged and neutral D mesons using a double tag technique. Among
measurements for three D^0 and six D^+ modes, we obtain reference branching
fractions B(D^0 --> K^-pi^+) = (3.891 +- 0.035 +- 0.059 +- 0.035)% and B(D^+
--> K^-pi^+pi^+) = (9.14 +- 0.10 +- 0.16 +- 0.07)%, where the first uncertainty
is statistical, the second is all systematic errors other than final state
radiation (FSR), and the third is the systematic uncertainty due to FSR. We
include FSR in these branching fractions by allowing for additional unobserved
photons in the final state. Using an independent determination of the
integrated luminosity, we also extract the cross sections sigma(e+e- --> D^0
D^0-bar) = (3.66+- 0.03 +- 0.06) nb and sigma(e+e- --> D^+ D^-) = (2.91+- 0.03
+- 0.05) nb at a center of mass energy, E_cm = 3774 +- 1 MeV.
