Masses of the lowest multiplets of c,b-mesons in S- and P-wave states with
quantum numbers JPC: 0-+, 1--, 0++, 1+-, 1++, 2++ are obtained with the help of
dispersion N/D method of heavy quark effective theory. The results are in a
good agreement with experimental data. Radiative decay widths for some states
mentioned above were calculated.
