The conventional probabilistic point of view implies that if a particle has a
probability $p$ to make a transition from one site to another site, then the
average transport should be $<Q>=p}$ with a variance $Var(Q)=(1-p)p$. In the
quantum mechanical context this observation becomes a non-trivial manifestation
of restricted quantum-classical correspondence. We demonstrate this observation
by considering the full counting statistics which is associated with a two
level coherent transition in the context of a continuous quantum measurement
process. In particular we test the possibility of getting a valid result for
$Var(Q)$ within the framework of the adiabatic picture, analyzing the simplest
non-trivial example of a Landau-Zener crossing.
