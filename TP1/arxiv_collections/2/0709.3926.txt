New type of radiation in crystals is predicted and investigated in computer
simulation. It is shown that process of volume reflection of electrons and
positrons in bent crystals is accomplished with high-power radiation of
photons. Volume reflection radiation has intensity comparable with known
channeling radiation, but it is less sensitive to entrance angle and sign of
charge of a particle. Simulated spectra of radiation power are presented for 10
GeV and 200GeV particles.
