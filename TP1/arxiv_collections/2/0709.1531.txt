The Fat Link Irrelevant Clover (FLIC) fermion action is a variant of the
$O(a)$-improved Wilson action where the irrelevant operators are constructed
using smeared links. While the use of such smearing allows for the use of
highly improved definitions of the field strength tensor $F_{\mu\nu},$ we show
that the standard 1-loop clover term with a mean field improved coefficient
$c_{\rm sw}$ is sufficient to remove the $O(a)$ errors, avoiding the need for
non-perturbative tuning. This result enables efficient dynamical simulations in
QCD with the FLIC fermion action.
