We derive relations between spin-dependent nuclear and nucleon g_1 and g_2
structure functions within the nuclear impulse approximation, which are valid
at all Q^2, and in both the resonance and deep inelastic regions. We apply the
formalism to the specific case of the deuteron, which is often used as a source
of neutron structure information, and compare the size of the nuclear
corrections calculated using exact kinematics and using approximations
applicable at large Q^2.
