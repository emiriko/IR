We consider complete spacelike hypersurfaces with constant mean curvature in
the open region of de Sitter space known as the steady state space. We prove
that if the hypersurface is bounded away from the infinity of the ambient
space, then the mean curvature must be H=1. Moreover, in the 2-dimensional case
we obtain that the only complete spacelike surfaces with constant mean
curvature which are bounded away from the infinity are the totally umbilical
flat surfaces. We also derive some other consequences for hypersurfaces which
are bounded away from the future infinity. Finally, using an isometrically
equivalent model for the steady state space, we extend our results to a wider
family of spacetimes.
