The hadron spectrum of SU(2) lattice gauge theory with two flavours of Wilson
quark is studied on an 8^3x16 lattice using all-to-all propagators, with
particular emphasis on the dependence on quark chemical potential mu. As mu is
increased from zero the diquark states with non-zero baryon number B respond as
expected, while states with B=0 remain unaffected until the onset of non-zero
baryon density at mu=m_pi/2. Post onset the pi-meson mass increases in
accordance with chiral perturbation theory while the rho becomes lighter. In
the diquark sector a Goldstone state associated with a superfluid ground state
can be identified. A further consequence of superfluidity is an approximate
degeneracy between mesons and baryons with the same spacetime and isospin
quantum numbers. Finally we find tentative evidence for the binding of states
with kaon quantum numbers within the baryonic medium.
