A theory is presented which quantitatively accounts for the cooperative
adsorption of cationic surfactants to anionic polyelectrolytes. For high salt
concentration we find that the critical adsorption concentration (CAC) is a
bilinear function of the polyion monomer and salt concentrations, with the
coefficients dependent only on the type of surfactant used. The results
presented in the paper might be useful for designing more efficient gene
delivery systems.
