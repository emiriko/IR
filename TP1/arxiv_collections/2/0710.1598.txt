We review the theory of alignment in Lorentzian geometry and apply it to the
algebraic classification of the Weyl tensor in higher dimensions. This
classification reduces to the the well-known Petrov classification of the Weyl
tensor in four dimensions. We discuss the algebraic classification of a number
of known higher dimensional spacetimes. There are many applications of the Weyl
classification scheme, especially in conjunction with the higher dimensional
frame formalism that has been developed in order to generalize the four
dimensional Newman--Penrose formalism. For example, we discuss higher
dimensional generalizations of the Goldberg-Sachs theorem and the Peeling
theorem. We also discuss the higher dimensional Lorentzian spacetimes with
vanishing scalar curvature invariants and constant scalar curvature invariants,
which are of interest since they are solutions of supergravity theory.
