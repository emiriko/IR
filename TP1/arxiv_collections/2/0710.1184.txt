We study entanglement witnesses that can be constructed with regard to the
geometrical structure of the Hilbert-Schmidt space, i.e. we present how to use
these witnesses in the context of quantifying entanglement and the detection of
bound entangled states. We give examples for a particular three-parameter
family of states that are part of the \emph{magic simplex} of two-qutrit
states.
