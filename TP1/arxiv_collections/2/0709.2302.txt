In the present work, ternary Special Quasirandom Structures (SQSs) for a fcc
solid solution phase are generated at different compositions,
$x_A=x_B=x_C=\tfrac{1}{3}$ and $x_A=\tfrac{1}{2}$, $x_B=x_C=\tfrac{1}{4}$,
whose correlation functions are satisfactorily close to those of a random fcc
solution. The generated SQSs are used to calculate the mixing enthalpy of the
fcc phase in the Ca-Sr-Yb system. It is observed that first-principles
calculations of all the binary and ternary SQSs in the Ca-Sr-Yb system exhibit
very small local relaxation. It is concluded that the fcc ternary SQSs can
provide valuable information about the mixing behavior of the fcc ternary solid
solution phase. The SQSs presented in this work can be widely used to study the
behavior of ternary fcc solid solutions.
