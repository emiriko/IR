The phi4 scalar field theory in three dimensions, prototype for the study of
phase transitions, is investigated by means of the hierarchical reference
theory (HRT) in its smooth cutoff formulation. The critical behavior is
described by scaling laws and critical exponents which compare favorably with
the known values of the Ising universality class. The inverse susceptibility
vanishes identically inside the coexistence curve, providing a first principle
implementation of the Maxwell construction, and shows the expected
discontinuity across the phase boundary, at variance with the usual sharp
cutoff implementation of HRT. The correct description of first and second order
phase transitions within a microscopic, nonperturbative approach is thus
achieved in the smooth cutoff HRT.
