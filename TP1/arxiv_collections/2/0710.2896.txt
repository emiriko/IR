The comparison of numerical data with published plots is a frequently
occurring task. In this article I present a short computer program written in
Java(TM) helping in those cases where someone wants to get the numbers out of a
plot but is not able to read the plot with a decent accuracy and cannot contact
the author of the plot directly for whatever reason. The accuracy reached by
this method depends on many factors. For the examples illustrated in this paper
a precision at the level of a few per mille could be reached. The tool might
help in improving the quality of future publications.
