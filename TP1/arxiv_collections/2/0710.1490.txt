We propose a quantum transport experiment to prepare and measure
charge-entanglement between two electrostatically defined quantum dots.
Coherent population trapping, as realized in cavity quantum electrodynamics,
can be carried out by using a third quantum dot to play the role of the optical
cavity. In our proposal, a pumping which is quantum mechanically
indistinguishable for the quantum dots drives the system into a state with a
high degree of entanglement. The whole effect can be switched on and off by
means of a gate potential allowing both state preparation and entanglement
detection by simply measuring the total current.
