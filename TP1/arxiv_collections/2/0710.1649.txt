Using noise methods on a quenched $20^3 \times 32$ lattice at $\beta=6.0$, we
have investigated vacuum expectation values and relative linear correlations
among the various Wilson and twisted mass scalar and pseudoscalar disconnected
loop operators. We show results near the maximal twist lines in $\kappa$, $\mu$
parameter space, either defined as the absence of parity mixing or the
vanishing of the PCAC quark mass.
