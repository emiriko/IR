A new improved transfer matrix method (TMM) is presented. It is shown that
the method not only overcomes the numerical instability found in the original
TMM, but also greatly improves the scalability of computation. The new improved
TMM has no extra cost of computing time as the length of homogeneous scattering
region becomes large. The comparison between the scattering matrix method(SMM)
and our new TMM is given. It clearly shows that our new method is much faster
than SMM.
