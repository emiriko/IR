The backreaction of D-branes on closed string moduli is studied in perturbed
conformal field theory. To this end we analyse the divergences in the modular
integral of the annulus diagram. By the Fischler-Susskind mechanism, these
divergences lead to additional terms in the bulk renormalisation group
equations. We derive explicit expressions for these backreaction terms, and
follow the resulting renormalisation group flow in several examples, finding
agreement with geometric expectations.
