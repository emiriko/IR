We present results of lattice computations using overlap fermions on a
twisted mass background. $N_f=2$ full QCD gauge configurations have been
produced by the ETM Collaboration with very light pions (down to less than 300
MeV), with small lattice spacing ($a \approx 0.09$ fm) and large volumes
($V/a^4=24^3\times 48$). By profiting of the good chiral properties of the
overlap operator for the valence quarks, it is also possible to have a precise
(and unquenched) determination of those physical quantities where the chiral
properties are crucial. In order to have unquenched results, we match the
valence quark mass with the sea quark mass. We also perform computations with
different quark masses in order to simulate (partially quenched) Strange and
Charm quarks. A typical application is the computation of $B_K$, for which we
present first results.
