We consider T--shaped, two--dimensional quantum waveguides containing
attractive or repulsive impurities with a smooth, realistic shape, and study
how the resonance behavior of the total conductance depends upon the strength
of the defect potential and the geometry of the device. The resonance
parameters are determined locating the relevant S-matrix poles in the Riemann
energy surface. The total scattering operator is obtained from the S-matrices
of the various constituent segments of the device through the *-product
composition rule. This allows for a numerically stable evaluation of the
scattering matrix and of the resonance parameters.
