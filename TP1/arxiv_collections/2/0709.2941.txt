Let $p$ be a real number greater than one and let $G$ be a finitely
generated, infinite group. In this paper we introduce the $p$-harmonic boundary
of $G$. We then characterize the vanishing of the first reduced
$\ell^p$-cohomology of $G$ in terms of the cardinality of this boundary. Some
properties of $p$-harmonic boundaries that are preserved under rough isometries
are also given. We also study the relationship between translation invariant
linear functionals on a certain difference space of functions on $G$, the
$p$-harmonic boundary of $G$ and the first reduced $\ell^p$-cohomology of $G$.
