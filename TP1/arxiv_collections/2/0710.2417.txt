We describe an extension of the nonlinear integral equation (NLIE) tehnique
to N=1 superminimal models perturbed by $\Phi_{13}$. Along the way, we also
complete our previous studies of the finite volume spectrum of the N=1
supersymmetric sine-Gordon model by considering the attractive regime and more
specifically, breather states.
