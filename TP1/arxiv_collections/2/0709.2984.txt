We have performed Fourier transform microwave spectroscopy of benzonitrile,
without and with applied electric fields. From the field-free
hyperfine-resolved microwave transitions we simultaneously derive accurate
values for the rotational constants, centrifugal distortion constants, and
nitrogen nuclear quadrupole coupling constants of benzonitrile. By measuring
the Stark shift of selected hyperfine transitions the electric dipole moment of
benzonitrile is determined to $\mu=\mu_a=4.5152 (68)$ D.
