We report on the microwave properties of a resonant cylindrical cavity made
of bulk MgB2 superconductor, produced by the reactive liquid Mg infiltration
process. The frequency response of the cavity has been measured in the range
5-13GHz. Among the various modes, the TE011, resonating at 9.79GHz, exhibits
the highest quality factor. For this mode, we have determined the temperature
dependence of the quality factor, obtaining values of the order of 10^5 in the
temperature range 4.2-30K. The values of the surface resistance deduced from
the measurements of the quality factor agree quite well with those
independently measured in a small sample of MgB2 extracted from the same
specimen from which the cavity has been obtained.
