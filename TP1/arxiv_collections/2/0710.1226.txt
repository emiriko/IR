We use shaped near-infrared (NIR) pulses to control the generation of
coherent broadband ultraviolet (UV) radiation in an atomic resonance-mediated
(2+1) three-photon excitation. Experimental and theoretical results are
presented for phase controlling the total emitted UV yield in atomic sodium
(Na). Based on our confirmed understanding, we present a new simple scheme for
producing shaped femtosecond pulses in the UV/VUV spectral range using the
control over atomic resonance-mediated generation of third (or higher order)
harmonic.
