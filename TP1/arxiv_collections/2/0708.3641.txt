New results about Poisson-Dirichlet point processes and Derrida-Ruelle
cascades allow us to express Guerra's interpolation entirely in the language of
Derrida-Ruelle cascades and to streamline Guerra's computations. Moreover, our
approach clarifies the nature of the error terms along the interpolation.
