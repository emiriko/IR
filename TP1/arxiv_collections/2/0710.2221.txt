A large BaF2 detector array along with its dedicated CAMAC electronics and
VME based data acquisition system has been designed, constructed and installed
successfully at VECC, Kolkata for studying high energy gamma rays (E>8 MeV).
The array consists of 162 detector elements. The detectors were fabricated from
bare barium fluoride crystals (each measuring 35 cm in length and having
cross-sectional area of 3.5 cm X 3.5 cm X 35.0 cm). The basic properties of the
detectors (energy resolution, time resolution, efficiency, uniformity, fast to
slow ratio etc.) were studied exhaustively. Complete GEANT3 monte carlo
simulations were performed to optimize the detector design and also to generate
the response function. The detector system has been used successfully to
measure high energy photons from 113Sb, formed by bombarding 145 and 160 MeV
20Ne beams on a 93Nb target. The measured experimental spectra are in good
agreement with those from a modified version of the statistical model code
CASCADE. In this paper, we present the complete description of this detector
array along with its in-beam performance.
