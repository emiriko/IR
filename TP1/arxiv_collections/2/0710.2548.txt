Inclusive semileptonic B_s^0 -> X^+ l^- \nu decays are studied for the first
time using a 23.6 fb^{-1} data sample collected on the Y(5S) resonance with the
Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric energy e^+ e^- collider. These decays are
identified by the means of a lepton accompanied by a same-sign D_s^+ meson
originating from the other B_s^0 in the event. The semileptonic branching
fractions are measured in the electron and muon channels to be Bf(B_s^0 -> X^+
e^- \nu) = (10.9 \pm 1.0 \pm 0.9)% and Bf(B_s^0 -> X^+ \mu^- \nu) = (9.2 \pm
1.0 \pm 0.8)%, respectively. Assuming an equal electron and muon production
rate in B_s^0 decays, a combined fit yields an average leptonic branching
fraction Bf(B_s^0 -> X^+ l^- \nu) = (10.2 \pm 0.8 \pm 0.9)%.
