We study the resonance fluorescence from a coherently driven four-level atom
in the Y-type configuration. The effects of quantum interference induced by
spontaneous emission on the fluorescence properties of the atom are
investigated. It is found that the quantum interference resulting from cascade
emission decays of the atom leads to a splitting of resonances in the excited
level populations calculated as a function of light detuning. For some
parameters, interference assisted enhancement of inner sidebands and narrowing
of central peaks may also occur in the fluorescence spectrum. We present a
physical understandingof our numerical results using the dressed state
description of the atom-light interaction.
