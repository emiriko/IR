Since the famous 1926 paper by Richardson, the relative diffusion of two
particles in a turbulent liquid has attracted a lot of interest. The motion of
a single particle on the other hand is usually considered not to be especially
interesting. The widely accepted picture is that the velocity of the particle
has short-range correlations in time, resulting in motion that is diffusive on
time scales large compared to the correlation time. We find, however, that the
correlation time is infinite and that the square displacement, F, is not linear
in the traversed time, T, which would correspond to diffusion, but rather F is
proportional to T^6/5. Namely, the motion is slightly super diffusive.
