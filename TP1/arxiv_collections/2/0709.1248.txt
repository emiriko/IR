Wherever old Universities exist [in Europe, for example: Italy being not the
last one], there can be found Scientific Instruments of Historical Interest,
e.g., for Physics -which is the case we are concerned with here;- even if
proper attention has been paid to such an exceptional heritage only during the
last half a century. [We studied ourselves the material existing at the
University of Catania, Catania, Italy, almost 600 years old]. However, even
where ancient universities do not exist, a lot of Historical Scientific
Instruments are often owned by the local Senior High Schools. By the present
"small book" we want to make known the antique physics instruments that are in
possession of three Senior High Schools of Bergamo, Italy: the "Istituto
Tecnico Vittorio Emanuele", the "Liceo Scientifico Lussana", and the "Istituto
per Geometri Quarenghi". Namely, we catalogue and describe: 61 instruments of
the "Vittorio Emanuele" (52 of the second half of the XIX century, and 9 of the
first half of the XX century); 100 instruments of the "Lussana" (belonging
essentially to the first half of the XX century); and 26 instruments, mainly
topographical in this case, of the "Quarenghi" (8 of the second half of the XIX
century, and 16 of the first half of the XX century); without forgetting to add
suitable explanations about their functioning. Our aim will be reached if we
happen to stimulate other colleagues to perform similar work in their towns.
The present small book is in Italian, but it contains fifty-one (51)
self-explanatory photographs in color, and nineteen (19) black-and-white
sketches. Actually, we can put in the Archives this small book, instead of
others, also because -with the help of the typesetter- we eventually suceeded
in reducing its whole size to less than 1 M-b.
