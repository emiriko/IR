Non-local electrodynamic models are developed for describing metallic
surfaces for a diffusive metal. The electric field noise at a distance z_0 from
the surface is evaluated and compared with data from ion chips that show
anomalous heating with a noise power decaying as z_0^{-4}. We find that high
surface diffusion can account for the latter result.
