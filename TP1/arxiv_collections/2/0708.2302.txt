We present a probabilistic (ideally 50%) nondestructive interaction-free
atom-photon controlled-NOT gate, where nondestructive means that all four
outgoing target photon modes of the gate are available and feed-forwardable.
Individual atoms are controlled by a stimulated Raman adiabatic passage
transition and photons by a ring resonator with two outgoing ports. Realistic
estimates we obtain for ions confined in a Paul trap around which the resonator
is mounted show that a strong atom-photon coupling can be achieved. It is also
shown how the resonator can be used for controlling superposition of atom
states.
