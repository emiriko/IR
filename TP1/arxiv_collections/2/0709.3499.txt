We investigate the incorporation of space noncommutativity into field theory
by extending to the spectral continuum the minisuperspace action of the quantum
mechanical harmonic oscillator propagator with an enlarged Heisenberg algebra.
In addition to the usual $\star$-product deformation of the algebra of field
functions, we show that the parameter of noncommutativity can occur in
noncommutative field theory even in the case of free fields without
self-interacting potentials.
