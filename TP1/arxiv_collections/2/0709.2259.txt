We consider charmonium polarization at high-energy hadron collider Tevatron
in the framework of the nonrelativistic QCD (NRQCD) and the k_T-factorization
approach. The polarization effects are studied for the direct and the prompt
production channels. The obtained predictions can be used to test the Regge
limit of QCD and the NRQCD formalism.
