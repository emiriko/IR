We prove that for any of a wide class of elliptic surfaces $X$ defined over a
number field $k$, if there is an algebraic point on $X$ that lies on only
finitely many rational curves, then there is an algebraic point on $X$ that
lies on no rational curves. In particular, our theorem applies to a large class
of elliptic $K3$ surfaces, which relates to a question posed by Bogomolov in
1981. We apply our results to construct an explicit algebraic point on a $K3$
surface that does not lie on any smooth rational curves.
