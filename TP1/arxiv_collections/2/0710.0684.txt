Numerous lines of experimental, numerical and analytical evidence indicate
that it is surprisingly easy to locate optimal controls steering quantum
dynamical systems to desired objectives. This has enabled the control of
complex quantum systems despite the expense of solving the Schrodinger equation
in simulations and the complicating effects of environmental decoherence in the
laboratory. Recent work indicates that this simplicity originates in universal
properties of the solution sets to quantum control problems that are
fundamentally different from their classical counterparts. Here, we review
studies that aim to systematically characterize these properties, enabling the
classification of quantum control mechanisms and the design of globally
efficient quantum control algorithms.
