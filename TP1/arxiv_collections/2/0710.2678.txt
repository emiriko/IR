In this paper, we propose a solution for a fundamental problem in
computational harmonic analysis, namely, the construction of a multiresolution
analysis with directional components. We will do so by constructing subdivision
schemes which provide a means to incorporate directionality into the data and
thus the limit function. We develop a new type of non-stationary bivariate
subdivision schemes, which allow to adapt the subdivision process depending on
directionality constraints during its performance, and we derive a complete
characterization of those masks for which these adaptive directional
subdivision schemes converge. In addition, we present several numerical
examples to illustrate how this scheme works. Secondly, we describe a fast
decomposition associated with a sparse directional representation system for
two dimensional data, where we focus on the recently introduced sparse
directional representation system of shearlets. In fact, we show that the
introduced adaptive directional subdivision schemes can be used as a framework
for deriving a shearlet multiresolution analysis with finitely supported
filters, thereby leading to a fast shearlet decomposition.
