We analyze large sets of energy-release data created by stress-induced
brittle fracture in a pure sapphire crystal at close to zero temperature where
stochastic fluctuations are minimal. The waiting-time distribution follows that
observed for fracture in rock and for earthquakes. Despite strong time
correlations of the events and the presence of large-event precursors, simple
prediction algorithms only succeed in a very weak probabilistic sense. We also
discuss prospects for further cryogenic experiments reaching close to
single-bond sensitivity and able to investigate the existence of a
transition-stress regime.
