We summarize results on finite-volume effects in the propagators of Landau
gauge Yang-Mills theory using Dyson-Schwinger equations on a 4-dimensional
torus. We demonstrate explicitly how the solutions for the gluon and the ghost
propagator tend towards their respective infinite volume forms in the
corresponding limit. We discuss the relation of our solutions with results from
lattice Monte-Carlo simulations.
