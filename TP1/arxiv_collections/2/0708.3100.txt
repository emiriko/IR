We investigate models in minimal supergravity parameter space which contain
metastable sleptons. We find the luminosity required to determine the slepton
spin in these scenarios, and apply our analysis to two benchmark models. We
show that the spin of the slepton in one of the benchmark models can be
determined with less than 30 fb$^{-1}$ of data, while the slepton spin in the
other model can be determined with roughly 40 fb$^{-1}$ of data. We show how
our analysis can be applied to other models, and give an estimate of the
luminosity needed for a spin determination as a function of slepton mass. This
analysis can be used to distinguish supersymmetry and extra dimensions.
