We present a quantitative analysis of Yang-Mills thermodynamics in 4D flat
spacetime. The focus is on the gauge group SU(2). Results for SU(3) are
mentioned in passing. Although all essential arguments and results were
reported elsewhere we summarize them here in a concise way and offer a number
of refinements and some additions.
