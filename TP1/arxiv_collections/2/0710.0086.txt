We present a new evaluation of an 87Sr optical lattice clock using spin
polarized atoms. The frequency of the 1S0-3P0 clock transition is found to be
429 228 004 229 873.6 Hz with a fractional accuracy of 2.6 10^{-15}, a value
that is comparable to the frequency difference between the various primary
standards throughout the world. This measurement is in excellent agreement with
a previous one of similar accuracy.
