We focus on a powerful aspect of chiral perturbation theory (chi PT) which
provides us with a ``bridge'' over different reactions. For this purpose, we
study a contact operator which contributes p-wave pi-production and several
weak processes. We fix the unknown coupling of the contact operator using a
matrix element of a low-energy weak process (pp\to de^+\nu_e), and then
calculate the partial wave amplitude (a_0) for the p-wave pi-production (pp\to
pn\pi^+). We find that the chiral operator including the contact term does not
reproduce a_0 extracted from data, showing that the bridging over reactions
with significantly different kinematics is not necessarily successful. We argue
the importance of a specific higher order calculation. In order to gain an
insight into a higher order calculation, we consider a higher order counter
term, and find that the energy dependence of a_0 is then consistent with the
data.
