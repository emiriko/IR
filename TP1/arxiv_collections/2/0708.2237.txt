The particle-hole version of the density-matrix renormalization-group method
(PH-DMRG) is utilized to calculate the ground-state energy of an interacting
two-dimensional quantum dot. We show that a modification of the method, termed
generation-based PH-DMRG, leads to significant improvement of the results, and
discuss its feasibility for the treatment of large systems. As another
application we calculate the addition spectrum.
