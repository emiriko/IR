Electronic properties of transition metal oxides at interfaces are influenced
by strain, electric polarization and oxygen diffusion. Linear dichroism (LD)
x-ray absorption, diffraction, transport and magnetization on thin
La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 films, allow identification of a peculiar universal interface
effect. We report the LD signature of preferential 3d-eg(3z2-r2) occupation at
the interface, suppressing the double exchange mechanism. This surface orbital
reconstruction is opposite of that favored by residual strain and independent
of dipolar fields, chemical nature of the substrate and capping.
