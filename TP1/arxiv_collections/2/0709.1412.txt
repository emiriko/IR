We discuss the problem of heat conduction in quantum spin chain models. To
investigate this problem it is necessary to consider the finite open system
connected to heat baths. We describe two different procedures to couple the
system with the reservoirs: a model of stochastic heat baths and the quantum
trajectories solution of the quantum master equation. The stochastic heat bath
procedure operates on the pure wave function of the isolated system, so that it
is locally and periodically collapsed to a quantum state consistent with a
boundary nonequilibrium state. In contrast, the quantum trajectories procedure
evaluates ensemble averages in terms of the reduced density matrix operator of
the system. We apply these procedures to different models of quantum spin
chains and numerically show their applicability to study the heat flow.
