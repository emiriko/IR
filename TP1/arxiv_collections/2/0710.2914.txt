We propose a setup in which Andreev-like reflections predicted for 1D
transport systems could be observed time-dependently using cold atoms in a 1D
optical lattice. Using time-dependent Density Matrix Renormalisation Group
methods we analyse the wavepacket dynamics as a density excitation propagates
across a boundary in the interaction strength. These phenomena exhibit good
correspondence with predictions from Luttinger liquid models and could be
observed in current experiments in the context of the Bose-Hubbard model.
