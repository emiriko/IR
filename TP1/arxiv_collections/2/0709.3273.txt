Quantum phase transitions occur when the ground state of a quantum system
undergoes a qualitative change when an external control parameter reaches a
critical value. Here, we demonstrate a technique for studying quantum systems
undergoing a phase transition by coupling the system to a probe qubit. It uses
directly the increased sensibility of the quantum system to perturbations when
it is close to a critical point. Using an NMR quantum simulator, we demonstrate
this measurement technique for two different types of quantum phase transitions
in an Ising spin chain.
