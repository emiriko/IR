The longitudinal momentum distribution (P_{//}) of fragments after one-proton
removal from ^{23} Al and reaction cross sections (\sigma_R) for
  ^{23,24} Al on carbon target at 74A MeV have been measured. The ^{23,24} Al
ions were produced through projectile fragmentation of 135 A MeV ^{28} Si
primary beam using RIPS fragment separator at RIKEN. P_{//} is measured by a
direct time-of-flight (TOF) technique, while \sigma_R is determined using a
transmission method. An enhancement in \sigma_R is observed for ^{23} Al
compared with ^{24} Al. The P_{//} for ^{22} Mg fragments from ^{23} Al breakup
has been obtained for the first time. FWHM of the distributions has been
determined to be 232 \pm 28 MeV/c. The experimental data are discussed by using
Few-Body Glauber model. Analysis of P_{//} demonstrates a dominant d-wave
configuration for the valence proton in ground state of ^{23} Al, indicating
that ^{23} Al is not a proton halo nucleus.
