We present a study of the X(3940) state in the process e+e- -> J/psi D* Dbar.
The X(3940) mass and width are measured to be (3942 +7 -6 +- 6)MeV/c^2 and
Gamma=(37 + 26 - 15 +- 8 MeV. In the process e+e- -> J/psi D* D*bar we have
observed another charmonium-like state, which we denote as X(4160), in the
spectrum of invariant masses of D*+ D*- combinations. The X(4160) parameters
are M= 4156 + 25 - 20 +- 15 MeV/c^2 and Gamma = 139 + 111 -61 +- 21 MeV. The
analysis is based on a data sample with an integrated luminosity of 693 /fb
recorded near the Upsilon(4S) resonance with the Belle detector at the KEKB e+
e- asymmetric-energy collider.
