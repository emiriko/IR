Classical MD data on the charge-charge dynamic structure factor of
two-component plasmas (TCP) modeled in Phys. Rev. A 23, 2041 (1981) are
analyzed using the sum rules and other exact relations. The convergent power
moments of the imaginary part of the model system dielectric function are
expressed in terms of its partial static structure factors, which are computed
by the method of hypernetted chains using the Deutsch effective potential.
High-frequency asymptotic behavior of the dielectric function is specified to
include the effects of inverse bremsstrahlung. The agreement with the MD data
is improved, and important statistical characteristics of the model TCP, such
as the probability to find both electron and ion at one point, are determined.
