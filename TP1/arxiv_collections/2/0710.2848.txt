Regularization by the sum of singular values, also referred to as the trace
norm, is a popular technique for estimating low rank rectangular matrices. In
this paper, we extend some of the consistency results of the Lasso to provide
necessary and sufficient conditions for rank consistency of trace norm
minimization with the square loss. We also provide an adaptive version that is
rank consistent even when the necessary condition for the non adaptive version
is not fulfilled.
