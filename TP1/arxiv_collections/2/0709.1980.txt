We discuss the sensitivity reach of a neutrino factory measurement to
non-standard neutrino interactions (NSI), which may exist as a low-energy
manifestation of physics beyond the Standard Model. We use the muon appearance
mode \nu_e --> \nu_\mu and consider two detectors, one at 3000 km and the other
at 7000 km.
  Assuming the effects of NSI at the production and the detection are
negligible, we discuss the sensitivities to NSI and the simultaneous
determination of \theta_{13} and \delta by examining the effects in the
neutrino propagation of various systems in which two NSI parameters
\epsilon_{\alpha \beta} are switched on. The sensitivities to off-diagonal
\epsilon's are found to be excellent up to small values of \theta_{13}.
  We demonstrate that the two-detector setting is powerful enough to resolve
the \theta_{13}-NSI confusion problem. We believe that the results obtained in
this paper open the door to the possibility of using neutrino factory as a
discovery machine for NSI while keeping its primary function of performing
precision measurements of the lepton mixing parameters.
