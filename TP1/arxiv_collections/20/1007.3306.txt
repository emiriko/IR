We use the S\'aez-Ballester theory on anisotropic Bianchi I cosmological
model, with barotropic fluid and cosmological constant. We obtain the classical
solution by using the Hamilton-Jacobi approach. Also the quantum regime is
constructed and exact solutions to the Wheeler-DeWitt equation are found.
