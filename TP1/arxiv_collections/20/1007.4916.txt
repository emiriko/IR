We provide a new derivation of the conditions of dynamical and
thermodynamical stability of homogeneous and inhomogeneous isothermal
distributions in the Hamiltonian Mean Field (HMF) model. This proof completes
the original thermodynamical approach of Inagaki [Prog. Theor. Phys. 90, 557
(1993)]. Our formalism, based on variational principles, is simple and the
method can be applied to more general situations. For example, it can be used
to settle the dynamical stability of polytropic distributions with respect to
the Vlasov equation [Chavanis & Campa, arXiv:1001.2109]. For isothermal
distributions, the calculations can be performed fully analytically, providing
therefore a clear illustration of the method.
