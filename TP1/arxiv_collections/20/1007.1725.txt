We discuss the $\Gamma$-convergence, under the appropriate scaling, of the
energy functional $$ \|u\|_{H^s(\Omega)}^2+\int_\Omega W(u)dx,$$ with $s \in
(0,1)$, where $\|u\|_{H^s(\Omega)}$ denotes the total contribution from
$\Omega$ in the $H^s$ norm of $u$, and $W$ is a double-well potential.
  When $s\in [1/2,\,1)$, we show that the energy $\Gamma$-converges to the
classical minimal surface functional -- while, when $s\in(0,\,1/2)$, it is easy
to see that the functional $\Gamma$-converges to the nonlocal minimal surface
functional.
