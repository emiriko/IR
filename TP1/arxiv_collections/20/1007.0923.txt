Of concern in this paper is an investigation of peristaltic transport of a
physiological fluid in an asymmetric channel under long wave length and
low-Reynolds number assumptions. The flow is assumed to be incompressible,
viscous, electrically conducting micropolar fluid and the effect of induced
magnetic field is taken into account. Exact analytical solutions obtained for
the axial velocity, microrotation component, stream line pattern, magnetic
force function, axial-induced magnetic field as well as the current density
distribution across the channel. The flow phenomena for the pumping
characteristics, trapping and reflux are also investigated. The results
presented reveal that the velocity decreases with the increase of magnetic
field as well as the coupling parameter. Moreover, the trapping fluid can be
eliminated by the application of an external magnetic field. Thus, the study
bears the promise of important applications in physiological systems.
