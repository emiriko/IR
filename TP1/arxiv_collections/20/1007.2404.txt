We present an electrostatically defined few-electron double quantum dot (QD)
realized in a molecular beam epitaxy grown Si/SiGe heterostructure. Transport
and charge spectroscopy with an additional QD as well as pulsed-gate
measurements are demonstrated. We discuss technological challenges specific for
silicon-based heterostructures and the effect of a comparably large effective
electron mass on transport properties and tunability of the double QD. Charge
noise, which might be intrinsically induced due to strain-engineering is proven
not to affect the stable operation of our device as a spin qubit. Our results
promise the suitability of electrostatically defined QDs in Si/SiGe
heterostructures for quantum information processing.
