We consider the ELKO field in interaction through contorsion with its own
spin density, and we investigate the form of the consequent autointeractions;
to do so we take into account the high-density limit and find plane wave
solutions: such plane waves give rise to contorsional autointeractions for
which the Ricci metric curvature vanishes and therefore the energy density is
equal to zero identically. Consequences are discussed.
