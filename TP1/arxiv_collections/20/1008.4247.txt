We have calculated the kinematical correlations between charged leptons from
semileptonic decays of open charm/bottom as well as leptons produced in the
Drell-Yan mechanism in proton-proton collisions at BNL RHIC. Presented
production rates for open charm and bottom were estimated by a detailed
analysis of so-called nonphotonic electrons. The distributions for charm and
bottom quarks pairs are calculated in the $k_{t}$-factorization approach with
the help of the Kwieci{\'n}ski unintegrated parton distributions. The
hadronization of heavy quarks is done by means of Peterson et al. fragmentation
function. The semileptonic decay functions are found by fitting recent
semileptonic data obtained by the CLEO and BABAR. We get good description of
recent PHENIX data.
