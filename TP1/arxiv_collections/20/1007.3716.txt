We study resonant tunneling through a superconducting double barrier
structure in graphene as a function of the system parameters. At each barrier,
due to the proximity effect, an incident electron can either reflect as an
electron or a hole (specular as well as retro Andreev reflection in graphene).
Similarly, transport across the barriers can occur via electrons as well as via
the crossed (specular and/or retro) Andreev channel, where a hole is
transmitted nonlocally to the other lead. In this geometry, in the subgap
regime, we find resonant suppression of Andreev reflection at certain energies,
due to the formation of Andreev bound levels between the two superconducting
barriers, where the transmission probability T for electrons incident on the
double barrier structure becomes unity. The evolution of the transport through
the superconducting double barrier geometry as a function of the incident
energy for various angles of incidence shows the damping of the resonance as
normal reflection between the barriers increases.
