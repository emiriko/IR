We describe a light-cone QCD sum rule calculation of the $B_s\to f_0(980)$
transition form factors useful to predict the branching ratios of the rare
decays $B_s \to f_0 \ell^+ \ell^-$, $B_s \to f_0 \nu \bar \nu$ and of $B_s\to
J/\psi f_0$ decay assuming factorization. We compare this channel to $B_s \to
J/\psi \phi$ as far as the possibility to determine the $B_s$ mixing phase is
concerned.
