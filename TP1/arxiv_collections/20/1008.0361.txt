We study the quantum localization phenomena of noninteracting particles in
one-dimensional lattices based on tight-binding models with various forms of
hopping terms beyond the nearest neighbor, which are generalizations of the
famous Aubry-Andr\'e and noninteracting Anderson model. For the case with
deterministic disordered potential induced by a secondary incommensurate
lattice (i.e. the Aubry-Andr\'e model), we identify a class of self dual
models, for which the boundary between localized and extended eigenstates are
determined analytically by employing a generalized Aubry-Andr\'e
transformation. We also numerically investigate the localization properties of
non-dual models with next-nearest-neighbor hopping, Gaussian, and power-law
decay hopping terms. We find that even for these non-dual models, the
numerically obtained mobility edges can be well approximated by the
analytically obtained condition for localization transition in the self dual
models, as long as the decay of the hopping rate with respect to distance is
sufficiently fast. For the disordered potential with genuinely random
character, we examine scenarios with next-nearest-neighbor hopping,
exponential, Gaussian, and power-law decay hopping terms numerically. We find
that the higher order hopping terms can remove the symmetry in the localization
length about the energy band center compared to the Anderson model.
Furthermore, our results demonstrate that for the power-law decay case, there
exists a critical exponent below which mobility edges can be found. Our
theoretical results could, in principle, be directly tested in shallow atomic
optical lattice systems enabling non-nearest-neighbor hopping.
