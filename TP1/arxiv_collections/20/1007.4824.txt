The discovery of many particles, especially in the 50's, when the firsts
accelerators appeared, caused the searching for a model that would describe in
a simple form the whole of known particles. The Quark Model, based in the
mathematical structures of group theory, provided in the beginning of the 60's
a simplified description of hadronic matter already known, proposing that three
particles, called quarks, would originate all the observed hadrons. This model
was able to preview the existence of particles that were later detected,
confirming its consistency. Extensions of the Quark Model were made in the
beginning of the 70's, focusing in describing observed particles that were
excited states of the fundamental particles and others that presented new
quantum numbers (flavors). Recently, exotic states as tetraquarks and
pentaquarks types, also called multiquarks systems, previewed by the model,
were observed, what renewed the interest in the way as quarks are confined
inside the hadrons. In this article we present a review of the Quark Model and
a discussion on the new exotic states.
