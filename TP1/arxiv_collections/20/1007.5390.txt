e classify the matrix product states having only spin-flip and parity
symmetries, which can be constructed from two dimensional auxiliary matrices.
We show that there are three distinct classes of such states and in each case,
we determine the parent Hamiltonian and the points of possible quantum phase
transitions. For two of the models, the interactions are three-body and for one
the interaction is two-body
