Nonlinearity shapes lattice dynamics affecting vibrational spectrum,
transport and thermalization phenomena. Beside breathers and solitons one finds
the third fundamental class of nonlinear modes -- $q$-breathers -- periodic
orbits in nonlinear lattices, exponentially localized in the reciprocal mode
space. To date, the studies of $q$-breathers have been confined to the cubic
and quartic nonlinearity in the interaction potential. In this paper we study
the case of arbitrary nonlinearity index $\gamma$ in an acoustic chain. We
uncover qualitative difference in the scaling of delocalization and stability
thresholds of $q$-breathers with the system size: there exists a critical index
$\gamma^*=6$, below which both thresholds (in nonlinearity strength) tend to
zero, and diverge when above. We also demonstrate that this critical index
value is decisive for the presence or absense of thermalization. For a generic
interaction potential the mode space localized dynamics is determined only by
the three lowest order nonlinear terms in the power series expansion.
