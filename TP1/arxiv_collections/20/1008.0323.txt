The dynamics of entangled state interacting with a single cavity mode is
investigated in the presence of a random parameter. We have shown that degree
of entanglement decays with time and rate of decay is defined by features of
random parameter. Quantum teleportation through dissipative channal and
teleportation fidelity as a function of damping rates has been studied. The
sensitivity of the fidelity with respect to random parameter is discussed. We
have evaluated the time interval during which one can perform the quantum
teleportation and send the information with reasonable fidelity, for a given
values of correlation length of random parameter.
