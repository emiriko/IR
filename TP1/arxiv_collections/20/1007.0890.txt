Context: Multiwavelength observations of supernova remnants can be explained
within the framework of diffusive shock acceleration theory, which allows
effective conversion of the explosion energy into cosmic rays. Although the
models of nonlinear shocks describe reasonably well the nonthermal component of
emission, certain issues, including the heating of the thermal electron plasma
and the related X-ray emission, still remain open.
  Methods: Numerical solution of the equations of the Chevalier model for
supernova remnant evolution, coupled with Coulomb scattering heating of the
electrons.
  Results: The electron temperature and the X-ray thermal Bremsstrahlung
emission from supernova remnants have been calculated as functions of the
relevant parameters. Since only the Coulomb mechanism was considered for
electron heating, the values obtained for the electron temperatures should be
treated as lower limits. Results from this work can be useful to constrain
model parameters for observed SNRs.
