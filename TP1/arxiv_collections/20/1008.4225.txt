The long range structure of the nucleon is discussed starting from the old
model of a quark bag with a pion cloud (``cloudy bag'') carrying on to the more
recent ideas of the parton model of the nucleon. On the basis of the most
recent measurements of the form factors at MAMI, JLab and MIT quantitative
results for nucleon charge densities are presented within both non-relativistic
and relativistic frameworks.
