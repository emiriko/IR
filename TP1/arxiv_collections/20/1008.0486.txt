We study the CPT-even dimension-six Chern-Simons-like term by including
dynamical Kalb-Ramond and scalar fields to examine the cosmological
birefringence. We show that the combined effect of neutrino current and
Kalb-Ramond field could induce a sizable rotation polarization angle in the
cosmic microwave background radiation polarization.
