In this note we consider a fermionic T-duality of the coset realization of
the type IIA sigma-model on AdS_4 \times CP^3 with respect to the three flat
directions in AdS_4, six of the fermionic coordinates and three of the CP^3
directions. We show that the Buscher procedure fails as it leads to a singular
transformation and discuss the result and its implications.
