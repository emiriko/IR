In the past decade, much progress has been made in characterising the
processes leading to the enhanced deuterium fractionation observed in the ISM
and in particular in the cold, dense parts of star forming regions such as
protostellar envelopes. Very high molecular D/H ratios have been found for
saturated molecules and ions. However, little is known about the deuterium
fractionation in radicals, even though simple radicals often represent an
intermediate stage in the formation of more complex, saturated molecules. The
imidogen radical NH is such an intermediate species for the ammonia synthesis
in the gas phase. Herschel/HIFI represents a unique opportunity to study the
deuteration and formation mechanisms of such species, which are not observable
from the ground. We searched here for the deuterated radical ND in order to
determine the deuterium fractionation of imidogen and constrain the deuteration
mechanism of this species. We observed the solar-mass Class 0 protostar
IRAS16293-2422 with the heterodyne instrument HIFI as part of the Herschel key
programme CHESS (Chemical HErschel Surveys of Star forming regions). The
deuterated form of the imidogen radical ND was detected and securely identified
with 2 hyperfine component groups of its fundamental transition in absorption
against the continuum background emitted from the nascent protostar. The 3
groups of hyperfine components of its hydrogenated counterpart NH were also
detected in absorption. We derive a very high deuterium fractionation with an
[ND]/[NH] ratio of between 30 and 100%. The deuterium fractionation of imidogen
is of the same order of magnitude as that in other molecules, which suggests
that an efficient deuterium fractionation mechanism is at play. We discuss two
possible formation pathways for ND, by means of either the reaction of N+ with
HD, or deuteron/proton exchange with NH.
