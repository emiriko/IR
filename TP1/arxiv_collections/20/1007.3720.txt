A series of lanthanide, Ln, ion doped lead titanate ceramics, at 2 and 8
at.%, have been prepared with starting compositions Pb1-3x/2LnxTiO3, Ln = La,
Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Dy, using a standard ceramic method. Structural, and
differential scanning calorimetry, measurements are reported. Doping with La3+
results in a reduction in tetragonality and cell volume; a partial recovery was
then observed for the smaller Ln3+ ions and suggests the onset of partial
substitution of the rare earth on the B-site. The ferroelectric-paraelectric
transition temperature results also consistent with an increased probability
the B-site occupation with decreasing ion size.
