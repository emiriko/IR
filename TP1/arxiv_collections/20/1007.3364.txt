We study the class of pulsating strings in AdS_5 x Y^{p,q} and AdS_5 x
L^{p,q,r}. Using a generalized ansatz for pulsating string configurations, we
find new solutions for this class in terms of Heun functions, and derive the
particular case of AdS_5 x T^{1,1}, which was analyzed in arXiv:1006.1539
[hep-th]. Unfortunately, Heun functions are still little studied, and we are
not able to quantize the theory quasi-classically and obtain the first
corrections to the energy. The latter, due to AdS/CFT correspondence, is
supposed to give the anomalous dimensions of operators of the gauge theory dual
N=1 superconformal field theory.
