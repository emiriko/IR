We analyze EUV spectra of the full solar disk from the Cosmic Hot
Interstellar Plasma Spectrometer (CHIPS) spanning a period of two years. The
observations were obtained via a fortuitous off-axis light path in the 140 --
270 Angstrom passband. The general appearance of the spectra remained
relatively stable over the two-year time period, but did show significant
variations of up to 25% between two sets of Fe lines that show peak emission at
1 MK and 2 MK. The variations occur at a measured period of 27.2 days and are
caused by regions of hotter and cooler plasma rotating into, and out of, the
field of view. The CHIANTI spectral code is employed to determine plasma
temperatures, densities, and emission measures. A set of five isothermal
plasmas fit the full disk spectra well. A 1 -- 2 MK plasma of Fe contributes
85% of the total emission in the CHIPS passband. The standard Differential
Emission Measures (DEMs) supplied with the CHIANTI package do not fit the CHIPS
spectra well as they over-predict emission at temperatures below log(T) = 6.0
and above log(T) = 6.3. The results are important for cross-calibrating TIMED,
SORCE, SOHO/EIT, and CDS/GIS, as well as the recently launched Solar Dynamics
Observatory.
