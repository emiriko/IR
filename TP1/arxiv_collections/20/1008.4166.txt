The paper describes several efficient parallel implementations of the
one-sided hyperbolic Jacobi-type algorithm for computing eigenvalues and
eigenvectors of Hermitian matrices. By appropriate blocking of the algorithms
an almost ideal load balancing between all available processors/cores is
obtained. A similar blocking technique can be used to exploit local cache
memory of each processor to further speed up the process. Due to diversity of
modern computer architectures, each of the algorithms described here may be the
method of choice for a particular hardware and a given matrix size. All
proposed block algorithms compute the eigenvalues with relative accuracy
similar to the original non-blocked Jacobi algorithm.
