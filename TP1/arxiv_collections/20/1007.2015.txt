The Quantum Mechanics Conceptual Survey (QMCS) is a 12-question survey of
students' conceptual understanding of quantum mechanics. It is intended to be
used to measure the relative effectiveness of different instructional methods
in modern physics courses. In this paper we describe the design and validation
of the survey, a process that included observations of students, a review of
previous literature and textbooks and syllabi, faculty and student interviews,
and statistical analysis. We also discuss issues in the development of specific
questions, which may be useful both for instructors who wish to use the QMCS in
their classes and for researchers who wish to conduct further research of
student understanding of quantum mechanics. The QMCS has been most thoroughly
tested in, and is most appropriate for assessment of (as a posttest only),
sophomore-level modern physics courses. We also describe testing with students
in junior quantum courses and graduate quantum courses, from which we conclude
that the QMCS may be appropriate for assessing junior quantum courses, but is
not appropriate for assessing graduate courses. One surprising result of our
faculty interviews is a lack of faculty consensus on what topics should be
taught in modern physics, which has made designing a test that is valued by a
majority of physics faculty more difficult than expected.
