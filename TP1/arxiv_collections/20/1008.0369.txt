We study the dependence of the quantum graph Hamiltonian, its resolvent, and
its spectrum on the vertex conditions and graph edge lengths. In particular,
several results on the interlacing (bracketing) of the spectra of graphs with
different vertex conditions are obtained and their applications are discussed.
