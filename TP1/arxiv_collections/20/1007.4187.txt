We characterize inductors fabricated from ultra-thin, approximately 100 nm
wide strips of niobium (Nb) and niobium nitride (NbN). These nanowires have a
large kinetic inductance in the superconducting state. The kinetic inductance
scales linearly with the nanowire length, with a typical value of 1 nH/um for
NbN and 44 pH/um for Nb at a temperature of 2.5 K. We measure the temperature
and current dependence of the kinetic inductance and compare our results to
theoretical predictions. We also simulate the self-resonant frequencies of
these nanowires in a compact meander geometry. These nanowire inductive
elements have applications in a variety of microwave frequency superconducting
circuits.
