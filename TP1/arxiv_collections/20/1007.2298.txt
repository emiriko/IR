The results of numerical simulations of the dynamics of galactic disks, which
are submerged into nonaxisymmetric dark massive halo are discussed. Galaxy
disks dynamics in the nonaxisymmetric (triaxial) dark halo were investigated in
detail by the high resolution numerical hydrodynamical methods (TVD \& SPH) and
N-body models. The long-lived two arms spiral structure generates for a wide
range of parameters. The spiral structure is global and number of turns can be
2-3 in depends of model parameters. Morphology and kinematics of spiral
structures were investigated in depends of the halo and the disk parameters.
The spiral structure rotates slowly and the angular velocity varies is
quasiperiodic.
