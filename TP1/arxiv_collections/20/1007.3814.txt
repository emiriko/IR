Muon spin rotation/relaxation/resonance (MuSR) technique for studying matter
structures is considered by means of a recently introduced probability
representation of quantum spin states. A relation between experimental MuSR
histograms and muon spin tomograms is established. Time evolution of muonium,
anomalous muonium, and a muonium-like system is studied in the tomographic
representation. Entanglement phenomenon of a bipartite muon-electron system is
investigated via tomographic analogues of Bell number and positive partial
transpose (PPT) criterion. Reconstruction of the muon-electron spin state as
well as the total spin tomography of composed system is discussed.
