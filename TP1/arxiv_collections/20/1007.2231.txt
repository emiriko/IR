By modeling the coupling of multiple superconducting qubits to a single
cavity in the circuit-quantum electrodynamics (QED) framework we find that it
should be possible to observe superradiance and phase multistability using
currently available technology. Due to the exceptionally large couplings
present in circuit-QED we predict that superradiant microwave pulses should be
observable with only a very small number of qubits (just three or four), in the
presence of energy relaxation and non-uniform qubit-field coupling strengths.
This paves the way for circuit-QED implementations of superradiant state
readout and decoherence free subspace state encoding in subradiant states. The
system considered here also exhibits phase multistability when driven with
large field amplitudes, and this effect may have applications for collective
qubit readout and for quantum feedback protocols.
