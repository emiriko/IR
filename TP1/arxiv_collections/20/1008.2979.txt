We studied the field-induced magnetic structures of the Tb2Ti2O7 pyrochlore
by single-crystal neutron diffraction with a magnetic field applied along a
[110] axis, focusing on the influence of a small misalignment. Both induced
magnetic structures with k=0 and k=(0,0,1) propagation vectors are found to be
sensitive to the misalignment, which controls the magnitude and orientation of
the Tb moments involved in the beta chains, with local [111] anisotropy axis
perpendicular to the field. For k=0, spin-ice-like structures are observed for
a misalignment of a few degrees, whereas other structures, where the Tb-beta
moments flip by "melting" on the field axis, occur when the field is perfectly
aligned. The field evolution of the k=0 structure is well reproduced by a
molecular field model with anisotropic exchange. We give a complete symmetry
analysis of the k=0 and k=(0,0,1) magnetic structures, both being described by
the basis functions of single irreducible representations.
