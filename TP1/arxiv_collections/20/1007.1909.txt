We present the results from 1.5D diffusion simulations of the
Kippenhahn-Schlueter prominence model magnetic field evolution under the
influence of the ambipolar terms of Cowling resistivity. We show that initially
the evolution is determined by the ratio of the horizontal and vertical
magnetic fields, which gives current sheet thinning (thickening) when this
ratio is large (small) and a marginal case where a new characteristic current
sheet length scale is formed. After a timespan greater than the Cowling
resistivity time, the current sheet thickens as a power law of $t$ independent
of the ratio of the field strengths. These results imply that when Cowling
resistivity is included in the model, the tearing instability time scale is
reduced by more than one order of magnitude when the ratio of the horizontal
field to the vertical field is 20\% or less. These results imply that, over the
course of its lifetime, the structure of the prominence can be significantly
altered by Cowling resistivity, and in some cases will allow the tearing
instability to occur.
