This paper extends the Birman-Wenzl category by including a spin
representation and then developing the recoupling theory, following Cvitanovic.
In particular this gives a q-analogue of the chromatic evaluation of a spin
network. The recoupling theory is developed up to an evaluation of the
q-analogues of the Fierz coefficients.
