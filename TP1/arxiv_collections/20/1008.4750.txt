We analyzed the electron neutrino data of the Gallium radioactive source
experiments and the electron antineutrino data of the reactor Bugey and Chooz
experiments in terms of neutrino oscillations allowing for a CPT-violating
difference of the squared-masses and mixings of neutrinos and antineutrinos. We
found that the discrepancy between the disappearance of electron neutrinos
indicated by the data of the Gallium radioactive source experiments and the
limits on the disappearance of electron antineutrinos given by the data of
reactor experiments reveal a positive CPT-violating asymmetry of the effective
neutrino and antineutrino mixing angles (with a statistical significance of
about 3.5 sigma), whereas the squared-mass asymmetry is practically not
bounded.
