Full jet reconstruction in heavy-ion collisions is a promising tool for the
quantitative study of properties of the dense medium produced at RHIC.
Measurements of d+Au collisions are important to disentangle initial state
nuclear effects from medium-induced kT broadening and jet quenching. Study of
jet production and properties in d+Au in combination with similar studies in
p+p is an important baseline measurement needed to better understand heavy-ion
results. We present mid-rapidity inclusive jet pT spectra and di-jet
correlations (kT) in 200 GeV p+p and d+Au collisions from the 2007-2008 RHIC
run. We discuss the methods used to correct the data for detector effects and
for background in d+Au collisions.
