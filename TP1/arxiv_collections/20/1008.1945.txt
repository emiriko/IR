The LMC star, SSTISAGE1C J050756.44-703453.9, was first noticed during a
survey of EROS-2 lightcurves for stars with large irregular brightness
variations typical of the R Coronae Borealis (RCB) class. However, the visible
spectrum showing emission lines including the Balmer and Paschen series as well
as many Fe II lines is emphatically not that of an RCB star. This star has all
of the characteristics of a typical UX Ori star. It has a spectral type of
approximately A2 and has excited an H II region in its vicinity. However, if it
is an LMC member, then it is very luminous for a Herbig Ae/Be star. It shows
irregular drops in brightness of up to 2 mag, and displays the reddening and
"blueing" typical of this class of stars. Its spectrum, showing a combination
of emission and absorption lines, is typical of a UX Ori star that is in a
decline caused by obscuration from the circumstellar dust. SSTISAGE1C
J050756.44-703453.9 has a strong IR excess and significant emission is present
out to 500 micron. Monte Carlo radiative transfer modeling of the SED requires
that SSTISAGE1C J050756.44-703453.9 has both a dusty disk as well as a large
extended diffuse envelope to fit both the mid- and far-IR dust emission. This
star is a new member of the UX Ori subclass of the Herbig Ae/Be stars and only
the second such star to be discovered in the LMC.
