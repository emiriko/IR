It is proposed to use apertures with large acceptance angles to reduce the
integration time when studying the emissivity of laser induced plasmas by means
of the Abel inversion method. The spatial resolution lost due to contributions
of angled lines of sight to the intensity data collected along the plasma plume
diameter is restored by a special numerical data processing. The procedure is
meant for the laser induced plasma diagnostics and tomography when the
integration time needed to achieve a reasonable signal to noise ratio exceeds a
characteristic time scale of the plasma state variations which is short
especially at early stages of the plasma evolution.
