In this paper, we prove an explicit arithmetic intersection formula between
arithmetic Hirzebruch-Zagier divisors and arithmetic CM cycles in a Hilbert
modular surface over $\mathbb Z$. As applications, we obtain the first
`non-abelian' Chowla-Selberg formula, which is a special case of Colmez's
conjecture; an explicit arithmetic intersection formula between arithmetic
Humbert surfaces and CM cycles in the arithmetic Siegel modular variety of
genus two; Lauter's conjecture about the denominators of CM values of Igusa
invariants; and a result about bad reductions of CM genus two curves.
