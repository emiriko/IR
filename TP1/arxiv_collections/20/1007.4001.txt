I argue that the conventional field theoretic notion of vacuum state is not
valid in quantum gravity. The arguments use gravitational effective field
theory, as well as results from string theory, particularly the AdS/CFT
correspondence. Different solutions of the same low energy gravitational field
equations correspond to different quantum systems, rather than different states
in the same system. I then introduce {\it holographic space-time} a quasi-local
quantum mechanical construction based on the holographic principle. I argue
that models of quantum gravity in asymptotically flat space-time will be
exactly super-Poincare invariant, because the natural variables of holographic
space-time for such a system, are the degrees of freedom of massless
superparticles. The formalism leads to a non-singular quantum Big Bang
cosmology, in which the asymptotic future is required to be a de Sitter space,
with cosmological constant (c.c.) determined by cosmological initial
conditions. It is also approximately SUSic in the future, with the gravitino
mass $K \Lambda^{1/4}$.
