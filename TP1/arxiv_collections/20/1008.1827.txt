Motivated by the fact that in many game-theoretic settings, the game analyzed
is only an approximation to the game being played, in this work we analyze
equilibrium computation for the broad and natural class of bimatrix games that
are stable to perturbations. We specifically focus on games with the property
that small changes in the payoff matrices do not cause the Nash equilibria of
the game to fluctuate wildly. For such games we show how one can compute
approximate Nash equilibria more efficiently than the general result of Lipton
et al. \cite{LMM03}, by an amount that depends on the degree of stability of
the game and that reduces to their bound in the worst case. Furthermore, we
show that for stable games the approximate equilibria found will be close in
variation distance to true equilibria, and moreover this holds even if we are
given as input only a perturbation of the actual underlying stable game.
  For uniformly-stable games, where the equilibria fluctuate at most
quasi-linearly in the extent of the perturbation, we get a particularly
dramatic improvement. Here, we achieve a fully quasi-polynomial-time
approximation scheme: that is, we can find $1/\poly(n)$-approximate equilibria
in quasi-polynomial time. This is in marked contrast to the general class of
bimatrix games for which finding such approximate equilibria is PPAD-hard. In
particular, under the (widely believed) assumption that PPAD is not contained
in quasi-polynomial time, our results imply that such uniformly stable games
are inherently easier for computation of approximate equilibria than general
bimatrix games.
