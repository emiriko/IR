In this paper, we propose a general method for testing composite hypotheses.
Our idea is to use confidence limits to define stopping and decision rules. The
requirements of operating characteristic function can be satisfied by adjusting
the coefficients of the confidence limits. For common distributions, such
adjustment can be done via efficient computation by making use of the
monotonicity of the associated operating characteristic function. We show that
the problem of testing multiple hypotheses can be cast into the general
framework of constructing sequential random intervals with prescribed coverage
probabilities. We propose an inclusion principle for constructing multistage
testing plans. It is demonstrated that our proposed testing plans can be
substantially more efficient than the sequential probability ratio test and its
variations. We apply our general methodology to develop an exact approach for
testing hypotheses regarding the difference of two binomial proportions.
