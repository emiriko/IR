Sequences of events in noise-driven excitable systems with slow variables
often show serial correlations among their intervals of events. Here, we employ
a master equation for general non-renewal processes to calculate the interval
and count statistics of superimposed processes governed by a slow adaptation
variable. For an ensemble of spike-frequency adapting neurons this results in
the regularization of the population activity and an enhanced post-synaptic
signal decoding. We confirm our theoretical results in a population of cortical
neurons.
