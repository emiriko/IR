Ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) may be produced in active galactic
nuclei (AGN) or gamma-ray burst (GRB) jets. I argue that magnetic reconnection
in jets can accelerate UHECRs rather independently of physical processes in the
magnetic dissipation region. First order Fermi acceleration can efficiently
take place in the region where the unreconnected (upstream) magnetized fluid
converges into the reconnection layer. I find that protons can reach energies
up to E~10^{20} eV in GRB and powerful AGN jets while iron nuclei can reach
similar energies in AGN jets of more moderate luminosity.
