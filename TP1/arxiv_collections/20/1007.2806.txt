Using the Optimal Filter Technique applied to Sloan Digital Sky Survey
photometry, we have found extended tails stretching about 1 degree (or several
tens of half-light radii) from either side of the ultra-faint globular cluster
Palomar 1. The tails contain roughly as many stars as does the cluster itself.
Using deeper Hubble Space Telescope data, we see that the isophotes twist in a
chacteristic S-shape on moving outwards from the cluster centre to the tails.
We argue that the main mechanism forming the tails may be relaxation driven
evaporation and that Pal 1 may have been accreted from a now disrupted dwarf
galaxy ~500 Myr ago.
