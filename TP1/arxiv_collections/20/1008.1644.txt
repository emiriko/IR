We consider asymmetric spin-1/2 two-leg ladders with non-equal
antiferromagnetic (AF) couplings J_|| and \kappa J_|| along legs (\kappa <= 1)
and ferromagnetic rung coupling, J_\perp. This model is characterized by a gap
\Delta in the spectrum of spin excitations. We show that in the large J_\perp
limit this gap is equivalent to the Haldane gap for the AF spin-1 chain,
irrespective of the asymmetry of the ladder. The behavior of the gap at small
rung coupling falls in two different universality classes. The first class,
which is best understood from the case of the conventional symmetric ladder at
\kappa=1, admits a linear scaling for the spin gap \Delta ~ J_\perp. The second
class appears for a strong asymmetry of the coupling along legs, \kappa J_|| <<
J_\perp << J_|| and is characterized by two energy scales: the exponentially
small spin gap \Delta ~ J_\perp \exp(-J_|| / J_\perp), and the bandwidth of the
low-lying excitations induced by a Suhl-Nakamura indirect exchange ~ J_\perp^2
/J_|| . We report numerical results obtained by exact diagonalization, density
matrix renormalization group and quantum Monte Carlo simulations for the spin
gap and various spin correlation functions. Our data indicate that the behavior
of the string order parameter, characterizing the hidden AF order in Haldane
phase, is different in the limiting cases of weak and strong asymmetry. On the
basis of the numerical data, we propose a low-energy theory of effective spin-1
variables, pertaining to large blocks on a decimated lattice.
