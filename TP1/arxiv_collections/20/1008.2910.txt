Close binary systems undergoing mass transfer or common envelope interactions
can account for the morphological properties of some planetary nebulae. The
search for close binary companions in planetary nebulae is hindered by the
difficulty of detecting cool, late-type, main sequence companions in binary
systems with hot pre-white dwarf primaries. However, models of binary PN
progenitor systems predict that mass accretion or tidal interactions can induce
rapid rotation in the companion, leading to X-ray-emitting coronae. To test
such models, we have searched for, and detected, X-ray emission from three
binary central stars within planetary nebulae: the post-common envelope close
binaries in HFG 1 and DS 1 consisting of O-type subdwarfs with late-type, main
sequence companions, and the binary system in LoTr 5 consisting of O-type
subdwarf and rapidly rotating, late-type giant companion. The X-ray emission in
each case is best characterized by spectral models consisting of two
optically-thin thermal plasma components with characteristic temperatures of
about 10 MK and 15-40 MK, and total X-ray luminosities about 10^30 erg/s. We
consider the possible origin of the X-ray emission from these binary systems
and conclude that the most likely origin is, in each case, a corona around the
late-type companion, as predicted by models of interacting binaries.
