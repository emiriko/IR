The properties of neutron star matter above nuclear density are not precisely
known. Gravitational waves emitted from binary neutron stars during their late
stages of inspiral and merger contain imprints of the neutron-star equation of
state. Measuring departures from the point-particle limit of the late inspiral
waveform allows one to measure properties of the equation of state via
gravitational wave observations. This and a companion talk by J. S. Read
reports a comparison of numerical waveforms from simulations of inspiraling
neutron-star binaries, computed for equations of state with varying stiffness.
We calculate the signal strength of the difference between waveforms for
various commissioned and proposed interferometric gravitational wave detectors
and show that observations at frequencies around 1 kHz will be able to measure
a compactness parameter and constrain the possible neutron-star equations of
state.
