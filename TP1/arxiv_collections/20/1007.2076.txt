Based on the external perturbation that disturbs the system only slightly
from its equilibrium position we make the Taylor expansion of the pressure of a
quark gas. It turns out that the first term was used in the literature to
construct a Hard Thermal Loop perturbation theory (HTLpt) within the variation
principle of the lowest order of the thermal mass parameter. Various
thermodynamic quantities within the 1-loop HTLpt encountered overcounting of
the leading order (LO) contribution and also required a separation scale for
soft and hard momenta. Using same variational principle we reconstruct the
HTLpt at the first derivative level of the pressure that takes into account the
effect of the variation of the external source through the conserved density
fluctuation. This modification markedly improves those quantities in 1-loop
HTLpt in a simple way instead of pushing the calculation to a considerably more
complicated 2-loop HTLpt. Moreover, the results also agree with those obtained
in the 2-loop approximately self-consistent \Phi-derivable Hard Thermal Loop
resummation. We also discuss how this formalism can be extended for the higher
order contributions
