The social force model which belongs to the microscopic pedestrian studies
has been considered as the supremacy by many researchers and due to the main
feature of reproducing the self-organized phenomena resulted from pedestrian
dynamic. The Preferred Force which is a measurement of pedestrian's motivation
to adapt his actual velocity to his desired velocity is an essential term on
which the model was set up. This Force has gone through stages of development:
first of all, Helbing and Molnar (1995) have modeled the original force for the
normal situation. Second, Helbing and his co-workers (2000) have incorporated
the panic situation into this force by incorporating the panic parameter to
account for the panic situations. Third, Lakoba and Kaup (2005) have provided
the pedestrians some kind of intelligence by incorporating aspects of the
decision-making capability. In this paper, the authors analyze the most
important incorporations into the model regarding the preferred force. They
make comparisons between the different factors of these incorporations.
Furthermore, to enhance the decision-making ability of the pedestrians, they
introduce additional features such as the familiarity factor to the preferred
force to let it appear more representative of what actually happens in reality.
