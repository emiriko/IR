We introduce a quantum packing bound on the minimal resources required by
nondegenerate error correction codes for any kind of noise. We prove that
degenerate codes can outperform nondegenerate ones in the presence of
correlated noise, by exhibiting examples where the quantum packing bound is
violated.
