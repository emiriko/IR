Given a simple connected undirected graph G, the Wiener index W(G) of G is
defined as half the sum of the distances over all pairs of vertices of G. In
practice, G corresponds to what is known as the molecular graph of an organic
compound. We obtain a sharp lower bound for W(G) of an arbitrary graph in terms
of the order, size and diameter of G.
