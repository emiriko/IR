We discuss two aspects of the Waldmeier Effect, namely (1) the rise times of
sunspot cycles are anti-correlated to their strengths (WE1) and (2) the rates
of rise of the cycles are correlated to their strengths (WE2). From analysis of
four different data sets we conclude that both WE1 and WE2 exist in all the
data sets. We study these effects theoretically by introducing suitable
stochastic fluctuations in our regular solar dynamo model.
