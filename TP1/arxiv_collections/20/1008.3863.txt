Uncertainty in Logic Programming has been investigated since about 25 years,
publishing papers dealing with various approaches to semantics and different
applications. This report is intended as a first step towards the investigation
of qualified computations in Constraint Functional Logic Programming, including
uncertain computations as a particular case. We revise an early proposal,
namely van Emden's Quantitative Logic Programming, and we improve it in two
ways. Firstly, we generalize van Emden's QLP to a generic scheme QLP(D)
parameterized by any given Qualification Domain D, which must be a lattice
satisfying certain natural axioms. We present several interesting instances for
D, one of which corresponds to van Emden's QLP. Secondly, we generalize van
Emden's results by providing stronger ones, concerning both semantics and goal
solving. We present Qualified SLD Resolution over D, a sound and strongly
complete goal solving procedure for QLP(D), which is applicable to open goals
and can be efficiently implemented using CLP technology over any constraint
domain CD able to deal with qualification constraints over D. We have developed
a prototype implementation of some instances of the QLP(D) scheme (including
van Emden's QLP) on top of the CFLP system TOY.
