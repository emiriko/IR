We investigate the achievable error probability in communication over an AWGN
discrete time memoryless channel with noiseless delay-less rate-limited
feedback. For the case where the feedback rate R_FB is lower than the data rate
R transmitted over the forward channel, we show that the decay of the
probability of error is at most exponential in blocklength, and obtain an upper
bound for increase in the error exponent due to feedback. Furthermore, we show
that the use of feedback in this case results in an error exponent that is at
least RF B higher than the error exponent in the absence of feedback. For the
case where the feedback rate exceeds the forward rate (R_FB \geq R), we propose
a simple iterative scheme that achieves a probability of error that decays
doubly exponentially with the codeword blocklength n. More generally, for some
positive integer L, we show that a L-th order exponential error decay is
achievable if R_FB \geq (L-1)R. We prove that the above results hold whether
the feedback constraint is expressed in terms of the average feedback rate or
per channel use feedback rate. Our results show that the error exponent as a
function of R_FB has a strong discontinuity at R, where it jumps from a finite
value to infinity.
