Non-equilibrium transport properties of charge and spin sector of two edges
of a quantum spin Hall insulator are investigated theoretically in a
four-terminal configuration. A simple duality relation between charge and spin
sector is found for two helical Tomonaga Luttinger liquids (hTTLs) connected to
non-interacting electron reservoirs. If the hTLLs on opposite edges are coupled
locally or non-locally, the mixing between them yields interesting physics
where spin information can be easily detected by a charge measurement and vice
versa. Particularly, we show how a pure spin density in the absence of charge
current can be generated in a setup that contains two hTLL and one spinful
Tomonaga Luttinger liquid in between.
