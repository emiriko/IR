We introduce a bond percolation procedure on a $D$-dimensional lattice where
two neighbouring sites are connected by $N$ channels, each operated by valves
at both ends. Out of a total of $N$, randomly chosen $n$ valves are open at
every site. A bond is said to connect two sites if there is at least one
channel between them, which has open valves at both ends. We show analytically
that in all spatial dimensions, this system undergoes a discontinuous
percolation transition in the $N\to \infty$ limit when
  $\gamma =\frac{\ln n}{\ln N}$ crosses a threshold. It must be emphasized
that, in contrast to the ordinary percolation models, here the transition
occurs even in one dimensional systems, albeit discontinuously. We also show
that a special kind of discontinuous percolation occurs only in one dimension
when $N$ depends on the system size.
