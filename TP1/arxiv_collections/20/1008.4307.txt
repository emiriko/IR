Coherent states, and the Hilbert space representations they generate, provide
ideal tools to discuss classical/quantum relationships. In this paper we
analyze three separate classical/quantum problems using coherent states, and
show that useful connections arise among them. The topics discussed are: (1) a
truly natural formulation of phase space path integrals; (2) how this analysis
implies that the usual classical formalism is ``simply a subset'' of the
quantum formalism, and thus demonstrates a universal coexistence of both the
classical and quantum formalisms; and (3) how these two insights lead to a
complete analytic solution of a formerly insoluble family of nonlinear quantum
field theory models.
