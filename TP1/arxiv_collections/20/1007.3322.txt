We consider the supercritical finite-range random connection model where the
points $x,y$ of a homogeneous planar Poisson process are connected with
probability $f(|y-x|)$ for a given $f$. Performing percolation on the resulting
graph, we show that the critical probabilities for site and bond percolation
satisfy the strict inequality $p_c^{\rm site} > p_c^{\rm bond}$. We also show
that reducing the connection function $f$ strictly increases the critical
Poisson intensity. Finally, we deduce that performing a spreading
transformation on $f$ (thereby allowing connections over greater distances but
with lower probabilities, leaving average degrees unchanged) {\em strictly}
reduces the critical Poisson intensity. This is of practical relevance,
indicating that in many real networks it is in principle possible to exploit
the presence of spread-out, long range connections, to achieve connectivity at
a strictly lower density value.
