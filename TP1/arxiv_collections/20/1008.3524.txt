In this paper we calculate the interfacial resistances to heat and mass
transfer through a liquid-vapor interface in a binary mixture. We use two
methods, the direct calculation from the actual non-equilibrium solution and
integral relations, derived earlier. We verify, that integral relations, being
a relatively faster and cheaper method, indeed gives the same results as the
direct processing of a non-equilibrium solution. Furthermore we compare the
absolute values of the interfacial resistances with the ones obtained from
kinetic theory. Matching the diagonal resistances for the binary mixture we
find that kinetic theory underestimates the cross coefficients. The heat of
transfer is as a consequence correspondingly larger.
