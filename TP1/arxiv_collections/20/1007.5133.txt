Recently, applying the novel data mining techniques for evaluating enterprise
financial distress has received much research alternation. Support Vector
Machine (SVM) and back propagation neural (BPN) network has been applied
successfully in many areas with excellent generalization results, such as rule
extraction, classification and evaluation. In this paper, a model based on SVM
with Gaussian RBF kernel is proposed here for enterprise financial distress
evaluation. BPN network is considered one of the simplest and are most general
methods used for supervised training of multilayered neural network. The
comparative results show that through the difference between the performance
measures is marginal; SVM gives higher precision and lower error rates.
