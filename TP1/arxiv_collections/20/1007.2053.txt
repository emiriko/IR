A set of physics models and parameters pertaining to the simulation of proton
energy deposition in matter are evaluated in the energy range up to
approximately 65 MeV, based on their implementations in the Geant4 toolkit. The
analysis assesses several features of the models and the impact of their
associated epistemic uncertainties, i.e. uncertainties due to lack of
knowledge, on the simulation results. Possible systematic effects deriving from
uncertainties of this kind are highlighted; their relevance in relation to the
application environment and different experimental requirements are discussed,
with emphasis on the simulation of radiotherapy set-ups. By documenting
quantitatively the features of a wide set of simulation models and the related
intrinsic uncertainties affecting the simulation results, this analysis
provides guidance regarding the use of the concerned simulation tools in
experimental applications; it also provides indications for further
experimental measurements addressing the sources of such uncertainties.
