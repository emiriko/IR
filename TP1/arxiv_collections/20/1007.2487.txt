The spatial-temporal distribution of absorption-line systems (ALSs) observed
in QSO spectra within the cosmological redshift interval z = 0.0--4.3 is
investigated on the base of our updated catalog of absorption systems. We
consider so called metallic systems including basically lines of heavy
elements. The sample of the data displays regular variations (with amplitudes ~
15 -- 20%) in the z-distribution of ALSs as well as in the eta-distribution,
where eta is a dimensionless line-of-sight comoving distance, relatively to
smoother dependences. The eta-distribution reveals the periodicity with period
Delta eta = 0.036 +/- 0.002, which corresponds to a spatial characteristic
scale (108 +/- 6) h(-1) Mpc or (alternatively) a temporal interval (350 +/- 20)
h(-1) Myr for the LambdaCDM cosmological model. We discuss a possibility of a
spatial interpretation of the results treating the pattern obtained as a trace
of an order imprinted on the galaxy clustering in the early Universe.
