We propose and numerically study two permanent magnetic micro-structures for
creating Ioffe-Pritchard microtraps. A bias magnetic field is used to vary the
depth, trap frequencies and the minimum of each microtrap. After the
Bose-Einstein condensation achievement, the bias magnetic field can be slowly
removed to increase the trap barrier heights for more efficiently holding the
Bose-Einstein condensates. Even without the external magnetic field, it is
possible to hold ultracold atoms in the microtraps. These microtraps may also
be useful for single atom experiments for quantum information processing due to
their very high confinement.
