We propose an SU(5) SUSY GUT of flavour with A_4 family symmetry in 8d where
the vacuum alignment is achieved in an elegant way by the use of boundary
conditions on orbifolds. The model involves SU(5) living in the 8d bulk, with
matter living in 6d (or 4d) subspaces and Yukawa interactions occurring at a 4d
point. The GUT group is broken to the Standard Model by the orbifold
compactification, setting the GUT scale and leading to low energy supersymmetry
and Higgs doublet-triplet splitting. The first two families of 10-plets are
doubled resulting in a lack of both desirable and unwanted GUT relations. The
resulting four dimensional effective superpotential leads to a realistic
description of quark and lepton masses and mixing angles including
tri-bimaximal neutrino mixing and an inter-family mass hierarchy provided in
part by volume suppression and in part by a Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism.
