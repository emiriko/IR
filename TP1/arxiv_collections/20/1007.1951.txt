We study the dynamics of entanglement transfer in a system composed of two
initially correlated three-level atoms, each located in a cavity interacting
with its own reservoir. Instead of tracing out reservoir modes to describe the
dynamics using the master equation approach, we consider explicitly the
dynamics of the reservoirs. In this situation, we show that the entanglement is
completely transferred from atoms to reservoirs. Although the cavities mediate
this entanglement transfer, we show that under certain conditions, no
entanglement is found in cavities throughout the dynamics. Considering the
entanglement dynamics of interacting and non-interacting bipartite subsystems,
we found time windows where the entanglement can only flow through interacting
subsystems, depending on the system parameters.
