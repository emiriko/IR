There is a classical geometric construction which uses a binary quadratic
form to define an involution on the space of binary d-ics. We give a complete
characterization of a general class of such involutions which are definable
using compound transvectant formulae. We also study the associated varieties of
forms which are preserved by such involutions. Along the way we prove a
recoupling formula for transvectants, which is used to deduce a system of
equations satisfied by the coefficients in these involutions.
