Individual Based Models (IBMs) and Agent Based Models (ABMs) have become
widely used tools to understand complex biological systems. However, general
methods of parameter inference for IBMs are not available. In this paper we
show that it is possible to address this problem with a traditional
likelihood-based approach, using an example of an IBM developed to describe the
spread of Chytridiomycosis in a population of frogs as a case study. We show
that if the IBM satisfies certain criteria we can find the likelihood (or
posterior) analytically, and use standard computational techniques, such as
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), for parameter inference.
