This paper reports on the commissioning and first running experience of the
CMS Zero Degree Calorimeters during December 2009. All channels worked
correctly. The ZDCs were timed into the data acquisition system using beam
splash events. These data also allowed us to make a first estimate of
channel-by-channel variations in gain.
