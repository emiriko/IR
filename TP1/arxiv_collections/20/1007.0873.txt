Non-empirical effective contact pairing forces to be used in self-consistent
mean-field calculations are presented. These pairing forces, constructed so as
to reproduce exactly any given microscopic pairing gaps in infinite homogeneous
nuclear matter for any isospin asymmetry, are given in analytical form. As a
by-product, this work provides an analytical solution of the BCS gap equations
which could be applied to describe various many-body systems.
