We study the heat transfer between graphene and amorphous SiO2. We include
both the heat transfer from the area of real contact, and between the surfaces
in the non-contact region. We consider the radiative heat transfer associated
with the evanescent electromagnetic waves which exist outside of all bodies,
and the heat transfer by the gas in the non-contact region. We find that the
dominant contribution to the heat transfer result from the area of real
contact, and the calculated value of the heat transfer coefficient is in good
agreement with the value deduced from experimental data.
