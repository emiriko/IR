We carry out an analysis of the potential of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)
to discover supersymmetry in runs at $\sqrt s=7$ TeV with an accumulated
luminosity of (0.1--2) fb$^{-1}$ of data. The analysis is done both with
minimal supergravity (mSUGRA) and supergravity (SUGRA) models with
non-universal soft breaking. Benchmarks for early discovery with (0.1--2)
fb$^{-1}$ of data are given. We provide an update of b-tagging efficiencies in
PGS 4 appropriate for LHC analyses. A large number of signature channels are
analyzed and it is shown that each of the models exhibited are discoverable at
the 5$\sigma$ level or more above the standard model background in several
signature channels which would provide cross checks for a discovery of
supersymmetry (SUSY). It is shown that some of the benchmarks are discoverable
with 0.1 fb$^{-1}$ of data again with detectable signals in several channels.
