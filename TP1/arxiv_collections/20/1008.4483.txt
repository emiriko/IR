We generalize the vacuum static black brane solutions of Einstein's equations
with negative cosmological constant recently discussed in literature, by
introducing rotations and an electromagnetic field. We investigate numerically
the thermodynamical properties of the charged and of the rotating $AdS$ black
brane and we provide evidences for the existence of the charged and rotating
case. In particular, we study the influence of the rotation and charge on the
tension and mass. We find that the rotation essentially influences the tensions
while the charge essentially influences the mass.
