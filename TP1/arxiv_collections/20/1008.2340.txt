In 2002, Evertse and Schlickewei obtained a quantitative version of the
so-called Absolute Parametric Subspace Theorem. This result deals with a
parametrized class of twisted heights. One of the consequences of this result
is a quantitative version of the Absolute Subspace Theorem, giving an explicit
upper bound for the number of subspaces containing the solutions of the
Diophantine inequality under consideration.
  In the present paper, we further improve Evertse's and Schlickewei's
quantitative version of the Absolute Parametric Subspace Theorem, and deduce an
improved quantitative version of the Absolute Subspace Theorem. We combine
ideas from the proof of Evertse and Schlickewei (which is basically a
substantial refinement of Schmidt's proof of his Subspace Theorem from 1972,
with ideas from Faltings' and Wuestholz' proof of the Subspace Theorem.
