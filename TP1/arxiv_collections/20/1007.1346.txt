In simulations with dynamical quarks it has been established that the ground
state rho in the infrared is a strong mixture of the two chiral representations
(0,1)+(1,0) and (1/2,1/2)_b. Its angular momentum content is approximately the
3S1 partial wave which is consistent with the quark model. Effective chiral
restoration in an excited rho-meson would require that in the infrared this
meson couples predominantly to one of the two representations. The variational
method allows one to study the mixing of interpolators with different chiral
transformation properties in the non-perturbatively determined excited state at
different resolution scales. We present results for the first excited state of
the rho-meson using simulations with n_f=2 dynamical quarks. We point out, that
in the infrared a leading contribution to rho'= rho(1450) comes from
(1/2,1/2)_b, in contrast to the rho. Its approximate chiral partner would be a
h_1(1380) state. The rho' wave function contains a significant contribution of
the 3D1 wave which is not consistent with the quark model prediction.
