Cupric oxide is multiferroic at unusual high temperatures. From density
functional calculations we find that the low-T magnetic phase is paraelectric
and the higher-T one ferroelectric, with a size and direction of polarization
in good agreement with experiment. By mapping of the ab initio results on an
effective spin model we find with Monte Carlo that in the high-T magnetic state
non-collinearity and inversion symmetry breaking stabilize each other via the
Dzyaloshinskii Moriya interaction. This leads to a novel mechanism for
multiferroicity, with the particular property that non-magnetic impurities
enhance the effect.
