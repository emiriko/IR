We use four years of introductory astronomy scores to analyze the ability of
the current population to perform college level work and measure the amount of
grade inflation across various majors. Using an objective grading scale, one
that is independent of grading curves, we find that 29% of intro astronomy
students fail to meet minimal standards for college level work. Of the
remaining students, 41% achieve satisfactory work, 30% achieve mastery of the
topics.
  Intro astronomy scores correlate with SAT and college GPA. Sequential mapping
of the objective grade scheme onto GPA finds that college grades are inflated
by 0.2 for natural sciences majors, 0.3 for social sciences, professional
schools and undeclared majors), 0.5 for humanities majors. It is unclear from
the data whether grade inflation is due to easier grading curves or depression
of course material. Experiments with student motivation tools indicates that
poor student performance is due to deficiency in student abilities rather than
social factors (such as study time or decreased interest in academics), i.e.,
more stringent admission standards would resolve grade inflation.
