The accepted model for nerve pulse propagation in biological membranes seems
insufficient. It is restricted to dissipative electrical phenomena and
considers nerve pulses exclusively as a microscopic phenomenon. A simple
thermodynamic model that is based on the macroscopic properties of membranes
allows explaining more features of nerve pulse propagation including the
phenomenon of anesthesia that has so far remained unexplained.
