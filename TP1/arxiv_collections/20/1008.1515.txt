The dynamical symmetries of the Kratzer-type molecular potentials
(generalized Kratzer molecular potentials) are studied by using the
factorization method. The creation and annihilation (ladder) operators for the
radial eigenfunctions satisfying quantum dynamical algebra $SU(1, 1)$ are
established. Factorization method is a very simple method of calculating the
matrix elements from these ladder operators. The matrix elements of different
functions of $r$, $r\frac{d}{dr}$, their sum $\Gamma_{1}$ and difference
$\Gamma_{2}$ are evaluated in a closed form. The exact bound state energy
eigenvalues $E_{n, \ell}$ and matrix elements of $r$, $r\frac{d}{dr}$, their
sum $\Gamma_{1}$ and difference $\Gamma_{2}$ are calculated for various values
of $n$ and $\ell$ quantum numbers for $CO$ and $NO$ diatomic molecules for the
two potentials. The results obtained are in very good agreement with those
obtained by other methods.
