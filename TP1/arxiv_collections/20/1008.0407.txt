The first search for supersymmetry from ATLAS with 70/nb of integrated
luminosity extends the Tevatron' s reach for colored particles that decay into
jets plus missing transverse energy. For gluinos that decay directly or through
a one step cascade into the LSP and two jets, the mass range m_g < 205 GeV is
disfavored by the ATLAS searches, regardless of the mass of the LSP. In some
cases the coverage extends up to m_g ~ 295 GeV, already surpassing the
Tevatron's reach for compressed supersymmetry spectra.
