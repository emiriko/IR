We study nonlinear waves in Newton's cradle, a classical mechanical system
consisting of a chain of beads attached to linear pendula and interacting
nonlinearly via Hertz's contact forces. We formally derive a spatially discrete
modulation equation, for small amplitude nonlinear waves consisting of slow
modulations of time-periodic linear oscillations. The fully-nonlinear and
unilateral interactions between beads yield a nonstandard modulation equation
that we call the discrete p-Schroedinger (DpS) equation. It consists of a
spatial discretization of a generalized Schroedinger equation with p-Laplacian,
with fractional p>2 depending on the exponent of Hertz's contact force. We show
that the DpS equation admits explicit periodic travelling wave solutions, and
numerically find a plethora of standing wave solutions given by the orbits of a
discrete map, in particular spatially localized breather solutions. Using a
modified Lyapunov-Schmidt technique, we prove the existence of exact periodic
travelling waves in the chain of beads, close to the small amplitude modulated
waves given by the DpS equation. Using numerical simulations, we show that the
DpS equation captures several other important features of the dynamics in the
weakly nonlinear regime, namely modulational instabilities, the existence of
static and travelling breathers, and repulsive or attractive interactions of
these localized structures.
