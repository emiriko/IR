We present results from a numerical solution to the burning of neutron matter
inside a cold neutron star into stable (u,d,s) quark matter. Our method solves
hydrodynamical flow equations in 1D with neutrino emission from weak
equilibrating reactions, and strange quark diffusion across the burning front.
We also include entropy change due to heat released in forming the stable quark
phase. Our numerical results suggest burning front laminar speeds of 0.002-0.04
times the speed of light, much faster than previous estimates derived using
only a reactive-diffusive description. Analytic solutions to hydrodynamical
jump conditions with a temperature dependent equation of state agree very well
with our numerical findings for fluid velocities. The most important effect of
neutrino cooling is that the conversion front stalls at lower density (below
approximately 2 times saturation density). In a 2-dimensional setting, such
rapid speeds and neutrino cooling may allow for a flame wrinkle instability to
develop, possibly leading to detonation.
