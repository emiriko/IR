We present results based on new Chandra and multi-frequency radio
observations of the disturbed cool core cluster Abell 133. The diffuse gas has
a complex bird-like morphology, with a plume of emission extending from two
symmetric wing-like features, and capped with a filamentary radio relic. X-ray
observations indicate the presence of either high temperature gas or
non-thermal emission in the region of the relic. We find evidence for a weak
elliptical X-ray surface brightness edge surrounding the core, consistent with
a sloshing cold front. The plume is consistent with having formed due to uplift
by a buoyantly rising radio bubble, now seen as the radio relic. Our results
are inconsistent with the previous suggestion that the X-ray wings formed due
to the passage of a weak shock through the cool core. We instead conclude that
the wings are due to X-ray cavities formed by gas displacement by the radio
relic. The central cD galaxy contains two small-scale cold gas clumps that are
slightly offset from their optical and UV counterparts, suggestive of a
galaxy-galaxy merger event. On larger scales, there is evidence for cluster
substructure in both optical observations and the X-ray temperature map. We
suggest that Abell 133 has recently undergone a merger event with an
interloping subgroup, initiating gas sloshing in the core. We show that the
additional buoyant force from a passing subcluster can have a significant
effect on the rise trajectories of buoyant bubbles, although this effect alone
cannot fully explain the morphology of Abell 133. The radio observations reveal
a previously unreported background giant radio galaxy at z = 0.293, the
northern lobe of which overlies the radio relic in the core of Abell 133. A
rough estimate indicates that the contribution of this background lobe to the
total radio emission in the region of the relic is modest (< 13%). (Abridged)
