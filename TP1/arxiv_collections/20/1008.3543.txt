We investigate the ''spontaneous'' hyperon transverse polarization in
$e^+e^-$ annihilation and semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering processes as
a test of the universality of the naive-time-reversal-odd transverse momentum
dependent fragmentation functions. We find that universality implies definite
sign relations among various observables. This provides a unique opportunity to
study initial/final state interaction effects in the fragmentation process and
test the associated factorization.
