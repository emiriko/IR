The random matrix uniformly distributed over the set of all m-by-n matrices
over a finite field plays an important role in many branches of information
theory. In this paper a generalization of this random matrix, called k-good
random matrices, is studied. It is shown that a k-good random m-by-n matrix
with a distribution of minimum support size is uniformly distributed over a
maximum-rank-distance (MRD) code of minimum rank distance min{m,n}-k+1, and
vice versa. Further examples of k-good random matrices are derived from
homogeneous weights on matrix modules. Several applications of k-good random
matrices are given, establishing links with some well-known combinatorial
problems. Finally, the related combinatorial concept of a k-dense set of m-by-n
matrices is studied, identifying such sets as blocking sets with respect to
(m-k)-dimensional flats in a certain m-by-n matrix geometry and determining
their minimum size in special cases.
