We present simulations of initially stable isothermal clouds exposed to
ionizing radiation from a discrete external source, and identify the conditions
that lead to radiatively driven implosion and star formation. We use the
Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics code SEREN (Hubber et al. 2010) and the
HEALPix-based photoionization algorithm described in Bisbas et al. (2009). We
find that the incident ionizing flux is the critical parameter determining the
evolution: high fluxes simply disperse the cloud, whereas low fluxes trigger
star formation. We find a clear connection between the intensity of the
incident flux and the parameters of star formation.
