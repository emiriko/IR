We investigated 94GHz millimeter wave (MMW) scattering from neutral and
charged water mist produced in the laboratory with an ultrasonic atomizer.
Diffusion charging of the mist was accomplished with a negative ion generator
(NIG). We observed increased forward and backscattering of MMW from charged
mist, as compared to MMW scattering from an uncharged mist. In order to
interpret the experimental results, we developed a model based on classical
electrodynamics theory of scattering from a dielectric sphere with
diffusion-deposited mobile surface charge. In this approach, scattering and
extinction cross-sections are calculated for a charged Rayleigh particle with
effective dielectric constant consisting of the volume dielectric function of
the neutral sphere and surface dielectric function due to the oscillation of
the surface charge in the presence of applied electric field. For small
droplets with (radius smaller than 100nm), this model predicts increased MMW
scattering from charged mist, which is qualitatively consistent with the
experimental observations. The objective of this work is to develop indirect
remote sensing of radioactive gases via their charging action on atmospheric
humid air.
