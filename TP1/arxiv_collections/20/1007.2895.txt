It has been known for a while that a nonlinear equation driven by singular
noise must be interpreted in the re-normalized, or Wick, form. For the
stochastic Burgers equation, Wick nonlinearity forces the solution to be a
generalized process no matter how regular the random perturbation is, whence
the curse. On the other hand, certain multiplicative random perturbations of
the deterministic Burgers equation can only be interpreted in the Wick form,
whence the cure. The analysis is based on the study of the coefficients of the
chaos expansion of the solution at different stochastic scales.
