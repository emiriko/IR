Searches for possible new quantum phases and classifications of quantum
phases have been central problems in physics. Yet, they are indeed challenging
problems due to the computational difficulties in analyzing quantum many-body
systems and the lack of a general framework for classifications. While
frustration-free Hamiltonians, which appear as fixed point Hamiltonians of
renormalization group transformations, may serve as representatives of quantum
phases, it is still difficult to analyze and classify quantum phases of
arbitrary frustration-free Hamiltonians exhaustively. Here, we address these
problems by sharpening our considerations to a certain subclass of
frustration-free Hamiltonians, called stabilizer Hamiltonians, which have been
actively studied in quantum information science. We propose a model of
frustration-free Hamiltonians which covers a large class of physically
realistic stabilizer Hamiltonians, constrained to only three physical
conditions; the locality of interaction terms, translation symmetries and scale
symmetries, meaning that the number of ground states does not grow with the
system size. We show that quantum phases arising in two-dimensional models can
be classified exactly through certain quantum coding theoretical operators,
called logical operators, by proving that two models with topologically
distinct shapes of logical operators are always separated by quantum phase
transitions.
