This is a survey on the programming languages: C++, JavaScript, AspectJ, C#,
Haskell, Java, PHP, Scala, Scheme, and BPEL. Our survey work involves a
comparative study of these ten programming languages with respect to the
following criteria: secure programming practices, web application development,
web service composition, OOP-based abstractions, reflection, aspect
orientation, functional programming, declarative programming, batch scripting,
and UI prototyping. We study these languages in the context of the above
mentioned criteria and the level of support they provide for each one of them.
