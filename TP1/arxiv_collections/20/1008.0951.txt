We have extended previous results on the threshold expansion of the gluon
coefficient function for the charm contribution to the deep-inelastic structure
function F_2 by deriving all threshold-enhanced contributions at the
next-to-next-to-leading order. The size of these corrections is briefly
illustrated, and a first step towards extending this improvement to more
differential charm-production cross sections is presented.
