A method of using a gravitational UCN spectrometer to search for long-range
forces between neutrons and atoms is proposed. The constraints on the strength
of long-range forces within the range of 10-10 - 10-4 cm can be obtained from
the experiments on measurements of the total cross section of interaction of
UCN with atoms of the noble gases (He, Ne, Ar, Kr) and the data on the coherent
neutron scattering length of the nucleus. The first result of such an analysis
is presented. Further prospect of UCN method is discussed.
