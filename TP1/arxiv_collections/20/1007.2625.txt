A Fermi gas of atoms with resonant interactions is predicted to obey
universal hydrodynamics, where the shear viscosity and other transport
coefficients are universal functions of the density and temperature. At low
temperatures, the viscosity has a universal quantum scale $\hbar n$ where $n$
is the density, while at high temperatures the natural scale is $p_T^3/\hbar^2$
where $p_T$ is the thermal momentum. We employ breathing mode damping to
measure the shear viscosity at low temperature. At high temperature $T$, we
employ anisotropic expansion of the cloud to find the viscosity, which exhibits
precise $T^{3/2}$ scaling. In both experiments, universal hydrodynamic
equations including friction and heating are used to extract the viscosity. We
estimate the ratio of the shear viscosity to the entropy density and compare to
that of a perfect fluid.
