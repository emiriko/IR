In this article we present a neutron diffraction in-situ study of the thermal
evolution and high-temperature structure of layered cobaltites Y(Ba, Sr)Co2
O5+{\delta}. Neutron thermodiffractograms and magnetic susceptibility
measurements are reported in the temperature range 20 K <= T <= 570 K, as well
as high resolution neutron diffraction experiments at selected temperatures.
Starting from the as-synthesized samples with {\delta} ~ 0.5, we show that the
room temperature phases remain stable up to 550 K, where they start loosing
oxygen and transform to a vacancy-disordered "112" structure with tetragonal
symmetry. Our results also show how the so-called "122" structure can be
stabilized at high temperature (around 450 K) in a sample in which the addition
of Sr at the Ba site had suppressed its formation. In addition, we present the
structural and magnetic properties of the resulting samples with a new oxygen
content {\delta} ~ 0.25 in the temperature range 20 K <= T <= 300 K.
