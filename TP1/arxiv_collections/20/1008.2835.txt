In this paper, we propose a new Extended-p+ Stepped Gate (ESG) thin film SOI
LDMOS with an extended-p+ region beneath the source and a stepped gate
structure in the drift region of the LDMOS. The hole current generated due to
impact ionization is now collected from an n+p+ junction instead of an n+p
junction thus delaying the parasitic BJT action. The stepped gate structure
enhances RESURF in the drift region, and minimizes the gate-drain capacitance.
Based on two-dimensional simulation results, we show that the ESG LDMOS
exhibits approximately 63% improvement in breakdown voltage, 38% improvement in
on-resistance, 11% improvement in peak transconductance, 18% improvement in
switching speed and 63% reduction in gate-drain charge density compared with
the conventional LDMOS with a field plate.
