Computational chemistry is used here to build a set of carbonaceous
structures whose combined spectra approximately mimic typical UIB (Unidentified
Infrared Band) spectra. A large number of relatively small hydrocarbon
structures, containing traces of heteroatoms (oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur) were
considered, including aliphatic chains, compact and concatenated hexagonal and
pentagonal rings. Their ir (infrared) spectra were computed using standard
chemistry software. Those which exhibited at least a few lines falling within
one of the UIBs, and no significantly strong line outside the observed bands,
were retained: in all 35 structures, grouped in 8 families and totalling about
6000 vibrational modes together. Each family exhibits a characteristically
different spectrum. Guided by the IRS spectra of the Spitzer satellite, each of
the 8 families was given a weight, which was tailored so that the concatenation
of all 35 weighted spectra resembled UIB spectra. A typical chemical
composition is found to be C:H:O:N:S=1:1.15:0.064:0.0026:0.013. The present
procedure allows each structural family to be preferentially assigned to an
observed UIB, which helps figuring out the structure of interstellar dust. The
essential role of heteroatoms is apparent.
