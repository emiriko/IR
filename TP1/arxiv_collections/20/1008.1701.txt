In this paper we define Brownian local time as the almost sure limit of the
local times of a nested sequence of simple, symmetric random walks. The limit
is jointly continuous in $(t,x)$. The rate of convergence is $n^{\frac14} (\log
n)^{\frac34}$ that is close to the best possible. The tools we apply are almost
exclusively from elementary probability theory.
