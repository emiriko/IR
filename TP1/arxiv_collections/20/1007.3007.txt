In this paper we deal with the cubic Schr\"odinger system $ -\Delta u_i =
\sum_{j=1}^n \beta_{ij}u_j^2 u_i$, $u_1,\dots,u_n \geq 0$ in $\mathbb{R}^N
(N\leq 3)$, where $\beta=(\beta_{i,j})_{ij}$ is a symmetric matrix with real
coefficients and $\beta_{ii}\geq 0$ for every $i=1,\ldots,n$. We analyse the
existence and nonexistence of nontrivial solutions in connection with the
properties of the matrix $\beta$, and provide a complete characterization in
dimensions $N=1,2$. Extensions to more general power-type nonlinearities are
given.
