By going beyond Hubbard Hamiltonian we reflected correlation effects
accurately in the wavefunctions of H2. Using ab initio e-e interaction
parameters resulted maximally entangled ground and third excited states. We
assigned this maximally entangled character to the nonmagnetic (S=0) property
of these states and also the minimally entangled character of the first excited
states to its magnetic property. By switching on a magnetic field an entangled
state with Sz = 0 can be extracted from a minimally entangled degenerate
magnetic state. We suggest that presence of a moderate correlated system and a
non-magnetic (Sz = 0) electronic state can be two criteria for finding
maximally entangled electronic states in a realistic molecular system.
