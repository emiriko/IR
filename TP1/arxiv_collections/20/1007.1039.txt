We proved the explicit formulas in Laplace transform of the hitting times for
the birth and death processes on a denumerable state space with $\ift$ the exit
or entrance boundary. This extends the well known Keilson's theorem from finite
state space to infinite state space.
  We also apply these formulas to the fastest strong stationary time for
strongly ergodic birth and death processes, and obtain the explicit convergence
rate in separation.
