We study the low energy spin excitations of zigzag graphene nanoribbons of
varying width. We find their energy dispersion at small wave vector to be
dominated by antiferromagnetic correlations between the ribbon's edges, in
accrodance with previous calculations. We point out that spin wave lifetimes
are very long due to the semi-conducting nature of the electrically neutral
nanoribbons. However, application of very modest gate voltages cause a
discontinuous transition to a regime of finite spin wave lifetime. By further
increasing doping the ferromagnetic alignments along the edge become unstable
against transverse spin fluctuations. This makes the experimental detection of
ferromagnetism is this class of systems very delicate, and poses a difficult
challenge to the possible uses of these nanoribbons as basis for spintronic
devices.
