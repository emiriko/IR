Magnetotransport measurements on a high-mobility electron bilayer system
formed in a wide GaAs quantum well reveal vanishing dissipative resistance
under continuous microwave irradiation. Profound zero-resistance states (ZRS)
appear even in the presence of additional intersubband scattering of electrons.
We study the dependence of photoresistance on frequency, microwave power. and
temperature. Experimental results are compared with a theory demonstrating that
the conditions for absolute negative resistivity correlate with the appearance
of ZRS.
