Since autumn 2008 an L-band 7-Feed-Array is operated for astronomical science
at the 100-m radio telescope at Effelsberg. This receiver is used to perform an
unbiased, fully sampled HI survey of the whole northern hemisphere observing
both the galactic and extragalactic sky in parallel - the Effelsberg-Bonn HI
survey (EBHIS). We present first results based on the Milky Way data. Up to now
two larger coherent regions were mapped each covering about 2000 square
degrees. One of these fields covers the northern part of the high-velocity
cloud complex GCN. With the better angular resolution of the EBHIS we resolve
the previously detected clouds into isolated compact clumps and find a
linewidth-radial velocity relation giving hints on an interaction of accreting
material with the Milky Way halo.
