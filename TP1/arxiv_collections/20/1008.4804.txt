We study numerically the density of optical states (DOS) in two-dimensional
photonic structures with short-range positional order, and observe a clear
transition from polycrystalline to amorphous photonic systems. In polycrystals,
photonic band gaps (PBGs) are formed within individual do- mains, which leads
to a depletion of the DOS similar to that in periodic structures. In amorphous
photonic media, the domain sizes are too small to form PBGs, thus the depletion
of the DOS is weakened significantly. The critical domain size that separates
the polycrystalline and amorphous regimes is determined by the attenuation
length of Bragg scattering, which depends not only on the degree of positional
order but also the refractive index contrast of the photonic material. Even
with relatively low refractive index contrast, we find that modest short-range
positional order in photonic structures enhances light confinement via
collective scattering and interference.
