The task of compressing classical information in the one-shot scenario is
studied in the setting where the decompressor additionally has access to some
given quantum side information. In this hybrid classical-quantum version of the
famous Slepian-Wolf problem, the smooth max-entropy is found to govern the
number of bits into which classical information can be compressed so that it
can be reliably recovered from the compressed version and quantum side
information. Combining this result with known results on privacy amplification
then yields bounds on the amount of common randomness and secret key that can
be recovered in one-shot from hybrid classical-quantum systems using one-way
classical communication.
