Dickson's Lemma is a simple yet powerful tool widely used in termination
proofs, especially when dealing with counters or related data structures.
However, most computer scientists do not know how to derive complexity upper
bounds from such termination proofs, and the existing literature is not very
helpful in these matters.
  We propose a new analysis of the length of bad sequences over (N^k,\leq) and
explain how one may derive complexity upper bounds from termination proofs. Our
upper bounds improve earlier results and are essentially tight.
