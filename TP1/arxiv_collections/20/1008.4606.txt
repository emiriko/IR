The convergence of the Rayleigh-Ritz method with nonlinear parameters
optimized through minimization of the trace of the truncated matrix is
demonstrated by a comparison with analytically known eigenstates of various
quasi-solvable systems. We show that the basis of the harmonic oscillator
eigenfunctions with optimized frequency ? enables determination of boundstate
energies of one-dimensional oscillators to an arbitrary accuracy, even in the
case of highly anharmonic multi-well potentials. The same is true in the
spherically symmetric case of V (r) = {\omega}2r2 2 + {\lambda}rk, if k > 0.
For spiked oscillators with k < -1, the basis of the pseudoharmonic oscillator
eigenfunctions with two parameters ? and {\gamma} is more suitable, and
optimization of the latter appears crucial for a precise determination of the
spectrum.
