Molecular dynamics simulations are used to investigate the effects of
deformation on the segmental dynamics in an aging polymer glass. Individual
particle trajectories are decomposed into a series of discontinuous hops, from
which we obtain the full distribution of relaxation times and displacements
under three deformation protocols: step stress (creep), step strain, and
constant strain rate deformation. As in experiments, the dynamics can be
accelerated by several orders of magnitude during deformation, and the history
dependence is entirely erased during yield (mechanical rejuvenation). Aging can
be explained as a result of the long tails in the relaxation time distribution
of the glass, and similarly, mechanical rejuvenation is understood through the
observed narrowing of this distribution during yield. Although the relaxation
time distributions under deformation are highly protocol specific, in each case
they may be described by a universal acceleration factor that depends only on
the strain.
