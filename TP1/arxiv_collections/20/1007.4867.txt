We examine quantum statistics of optical photons emitted from atomic
ensembles which are classically driven and simultaneously coupled to a
two-level atom via microwave photon exchange. Quantum statistics and
correlations are analyzed by calculating second order coherence degree, von
Neumann entropy, spin squeezing for multi-particle entanglement, as well as
genuine two and three-mode entanglement parameters for steady state and
non-equilibrium situations. Coherent transfer of population between the
radiation modes and quantum state mapping between the two-level atom and the
optical modes are discussed. A potential experimental realization of the
theoretical results in a superconducting coplanar waveguide resonator
containing diamond crystals with Nitrogen-Vacancy color centers and a
superconducting artificial two-level atom is discussed.
