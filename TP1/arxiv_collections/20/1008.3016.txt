In this letter we discuss how the short channel behavior in sub 100 nm
channel range can be improved by inducing a step surface potential profile at
the back gate of an asymmetrical double gate (DG) Silicon-On-Insulator (SOI)
Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect- Transistor (MOSFET) in which the front
gate consists of two materials with different work functions.
