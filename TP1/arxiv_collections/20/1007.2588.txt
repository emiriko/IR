Since, in general, non-orthogonal states cannot be cloned, any eavesdropping
attempt in a Quantum Communication scheme using non-orthogonal states as
carriers of information introduces some errors in the transmission, leading to
the possibility of detecting the spy. Usually, orthogonal states are not used
in Quantum Cryptography schemes since they can be faithfully cloned without
altering the transmitted data. Nevertheless, L. Goldberg and L. Vaidman [\prl
75 (1995) 1239] proposed a protocol in which, even if the data exchange is
realized using two orthogonal states, any attempt to eavesdrop is detectable by
the legal users. In this scheme the orthogonal states are superpositions of two
localized wave packets travelling along separate channels. Here we present an
experiment realizing this scheme.
