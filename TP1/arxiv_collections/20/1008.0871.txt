We examine the physical properties and evolutionary stages of a sample of 17
clumps within 8 Infrared Dark Clouds (IRDCs) by combining existing infrared,
millimeter, and radio data with new Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey (BGPS) 1.1 mm
data, VLA radio continuum data, and HHT dense gas (HCO+ and N2H+) spectroscopic
data. We combine literature studies of star formation tracers and dust
temperatures within IRDCs with our search for ultra-compact (UC) HII regions to
discuss a possible evolutionary sequence for IRDC clumps. In addition, we
perform an analysis of mass tracers in IRDCs and find that 8 micron extinction
masses and 1.1 mm Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey (BGPS) masses are complementary
mass tracers in IRDCs except for the most active clumps (notably those
containing UCHII regions), for which both mass tracers suffer biases. We find
that the measured virial masses in IRDC clumps are uniformly higher than the
measured dust continuum masses on the scale of ~1 pc. We use 13CO, HCO+, and
N2H+ to study the molecular gas properties of IRDCs and do not see any evidence
of chemical differentiation between hot and cold clumps on the scale of ~1 pc.
However, both HCO+ and N2H+ are brighter in active clumps, due to an increase
in temperature and/or density. We report the identification of four UCHII
regions embedded within IRDC clumps and find that UCHII regions are associated
with bright (>1 Jy) 24 micron point sources, and that the brightest UCHII
regions are associated with "diffuse red clumps" (an extended enhancement at 8
micron). The broad stages of the discussed evolutionary sequence (from a
quiescent clump to an embedded HII region) are supported by literature dust
temperature estimates; however, no sequential nature can be inferred between
the individual star formation tracers.
