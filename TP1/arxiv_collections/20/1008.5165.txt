In 2010, Weixiao Shen pointed out to us that the proof of Theorem 3.2 of our
2002 paper in Ann ENS was flawed, and he kindly provided an argument to fix
this proof. (We do not make claims on the lower bounds for the stationary
density anymore.) In 2017, Wael Bahsoun, Christopher Bose, and Marks Ruziboev
pointed out to us that the proof of Corollary 5.2 in the same paper is flawed.
We explain how to recover Corollary 5.2 up to replacing the set $M'_q$ on p. 93
by a slightly smaller set (this does not affect the rest of the paper).
