We show that the sets in a family with finite VC dimension can be uniformly
approximated within a given error by a finite partition. Immediate corollaries
include the fact that VC classes have finite bracketing numbers, satisfy
uniform laws of averages under strong dependence, and exhibit uniform mixing.
Our results are based on recent work concerning uniform laws of averages for VC
classes under ergodic sampling.
