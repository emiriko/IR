Our team is carrying out a multi-year observing program to directly image and
characterize young extrasolar planets using the Near-Infrared Coronagraphic
Imager (NICI) on the Gemini-South 8.1-meter telescope. NICI is the first
instrument on a large telescope designed from the outset for high-contrast
imaging, comprising a high-performance curvature adaptive optics system with a
simultaneous dual-channel coronagraphic imager. Combined with state-of-the-art
observing methods and data processing, NICI typically achieves ~2 magnitudes
better contrast compared to previous ground-based or space-based programs, at
separations inside of ~2 arcsec. In preparation for the Campaign, we carried
out efforts to identify previously unrecognized young stars, to rigorously
construct our observing strategy, and to optimize the combination of angular
and spectral differential imaging. The Planet-Finding Campaign is in its second
year, with first-epoch imaging of 174 stars already obtained out of a total
sample of 300 stars. We describe the Campaign's goals, design, implementation,
performance, and preliminary results. The NICI Campaign represents the largest
and most sensitive imaging survey to date for massive (~1 Mjup) planets around
other stars. Upon completion, the Campaign will establish the best measurements
to date on the properties of young gas-giant planets at ~5-10 AU separations.
Finally, Campaign discoveries will be well-suited to long-term orbital
monitoring and detailed spectrophotometric followup with next-generation
planet-finding instruments.
