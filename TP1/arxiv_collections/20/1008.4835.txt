The 3+1 spacetime formulation of general relativity is used to investigate
the transverse waves propagating in a plasma influenced by the gravitational
field of Reissner-Nordstrom black hole, as explained in an earlier paper, to
take account of relativistic effects due to the event horizon. Here, a local
approximation is used to investigate the one-dimensional radial propagation of
longitudinal waves. We derive the dispersion relation for these waves and solve
it numerically for the wave number k.
