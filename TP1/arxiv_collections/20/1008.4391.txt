The present paper deals with mathematical models of heat and moisture
transport in layered building envelopes. The study of such processes generates
a system of two doubly nonlinear evolution partial differential equations with
appropriate initial and boundary conditions. The existence of the strong
solution in two dimensions on a (short) time interval is proven. The proof
rests on regularity results for elliptic transmission problem for isotropic
composite-like materials.
