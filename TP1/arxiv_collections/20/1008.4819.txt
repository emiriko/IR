The microscopic definition for the Cauchy stress tensor has been examined in
the past from many different perspectives. This has led to different
expressions for the stress tensor and consequently the "correct" definition has
been a subject of debate and controversy. In this work, a unified framework is
set up in which all existing definitions can be derived, thus establishing the
connections between them. The framework is based on the non-equilibrium
statistical mechanics procedure introduced by Irving, Kirkwood and Noll,
followed by spatial averaging. The Irving--Kirkwood--Noll procedure is extended
to multi-body potentials with continuously differentiable extensions and
generalized to non-straight bonds, which may be important for particles with
internal structure. Connections between this approach and the direct spatial
averaging approach of Murdoch and Hardy are discussed and the Murdoch--Hardy
procedure is systematized. Possible sources of non-uniqueness of the stress
tensor, resulting separately from both procedures, are identified and
addressed. Numerical experiments using molecular dynamics and lattice statics
are conducted to examine the behavior of the resulting stress definitions
including their convergence with the spatial averaging domain size and their
symmetry properties.
