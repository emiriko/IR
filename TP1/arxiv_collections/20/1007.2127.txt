We utilize quantum discord to charecterize the correlation present in
Buzek-Hillery quantum copying machine \cite{bh} (not necessarily universal
quantum cloning machine). In other words we quantify the correlation present
beetween the original and the replicated copy of the quantum state obtained at
the outport port, Interestingly, we find some domain of the machine parameter,
for which the quantum disord is non negative even in the mere absence of
entanglement. These non zero values of the quantum discord is a strong
signature for the presence of non classical correlations. This is one step
forward evidence in the support of the fact that quantum discord and
entanglement are not synonymous.
