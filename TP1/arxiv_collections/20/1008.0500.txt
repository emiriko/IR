The paper is proposing a survey of a region in Sudan, the Bayuda desert,
using the satellite images as obtained from Google Maps. The images reveal the
ring granitic structure of the region enclosed by a bend of river Nile. To
enhance the features of the landform, images are processed with a method based
on fractional calculus, able to increase the rendering of edges without
deteriorating the overall quality of images. Besides the ringed structure of
the region, a huge crater-like structure with a diameter of 10 km is evidenced.
