We continue our previous work on the potential short-term influence of a
gamma ray bursts on Earth's biosphere, focusing on the only important
short-term effect on life: the ultraviolet flash which occurs as a result of
the retransmission of the {\gamma} radiation through the atmosphere. Thus, in
this work we calculate the ultraviolet irradiances penetrating the first
hundred meters of the water column, for Jerlov's ocean water types I, II and
III. Then we estimate the UV flash potential for photosynthesis inhibition,
showing that it can be important in a considerable part of the water column
with light enough for photosynthesis to be done, the so called photic zone.
