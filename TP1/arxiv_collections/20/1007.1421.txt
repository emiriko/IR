We show that self-annihilating neutralino WIMP dark matter accreted onto
neutron stars may provide a mechanism to seed compact objects with long-lived
lumps of strange quark matter, or strangelets, for WIMP masses above a few GeV.
This effect may trigger a conversion of most of the star into a strange star.
We use an energy estimate for the long-lived strangelet based on the Fermi gas
model combined with the MIT bag model to set a new limit on the possible values
of the WIMP mass that can be especially relevant for subdominant species of
massive neutralinos.
