For an affine algebra of nonexceptional type in the large rank we show the
fermionic formula depends only on the attachment of the node 0 of the Dynkin
diagram to the rest, and the fermionic formula of not type A can be expressed
as a sum of that of type A with Littlewood-Richardson coefficients. Combining
this result with math.CO/9901037 and arXiv:1002.3715 we settle the X=M
conjecture under the large rank hypothesis.
