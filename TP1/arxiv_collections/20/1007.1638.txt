We present a long (100 ks) Suzaku observation of one of the X-ray brightest
AGN, MCG+8-11-11. These data were complemented with the 54-month Swift BAT
spectrum, allowing us to perform a broad-band fit in the 0.6-150 keV range. The
fits performed in the 0.6-10 keV band give consistent results with respect to a
previous XMM-Newton observation, i.e. the lack of a soft excess, warm
absorption along the line of sight, a large Compton reflection component (R~1)
and the absence of a relativistic component of the neutral iron K$\alpha$
emission line. However, when the PIN and Swift BAT data are included, the
reflection amount drops significantly (R~0.2-0.3), and a relativistic iron line
is required, the latter confirmed by a phenomenological analysis in a
restricted energy band (3-10 keV). When a self-consistent model is applied to
the whole broadband data, the observed reflection component appears to be all
associated to the relativistic component of the iron K$\alpha$ line. The
resulting scenario, though strongly model-dependent, requires that all the
reprocessing spectral components from Compton-thick material must be associated
to the accretion disc, and no evidence for the classical pc-scale torus is
found. The narrow core of the neutral iron K$\alpha$ line is therefore produced
in a Compton-thin material, like the BLR, similarly to what found in another
Seyfert galaxy, NGC7213, but with the notable difference that MCG+8-11-11
presents spectral signatures from an accretion disc. The very low accretion
rate of NGC7213 could explain the lack of relativistic signatures in its
spectrum, but the absence of the torus in both sources is more difficult to
explain, since their luminosities are comparable, and their accretion rates are
completely different.
