In this paper a novel device aimed at controlling the mechanical vibrations
of plates by means of a set of electrically-interconnected piezoelectric
actuators is described. The actuators are embedded uniformly in the plate
wherein they connect every node of an electric network to ground, thus playing
the two-fold role of capacitive element in the electric network and of couple
suppliers. A mathematical model is introduced to describe the propagation of
electro-mechanical waves in the device; its validity is restricted to the case
of wave-forms with wave-length greater than the dimension of the piezoelectric
actuators used. A self-resonance criterion is established which assures the
possibility of electro-mechanical energy exchange. Finally the problem of
vibration control in simply supported and clamped plates is addressed; the
optimal net-impedance is determined. The results indicate that the proposed
device can improve the performances of piezoelectric actuation
