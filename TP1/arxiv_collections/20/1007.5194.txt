In this paper, we investigate the role of a high-frequency magnetic field in
the resonant behavior displayed by a spin-$1/2$ particle under the influence of
a rotating magnetic field. We propose two alternative methods for analyzing the
system dynamics, namely, the averaging method and the multiple scale method.
The analytical results achieved by applying these two methods are compared with
those obtained from the numerical solution of the Schr\"odinger equation. This
comparison leads to the conclusion that the multiple scale method provides a
better understanding of the system dynamics than the averaging method. In
particular, the averaging method predicts the complete destruction of the
resonant behavior by an appropriate choice of the parameter values of the
high-frequency magnetic field. This conclusion is disproved both by the
numerical results, and also by the results obtained from the multiple scale
method.
