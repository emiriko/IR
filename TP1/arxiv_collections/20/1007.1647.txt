In the years 2002-2004, the Learning by Design\texttrademark group at Georgia
Tech conducted an investigation of the development of qualitative Newtonian
concepts as a function of time. I describe the classroom context and method for
this investigation, involving the coordination of multiple measures including
diagnostic quizzes, structured interviews, ethnographic observations in class
and performance assessments. This paper specifically concerns the results from
the diagnostic quizzes, relying on other measures as supporting evidence. I
present convincing evidence of conceptual gains from that data. I also show
that when looked at in more detail, there is a clear non-monotonic conceptual
development process in which there is a period of apparent regression of
understanding following apparent satisfactory understanding. I consider prior
work on this effect from developmental psychology, and propose a hypothesis to
explain its presence in this data. I then consider how cognitive models
converge on a similar explanation, and in the process contrast this
interpretation with the currently extant interpretation of related work in
terms of an interference effect. I close with consideration of implications of
this effect for both pedagogical design and research practice.
