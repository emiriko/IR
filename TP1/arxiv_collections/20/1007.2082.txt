Looking at rational solid-fluid mixture theories in the context of their
biomechanical perspectives, this work aims at proposing a two-scale
constitutive theory of a poroelastic solid infused with an inviscid
compressible fluid. The propagation of steady-state harmonic plane waves in
unbounded media is investigated in both cases of unconstrained solid-fluid
mixtures and fluid-saturated poroelastic solids. Relevant effects on the
resulting characteristic speed of longitudinal and transverse elastic waves,
due to the constitutive parameters introduced, are finally highlighted and
discussed.
