We present a new approach to the reduction of one-loop amplitudes obtained by
reconstructing the tensorial expression of the scattering amplitudes. The
reconstruction is performed at the integrand level by means of a sampling in
the integration momentum. There are several interesting applications of this
novel method within existing techniques for the reduction of one-loop multi-leg
amplitudes: to deal with numerically unstable points, such as in the vicinity
of a vanishing Gram determinant; to allow for a sampling of the numerator
function based on real values of the integration momentum; to optimize the
numerical reduction in the case of long expressions for the numerator
functions.
