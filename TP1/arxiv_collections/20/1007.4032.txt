Photomechanical actuation is demonstrated in two coupled liquid crystal
elastomer photomechanical optical devices (PODs) acting in series. The response
function of an individual POD is characterized and used to predict the temporal
response of the coupled system. The predicted coupled-system response agrees
with the experiment for several waveforms and frequencies, suggesting that
large-scale integration of photomechanical devices is possible.
