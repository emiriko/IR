In this paper, we investigate the effects of a classical gravitational field
on the dynamical behaviour of nonlinear atom-field interaction within the
framework of the f-deformed Jaynes-Cummings model. For this purpose, we first
introduce a set of new atomic operators obeying an f-deformed su(2) algebraic
structure to derive an effective Hamiltonian for the system under
consideration. Then by solving the Schrodinger equation in the interaction
picture and considering certain initial quantum states for the atomic and
radiation subsystems, we analyze the influence of gravity on the temporal
evolution of the atomic population inversion, atomic dipole squeezing, atomic
momentum diffusion, photon counting statistics, and deformed quadrature
squeezing of the radiation field.
