We study by means of numerical simulations the velocity reversal model, a
one-dimensional mechanical model of heat transport introduced in 1985 by Ianiro
and Lebowitz. Our numerical results indicate that this model, although it does
not conserve momentum, exhibits an anomalous Fourier's law similar to the ones
previously observed in momentum-conserving models. This is contrary to what is
obtained from the solution of the Boltzmann equation (BE) for this system. The
pair correlation velocity field also looks very different from the correlations
usually seen in diffusive systems, and shares some similarity with those of
momentum-conserving heat transport models.
