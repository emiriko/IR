The hydrodynamic forces exerted by a fluid on small isolated rigid spherical
particles are usually well described by the Maxey-Riley (MR) equation. The most
time-consuming contribution in the MR equation is the Basset history force
which is a well-known problem for many-particle simulations in turbulence. In
this paper a novel numerical approach is proposed for the computation of the
Basset history force based on the use of exponential functions to approximate
the tail of the Basset force kernel. Typically, this approach not only
decreases the cpu time and memory requirements for the Basset force computation
by more than an order of magnitude, but also increases the accuracy by an order
of magnitude. The method has a temporal accuracy of O(Delta t^2) which is a
substantial improvement compared to methods available in the literature.
Furthermore, the method is partially implicit in order to increase stability of
the computation. Traditional methods for the calculation of the Basset history
force can influence statistical properties of the particles in isotropic
turbulence, which is due to the error made by approximating the Basset force
and the limited number of particles that can be tracked with classical methods.
The new method turns out to provide more reliable statistical data.
