We investigate the thermonuclear bursting behaviour of IGR J17473-2721, an
X-ray transient that in 2008 underwent a six month long outburst, starting
(unusually) with an X-ray burst. We detected a total of 57 thermonuclear bursts
throughout the outburst with AGILE, Swift, RXTE, and INTEGRAL. The wide range
of inferred accretion rates (between <1% and about 20% of the Eddington
accretion rate m-dot_Edd) spanned during the outburst allows us to study
changes in the nuclear burning processes and to identify up to seven different
phases. The burst rate increased gradually with the accretion rate until it
dropped (at a persistent flux corresponding to about 15% of m-dot_Edd) a few
days before the outburst peak, after which bursts were not detected for a
month. As the persistent emission subsequently decreased, the bursting activity
resumed with a much lower rate than during the outburst rise. This hysteresis
may arise from the thermal effect of the accretion on the surface nuclear
burning processes, and the timescale is roughly consistent with that expected
for the neutron star crust thermal response. On the other hand, an undetected
superburst, occurring within a data gap near the outburst peak, could have
produced a similar quenching of burst activity.
