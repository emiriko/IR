In this paper, weak symmetries of the Benjamin-Bona-Mahony (BBM) equation
have been investigated. Indeed, this method has been performed by applying the
non-classical symmetries of the BBM equation and the infinitesimal generators
of the classical symmetry algebra of the KdV equation as the starting
constraints. Similarity reduced equations as well as some exact solutions of
the BBM equation are obtained via this method.
