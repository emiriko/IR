In this note we give semiclassical consideration of the role of pulse
duration in observation of local field effects in the regime of optical
switching. We show that the main parameter governing local field influence is
the ratio of peak Rabi frequency corresponding to medium inversion and Lorentz
frequency of the medium. To obtain significant local field effect, this
parameter should be near unity that is valid only for long enough pulses. We
also discuss the role of relaxation and pulse shape in this processes.
