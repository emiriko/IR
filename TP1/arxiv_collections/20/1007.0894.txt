The antiferromagnetic domain structure of a multiferroic has been
investigated in the presence of a ferroelectric domain structure. It has been
demonstrated that an inhomogeneous magnetoelectric (flexomagnetoelectric)
interaction leads to pinning of antiferromagnetic domain walls at the walls of
the ferroelectric domains and to a change in the structure of antiferromagnetic
domain walls.
