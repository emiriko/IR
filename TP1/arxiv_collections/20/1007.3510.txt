We trace the tidal Stream of the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy (Sgr
dSph) using Red Clump stars from the catalog of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey -
Data Release 6, in the range 150{\deg} < RA < 220{\deg}, corresponding to the
range of orbital azimuth 220{\deg} < Lambda < 290{\deg}. Substructures along
the line of sight are identified as significant peaks in the differential star
count profiles (SCP) of candidate Red Clump stars. A proper modeling of the
SCPs allows us to obtain: (a) <10% accurate, purely differential distances with
respect to the main body of Sgr, (b) estimates of the FWHM along the line of
sight, and (c) estimates of the local density, for each detected substructure.
In the range 255{\deg} < Lambda < 290{\deg} we cleanly and continuously trace
various coherent structures that can be ascribed to the Stream, in particular:
the well known northern portion of the leading arm, running from d~43 kpc at
Lambda ~ 290{\deg} to d ~ 30 kpc at Lambda ~ 255{\deg}, and a more nearby
coherent series of detections lying at constant distance d ~ 25 kpc, that can
be identified with a wrap of the trailing arm. The latter structure, predicted
by several models of the disruption of Sgr dSph, was never traced before;
comparison with existing models indicates that the difference in distance
between these portions of the leading and trailing arms may provide a powerful
tool to discriminate between theoretical models assuming different shapes of
the Galactic potential. A further, more distant wrap in the same portion of the
sky is detected only along a couple of lines of sight.[abridged]
