In a recent paper [arXiv:0901.0790], we showed that there is a neat geometric
interpretation of two flavor neutrino oscillation formulae, and that the
geometric phase involved in the physics of oscillations is restricted to be
topological as long as CP is conserved. This paper has been criticised by
Bhandari [arXiv:1006.5935]. In the present note, we show that the criticisms
are not valid and only reflect his failure to understand some crucial points.
