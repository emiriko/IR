We investigate if the visual representation of vectors can affect which
methods students use to add them. We gave students one of four questions with
different graphical representations, asking students to add the same two
vectors. For students in an algebra-based class the arrangement of the vectors
had a statistically significant effect on the vector addition method chosen
while the addition or removal of a grid did not.
