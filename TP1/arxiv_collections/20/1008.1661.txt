We investigate the nondeterministic state complexity of basic operations for
suffix-free regular languages. The nondeterministic state complexity of an
operation is the number of states that are necessary and sufficient in the
worst-case for a minimal nondeterministic finite-state automaton that accepts
the language obtained from the operation. We consider basic operations
(catenation, union, intersection, Kleene star, reversal and complementation)
and establish matching upper and lower bounds for each operation. In the case
of complementation the upper and lower bounds differ by an additive constant of
two.
