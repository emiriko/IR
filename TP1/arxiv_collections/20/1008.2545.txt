Results are presented for a Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera for
Surveys high-resolution imaging campaign of 90 white dwarfs with known or
suspected low mass stellar and substellar companions. Of the 72 targets which
remain candidate and confirmed white dwarfs with near-infrared excess, 43 are
spatially resolved into two or more components, and a total of 12 systems are
potentially triples. There is a possible, slight deficit of earlier spectral
types (bluer colors) among the spatially unresolved companions, exactly the
opposite of expectations if significant mass is transferred to the companion
during the common envelope phase. Using the best available distance estimates,
the low mass companions to white dwarfs exhibit a bimodal distribution in
projected separation. This result supports the hypothesis that during the giant
phases of the white dwarf progenitor, any unevolved companions either migrate
inward to short periods of hours to days, or outward to periods of hundreds to
thousands of years. No intermediate projected separations of a few to several
AU are found among these pairs. However, a few double M dwarfs (within triples)
are spatially resolved in this range, empirically demonstrating that such
separations were readily detectable among the binaries with white dwarfs. A
straightforward and testable prediction emerges: all spatially unresolved, low
mass stellar and substellar companions to white dwarfs should be in short
period orbits. This result has implications for substellar companion and
planetary orbital evolution during the post-main sequence lifetime of their
stellar hosts.
