We analyse deterministic diffusion in a simple, one-dimensional setting
consisting of a family of four parameter dependent, chaotic maps defined over
the real line. When iterated under these maps, a probability density function
spreads out and one can define a diffusion coefficient. We look at how the
diffusion coefficient varies across the family of maps and under parameter
variation. Using a technique by which Taylor-Green-Kubo formulae are evaluated
in terms of generalised Takagi functions, we derive exact, fully analytical
expressions for the diffusion coefficients. Typically, for simple maps these
quantities are fractal functions of control parameters. However, our family of
four maps exhibits both fractal and linear behavior. We explain these different
structures by looking at the topology of the Markov partitions and the ergodic
properties of the maps.
