Two-way relay network (TWRN) was introduced to realize high-data rate
transmission over the wireless frequency-selective channel. However, TWRC
requires the knowledge of channel state information (CSI) not only for coherent
data detection but also for the self-data removal. This is partial accomplished
by training sequence-based linear channel estimation. However, conventional
linear estimation techniques neglect anticipated sparsity of multipath channel.
Unlike the previous methods, we propose a compressive channel estimation method
which exploit the sparse structure and provide significant improvements in MSE
performance when compared with traditional LSbased linear channel probing
strategies. Simulation results confirm the proposed methods.
