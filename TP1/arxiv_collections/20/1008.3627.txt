We present evidence for Quasi Periodic Oscillations (QPOs) in the recurrent
outburst activity from SGR 1806-20 using Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE)
observations during November 1996. Searching for QPOs in a sample of 30 bursts
at similar frequencies to those previously reported in the December 27, 2004
giant flare, we find evidence for a QPO in a burst at 648 Hz at 5.17{\sigma}
confidence level, lying within 3.75% from the 625 Hz QPO discovered in the
giant flare. Two additional features are also detected around 84 and 103 Hz in
two other bursts at 4.2{\sigma} and 4.8{\sigma} confidence level, respectively,
which lie within 8.85% and 11.83% respectively from the QPO at 92.5 Hz also
detected in the giant flare. Accounting for the number of bursts analyzed the
confidence levels for the 84, 103 and 648 Hz becomes 3{\sigma}, 3.6{\sigma} and
3.4{\sigma} respectively. Extending our search to other frequency ranges, we
find candidates at 1096, 1230, 2785 and 3690 Hz in 3 different bursts with
confidence levels lying between 4.14{\sigma}-4.46{\sigma}, which is reduced to
2.3{\sigma}-3{\sigma} after accounting for a certain confirmation bias in each
case. The fact that we can find evidence for QPOs in the recurrent bursts at
frequencies relatively close to those found in the giant flare is intriguing.
We examine the candidate QPOs in relation with those found in the giant flare
and discuss their possible physical origin.
