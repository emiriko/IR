We present an experimental study of the two-dimensional S=1/2 square-lattice
antiferromagnet Cu(pz)$_2$(ClO$_4$)$_2$ (pz denotes pyrazine - $C_4H_4N_2$)
using specific heat measurements, neutron diffraction and cold-neutron
spectroscopy. The magnetic field dependence of the magnetic ordering
temperature was determined from specific heat measurements for fields
perpendicular and parallel to the square-lattice planes, showing identical
field-temperature phase diagrams. This suggest that spin anisotropies in
Cu(pz)$_2$(ClO$_4$)$_2$ are small. The ordered antiferromagnetic structure is a
collinear arrangement with the magnetic moments along either the
crystallographic b- or c-axis. The estimated ordered magnetic moment at zero
field is m_0=0.47(5)mu_B and thus much smaller than the available single-ion
magnetic moment. This is evidence for strong quantum fluctuations in the
ordered magnetic phase of Cu(pz)$_2$(ClO$_4$)$_2$. Magnetic fields applied
perpendicular to the square-lattice planes lead to an increase of the
antiferromagnetically ordered moment to m_0=0.93(5)mu_B at mu_0H=13.5T -
evidence that magnetic fields quench quantum fluctuations. Neutron spectroscopy
reveals the presence of a gapped spin excitations at the antiferromagnetic zone
center, and it can be explained with a slightly anisotropic nearest neighbor
exchange coupling described by J_1^{xy}=1.563(13)meV and
J_1^z=0.9979(2)J_1^{xy}.
