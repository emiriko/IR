To settle the question whether the growth with energy is universal for
different hadronic total cross-sections, we present results from theoretical
models for pion-proton, proton-proton and proton-antiproton total
cross-sections. We show that present and planned experiments at LHC can
differentiate between different models, all of which are consistent with
presently available (lower energy) data. This study is also relevant for the
analysis of those very high energy cosmic ray data which require reliable
pion-proton total cross-sections as seeds. A preliminary study of the total
pion-pion cross-sections is also made.
