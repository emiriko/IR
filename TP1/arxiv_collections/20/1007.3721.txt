Photon bremsstrahlung is proposed to be used to identify elastic
proton-proton interactions at the LHC. In addition to a measurement of the
elastic pp cross section (assuming that the elastic slope is known), the
bremsstrahlung photons will allow the evaluation of the total pp cross section,
luminosity and to align the Zero Degree Calorimeters (ZDCs).
