Using Langlands's {\it Beyond Endoscopy} idea and analytic number theory
techniques, we study the Asai L-function associated to a real quadratic field
$\mathbf{K}/\Q.$ If the Asai L-function associated to an automorphic form over
$\mathbf{K}$ has a pole, then the form is a base change from $\Q$. We prove
this and further prove the analytic continuation of the L-function. This is one
of the first examples of using a trace formula to get such information. A hope
of Langlands is that general L-functions can be studied via this method.
