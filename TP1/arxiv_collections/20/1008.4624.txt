In this paper we study the evolution operator of a time-dependent Hamiltonian
in the three level system. The evolution operator is based on $SU(3)$ and its
dimension is $8$, so we obtain three complex Riccati differential equations
interacting with one another (which have been obtained by Fujii and Oike) and
two real phase equations. This is a canonical form of the evolution operator.
