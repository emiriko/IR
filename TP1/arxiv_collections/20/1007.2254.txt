In this paper we investigate regular patterns of matrix elements of the
nuclear shell model Hamiltonian $H$, by sorting the diagonal matrix elements
from the smaller to larger values. By using simple plots of non-zero matrix
elements and lowest eigenvalues of artificially constructed "sub-matrices" $h$
of $H$, we propose a new and simple formula which predicts the lowest
eigenvalue with remarkable precisions.
