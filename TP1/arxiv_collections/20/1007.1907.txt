We analyze the importance of flavor effects in models in which leptogenesis
proceeds via the decay of Majorana electroweak triplets. We find that depending
on the relative strengths of gauge and Yukawa reactions the $B-L$ asymmetry can
be sizably enhanced, exceeding in some cases an order of magnitude level. We
also discuss the impact that such effects can have for TeV-scale triplets
showing that as long as the $B-L$ asymmetry is produced by the dynamics of the
lightest such triplet they are negligible, but open the possibility for
scenarios in which the asymmetry is generated above the TeV scale by heavier
states, possibly surviving the TeV triplet related washouts. We investigate
these cases and show how they can be disentangled at the LHC by using Majorana
triplet collider observables and, in the case of minimal type III see-saw
models even through lepton flavor violation observables.
