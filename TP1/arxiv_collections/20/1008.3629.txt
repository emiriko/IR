Formal Concept Analysis "FCA" is a data analysis method which enables to
discover hidden knowledge existing in data. A kind of hidden knowledge
extracted from data is association rules. Different quality measures were
reported in the literature to extract only relevant association rules. Given a
dataset, the choice of a good quality measure remains a challenging task for a
user. Given a quality measures evaluation matrix according to semantic
properties, this paper describes how FCA can highlight quality measures with
similar behavior in order to help the user during his choice. The aim of this
article is the discovery of Interestingness Measures "IM" clusters, able to
validate those found due to the hierarchical and partitioning clustering
methods "AHC" and "k-means". Then, based on the theoretical study of sixty one
interestingness measures according to nineteen properties, proposed in a recent
study, "FCA" describes several groups of measures.
