Surveys based on the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect provide a fresh view of
the galaxy cluster population, one that is complementary to X-ray surveys. To
better understand the relation between these two kinds of survey, we construct
an empirical cluster model using scaling relations constrained by current X-ray
and SZ data. We apply our model to predict the X-ray properties of the Planck
SZ Cluster Catalog (PCC) and compare them to existing X-ray cluster catalogs.
We find that Planck should significantly extend the depth of the previous
all-sky cluster survey, performed in the early 1990s by the ROSAT satellite,
and should be particularly effective at finding hot, massive clusters (T > 6
keV) out to redshift unity. These are rare objects, and our findings suggest
that Planck could increase the observational sample at z > 0.6 by an order of
magnitude. This would open the way for detailed studies of massive clusters out
to these higher redshifts. Specifically, we find that the majority of
newly-detected Planck clusters should have X-ray fluxes 10^{-13} ergs/s/cm^2 <
f_X[0.5-2 keV] < 10^{-12} ergs/s/cm^2, i.e., distributed over the decade in
flux just below the ROSAT All Sky Survey limit. This is sufficiently bright for
extensive X-ray follow-up campaigns. Once Planck finds these objects,
XMM-Newton and \textit{Chandra} could measure temperatures to 10% for a sample
of ~ 100 clusters in the range 0.5 < z < 1, a valuable increase in the number
of massive clusters studied over this range.
