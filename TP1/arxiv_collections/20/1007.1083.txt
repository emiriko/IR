Let $G$ be a connected linear algebraic group over a field $k$ of
characteristic zero. For a principal $G$-bundle $\pi: E \to X$ over a scheme
$X$ of finite type over $k$ and a parabolic subgroup $P$ of $G$, we describe
the rational algebraic cobordism and higher Chow groups of the flag bundle $E/P
\to X$ in terms of the cobordism of $X$ and that of the classifying space of a
maximal torus of $G$ contained in $P$. As a consequence, we also obtain the
formula for the cobordism and higher Chow groups of the principal bundles over
the scheme $X$. If $X$ is smooth, this describes the cobordism ring of these
bundles in terms of the cobordism ring of $X$.
