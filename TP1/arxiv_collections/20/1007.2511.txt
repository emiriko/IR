Superconductor/ferromagnet (S/F) proximity effect theory predicts that the
superconducting critical temperature of the F1/F2/S or F1/S/F2 trilayers for
the parallel orientation of the F1 and F2 magnetizations is smaller than for
the antiparallel one. This suggests a possibility of a controlled switching
between the superconducting and normal states in the S layer. Here, using the
spin switch design F1/F2/S theoretically proposed by Oh et al. [Appl. Phys.
Lett. 71, 2376 (1997)], that comprises a ferromagnetic bilayer separated by a
non-magnetic metallic spacer layer as a ferromagnetic component, and an
ordinary superconductor as the second interface component, we have successfully
realized a full spin switch effect for the superconducting current.
