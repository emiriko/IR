The aim of this paper is to study the semi-classical behaviour of
Schr\"odinger's dynamics for an one-dimesional quantum Hamiltonian with a
classical hyperbolic trajectory. As in the regular case (elliptic trajectory),
we prove, that for an initial wave packets localized in energy, the dynamics
follows the classical motion during short time. And, for large time, a new
period for the dynamics appears : the wave packets revivals.
