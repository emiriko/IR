We show that extraordinary magnetoresistance (EMR) arises in systems
consisting of two components; a semiconducting ring with a metallic inclusion
embedded. The im- portant aspect of this discovery is that the system must have
a quasi-two-dimensional character. Using the same materials and geometries for
the samples as in experiments by Solin et al.[1;2], we show that such systems
indeed exhibit a huge magnetoresistance. The magnetoresistance arises due to
the switching of electrical current paths passing through the metallic
inclusion. Diagrams illustrating the flow of the current density within the
samples are utilised in discussion of the mechanism responsible for the
magnetoresistance effect. Extensions are then suggested which may be applicable
to the silver chalcogenides. Our theory offers an excellent description and
explanation of experiments where a huge magnetoresistance has been
discovered[2;3].
