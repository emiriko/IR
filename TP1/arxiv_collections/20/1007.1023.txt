This paper introduces CONFIGEN, a tool that helps modularizing software.
CONFIGEN allows the developer to select a set of elementary components for his
software through an interactive interface. Configuration files for use by
C/assembly code and Makefiles are then automatically generated, and we
successfully used it as a helper tool for complex system software refactoring.
CONFIGEN is based on propositional logic, and its implementation faces hard
theoretical problems.
