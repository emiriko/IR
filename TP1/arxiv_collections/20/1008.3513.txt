The interplanetary magnetic fluctuation spectrum obeys a Kolmogorovian power
law at scales above the proton inertial length and gyroradius which is well
regarded as an inertial range. Below these scales a power law index around
$-2.5$ is often measured and associated to nonlinear dispersive processes.
Recent observations reveal a third region at scales below the electron inertial
length. This region is characterized by a steeper spectrum that some refer to
it as the dissipation range. We investigate this range of scales in the
electron magnetohydrodynamic approximation and derive an exact and universal
law for a third-order structure function. This law can predict a magnetic
fluctuation spectrum with an index of $-11/3$ which is in agreement with the
observed spectrum at the smallest scales. We conclude on the possible existence
of a third turbulence regime in the solar wind instead of a dissipation range
as recently postulated.
