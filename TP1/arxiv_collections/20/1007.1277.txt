We show a practical application of the Jarzynski equality in quantum
computation. Its implementation may open a way to solve combinatorial
optimization problems, minimization of a real single-valued function, cost
function, with many arguments. We consider to incorpolate the Jarzynski
equality into quantum annealing, which is one of the generic algorithms to
solve the combinatorial optimization problem. The ordinary quantum annealing
suffers from non-adiabatic transitions whose rate is characterized by the
minimum energy gap $\Delta_{\rm min.}$ of the quantum system under
consideration. The quantum sweep speed is therefore restricted to be extremely
slow for the achievement to obtain a solution without relevant errors. However,
in our strategy shown in the present study, we find that such a difficulty
would not matter.
