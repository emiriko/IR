We have used neutron scattering and muon spin relaxation (muSR) to
investigate the structural and magnetic properties of the beta-phase of
elemental manganese doped with dilute amounts of indium. beta-Mn is an example
of a topologically frustrated antiferromagnetically correlated metal - but
which remains paramagnetic at all temperatures. The addition of In to beta-Mn
results in a vast volume expansion of the lattice, and would therefore be
expected to have a major effect on the stability and localization of the Mn
moment - as observed in, for example, Ru and Al doped beta-Mn alloys. We find
that In doping in beta-Mn results in a short-range ordered spin-glass like
ground state, similar to that of Al-doped beta-Mn but with residual low
frequency spin fluctuations. This is in contrast to Ru doping which results in
the stabilization of a long-range ordered Mn moment
