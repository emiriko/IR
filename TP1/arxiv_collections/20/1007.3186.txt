Presented here are 442 new proper motion stellar systems in the southern sky
between declinations -$90\degr$ and -47$\degr$ with 0$\farcs$40 yr$^{-1}$ $>$
$\mu$ $\ge$ 0$\farcs$18 yr$^{-1}$. These systems constitute a 25.3% increase in
new systems for the same region of the sky covered by previous SuperCOSMOS
RECONS (SCR) searches that used Schmidt plates as the primary source of
discovery. Among the new systems are 25 multiples, plus an additional seven new
common proper motion companions found to previously known primaries. All stars
have been discovered using the third U.S. Naval Observatory (USNO) CCD
Astrograph Catalog (UCAC3). A comparison of the UCAC3 proper motions to those
from the Hipparcos, Tycho-2, Southern Proper Motion (SPM4), and SuperCOSMOS
efforts is presented, and shows that UCAC3 provides similar values and
precision to the first three surveys. The comparison between UCAC3 and
SuperCOSMOS indicates that proper motions in RA are systematically shifted in
the SuperCOSMOS data but are consistent in DEC data, while overall showing a
significantly higher scatter. Distance estimates are derived for stars having
SuperCOSMOS Sky Survey (SSS) $B_J$, $R_{59F}$, and $I_{IVN}$ plate magnitudes
and Two-Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) infrared photometry. We find 15 systems
estimated to be within 25 pc, including UPM 1710-5300 our closest new discovery
estimated at 13.5 pc. Such new discoveries suggest that more nearby stars are
yet to be found in these slower proper motion regimes, indicating that more
work is needed to develop a complete map of the solar neighborhood.
