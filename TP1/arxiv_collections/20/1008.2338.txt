The microscopic transport model UrQMD and a micro+macro hybrid model are used
to calculate direct photon spectra from U+U-collisions at Elab = 35 AGeV as
will be measured by the CBM-collaboration at FAIR. In the hybrid model, the
intermediate high-density part of the nuclear interaction is described with
ideal 3+1-dimensional hydrodynamics. Different equations of state of the matter
created in the heavy-ion collisions are investigated and the resulting spectra
of direct photons are predicted. The emission patterns of direct photons in
space and time are discussed.
