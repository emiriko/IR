Both families of high $T_c$ superconductors, iron pnictides and cuprates,
exhibit material dependence of superconductivity. Here, we study its origin
within the spin fluctuation pairing theory based on multiorbital models that
take into account realistic band structures. For pnictides, we show that the
presence and absence of Fermi surface pockets is sensitive to the pnictogen
height measured from the iron plane due to the multiorbital nature of the
system, which is reflected to the nodeless/nodal form of the superconducting
gap and $T_c$. Surprisingly, even for the cuprates, which is conventionally
modeled by a single orbital model, the multiorbital band structure is shown to
play a crucial role in the material dependence of superconductivity. In fact,
by adopting a two orbital model that considers the $d_{z^2}$ orbital on top of
the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital, we can resolve a long standing puzzle of why the
single layered Hg cuprate have much higher $T_c$ than the La cuprate.
Interestingly, here again the apical oxygen height measured from the CuO$_2$
plane plays an important role in determining the relative energy difference
between $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbitals, thereby strongly affecting the
superconductivity.
