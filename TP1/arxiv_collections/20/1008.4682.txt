The notion of fluctuation indices, characterizing thermodynamic stability of
statistical systems, is advanced. These indices are especially useful for
investigating the stability of nonuniform and trapped atomic assemblies. The
fluctuation indices are calculated for several systems with Bose-Einstein
condensate. It is shown that: the ideal uniform Bose-condensed gas is
thermodynamically unstable; trapped ideal gases are stable for the confining
dimension larger than two; trapped gases, under the confining dimension two,
are weakly unstable; harmonically trapped gas is stable only for the spatial
dimension three; one-dimensional harmonically trapped gas is unstable;
two-dimensional gas in a harmonic trap represents a marginal case, being weakly
unstable; interacting nonuniform three-dimensional Bose-condensed gas is
stable. There are no thermodynamically anomalous particle fluctuations in
stable Bose-condensed systems.
