We investigate the use of inexact solves for interpolatory model reduction
and consider associated perturbation effects on the underlying model reduction
problem. We give bounds on system perturbations induced by inexact solves and
relate this to termination criteria for iterative solution methods. We show
that when a Petrov-Galerkin framework is employed for the inexact solves, the
associated reduced order model is an exact interpolatory model for a nearby
full-order system; thus demonstrating backward stability. We also give evidence
that for $\h2$-optimal interpolation points, interpolatory model reduction is
robust with respect to perturbations due to inexact solves. Finally, we
demonstrate the effecitveness of direct use of inexact solves in optimal
${\mathcal H}_2$ approximation. The result is an effective model reduction
strategy that is applicable in realistically large-scale settings.
