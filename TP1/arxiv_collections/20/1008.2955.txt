We investigate the spinor classification of the Weyl tensor in five
dimensions due to De Smet. We show that a previously overlooked reality
condition reduces the number of possible types in the classification. We
classify all vacuum solutions belonging to the most special algebraic type. The
connection between this spinor and the tensor classification due to Coley,
Milson, Pravda and Pravdov\'a is investigated and the relation between most of
the types in each of the classifications is given. We show that the black ring
is algebraically general in the spinor classification.
