This work presents a homogeneous derivation of atmospheric parameters and
iron abundances for a sample of giant and subgiant stars which host giant
planets, as well as a control sample of subgiant stars not known to host giant
planets. The analysis is done using the same technique as for our previous
analysis of a large sample of planet-hosting and control sample dwarf stars. A
comparison between the distributions of [Fe/H] in planet-hosting main-sequence
stars, subgiants, and giants within these samples finds that the main-sequence
stars and subgiants have the same mean metallicity of <[Fe/H]> \simeq +0.11
dex, while the giant sample is typically more metal poor, having an average
metallicity of <[Fe/H]> = -0.06 dex. The fact that the subgiants have the same
average metallicities as the dwarfs indicates that significant accretion of
solid metal-rich material onto the planet-hosting stars has not taken place, as
such material would be diluted in the evolution from dwarf to subgiant. The
lower metallicity found for the planet-hosting giant stars in comparison with
the planet-hosting dwarfs and subgiants is interpreted as being related to the
underlying stellar mass, with giants having larger masses and thus, on average
larger-mass protoplanetary disks. In core accretion models of planet formation,
larger disk masses can contain the critical amount of metals necessary to form
giant planets even at lower metallicities.
