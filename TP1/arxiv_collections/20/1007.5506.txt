The production of heavy neutron-rich nuclei has been investigated using cold
fragmentation reactions of $^{238}$U projectiles at relativistic energies. The
experiment performed at the high-resolving-power magnetic spectrometer FRS at
GSI allowed to identify 45 new heavy neutron-rich nuclei: $^{205}$Pt,
$^{207-210}$Au, $^{211-216}$Hg, $^{213-217}$Tl, $^{215-220}$Pb, $^{219-224}$Bi,
$^{221-227}$Po, $^{224-229}$At, $^{229-231}$Rn and $^{233}$Fr. The production
cross sections of these nuclei were also determined and used to benchmark
reaction codes that predict the production of nuclei far from stability.
