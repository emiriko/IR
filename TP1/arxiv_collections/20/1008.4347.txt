We describe a variability study of the moderately old open cluster NGC 6819.
We have detected 4 new detached eclipsing binaries near the cluster turnoff
(one of which may be in a triple system). Several of these systems should be
able to provide mass and radius information, and can therefore constrain the
age of the cluster. We have also newly detected one possible detached binary
member about 3.5 magnitudes below the turnoff. One EW-type binary (probably not
a cluster member) shows unusually strong night-to-night light curve variations
in sets of observations separated by 8 years. According to the best current
information, the three brightest variables we detected (2 of them new) are
cluster members, making them blue stragglers. One is a delta Scu pulsating
variable, one is a close but detached binary, and the third contains a detached
short period binary that shows total eclipses. In each case, however, there is
evidence hinting that the system may have been produced through the interaction
of more than two stars.
