We study further the soft-wall AdS/QCD model with a cubic potential for the
bulk scalar. We analyze the spectra of pseudoscalar, scalar, vector and
axial-vector mesons. We also study the spin-1/2 nucleon spectrum and the
pion-nucleon coupling. All of them have a good agreement with the experimental
data.
