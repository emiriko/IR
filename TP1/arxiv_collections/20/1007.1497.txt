The phase structure of a four- and eight-fermion interaction model is
investigated at finite temperature and chemical potential in arbitrary
space-time dimensions, $2\leq D<4$. The effective potential and the gap
equation are calculated in the leading order of the 1/N expansion. If the first
order phase transition takes place, the phase boundary dividing the symmetric
and the broken phase is modified by the eight-fermion interaction.
