The orbit decomposition is given under the automorphism group on the real
split Jordan algebra of all hermitian matrices of order three corresponding to
any real split composition algebra, or the automorphism group on the
complexification, explicitly, in terms of the cross product of H. Freudenthal
and the characteristic polynomial.
