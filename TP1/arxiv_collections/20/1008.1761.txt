Two recent observing campaigns provide us with moderate dispersion spectra of
more than 230 cluster and 370 field B stars. Combining them and the spectra of
the B stars from our previous investigations ($\sim$430 cluster and $\sim$100
field B stars) yields a large, homogeneous sample for studying the rotational
properties of B stars. We derive the projected rotational velocity $V\sin i$,
effective temperature, gravity, mass, and critical rotation speed $V_{\rm
crit}$ for each star. We find that the average $V\sin i$ is significantly lower
among field stars because they are systematically more evolved and spun down
than their cluster counterparts. The rotational distribution functions of
$V_{\rm eq}/V_{\rm crit}$ for the least evolved B stars show that lower mass B
stars are born with a larger proportion of rapid rotators than higher mass B
stars. However, the upper limit of $V_{\rm eq}/V_{\rm crit}$ that may separate
normal B stars from emission line Be stars (where rotation promotes mass loss
into a circumstellar disk) is smaller among the higher mass B stars. We compare
the evolutionary trends of rotation (measured according to the polar gravity of
the star) with recent models that treat internal mixing. The spin-down rates
observed in the high mass subset ($\sim 9 M_\odot$) agree with predictions, but
the rates are larger for the low mass group ($\sim 3 M_\odot$). The faster spin
down in the low mass B stars matches well with the predictions based on
conservation of angular momentum in individual spherical shells. Our results
suggest the fastest rotators (that probably correspond to the emission line Be
stars) are probably formed by evolutionary spin up (for the more massive stars)
and by mass transfer in binaries (for the full range of B star masses).
