The tidal stirring model envisions the formation of dwarf spheroidal (dSph)
galaxies in the Local Group via the tidal interaction of disky dwarf systems
with a larger host galaxy like the Milky Way. These progenitor disks are
embedded in extended dark halos and during the evolution both components suffer
strong mass loss. In addition, the disks undergo the morphological
transformation into spheroids and the transition from ordered to random motion
of their stars. Using collisionless N-body simulations we construct a model for
the nearby and highly elongated Sagittarius (Sgr) dSph galaxy within the
framework of the tidal stirring scenario. Constrained by the present known
orbit of the dwarf, the model suggests that in order to produce the majority of
tidal debris observed as the Sgr stream, but not yet transform the core of the
dwarf into a spherical shape, Sgr must have just passed the second pericenter
of its current orbit around the Milky Way. In the model, the stellar component
of Sgr is still very elongated after the second pericenter and morphologically
intermediate between the strong bar formed at the first pericenter and the
almost spherical shape existing after the third pericenter. This is thus the
first model of the evolution of the Sgr dwarf that accounts for its observed
very elliptical shape. At the present time there is very little intrinsic
rotation left and the velocity gradient detected along the major axis is almost
entirely of tidal origin. We model the recently measured velocity dispersion
profile for Sgr assuming that mass traces light and estimate its current total
mass within 5 kpc to be 5.2 x 10^8 M_sun. To have this mass at present, the
model requires that the initial virial mass of Sgr must have been as high as
1.6 x 10^10 M_sun, comparable to that of the Large Magellanic Cloud, which may
serve as a suitable analog for the pre-interaction, Sgr progenitor.
