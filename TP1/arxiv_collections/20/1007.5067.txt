Recent experiments strongly suggest that a Fermi surface reconstruction and
multiple Fermi pockets are important common features of the underdoped
high-temperature cuprate superconductors. A related theoretical work [Phys.
Rev. B 79, 134512 (2009)] has demonstrated that a number of hallmark phenomena
observed in the underdoped cuprates appear naturally in the scenario of a
paired electron pocket co-existing with unpaired hole pockets. We propose
Gutzwiller-projected wave-functions to describe this two-fluid state as well as
two competing states in its vicinity. It is argued that a pseudogap state
constructed from these wave-functions may be selected by energetics at finite
temperatures due to spin fluctuations.
