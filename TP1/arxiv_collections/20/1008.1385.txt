In this paper, we derive the master equations for gravitational perturbations
of vector and scalar type for static vacuum Lovelock black holes. Together with
our previous work on the tensor type perturbation, we now provide the full set
of master equations that governs all types of gravitational perturbations of
static vacuum Lovelock black holes in any dimensions.
