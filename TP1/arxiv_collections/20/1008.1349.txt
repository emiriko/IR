We performed density-functional calculations to investigate the electronic
structure of ZnO/GaN core/shell heterostructured nanowires (NWs) orientating
along <0001> direction. The build-in electric filed arising from the charge
redistribution at the {1-100} interfaces and the band offsets were revealed.
ZnO-core/GaN-shell NWs rather than GaN-core/ZnO-shell ones were predicted to
exhibit natural charge spatial separation behaviors, which are understandable
in terms of an effective mass model. The effects of quantum confinement on the
band gaps and band offsets were also discussed.
