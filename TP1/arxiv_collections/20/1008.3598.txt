The violation of local P and CP invariance in QCD, as it is observed at RHIC,
has been a subject of intense discussions for the last couple of
years.Separately, a new thermalization scenario for heavy ion collisions
through the event horizon as a manifestation of the Unruh effect, has been also
suggested. In this paper we argue that these two, naively unrelated phenomena,
are actually two sides of the same coin as they are deeply rooted into the same
fundamental physics related to some very nontrivial topological features of
QCD. We formulate the universality conjecture for P and CP odd effects in heavy
ion collisions analogous to the universal thermal behaviour observed in all
other high energy interactions.
