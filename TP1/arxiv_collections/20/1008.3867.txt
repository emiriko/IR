Similarity-based Logic Programming (briefly, SLP ) has been proposed to
enhance the LP paradigm with a kind of approximate reasoning which supports
flexible information retrieval applications. This approach uses a fuzzy
similarity relation R between symbols in the program's signature, while keeping
the syntax for program clauses as in classical LP. Another recent proposal is
the QLP(D) scheme for Qualified Logic Programming, an extension of the LP
paradigm which supports approximate reasoning and more. This approach uses
annotated program clauses and a parametrically given domain D whose elements
qualify logical assertions by measuring their closeness to various users'
expectations. In this paper we propose a more expressive scheme SQLP(R,D) which
subsumes both SLP and QLP(D) as particular cases. We also show that SQLP(R,D)
programs can be transformed into semantically equivalent QLP(D) programs. As a
consequence, existing QLP(D) implementations can be used to give efficient
support for similarity-based reasoning.
