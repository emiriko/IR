As a variant of the HB authentication protocol for RFID systems, which relies
on the complexity of decoding linear codes against passive attacks, Madhavan et
al. presented Non-Linear HB(NLHB) protocol. In contrast to HB, NLHB relies on
the complexity of decoding a class of non-linear codes to render the passive
attacks proposed against HB ineffective. In this paper, we show that passive
attacks against HB protocol can still be applicable to NLHB and this protocol
does not provide the desired security margin. In our attack, we first linearize
the non-linear part of NLHB to obtain a HB equivalent for NLHB, and then
exploit the passive attack techniques proposed for the HB to evaluate the
security margin of NLHB. The results show that although NLHB's security margin
is relatively higher than HB against similar passive attack techniques, it has
been overestimated and, in contrary to what is claimed, NLHB is vulnerable to
passive attacks against HB, especially when the noise vector in the protocol
has a low weight.
