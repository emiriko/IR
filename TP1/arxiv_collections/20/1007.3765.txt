We calculate the electronic viscosity for a multiple quantum well structure
in the presence of disorder potential(V = 4 meV), the electron-electron
repulsion(U = 5-17 meV) and a strong magnetic field (B greater than or equal to
16.5 T) in the direction in which the electrons are trapped. This viscosity is
different from the dissipation-less Hall viscosity which cannot take non-zero
value in a time reversal invariant system. The Fermi energy density of states
for the system has been calculated in the t-matrix approximation assuming low
concentration of impurities. Our approach involves calculation of the density
of viscosity, for temperature close to 0 K, on the Brillouin zone(BZ) followed
by the numerical evaluation of the integral of viscosity density over the BZ.
We show that (i) the viscosity coefficient is nearly proportional to B for
given (V,U),and (ii) dissipation-less state, analogous to superfluidity, is
possible for a critical value of U when (V, B) are given. We also calculate the
entropy per particle (S) and show that the results comply with the KSS bound
reported by Kovtun et al.
