We present a fluid dynamics video showing simulations of flexible bodies
falling in an inviscid fluid. Vortex sheets are shed from the trailing edges of
the bodies according to the Kutta condition. The basic behavior is a repeated
series of accelerations to a critical speed at which the sheet buckles, and
rapidly decelerates, shedding large vortices. Examples of persistent circling,
quasi-periodic flapping, and more complex trajectories are shown.
