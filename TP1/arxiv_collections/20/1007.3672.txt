EBEX is a NASA-funded balloon-borne experiment designed to measure the
polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Observations will be
made using 1432 transition edge sensor (TES) bolometric detectors read out with
frequency multiplexed SQuIDs. EBEX will observe in three frequency bands
centered at 150, 250, and 410 GHz, with 768, 384, and 280 detectors in each
band, respectively. This broad frequency coverage is designed to provide
valuable information about polarized foreground signals from dust. The
polarized sky signals will be modulated with an achromatic half wave plate
(AHWP) rotating on a superconducting magnetic bearing (SMB) and analyzed with a
fixed wire grid polarizer. EBEX will observe a patch covering ~1% of the sky
with 8' resolution, allowing for observation of the angular power spectrum from
\ell = 20 to 1000. This will allow EBEX to search for both the primordial
B-mode signal predicted by inflation and the anticipated lensing B-mode signal.
Calculations to predict EBEX constraints on r using expected noise levels show
that, for a likelihood centered around zero and with negligible foregrounds,
99% of the area falls below r = 0.035. This value increases by a factor of 1.6
after a process of foreground subtraction. This estimate does not include
systematic uncertainties. An engineering flight was launched in June, 2009,
from Ft. Sumner, NM, and the long duration science flight in Antarctica is
planned for 2011. These proceedings describe the EBEX instrument and the North
American engineering flight.
