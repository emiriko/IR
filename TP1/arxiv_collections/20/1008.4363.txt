The low-mass end of the stellar Initial Mass Function (IMF) is constrained by
focusing on the baryon-dominated central regions of strong lensing galaxies. We
study in this letter the Einstein Cross (Q2237+0305), a z=0.04 barred galaxy
whose bulge acts as lens on a background quasar. The positions of the four
quasar images constrain the surface mass density on the lens plane, whereas the
surface brightness (H-band NICMOS/HST imaging) along with deep spectroscopy of
the lens (VLT/FORS1) allow us to constrain the stellar mass content, for a
range of IMFs. We find that a classical single power law (Salpeter IMF)
predicts more stellar mass than the observed lensing estimates. This result is
confirmed at the 99% confidence level, and is robust to systematic effects due
to the choice of population synthesis models, the presence of dust, or the
complex disk/bulge population mix. Our non-parametric methodology is more
robust than kinematic estimates, as we do not need to make any assumptions
about the dynamical state of the galaxy or its decomposition into bulge and
disk. Over a range of low-mass power law slopes (with Salpeter being
Gamma=+1.35) we find that at a 90% confidence level, slopes with Gamma>0 are
ruled out.
