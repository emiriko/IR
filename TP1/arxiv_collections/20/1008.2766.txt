The Chiral String-Soliton Model is a joining of the two notions about the
light chiral baryons: the chiral soliton models (like the Skyrme model) and the
Quark-Gluon String models. The ChSS model is based on the Effective Chiral
Lagrangian which was proposed in [arXiv:hep-ph/0306216]. We have studied the
physical properties of the light chiral baryon within the framework of this
ChSS model.
