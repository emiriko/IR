We derive the weight function w(M) to apply to dark-matter halos that
minimizes the stochasticity between the weighted halo distribution and its
underlying mass density field. The optimal w(M) depends on the range of masses
being used in the estimator. In N-body simulations, the Poisson estimator is up
to 15 times noisier than the optimal. Implementation of the optimal weight
yields significantly lower stochasticity than weighting halos by their mass,
bias or equal. Optimal weighting could make cosmological tests based on the
matter power spectrum or cross-correlations much more powerful and/or
cost-effective. A volume-limited measurement of the mass power spectrum at
k=0.2h/Mpc over the entire z<1 universe could ideally be done using only 6
million redshifts of halos with mass M>6\times10^{13}h^{-1}M_\odot
(1\times10^{13}) at z=0 (z=1); this is 5 times fewer than the Poisson model
predicts. Using halo occupancy distributions (HOD) we find that
uniformly-weighted catalogs of luminous red galaxies require >3 times more
redshifts than an optimally-weighted halo catalog to reconstruct the mass to
the same accuracy. While the mean HODs of galaxies above a threshold luminosity
are similar to the optimal w(M), the stochasticity of the halo occupation
degrades the mass estimator. Blue or emission-line galaxies are about 100 times
less efficient at reconstructing mass than an optimal weighting scheme. This
suggests an efficient observational approach of identifying and weighting halos
with a deep photo-z survey before conducting a spectroscopic survey. The
optimal w(M) and mass-estimator stochasticity predicted by the standard halo
model for M>10^{12}h^{-1}M_\odot are in reasonable agreement with our
measurements, with the important exceptions that the halos must be assumed to
be linearly biased samples of a "halo field" that is distinct from the mass
field. (Abridged)
