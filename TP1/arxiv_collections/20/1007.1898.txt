The transfer of weakly bound KRb molecules from levels just below the
dissociation threshold into the vibrational ground state with shaped laser
pulses is studied. Optimal control theory is employed to calculate the pulses.
The complexity of modelling the molecular structure is successively increased
in order to study the effects of the long-range behavior of the excited state
potential, resonant spin-orbit coupling and singlet-triplet mixing.
