Xi UrsaMajoris ({\xi} Uma) historically is one of the most important double
star inconstellation Ursa Major, found by Sir William Herschel on May, 2, 1780
and the first binary successfully determined by using the principle of two body
problem in 1828 by Savary. This star consists of two pair wide binary ADS8119
AB; in this case HD 98231(ADS8119 A) as primary and HD98230 (ADS 8119 B) as
secondary. We have collected the observational data consist of separation
angular ({\rho}) and position angle ({\theta}) fromthe observations in 1780 up
to 2005 taken from Bosscha Observatory and other Observatories in the world.
This paper presents the recent status of orbit binary system ADS 8119. By using
Thiele Van den Bos method and empirical formula Strand's Mass-Luminosity
relation we have determined the orbit and mass of ADS 8119AB. The result is;
