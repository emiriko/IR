We report on the current status of the Golem project which aims at the
construction of a general one-loop evaluator for matrix elements. We construct
the one-loop matrix elements from Feynman diagrams in a highly automated way
and provide a library for the reduction and numerically stable evaluation of
the tensor integrals involved in this approach. Furthermore, we present
applications to physics processes relevant for the LHC.
