We calculate the supergravity fields sourced by a D-brane with a null
travelling wave from disk amplitudes in type IIB string theory compactified on
T^4 x S^1. The amplitudes reproduce all the non-trivial features of the
previously known two-charge supergravity solutions in the D-brane/momentum
frame, providing a direct link between the microscopic bound states and their
macroscopic descriptions.
