In this note we point out that primordial black holes could be much shorter
lived than usually assumed if there is a large hidden sector of particles that
only interacts gravitationally with the particles of the standard model. The
observation of the explosion of one of these black holes would severely
constrain the energy scale at which gravity becomes strong.
