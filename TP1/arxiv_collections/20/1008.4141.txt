We report the discovery of a brown dwarf that transits one member of the M+M
binary system LHS6343AB every 12.71 days. The transits were discovered using
photometric data from the Kelper public data release. The LHS6343 stellar
system was previously identified as a single high-proper-motion M dwarf. We use
high-contrast imaging to resolve the system into two low-mass stars with masses
0.45 Msun and 0.36 Msun, respectively, and a projected separation of 55 arcsec.
High-resolution spectroscopy shows that the more massive component undergoes
Doppler variations consistent with Keplerian motion, with a period equal to the
transit period and an amplitude consistent with a companion mass of M_C = 62.8
+/- 2.3 Mjup. Based on an analysis of the Kepler light curve we estimate the
radius of the companion to be R_C = 0.832 +/- 0.021 Rjup, which is consistent
with theoretical predictions of the radius of a > 1 Gyr brown dwarf.
