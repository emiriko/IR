We study the low-energy effective theory of spinor condensate ferromagnets
for the superfluid velocity and magnetization degrees of freedom. This
effective theory describes the competition between spin stiffness and a
long-ranged interaction between skyrmions, topological objects familiar from
the theory of ordinary ferromagnets. We find exact solutions to the non-linear
equations of motion describing neutral configurations of skyrmions and
anti-skyrmions. These analytical solutions provide a simple physical picture
for the origin of crystalline magnetic order in spinor condensate ferromagnets
with dipolar interactions. We also point out the connections to effective
theories for quantum Hall ferromagnets.
