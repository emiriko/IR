We investigate how the pattern of contacts between species in mutualistic
ecosystems is affected by the phylogenetic proximity between the species of
each guild. We develop several theoretical tools to measure that effect and we
use them to examine some real mutualistic sytems. We aim at establishing the
role of such proximity in the emergence of a nested pattern of contacts. We
conclude that although phylogenetic proximity is compatible with nestedness it
can not be claimed to determine it. We find that nestedness can instead be
attributed to a general rule by which species tend to behave as generalists
holding contacts with counterparts that already have a large number of
contacts. A nested ecosystem generated by this rule, shows high phylogenetic
diversity. This is to say, the counterparts of species having similar degrees
are not phylogenetic neighbours.
