We show that in a quantum wire the spin-orbit interaction leads to a narrow
spin resonance at low temperatures, even in the absence of an external magnetic
field. A relatively weak dc magnetic field of a definite direction strongly
increases the resonance absorption. Linearly polarized resonance radiation
produces dynamic magnetization as well as electric and spin currents. The
effect strongly depends on the external magnetic field.
