In this paper, we consider the time-frequency localization of the generator
of a principal shift-invariant space on the real line which has additional
shift-invariance. We prove that if a principal shift-invariant space on the
real line is translation-invariant then any of its orthonormal (or Riesz)
generators is non-integrable. However, for any $n\ge2$, there exist principal
shift-invariant spaces on the real line that are also $\nZ$-invariant with an
integrable orthonormal (or a Riesz) generator $\phi$, but $\phi$ satisfies
$\int_{\mathbb R} |\phi(x)|^2 |x|^{1+\epsilon} dx=\infty$ for any $\epsilon>0$
and its Fourier transform $\hat\phi$ cannot decay as fast as $ (1+|\xi|)^{-r}$
for any $r>1/2$. Examples are constructed to demonstrate that the above decay
properties for the orthormal generator in the time domain and in the frequency
domain are optimal.
