New experimental data are presented on the energy dependence of the total
cross sections for the np -> d eta and quasi-two-body pp -> pp eta reactions,
where the final diproton is detected at very low excitation energy.
Differential cross sections of pp -> pp eta away from threshold show the
influence of higher partial waves and a partial wave decomposition is
attempted.
