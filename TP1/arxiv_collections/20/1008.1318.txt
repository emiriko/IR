It is a longstanding problem that HII regions and very young stellar
populations in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) have the nitrogen abundances
  ([N/H]) by a factor of ~7 lower than the solar value. We here discuss a new
scenario in which the observed unusually low nitrogen abundances can be closely
associated with recent collision and subsequent accretion of HI high velocity
clouds (HVCs) that surround the Galaxy and have low nitrogen abundances. We
show that if the observed low [N/H] is limited to very young stars with ages
less than ~10^7 yr, then the collision/accretion rate of the HVCs onto the LMC
needs to be ~ 0.2 M_sun/yr (corresponding to the total HVC mass of 10^6-10^7
M_sun) to dilute the original interstellar medium (ISM) before star formation.
The required accretion rate means that even if the typical mass of HVCs
accreted onto the LMC is ~ 10^7 M_sun, the Galaxy needs to have ~2500 massive
HVCs within the LMC's orbital radius with respect to the Galactic center. The
required rather large number of massive HVCs drives us to suggest that the HVCs
are not likely to efficiently dilute the ISM of the LMC and consequently lower
the [N/H]. We thus suggest the transfer of gas with low [N/H] from the Small
Magellanic Cloud (SMC) to the LMC as a promising scenario that can explain the
observed low [N/H].
