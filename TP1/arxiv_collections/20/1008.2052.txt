Let $A^{lev}_{11}$ be the moduli space of (1,11)-polarized abelian surfaces
with level structure of canonical type. Let $\chi$ be a finite character of
order 5 with conductor 11. In this paper we construct five endoscopic lifts
$\Pi_i,0\le i\le 4$ from two elliptic modular forms $f\otimes\chi^i$ of weight
2 and $g\otimes\chi^i$ of weight 4 with complex multiplication by
$Q(\sqrt{-11})$ such that ${\Pi_i}_\infty$ gives a non-holomorphic differential
form on $A^{lev}_{11}$ for each $i$. Then the spinor L-function is of form
$L(f\otimes\chi^i,s-1)L(g\otimes\chi^i,s)$ such that $L(g\otimes\chi^i,s)$ does
not appear in the L-function of $A^{lev}_{11}$ for any $i$. The existence of
such lifts is motivated by the computation of the L-function of Klein's cubic
hypersurface which is a birational smooth model of $A^{lev}_{11}$.
