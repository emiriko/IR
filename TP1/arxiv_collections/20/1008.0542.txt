The Sommerfeld rescattering formula is compared to the e+e- -> ppbar BaBar
data at threshold and above. While there is the expected Coulomb enhancement at
threshold, two unexpected outcomes have been found: |G^p (4M_p^2)|= 1, like for
a pointlike fermion, and moreover data show that the resummation factor in the
Sommerfeld formula is not needed. Other e+e- -> baryon-antibaryon cross
sections show a similar behavior near threshold.
