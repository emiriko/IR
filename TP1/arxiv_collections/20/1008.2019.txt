We probe the local quasiparticles density-of-states in micron-sized
SmFeAsO$_{1-x}$F$_{x}$ single-crystals by means of Scanning Tunnelling
Spectroscopy. Spectral features resemble those of cuprates, particularly a
dip-hump-like structure developed at energies larger than the gap that can be
ascribed to the coupling of quasiparticles to a collective mode, quite likely a
resonant spin mode. The energy of the collective mode revealed in our study
decreases when the pairing strength increases. Our findings support
spin-fluctuation-mediated pairing in pnictides.
