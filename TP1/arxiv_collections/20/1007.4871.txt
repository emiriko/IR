We present results for the negative parity low-lying state of the nucleon,
$N{\frac{1}{2}}^{-}$ (1535 MeV) ${\rm S}_{11}$, from a variational analysis
method. The analysis is performed in quenched QCD with the FLIC fermion action.
The principal focus of this paper is to explore the level ordering between the
Roper (${\rm{P}}_{11}$) and the negative parity ground (${\rm{S}}_{11}$) states
of the nucleon. Evidence of the physical level ordering is observed at light
quark masses. A wide variety of smeared-smeared correlation functions are used
to construct correlation matrices. A comprehensive correlation matrix analysis
is performed to ensure an accurate isolation of the $N{\frac{1}{2}}^{-}$ state.
