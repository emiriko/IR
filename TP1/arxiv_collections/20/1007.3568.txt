Suppose Alice wishes to send messages to Bob through a communication channel
C_1, but her transmissions also reach an eavesdropper Eve through another
channel C_2. The goal is to design a coding scheme that makes it possible for
Alice to communicate both reliably and securely. Reliability is measured in
terms of Bob's probability of error in recovering the message, while security
is measured in terms of the mutual information between the message and Eve's
observations. Wyner showed that the situation is characterized by a single
constant C_s, called the secrecy capacity, which has the following meaning: for
all $\epsilon > 0$, there exist coding schemes of rate $R \ge C_s - \epsilon$
that asymptotically achieve both the reliability and the security objectives.
However, his proof of this result is based upon a nonconstructive random-coding
argument. To date, despite a considerable research effort, the only case where
we know how to construct coding schemes that achieve secrecy capacity is when
Eve's channel C_2 is an erasure channel, or a combinatorial variation thereof.
  Polar codes were recently invented by Arikan; they approach the capacity of
symmetric binary-input discrete memoryless channels with low encoding and
decoding complexity. Herein, we use polar codes to construct a coding scheme
that achieves the secrecy capacity of general wiretap channels. Our
construction works for any instantiation of the wiretap channel model, as
originally defined by Wyner, as long as both C_1 and C_2 are symmetric and
binary-input. Moreover, we show how to modify our construction in order to
achieve strong security, as defined by Maurer, while still operating at a rate
that approaches the secrecy capacity. In this case, we cannot guarantee that
the reliability condition will be satisfied unless the main channel C_1 is
noiseless, although we believe it can be always satisfied in practice.
