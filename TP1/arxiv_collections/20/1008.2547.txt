The Dirichlet characters of reduced residue systems modulo m are tabulated
for moduli m <= 195. The associated L-series are tabulated for m <= 14 and
small positive integer argument s accurate to 10^(-50), their first derivatives
for m <= 6. Restricted summation over primes only defines Dirichlet Prime
L-functions which lead to Euler products (Prime Zeta Modulo functions). Both
are materialized over similar ranges of moduli and arguments. Formulas and
numerical techniques are well known; the aim is to provide direct access to
reference values.
