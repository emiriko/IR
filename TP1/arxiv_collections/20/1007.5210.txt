GRS 1915+105 is a prominent black hole system exhibiting variability over a
wide range of time scales and its observed light curves have been classified
into 12 temporal states. Here we undertake a complete analysis of these light
curves from all the states using various quantifiers from nonlinear time series
analysis, such as, the correlation dimension (D_2), the correlation entropy
(K_2), singular value decomposition (SVD) and the multifractal spectrum
($f(\alpha)$ spectrum). An important aspect of our analysis is that, for
estimating these quantifiers, we use algorithmic schemes which we have proposed
recently and tested successfully on synthetic as well as practical time series
from various fields. Though the schemes are based on the conventional delay
embedding technique, they are automated so that the above quantitative measures
can be computed using conditions prescribed by the algorithm and without any
intermediate subjective analysis. We show that nearly half of the 12 temporal
states exhibit deviation from randomness and their complex temporal behavior
could be approximated by a few (3 or 4) coupled ordinary nonlinear differential
equations. These results could be important for a better understanding of the
processes that generate the light curves and hence for modelling the temporal
behavior of such complex systems. To our knowledge, this is the first complete
analysis of an astrophysical object (let alone a black hole system) using
various techniques from nonlinear dynamics.
