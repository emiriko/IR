Molecular FeH provides a large number of sharp and isolated absorption lines
that can be used to measure radial velocity, rotation, or magnetic field
strength with high accuracy. Our aim is to provide an FeH atlas for M-type
stars in the spectral region from 986 nm to 1077 nm (Wing-Ford band). To
identify these lines in CRIRES spectra of the magnetically inactive, slowly
rotating, M5.5 dwarf GJ1002, we calculated model spectra for the selected
spectral region with theoretical FeH line data. In general this line list
agrees with the observed data, but several individual lines differ
significantly in position or in line strength. After identification of as many
as possible FeH lines, we correct the line data for position and line strength
to provide an accurate atlas of FeH absorption lines for use in high precision
spectroscopy of low mass stars. For all lines, we use a Voigt function to
obtain their positions and equivalent widths. Identification with theoretical
lines is done by hand. For confirmation of the identified lines, we use
statistical methods, cross- correlation techniques, and line intensities.
Eventually, we were able to identify FeH lines from the (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1),
(2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), and (4, 3) vibrational bands in the observed spectra
and correct the positions of the lines if necessary. The deviations between
theoretical and observed positions follow a normal distribution approximately
around zero. In order to empirically correct the line strength, we determined
Teff, instrumental broadening (rotational broadening) and a van der Waals
enhancement factor for FeH lines in GJ1002. We also give scaling factors for
the Einstein A values to correct the line strengths. With the identified lines,
we derived rotational temperatures from line intensities for GJ1002. ... .
