Electrostatic gyrokinetic absolute equilibria with continuum velocity field
are obtained through the partition function and through the Green function of
the functional integral. The new results justify and explain the prescription
for quantization/discretization or taking the continuum limit of velocity. The
mistakes in the Appendix D of our earlier work [J.-Z. Zhu and G. W. Hammett,
Phys. Plasmas {\bf 17}, 122307 (2010)] are explained and corrected. If the
lattice spacing for discretizing velocity is big enough, all the invariants
could concentrate at the lowest Fourier modes in a negative-temperature state,
which might indicate a possible variation of the dual cascade picture in
two-dimension magnetized plasma turbulence.
