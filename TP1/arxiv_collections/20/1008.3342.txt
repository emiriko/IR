An electron-impact ion source based on photoelectron emission was developed
for ionization of gases at pressures below 1e-4 mbar in an axial magnetic field
in the order of 5 T. The ion source applies only DC fields, which makes it
suitable for use in the presence of equipment sensitive to radio-frequency (RF)
fields. The ion source was succesfully tested under varying conditions
regarding pressure, magnetic field and magnetic-field gradient, and the results
were studied with the help of simulations. The processes in the ion source are
well understood and possibilities for further optimization of generated ion
currents are clarified.
