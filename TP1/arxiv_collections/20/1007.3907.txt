We study the band structure and the density of states of graphene in the
presence of a next-to-nearest-neighbor coupling (N2) and a
third-nearest-neighbor coupling (N3). We show that for values of N3 larger or
equal to 1/3 of the value of the nearest-neighbor hopping (NN), extra Dirac
points appear in the spectrum. If N3 is exactly equal to 1/3 NN, the new Dirac
points are localized at the M points of the Brillouin zone and are hybrid: the
electrons have a linear dispersion along the GammaM direction and a quadratic
dispersion along the perpendicular direction MK. For larger values of N3 the
new points have a linear dispersion, and are situated along the MK line. For a
value of N3 equal to 1/2 NN, these points merge with the Dirac cones at the K
points, yielding a gapless quadratic dispersion around K, while for larger
values each quadratic point at K splits again into four Dirac points. The
effects of changing the N2 coupling are not so dramatic. We calculate the
density of states and we show that increasing the N3 coupling lowers the energy
of the Van Hove singularities, and when N3 is larger than 1/3 NN the Van Hove
singularities split in two, giving rise to extra singularities at low energies.
