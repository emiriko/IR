The determination of confidence intervals of stress orientation is a crucial
element in the discussion of homogeneity or heterogeneity of the stress field
under study. The error estimates provided by the grid search method Focal
Mechanism Stress Inversion of Gephart and Forsyth (1984) have been shown to be
too wide but the reasons for this failure have escaped elucidation. Through the
use of directional statistics and synthetic focal mechanisms, I show that the
grid search methodology does yield appropriate uncertainty estimates. The
direct perturbation of the synthetic focal mechanisms introduces bias which
leads to confidence intervals which become increasingly too wide as the amount
of perturbation increases. The synthetic data also show at what point the
method fails to overcome this bias and when confidence intervals will be too
wide. The indirect perturbation of the focal mechanisms by perturbing the
generating deviatoric stress tensor generates synthetic data devoid of bias.
Inversion of these data sets yields correct confidence intervals. The Focal
Mechanism Stress Inversion method is vindicated as a highly effective method,
and with the use of appropriate directional statistics, its results can be
assessed and homogeneity or heterogeneity of the stress field can be discussed
with confidence.
