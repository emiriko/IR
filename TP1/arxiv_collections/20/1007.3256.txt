Lithium niobate photonic circuits have the salutary property of permitting
the generation, transmission, and processing of photons to be accommodated on a
single chip. Compact photonic circuits such as these, with multiple components
integrated on a single chip, are crucial for efficiently implementing quantum
information processing schemes. We present a set of basic transformations that
are useful for manipulating modal qubits in Ti:LiNbO$_3$ photonic quantum
circuits. These include the mode analyzer, a device that separates the even and
odd components of a state into two separate spatial paths; the mode rotator,
which rotates the state by an angle in mode space; and modal Pauli spin
operators that effect related operations. We also describe the design of a
deterministic, two-qubit, single-photon, CNOT gate, a key element in certain
sets of universal quantum logic gates. It is implemented as a Ti:LiNbO$_3$
photonic quantum circuit in which the polarization and mode number of a single
photon serve as the control and target qubits, respectively. It is shown that
the effects of dispersion in the CNOT circuit can be mitigated by augmenting it
with an additional path. The performance of all of these components are
confirmed by numerical simulations. The implementation of these transformations
relies on selective and controllable power coupling among single- and two-mode
waveguides, as well as the polarization sensitivity of the Pockels coefficients
in LiNbO$_3$.
