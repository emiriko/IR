Quantum gauge theories with finite-dimensional representation spaces are
constructed that can have canonical gauge field theories as singular limits.
They describe nature as a recursive quantum assembly by iterating Fermi-Dirac
quantification. Six iterations are necessary and sufficient for present
physics. The gauge structure, the spin-statistics correlation, the space-time
metric, and the Higgs field are modeled.
