The very center of NGC~3610, a clearly disturbed giant elliptical generally
assumed to be a post-merger remnant, appears dominated in the mid-UV (2500-3200
A spectral region) by a stellar population markedly different from that
dominating the bulk of its stellar body. I want here to make use of the mid-UV
spectra of NGC~3610 as seen through tiny ($\sim$1") and large (10"$\times$20")
apertures as a diagnostic population tool. I compare archive IUE/LWP large
aperture and HST/FOS UV data of NGC 3610. The strength of mid-UV triplet
(dominated by the turnoff population) shows a remarkable drop when switching
from the galaxy central arcsec (FOS aperture) to an aperture size comparable to
$\sim$0.5 r$_e$ (IUE). The sub-arsec (mid)-UV properties of this galaxy
involved in a past merger reveal a central metal enrichment which left intact
the bulk of its pre-existing population.
