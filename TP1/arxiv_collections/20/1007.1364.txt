The spin-Seebeck effect was recently discovered in a metallic ferromagnet and
consists of a thermally generated spin distribution that is electrically
measured utilizing the inverse spin Hall effect. Here this effect is reproduced
experimentally in a ferromagnetic semiconductor, GaMnAs, which allows for
flexible design of the magnetization directions, a larger spin polarization,
and measurements across the magnetic phase transition. The spin-Seebeck effect
in GaMnAs is observed even in the absence of longitudinal charge transport. The
spatial distribution of spin-currents is maintained across electrical breaks
highlighting the local nature of the effect, which is therefore ascribed to a
thermally induced spin redistribution.
