A harmonically trapped ultracold 1D spin-1 Bose gas with strongly repulsive
or attractive 1D even-wave interactions induced by a 3D Feshbach resonance is
studied. The exact ground state, a hybrid of Tonks-Girardeau (TG) and ideal
Fermi gases, is constructed in the TG limit of infinite even-wave repulsion by
a spinor Fermi-Bose mapping to a spinless ideal Fermi gas. It is then shown
that in the limit of infinite even-wave attraction this same state remains an
exact many-body eigenstate, now highly excited relative to the collapsed
generalized McGuire cluster ground state, showing that the hybrid TG state is
completely stable against collapse to this cluster ground state under a sudden
switch from infinite repulsion to infinite attraction. It is shown to be the TG
limit of a hybrid super Tonks-Girardeau (STG) state which is metastable under a
sudden switch from finite but very strong repulsion to finite but very strong
attraction. It should be possible to create it experimentally by a sudden
switch from strongly repulsive to strongly attractive interaction, as in the
recent Innsbruck experiment on a spin-polarized bosonic STG gas. In the case of
strong attraction there should also exist another STG state of much lower
energy, consisting of strongly bound dimers, a bosonic analog of a recently
predicted STG gas which is an ultracold gas of strongly bound bosonic dimers of
fermionic atoms, but it is shown that this STG state cannot be created by such
a switch from strong repulsion to strong attraction.
