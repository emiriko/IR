We study the Kondo effect in a model system of a quantum dot embedded in an
Aharanov-Bohm ring connected to two leads. By transforming to the scattering
basis of the direct inter-lead tunneling, we are able to describe precisely how
the Kondo screening of the dot spin occurs. We calculate the Kondo temperature
and zero-temperature conductance and find that both are influenced by the
Aharanov-Bohm ring as well as the electron density in the leads. We also
calculate the form of an additional potential scattering term that arises at
low energies due to the breaking of particle-hole symmetry. Many of our results
are supported by numerical analysis using the numerical renormalization group.
