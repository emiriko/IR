We present a simple technique for stabilization of a laser frequency off
resonance using the Faraday effect in a heated vapor cell with an applied
magnetic field. In particular we demonstrate stabilization of a 780 nm laser
detuned up to 14 GHz from the 85Rb D2 5 2S_1/2 F = 2 to 5 2P_3/2 F' = 3
transition. Control of the temperature of the vapor cell and the magnitude of
the applied magnetic field allows locking ~6-14 GHz red and blue detuned from
the atomic line. We obtain an rms fluctuation of 16(1) MHz over one hour
without stabilization of the cell temperature or magnetic field.
