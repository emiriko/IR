Two aspects of bright matter-wave solitons in weak external potentials are
discussed. First, we briefly review recent results on the Anderson localization
of an entire soliton in disordered potentials [Sacha et al. PRL 103, 210402
(2009)], as a paradigmatic showcase of genuine quantum dynamics beyond simple
perturbation theory. Second, we calculate the linear response of the mean-field
soliton shape to a weak, but otherwise arbitrary external potential, with a
detailed application to lattice potentials.
