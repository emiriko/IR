We present a double quantum wire system containing a coupling element in the
middle barrier between the two parallel quantum wires. We explicitly account
for the finite length of the double quantum wire with a time-dependent
switching-on potential coupling the double-wire system and the leads. By tuning
the magnetic field and the coupling window between the wires, we analyze the
time-dependent current and the charge distribution of the Coulomb interacting
many-electron states in order to explore inter-wire transfer effects for
developing efficient quantum interference nanoelectronics.
