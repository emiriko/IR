We analyze the three-dimensional kinematics of about 82000 Tycho-2 stars
belonging to the red giant clump (RGC). First, based on all of the currently
available data, we have determined new, most probable components of the
residual rotation vector of the optical realization of the ICRS/HIPPARCOS
system relative to an inertial frame of reference, \omega_x,\omega_y,\omega_z)=
(-0.11,0.24,-0.52)+/-(0.14,0.10,0.16) mas/yr. The stellar proper motions in RA
have then be corrected by applying the correction \omega_z = -0.52 mas/yr. We
show that, apart from their involvement in the general Galactic rotation
described by the Oort constants A= 15.82+/-0.21 km/s/kpc and B=-10.87+/-0.15
km/s/kpc, the RGC stars have kinematic peculiarities in the Galactic yz plane
related to the kinematics of the warped stellar-gaseous Galactic disk. We show
that the parameters of the linear Ogorodnikov-Milne model that describe the
kinematics of RGC stars in the zx plane do not differ significantly from zero.
The situation in the yz plane is different. For example, the component of the
solid-body rotation vector of the local solar neighborhood around the Galactic
x axis is M_32- = -2.6+/-0.2 km/s/kpc. Two parameters of the deformation tensor
in this plane, namely M_23^+ = 1.0+/-0.2 km/s/kpc and (M_33-M_22)= -1.3+/-0.4
km/s/kpc, also differ significantly from zero. On the whole, the kinematics of
the warped stellar-gaseous Galactic disk in the local solar neighborhood can be
described as a rotation around the Galactic X axis (close to the line of nodes
of this structure) with an angular velocity (-3.1+/-0.5) < \Omega_W <
(-4.4+/-0.5) km/s/kpc.
