A one-sided Jacobi hyperbolic singular value decomposition (HSVD) algorithm,
using a massively parallel graphics processing unit (GPU), is developed. The
algorithm also serves as the final stage of solving a symmetric indefinite
eigenvalue problem. Numerical testing demonstrates the gains in speed and
accuracy over sequential and MPI-parallelized variants of similar Jacobi-type
HSVD algorithms. Finally, possibilities of hybrid CPU--GPU parallelism are
discussed.
