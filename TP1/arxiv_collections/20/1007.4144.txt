The Discrete Nonlinear Schroedinger Equation with a random potential in one
dimension is studied as a dynamical system. It is characterized by the length,
the strength of the random potential and by the field density that determines
the effect of nonlinearity. The probability of the system to be regular is
established numerically and found to be a scaling function. This property is
used to calculate the asymptotic properties of the system in regimes beyond our
computational power.
