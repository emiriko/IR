A number system coding for the permutations generated by cyclic shift is
described. The system allows to find the rank of a permutation given how it has
been generated, and to determine a permutation given its rank. It defines a
code describing the symmetry properties of the set of permutations generated by
cyclic shift. This code is conjectured to be a combinatorial Gray code listing
the set of permutations: this corresponds to an Hamiltonian path of minimal
weight in an appropriate regular digraph.
