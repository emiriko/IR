The initial motivation for this paper is to discuss a more concrete approach
to an approximation theorem of Axler and Shields, which says that the uniform
algebra on the closed unit disc closure(D) generated by z and h --- where h is
a nowhere-holomorphic harmonic function on D that is continuous up to the
boundary --- equals the algebra of continuous functions on closure(D). The
abstract tools used by Axler and Shields make harmonicity of h an essential
condition for their result. We use the concepts of plurisubharmonicity and
polynomial convexity to show that, in fact, the same conclusion is reached if h
is replaced by h+R, where R is a non-harmonic perturbation whose Laplacian is
"small" in a certain sense.
