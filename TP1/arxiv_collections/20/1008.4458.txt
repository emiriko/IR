Given an endomorphism u of a finite-dimensional vector space over an
arbitrary field K, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for the
existence of a regular quadratic form (resp. a symplectic form) for which u is
orthogonal (resp. symplectic). A solution to this problem being already known
in the case char(K)<>2, our main contribution lies in the case char(K)=2. When
char(K)=2, we also give necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence
of a regular symmetric bilinear form for which u is orthogonal. In the case K
is finite with characteristic 2, we give necessary and sufficient conditions
for the existence of an hyperbolic quadratic form (resp. a regular
non-hyperbolic quadratic form, resp. a regular non-alternate symmetric bilinear
form) for which u is orthogonal.
