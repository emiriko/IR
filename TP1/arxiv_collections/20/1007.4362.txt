We propose a holographic model for dilepton production in proton-proton
collisions based on the exchange of vector mesons. The holographic hard wall
model is used to describe the dynamics and interactions of vector mesons and
baryons. We estimate the parameters lambda, mu, nu that characterize the
angular distribution of the produced dileptons in a region of q_T^2 << Q^2,
where perturbative QCD presents an effective strong coupling due to large
logarithm corrections.
