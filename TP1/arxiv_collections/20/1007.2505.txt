The accuracy of Milne-Eddington (ME) inversions, used to retrieve the
magnetic field vector, depends upon the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the
spectro-polarimetric observations. The SNR in real observations varies from
pixel to pixel, therefore the accuracy of the field vector also varies over the
map. The aim of this work is to study the effect of polarimetric noise on the
inference of magnetic field vector and the magnetic non-potentiality of a real
sunspot. To this end, we use Hinode SOT/SP vector magnetogram of a real sunspot
NOAA 10933 as an input to generate synthetic Stokes profiles under ME model
assumptions. We then add normally-distributed polarimetric noise of the level
0.5\% of continuum intensity to these synthetic profiles and invert them again
using ME code. This process is repeated 100 times with different realizations
of noise. It is found that within most of the sunspot area (> 90% area) the
spread in the (i) field strength is less than 8 Gauss, (ii) field inclination
is less than 1 degree, and (iii) field azimuth is less than 5 degrees. Further,
we determine the uncertainty in the magnetic non-potentiality of a sunspot as
determined by the force-free parameter alpha_g and Spatially Averaged Signed
Shear Angle (SASSA). It is found that for the sunspot studied here these
parameters are alpha_g = -3.5 +/- 0.37 (x 10^{-9} m^{-1}) and SASSA = -1.68 +/-
0.014 degrees. This suggests that the SASSA is a less dispersion
non-potentiality parameter as compared to alpha_g. Further, we examine the
effect of increasing noise levels viz. 0.01, 0.1, 0.5 and 1% of continuum
intensity and find that SASSA is less vulnerable to noise as compared to
alpha_g parameter.
