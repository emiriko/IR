This paper discusses the stability to linearized radial perturbations of
spherically symmetric thin-shell wormholes with a "phantom-like" equation of
state for the exotic matter at the throat: $P=\omega\sigma$, $\omega<0$, where
$\sigma$ is the energy-density of the shell and $P$ the surface pressure. This
equation is analogous to the generalized Chaplygin-gas equation of state used
by E.F. Eiroa. The analysis, which differes from Eiroa's in its basic approach,
is carried out for wormholes constructed from the following spacetimes:
Schwarzschild, de Sitter and anti de Sitter, Reissner-Nordstrom, and regular
charged black-hole spacetimes, as well as from black holes in dilaton and
generalized dilaton-axion gravity.
