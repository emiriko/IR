Room temperature electronic diffusion is studied in 3 mum thick epitaxial p+
GaAs lift-off films using a novel circularly polarized photoluminescence
microscope. The method is equivalent to using a standard optical microscope and
provides a contactless means to measure charge (L) and spin (L_s) diffusion
lengths. The measured values of L and L_s are in excellent agreement with the
spatially averaged polarization and a sharp reduction in these two quantities
(L from 21.3 mum to 1.2 mum and L_s from 1.3 mum to 0.8 mum) is measured with
increasing surface recombination. Outwards diffusion results in a factor of 10
increase in the polarization at the excitation spot.
