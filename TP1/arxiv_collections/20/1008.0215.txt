We show that in suitable anisotropic ferromagnets, both stable and metastable
``tilted'' phases occur, in which the magnetization ${\vec M}$ makes an angle
between zero and $180$ degrees with the externally applied ${\vec H}$. Tuning
either the magnitude of the external field or the temperature can lead to
continuous transitions between these states. A unique feature is that one of
these transitions is between two {\it metastable} states. Near the transitions
the longitudinal susceptibility becomes anomalous with an exponent which has an
{\it exact} scaling relation with the critical exponents.
