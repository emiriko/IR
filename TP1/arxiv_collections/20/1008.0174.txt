One of the most discussed peculiarities of Einstein's theory of relativity is
the twin paradox, the fact that the time between two events in space-time
appears to depend on the path between these events. We show that this time
discrepancy results only from faulty assumptions in the transition from one
reference system to another. The twin paradox does not exist. But the Lorentz
invariance of the theory has strong consequences, if we assume that it is valid
not only locally, but also on cosmic scale.
