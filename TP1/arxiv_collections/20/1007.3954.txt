We investigate solid-solid and solid-liquid transitions of elastic flexible
off-lattice polymers with Lennard-Jones monomer-monomer interaction and
anharmonic springs by means of sophisticated variants of multicanonical Monte
Carlo methods. We find that the low-temperature behavior depends strongly and
non-monotonically on the system size and exhibits broad similarities to unbound
atomic clusters. Particular emphasis is dedicated to the classification of
icosahedral and non-icosahedral low-energy polymer morphologies.
