The objective of this paper is to propose a simple tool to estimate the
absorption vs. transmission loss contributions of a multilayered blanket
unbounded in a double panel structure and thus guide its optimization. The
normal incidence airborne sound transmission loss of the double panel
structure, without structure-borne connections, is written in terms of three
main contributions; (i) sound transmission loss of the panels, (ii) sound
transmission loss of the blanket and (iii) sound absorption due to multiple
reflections inside the cavity. The method is applied to four different blankets
frequently used in automotive and aeronautic applications: a non-symmetric
multilayer made of a screen in sandwich between two porous layers and three
symmetric porous layers having different pore geometries. It is shown that the
absorption behavior of the blanket controls the acoustic behavior of the
treatment at low and medium frequencies and its transmission loss at high
frequencies. Acoustic treatment having poor sound absorption behavior can
affect the performance of the double panel structure.
