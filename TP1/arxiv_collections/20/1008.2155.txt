We study the scaling behavior of the two-flavor chiral phase transition using
an effective quark-meson model. We investigate the transition between
infinite-volume and finite-volume scaling behavior when the system is placed in
a finite box. We can estimate effects that the finite volume and the explicit
symmetry breaking by the current quark masses have on the scaling behavior
which is observed in full QCD lattice simulations. The model allows us to
explore large quark masses as well as the chiral limit in a wide range of
volumes, and extract information about the scaling regimes.In particular, we
find large scaling deviations for physical pion masses and significant finite
volume effects for pion masses that are used in current lattice simulations.
