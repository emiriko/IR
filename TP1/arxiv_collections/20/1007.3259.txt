We present results from a survey carried out by the Balloon-borne Large
Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (BLAST) on a 9 deg^2 field near the South
Ecliptic Pole at 250, 350 and 500 {\mu}m. The median 1{\sigma} depths of the
maps are 36.0, 26.4 and 18.4 mJy, respectively. We apply a statistical method
to estimate submillimeter galaxy number counts and find that they are in
agreement with other measurements made with the same instrument and with the
more recent results from Herschel/SPIRE. Thanks to the large field observed,
the new measurements give additional constraints on the bright end of the
counts. We identify 132, 89 and 61 sources with S/N>4 at 250, 350, 500 {\mu}m,
respectively and provide a multi-wavelength combined catalog of 232 sources
with a significance >4{\sigma} in at least one BLAST band. The new BLAST maps
and catalogs are available publicly at http://blastexperiment.info.
