We have investigated the detailed structure of $l$-plane singularities of
scattering amplitude saturating the Froissart bound. A self-consistent analysis
of these singularities provides us secondary terms in the Froissart bound.
These secondary terms lead to ghosts in the $l$-plane, which can only be
removed by introducing an odderon singularity. Phenomenological implications of
this analysis are also discussed.
