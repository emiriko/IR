Let P be a long range metric perturbation of the Euclidean Laplacian on R^d,
d>1. We prove local energy decay for the solutions of the wave, Klein-Gordon
and Schroedinger equations associated to P. The problem is decomposed in a low
and high frequency analysis. For the high energy part, we assume a non trapping
condition. For low (resp. high) frequencies we obtain a general result about
the local energy decay for the group exp(itf(P)) where f has a suitable
development at zero (resp. infinity).
