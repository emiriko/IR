A lot of effort in lattice simulations over the last years has been devoted
to studies of the QCD deconfinement transition. Most state-of-the-art
simulations use rooted staggered fermions, while Wilson fermions are affected
by large systematic uncertainties, such as coarse lattices or heavy sea quarks.
Here we report on an ongoing study of the transition, using two degenerate
flavours of nonperturbatively $\Ord(a)$ improved Wilson fermions. We start with
$N_{t}=12$ and 16 lattices and pion masses of 600 to 450 MeV, aiming at chiral
and continuum limits with light quarks.
