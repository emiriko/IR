The standing quasi-modes of the ideal MHD in a zero-$\beta$ cylindrical
magnetic flux tube that undergoes a longitudinal density stratification and
radial density structuring is considered. The radial structuring is assumed to
be a linearly varying density profile. Using the relevant connection formulae
of the resonant absorption, the dispersion relation for the fast MHD body waves
is derived and solved numerically to obtain both the frequencies and damping
rates of the fundamental and first-overtone, $k=1,2$ modes of both the kink
($m=1$), and fluting ($m=2$) waves. Where $k$ and $m$ are the longitudinal and
azimuthal mode numbers, respectively.
