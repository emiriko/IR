During the 2008 run RHIC provided high luminosity in both p+p and d+Au
collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}= 200$ GeV. Electromagnetic calorimeter acceptance
in STAR was enhanced by the new Forward Meson Spectrometer (FMS), and is now
almost contiguous from $-1<\eta<4$ over the full azimuth. This large acceptance
provides sensitivity to the gluon density in the nucleus down to $x\approx
10^{-3}$, as expected for $2\rightarrow 2$ parton scattering. Measurements of
the azimuthal correlation between a forward $\pi^{0}$ and an associated
particle at large rapidity are sensitive to the low-x gluon density. Data
exhibit the qualitative features expected from gluon saturation. A comparison
to calculations using the Color Glass Condensate (CGC) model is presented.
