In this paper, we consider the transition complexity of regular languages
based on the incomplete deterministic finite automata. A number of results on
Boolean operations have been obtained. It is shown that the transition
complexity results for union and complementation are very different from the
state complexity results for the same operations. However, for intersection,
the transition complexity result is similar to that of state complexity.
