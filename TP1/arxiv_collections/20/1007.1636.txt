In the present work it is studied the fermionic van Hemmen model for the spin
glass (SG) with a transverse magnetic field $\Gamma$. In this model, the spin
operators are written as a bilinear combination of fermionic operators, which
allows the analysis of the interplay between charge and spin fluctuations in
the presence of a quantum spin flipping mechanism given by $\Gamma$. The
problem is expressed in the fermionic path integral formalism. As results,
magnetic phase diagrams of temperature versus the ferromagnetic interaction are
obtained for several values of chemical potential $\mu$ and $\Gamma$. The
$\Gamma$ field suppresses the magnetic orders. The increase of $\mu$ alters the
average occupation per site that affects the magnetic phases. For instance, the
SG and the mixed SG+ferromagnetic phases are also suppressed by $\mu$. In
addition, $\mu$ can change the nature of the phase boundaries introducing a
first order transition.
