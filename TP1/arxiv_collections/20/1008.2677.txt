A Lagrangian depending on geometric variables (metric, affine connection,
gauge group generators) is given which maintains compatibility with General
Relativity. It generates the dynamics for Electromagnetism and other Gauge
Fields along with Gravitation, at the time it gives a geometric foundation for
the stress-energy tensor of continuous matter. The geometric-invariance
principle under this integration is exposed and the resulting field equations
are obtained. The theory is developed over the tangent space of a
four-dimensional real manifold and the generators become those from the
Homogenous Lorentz group.
