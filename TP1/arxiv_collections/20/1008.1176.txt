Resluts of 3D numerical simulations in the framework of pair starved polar
cap model (PSPC) for millisecond pulsars are presented. In the investigated
PSPC model electric field structure highly depends on the pulsar inclination
which is clearly visible in the computed spectra of electrons escaping pulsar
magnetosphere which become bimodal with the increasing inclination. This is an
important result for modelling very high energy radiation from globular
clusters where currently the standard power law or monoenergetic electron
distributions are used.
