We investigate the possibility of probing high reheating temperature
scenarios at the LHC, in supersymmetric models where the gravitino is the
lightest supersymmetric particle, and the stau is the next-to-lightest
supersymmetric particle. In such scenarios, the big-bang nucleosynthesis and
the gravitino abundance give a severe upper bound on the gluino mass. We find
that, if the reheating temperature is \sim 10^8 GeV or higher, the scenarios
can be tested at the LHC with an integrated luminosity of O(1 fb^{-1}) at
\sqrt{s}=7 TeV in most of the parameter space.
