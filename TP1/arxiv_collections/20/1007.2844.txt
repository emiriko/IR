In this study recent drawings made by physics students are investigated.
These drawings are part of reports made during experimenting. Aspects of
drawings are chosen for investigation that are linked to basic physical notions
like plasticity and spatiality. Also the aspects are required to link to the
motor recognition experience during drawing, of the one who made the drawing.
In this way the aim is to clarify the individual notions of space and time that
are basic to performing the experiments. These are called the attitude with
which the experiment is performed. Some aspects of these drawings tend to be
correlated in several trends. Polanyi's theory of consciousness is generalised
to explain why this correlation of aspects occurs. The correlation trends and
attitudes can be related to each other. The results are presented in a
schematic way to facilitate interpretation of the concepts introduced and of
the correlation results.
