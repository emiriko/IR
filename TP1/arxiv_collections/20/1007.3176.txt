A systematic search for gamma Dor and gamma Dor - delta Scuti hybrid
pulsators was conducted on the CoRoT LRa01 Exo-archive yielding a total of 418
gamma Dor and 274 hybrid candidates. After an automatic jump correction 194 and
167 respectively, show no more obvious jumps and were investigated in more
detail. For about 25\% of these candidates classification spectra from the
Anglo-Australian Observatory (AAO) are available. The detailed frequency
analysis and a check for combination frequencies together with spectroscopic
information allowed us to identify I) 34 gamma Dor stars which show very
different pulsation spectra where mostly two modes dominate. Furthermore, a
search for regularities in their oscillation spectra allowed to derive
recurrent period spacings for 5 of these gamma Dor stars. II) 25 clear hybrid
pulsators showing frequencies in the gamma Dor and delta Sct domain and are of
A-F spectral type.
