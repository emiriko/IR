We present sensitivity estimates for point and resolved astronomical sources
for the current design of the InfraRed Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) on the
future Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT). IRIS, with TMT's adaptive optics system,
will achieve unprecedented point source sensitivities in the near-infrared
(0.84 - 2.45 {\mu}m) when compared to systems on current 8-10m ground based
telescopes. The IRIS imager, in 5 hours of total integration, will be able to
perform a few percent photometry on 26 - 29 magnitude (AB) point sources in the
near-infrared broadband filters (Z, Y, J, H, K). The integral field
spectrograph, with a range of scales and filters, will achieve good
signal-to-noise on 22 - 26 magnitude (AB) point sources with a spectral
resolution of R=4,000 in 5 hours of total integration time. We also present
simulated 3D IRIS data of resolved high-redshift star forming galaxies (1 < z <
5), illustrating the extraordinary potential of this instrument to probe the
dynamics, assembly, and chemical abundances of galaxies in the early universe.
With its finest spatial scales, IRIS will be able to study luminous, massive,
high-redshift star forming galaxies (star formation rates ~ 10 - 100 M yr-1) at
~100 pc resolution. Utilizing the coarsest spatial scales, IRIS will be able to
observe fainter, less massive high-redshift galaxies, with integrated star
formation rates less than 1 M yr-1, yielding a factor of 3 to 10 gain in
sensitivity compared to current integral field spectrographs. The combination
of both fine and coarse spatial scales with the diffraction-limit of the TMT
will significantly advance our understanding of early galaxy formation
processes and their subsequent evolution into presentday galaxies.
