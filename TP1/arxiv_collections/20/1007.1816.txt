Kepler is a NASA mission designed to detect exoplanets and characterize the
properties of exoplanetary systems. Kepler also includes an asteroseismic
programme which is being conducted through the Kepler Asteroseismic Science
Consortium (KASC), whose 400 members are organized into 13 working groups by
type of variable star. So far data have been available from the first 7 month
of the mission containing a total of 2937 targets observed at a 1-min. cadence
for periods between 10 days and 7 months. The goals of the asteroseismic part
of the Kepler project is to perform detailed studies of stellar interiors. The
first results of the asteroseismic analysis are orders of magnitude better than
seen before, and this bodes well for how the future analysis of Kepler data for
many types of stars will impact our general understanding of stellar structure
and evolution.
