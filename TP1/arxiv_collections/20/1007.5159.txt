A model for the transmission of dengue disease is presented. It consists of
eight mutually-exclusive compartments representing the human and vector
dynamics. It also includes a control parameter (insecticide) in order to fight
the mosquitoes. The main goal of this work is to investigate the best way to
apply the control in order to effectively reduce the number of infected humans
and mosquitoes. A case study, using data of the outbreak that occurred in 2009
in Cape Verde, is presented.
