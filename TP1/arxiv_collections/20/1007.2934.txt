We investigate isolated white holes surrounded by vacuum, which correspond to
the time reversal of eternal black holes that do not evaporate. We show that
isolated white holes produce quasi- thermal Hawking radiation. The time
reversal of this radiation, incident on a black hole precursor, constitutes a
special preparation that will cause the black hole to become eternal.
