In the framework of London theory we study the novel magnetic state in
two-component superconductors with finite density of fractional flux vortices
stabilized near the surface. We show that the process of vortex entry into the
two-component superconductor consists of several steps, while the external
magnetic field increases from zero. At the first stage only vortices in one of
the order parameter components penetrate and sit at the equilibrium position
near the surface. When the magnetic field is increased further vortices in the
second order parameter component eventually enter the superconductor. Such a
complex partial vortex penetration leads to the modification of a
Bean-Livingston barrier and a magnetization curve as compared to conventional
single-component superconductors. We discuss the possibility of experimental
identification of protonic superconductivity in the projected superconducting
state of liquid metallic hydrogen and hydrogen rich alloys with the help of
partial vortex penetration effect.
