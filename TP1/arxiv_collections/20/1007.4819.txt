The emerging field of optomechanics seeks to explore the interaction between
nanomechanics and light. Recently, the exciting concept of optomechanical
crystals has been introduced, where defects in photonic crystal structures are
used to generate both localized optical and mechanical modes that interact with
each other. Here we start exploring the collective dynamics of arrays
consisting of many coupled optomechanical cells. We show that such
"optomechanical arrays" can display synchronization and that they can be
described by a modified Kuramoto model that allows to explain and predict most
of the features that will be observable in future experiments.
