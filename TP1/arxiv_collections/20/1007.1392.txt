The purpose of this paper is to generalize fermionic coherent states for
two-level systems described by pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonian \cite{Trifonov}, to
n-level systems. Central to this task is the expression of the coherent states
in terms of generalized Grassmann variables. These kind of Grassmann coherent
states satisfy bi-overcompleteness condition instead of over-completeness one,
as it is reasonably expected because of the biorthonormality of the system.
Choosing an appropriate Grassmann weight function resolution of identity is
examined. Moreover Grassmannian coherent and squeezed states of deformed group
$SU_{q}(2)$ for three level pseudo-Hermitian system are presented.
