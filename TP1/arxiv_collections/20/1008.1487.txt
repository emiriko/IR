We describe an application of Poincar\'e duality for completed homology
spaces (as defined by Emerton) to level raising for p-adic modular forms. This
allows us to give a new description of the image of Chenevier's p-adic
Jacquet-Langlands map between an eigencurve for a definite quaternion algebra
and an eigencurve for GL(2). The points on the eigencurve at which we "raise
the level" are (non-smooth) points of intersection between an "old" and a "new"
component.
