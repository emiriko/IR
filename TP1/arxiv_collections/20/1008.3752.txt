We propose a scalable way to construct a 3D cluster state for fault-tolerant
topological one-way computation (TOWC) even if the entangling two-qubit gates
succeed with a small probability. It is shown that fault-tolerant TOWC can be
performed with the success probability of the two-qubit gate such as 0.5 (0.1)
provided that the conditional error probability of the two-qubit gate is less
than 0.040% (0.016%). Furthermore, the resource usage is considerably
suppressed compared to the conventional fault-tolerant schemes with
probabilistic two-qubit gates.
