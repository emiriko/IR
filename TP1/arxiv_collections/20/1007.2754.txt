We use a simple relational framework to develop the key notions and results
on hidden variables and non-locality. The extensive literature on these topics
in the foundations of quantum mechanics is couched in terms of probabilistic
models, and properties such as locality and no-signalling are formulated
probabilistically. We show that to a remarkable extent, the main structure of
the theory, through the major No-Go theorems and beyond, survives intact under
the replacement of probability distributions by mere relations.
