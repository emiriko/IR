Single cell experiments of simple regulatory networks can markedly differ
from cell population experiments. Such differences arise from stochastic events
in individual cells that are averaged out in cell populations. For instance,
while individual cells may show sustained oscillations in the concentrations of
some proteins, such oscillations may appear damped in the population average.
In this paper we investigate the role of RNA stochastic fluctuations as a
leading force to produce a sustained excitatory behavior at the single cell
level. Opposed to some previous models, we build a fully stochastic model of a
negative feedback loop that explicitly takes into account the RNA stochastic
dynamics. We find that messenger RNA random fluctuations can be amplified
during translation and produce sustained pulses of protein expression.
Motivated by the recent appreciation of the importance of non--coding
regulatory RNAs in post--transcription regulation, we also consider the
possibility that a regulatory RNA transcript could bind to the messenger RNA
and repress translation. Our findings show that the regulatory transcript helps
reduce gene expression variability both at the single cell level and at the
cell population level.
