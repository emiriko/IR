On May 27th 2010, the Italian astronomical community learned with concern
that the National Institute for Astrophysics (INAF) was going to be suppressed,
and that its employees were going to be transferred to the National Research
Council (CNR). It was not clear if this applied to all employees (i.e. also to
researchers hired on short-term contracts), and how this was going to happen in
practice. In this letter, we give a brief historical overview of INAF and
present a short chronicle of the few eventful days that followed. Starting from
this example, we then comment on the current situation and prospects of
astronomical research in Italy.
