The concept of an objective spatial direction in special relativity is
investigated and theories assuming light-speed isotropy while accepting the
existence of a privileged spatial direction are classified. A natural
generalization of the proper time principle is introduced which makes it
possible to devise experimental tests of spatial isotropy. Several common
misunderstandings in the relativistic literature concerning the role of spatial
isotropy are clarified.
