In the present paper we introduce some expansions, based on the falling
factorials, for the Euler Gamma function and the Riemann Zeta function. In the
proofs we use the Fa\'a di Bruno formula, Bell polynomials, potential
polynomials, Mittag-Leffler polynomials, derivative polynomials and special
numbers (Eulerian numbers and Stirling numbers of both kinds). We investigate
the rate of convergence of the series and give some numerical examples.
