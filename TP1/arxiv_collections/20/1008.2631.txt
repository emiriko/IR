We have investigated the effect of unidirectional periodic potential
modulation on the fractional quantum Hall (FQH) state at filling factors nu=5/3
and 4/3. For large enough modulation amplitude, we find that the resistivity
minimum at nu=5/3 gives way to a peak that grows with decreasing temperature.
Density matrix renormalization group calculation reveals that phase transition
from FQH state to unidirectional striped state having a period sim 4 l (with l
the magnetic length) takes place at nu=1/3 (equivalent to nu=5/3 by the
particle-hole symmetry) with the increase of the modulation amplitude,
suggesting that the observed peak is the manifestation of the stripe phase.
