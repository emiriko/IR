Different imaging modes of low temperature laser scanning microscopy (LTLSM)
have been applied to probe local optical and superconducting properties, as
well as the spatial variations in thermoelectric and electronic (both dc and
rf) transport, in a YBa_2Cu_3O_6.95 /LaAlO_3 (YBCO/LAO) superconducting
microstrip resonator with micron-range resolution. Additionally, the local
sources of microwave nonlinearity (NL) were mapped in two-dimensions
simultaneously by using the LTLSM in two-tone rf intermodulation distortion
contrast mode as a function of (x,y) position of the laser beam perturbation on
the sample. The influence of the direction of individual twin-domain YBCO
blocks on its NL properties was analyzed in detail. The result shows the direct
spatial correlation between NL microwave and dc electronic transport properties
of the YBCO film that are imposed by the underlying twin-domain topology of the
LAO substrate. In these circumstances, the scale of local NL current densities
J_IM(x,y) in different areas of the YBCO microstrip quantitatively coincide
with the scale of local critical current densities J_c(x,y) measured at the
same positions.
