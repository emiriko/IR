We give an exponential upper and a quadratic lower bound on the number of
pairwise non-isotopic simple closed curves can be placed on a closed surface of
genus g such that any two of the curves intersects at most once. Although the
gap is large, both bounds are the best known for large genus. In genus one and
two, we solve the problem exactly.
  Our methods generalize to variants in which the allowed number of pairwise
intersections is odd, even, or bounded, and to surfaces with boundary
components.
