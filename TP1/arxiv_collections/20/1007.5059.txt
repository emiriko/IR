We present a comprehensive study of the symmetries of the generating
functionals of generic Langevin processes with multiplicative colored noise. We
treat both Martin-Siggia-Rose-Janssen-deDominicis and supersymmetric
formalisms. We summarize the relations between observables that they imply
including fluctuation relations, fluctuation-dissipation theorems, and
Schwinger-Dyson equations. Newtonian dynamics and their invariances follow in
the vanishing friction limit.
