Using Gauss' averaged equations, we compute the secular relativistic effects
generated by the Sun on the argument of the perihelion and the mean anomaly of
an orbit. Then we test different alternative simpler models that have been
proposed to reproduce the secular relativistic effects in the orbital elements.
Generally, models introduce artificial perturbations that are
velocity-independent but that depend on the heliocentric distance. If these
perturbations are set as an impulse in a constant timestep integrator, when the
particle approaches perihelion the generated impulse could be very strong and
badly sampled, originating a spurious orbital evolution. In order to overcome
this setback, we propose two new models based on a constant,
distance-independent, perturbation. With these models we obtain the correct
secular drift in the argument of perihelion and the expected secular orbital
evolution is reproduced. We also discuss with some detail the secular effect
generated on the mean anomaly by different models.
