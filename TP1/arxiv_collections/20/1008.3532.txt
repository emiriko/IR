We report measurements of the temperature dependent components of the
magnetic penetration depth {\lambda}(T) in single crystal samples of
YBa_2Cu_4O_8 using a radio frequency tunnel diode oscillator technique. We
observe a downturn in {\lambda}(T) at low temperatures for currents flowing
along the b and c axes but not along the a axis. The downturn in {\lambda}_b is
suppressed by a small dc field of ~0.25 T. This and the zero field anisotropy
of {\lambda}(T) likely result from proximity induced superconducting on the CuO
chains, however we also discuss the possibility that a significant part of the
anisotropy might originate from the CuO2 planes.
