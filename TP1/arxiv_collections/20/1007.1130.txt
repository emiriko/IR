We demonstrate that the extraordinary waves in indefinite metamaterials
experience (- - + +) effective metric signature. During a metric signature
change transition in such a metamaterial, a Minkowski space-time is "created"
together with large number of particles populating this space-time. Such
metamaterial models provide a table top realization of metric signature change
events suggested to occur in Bose-Einstein condensates and quantum gravity
theories.
