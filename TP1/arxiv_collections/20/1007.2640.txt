We obtain convergent power series representations for Bloch waves in periodic
high-contrast media. The material coefficient in the inclusions can be positive
or negative. The small expansion parameter is the ratio of period cell width to
wavelength, and the coefficient functions are solutions of the cell problems
arising from formal asymptotic expansion. In the case of positive coefficient,
the dispersion relation has an infinite sequence of branches, each represented
by a convergent even power series whose leading term is a branch of the
dispersion relation for the homogenized medium. In the negative case, there is
a single branch.
