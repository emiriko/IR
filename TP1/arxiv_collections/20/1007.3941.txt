Alloying Fe electrodes with V, through reduced FeV/MgO interface mismatch in
epitaxial magnetic tunnel junctions with MgO barriers, notably suppresses both
nonmagnetic (parallel) and magnetic (antiparallel) state 1/f noise and enhances
tunnelling magnetoresistance (TMR). A comparative study of the room temperature
electron transport and low frequency noise in Fe1-xVx/MgO/Fe and Fe/MgO/Fe1-xVx
MTJs with 0 <= x <= 0.25 reveals that V doping of the bottom electrode for x <
0.1 reduces in nearly 2 orders of magnitude the normalized nonmagnetic and
magnetic 1/f noise. We attribute the enhanced TMR and suppressed 1/f noise to
strongly reduced misfit and dislocation density.
