We present tomography of the circum-galactic metal distribution at redshift
1.7 to 4.5 derived from echellete spectroscopy of binary quasars. We find CIV
systems at similar redshifts in paired sightlines more often than expected for
sightline-independent redshifts. As the separation of the sightlines increases
from 36 kpc to 907 kpc, the amplitude of this clustering decreases. At the
largest separations, the CIV systems cluster similar to Lyman-break galaxies
(Adelberger et al. 2005a). The CIV systems are significantly less correlated
than these galaxies, however, at separations less than R_1 ~ 0.42 +/- 0.15 h-1
comoving Mpc. Measured in real space, i.e., transverse to the sightlines, this
length scale is significantly smaller than the break scale estimated from the
line-of-sight correlation function in redshift space (Scannapieco et al.
2006a). Using a simple model, we interpret the new real-space measurement as an
indication of the typical physical size of enriched regions. We adopt this size
for enriched regions and fit the redshift-space distortion in the line-of-sight
correlation function. The fitted velocity kick is consistent with the peculiar
velocity of galaxies as determined by the underlying mass distribution and
places an upper limit on the outflow (or inflow) speed of metals. The implied
time scale for dispersing metals is larger than the typical stellar ages of
Lyman-break galaxies (Shapley et al. 2001), and we argue that enrichment by
galaxies at z > 4.3 played a greater role in dispersing metals. To further
constrain the growth of enriched regions, we discuss empirical constraints on
the evolution of the CIV correlation function with cosmic time. This study
demonstrates the potential of tomography for measuring the metal enrichment
history of the circum-galactic medium.
