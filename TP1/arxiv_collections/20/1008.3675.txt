We show that families of coverings of an algebraic curve where the associated
Cayley-Schreier graphs form an expander family exhibit strong forms of
geometric (genus and gonality) growth. Combining this general result with
finiteness statements for rational points under such conditions, we derive
results concerning the variation of Galois representations in one-parameter
families of abelian varieties.
