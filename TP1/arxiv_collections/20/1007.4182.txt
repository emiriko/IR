We present the correspondence principle between the T-{\rho} diagram, the
Zeno line and the binodal for a given interaction potential of Lennard-Jones
type. We use this correspondence further to construct a distribution of the
Bose-Einstein type for a classical gas with the help of the new notion of Bose
condensate, making it possible to decrease fractal dimension while
simultaneously preserving the number of particles. In so doing, we use new
global distributions in number theory.
