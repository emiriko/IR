Several path integral representations for the $T$-matrix in nonrelativistic
potential scattering are given which produce the complete Born series when
expanded to all orders and the eikonal approximation if the quantum
fluctuations are suppressed. They are obtained with the help of "phantom"
degrees of freedom which take away explicit phases that diverge for asymptotic
times. Energy conservation is enforced by imposing a Faddeev-Popov-like
constraint in the velocity path integral. An attempt is made to evaluate
stochastically the real-time path integral for potential scattering and
generalizations to relativistic scattering are discussed.
