We study periodic crystalline spin textures in spinor condensates with
dipolar interactions via a systematic symmetry analysis of the low-energy
effective theory. By considering symmetry operations which combine real and
spin space operations, we classify symmetry groups consistent with non-trivial
experimental and theoretical constraints. Minimizing the energy within each
symmetry class allows us to explore possible ground states.
