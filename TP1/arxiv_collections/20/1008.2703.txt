The quasi-linear bands in the topologically trivial skutterudite insulator
CoSb$_3$ are studied under adiabatic, symmetry-conserving displacement of the
Sb sublattice. In this cubic, time-reversal and inversion symmetric system, a
transition from trivial insulator to topological point Fermi surface system
occurs through a critical point in which massless (Dirac) bands are {\it
degenerate} with massive bands. Spin-orbit coupling does not alter the
character of the transition. The mineral skutterudite (CoSb$_3$) is very near
the critical point in its natural state.
