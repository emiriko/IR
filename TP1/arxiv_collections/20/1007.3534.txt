We obtain mirror formulas for the genus 1 Gromov-Witten invariants of
projective Calabi-Yau complete intersections. We follow the approach previously
used for projective hypersurfaces by extending the scope of its algebraic
results; there is little change in the geometric aspects. As an application, we
check the genus 1 BPS integrality predictions in low degrees for all projective
complete intersections of dimensions 3, 4, and 5.
