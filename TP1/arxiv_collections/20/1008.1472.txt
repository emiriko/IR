Within the t-t'-J model, the doping dependence of the Meissner effect in
cuprate superconductors is studied based on the kinetic energy driven
superconducting mechanism. Following the linear response theory, it is shown
that the electromagnetic response consists of two parts, the diamagnetic
current and the paramagnetic current, which exactly cancels the diamagnetic
term in the normal state, and then the Meissner effect is obtained for all the
temperature $T\leq T_{c}$ throughout the superconducting dome. By considering
the two-dimensional geometry of cuprate superconductors within the specular
reflection model, the main features of the doping and temperature dependence of
the local magnetic field profile, the magnetic field penetration depth, and the
superfluid density observed on cuprate superconductors are well reproduced. In
particular, it is shown that in analogy to the domelike shape of the doping
dependent superconducting transition temperature, the maximal superfluid
density occurs around the critical doping $\delta\approx 0.195$, and then
decreases in both lower doped and higher doped regimes.
