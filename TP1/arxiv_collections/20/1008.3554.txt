A random perturbation of a deterministic Navier-Stokes equation is considered
in the form of an SPDE with Wick type nonlinearity. The nonlinear term of the
perturbation can be characterized as the highest stochastic order approximation
of the original nonlinear term u\nabla u. This perturbation is unbiased in that
the expectation of a solution of the perturbed equation solves the
deterministic Navier-Stokes equation. The perturbed equation is solved in the
space of generalized stochastic processes using the Cameron-Martin version of
the Wiener chaos expansion. It is shown that the generalized solution is a
Markov process and scales effectively by Catalan numbers.
