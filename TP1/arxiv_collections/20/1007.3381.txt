This paper presents a new technique to calculate the evolution of a quantum
wavefunction in a chosen spatial basis by minimizing the accumulated action.
Introduction of a finite temporal basis reduces the problem to a set of linear
equations, while an appropriate choice of temporal basis set offers improved
convergence relative to methods based on matrix exponentiation for a class of
physically relevant problems.
