We calculate transmission eigenvalue distributions for Pt-benzene-Pt and
Pt-butadiene-Pt junctions using realistic state-of-the-art many-body
techniques. An effective field theory of interacting $\pi$-electrons is used to
include screening and van der Waals interactions with the metal electrodes. We
find that the number of dominant transmission channels in a molecular junction
is equal to the degeneracy of the molecular orbital closest to the metal Fermi
level.
