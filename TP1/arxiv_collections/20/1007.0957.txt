We investigate a steady flow of incompressible fluid in the plane. The motion
is governed by the Navier-Stokes equations with prescribed velocity $u_\infty$
at infinity. The main result shows the existence of unique solutions for
arbitrary force, provided sufficient largeness of $u_\infty$. Furthermore a
spacial structure of the solution is obtained in comparison with the Oseen
flow. A key element of our new approach is based on a setting which treats the
directino of the flow as \emph{time} direction. The analysis is done in
framework of the Fourier transform taken in one (perpendicular) direction and a
special choice of function spaces which take into account the inhomogeneous
character of the symbol of the Oseen system. From that point of view our
technique can be used as an effective tool in examining spatial asymptotics of
solutions to other systems modeled by elliptic equations.
