The paper gives a systematic review of the basic ideas of (non-relativistic)
quantum mechanics including all changes that result from previous work of the
authors. This shows that the new theory is self-consistent and (in certain
sense) complete. The most important changes are: 1) A new realist
interpretation of quantum mechanics based on the observation that there are
enough objective properties of quantum systems if one looks for them elsewhere
than among values of observables. This enables us to introduce the notion of
quantum object. 2) Classical systems are defined as macroscopic quantum objects
in states close to maximum entropy. For classical mechanics, new states of such
kind are introduced, the so-called maximum-entropy packets, and shown to
approximate classical dynamics better than Gaussian wave packets. 3) A new
solution of quantum measurement problem is proposed for measurements that are
performed on microsystems. First, it is assumed that readings of registration
apparatuses are always signals from detectors. This implies restrictions on
what is observable. Second, an application of the cluster separability
principle leads to the key notion of the paper: the separation status of
microsystems. The processes of preparation and registration include changes of
separation status. A crucial observation is that standard quantum mechanics
does not prescribe the evolution during such changes. This gap can be filled by
new rules without contradicting the rest of quantum mechanics. As an example of
such a new rule, Beltrametti-Cassinelli-Lahti model of measurement is modified
and shown then to satisfy both the probability-reproducibility and the
objectification requirements.
