We propose a natural way to create quantum-confined regions in graphene in a
system that allows large-scale device integration. We show, using
first-principles calculations, that a single graphene layer on a trenched
region of $[000\bar{1}]$ $SiC$ mimics i)the energy bands around the Fermi level
and ii) the magnetic properties of free-standing graphene nanoribbons.
Depending on the trench direction, either zigzag or armchair nanoribbons are
mimicked. This behavior occurs because a single graphene layer over a $SiC$
surface loses the graphene-like properties, which are restored solely over the
trenches, providing in this way a confined strip region.
