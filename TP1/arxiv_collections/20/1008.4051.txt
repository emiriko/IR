In this paper, we consider the problem of optimum multi-domain real-time
beamforming and high-precision beam pattern positioning in application to very
large wideband array antennas, particularly to the Square Kilometre Array (SKA)
aperture array antenna. We present a new structure for wideband space-frequency
beamforming and beamsteering that maximizes detectability of cosmic signals
over the array operational frequency range.
