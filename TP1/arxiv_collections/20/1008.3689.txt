We reprove the Lefschetz trace formula for stacks (in the context of derived
categories and the six operations for stacks developed by Laszlo and Olsson),
and give the meromorphic continuation of L-series (in particular, zeta
functions) of Artin stacks over a finite field. We also give an upper bound for
the weights of the cohomology groups of stacks, and an "independence of l"
result for a certain class of quotient stacks.
