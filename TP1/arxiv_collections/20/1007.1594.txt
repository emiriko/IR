We report an extensive study on the intrinsic bulk electronic structure of
the high-temperature superconductor CeFeAsO0.89F0.11 and its parent compound
CeFeAsO by soft and hard x-ray photoemission, x-ray absorption and soft-x-ray
emission spectroscopies. The complementary surface/bulk probing depth, and the
elemental and chemical sensitivity of these techniques allows resolving the
intrinsic electronic structure of each element and correlating it with the
local structure, which has been probed by extended-x-ray absorption fine
structure spectroscopy. The measurements indicate a predominant 4f1 (i.e. Ce3+)
initial state configuration for Cerium and an effective valence-band-to-4f
charge-transfer screening of the core hole. The spectra also reveal the
presence of a small Ce f0 initial state configuration, which we assign to the
occurrence of an intermediate valence state. The data reveal a reasonably good
agreement with the partial density of states as obtained in standard density
functional calculations over a large energy range. Implications for the
electronic structure of these materials are discussed.
