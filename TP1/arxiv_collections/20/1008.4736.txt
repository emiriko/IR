We introduce a process for the fabrication of high quality, spatially
isolated nano-diamonds on iridium via microwave plasma assisted CVD-growth. We
perform spectroscopy of single silicon-vacancy (SiV)-centres produced during
the growth of the nano-diamonds. The colour centres exhibit extraordinary
narrow zero-phonon-lines down to 0.7 nm at room temperature. Single photon
count rates up to 4.8 Mcps at saturation make these SiV-centres the brightest
diamond based single photon sources to date. We measure for the first time the
fine structure of a single SiV-centre thus confirming the atomic composition of
the investigated colour centres.
