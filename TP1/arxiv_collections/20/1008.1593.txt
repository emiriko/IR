We analyse three different New Physics scenarios for Delta F=2
flavour-changing neutral currents in the quark sector in the light of recent
data on neutral-meson mixing. We parametrise generic New Physics contributions
to B_q-Bbar_q mixing (q=d,s), in terms of one complex quantity Delta_q, while
three parameters Delta_K^tt, Delta_K^ct and Delta_K^cc are needed to describe
K-Kbar mixing. In Scenario I, we consider uncorrelated New Physics
contributions in the B_d, B_s, and K sectors. In this scenario, it is only
possible to constrain the parameters Delta_d and Delta_s whereas there are no
non-trivial constraints on the kaon parameters. In Scenario II, we study the
case of Minimal Flavour Violation (MFV) and small bottom Yukawa coupling and
Scenario III is the generic MFV case with large bottom Yukawa couplings. Our
quantitative analyses consist of global CKM fits within the Rfit frequentist
statistical approach, determining the Standard Model parameters and the new
physics parameters of the studied scenarios simultaneously. We find that the
recent measurements indicating discrepancies with the Standard Model are well
accomodated in Scenarios I and III with new mixing phases, with a slight
preference for Scenario I that permits different new CP phases in the B_d and
B_s systems. Within our statistical framework, we find evidence of New Physics
in both B_d and B_s systems. The Standard-Model hypothesis Delta_d=Delta_s=1 is
disfavoured with p-values of 3.6 sigma and 3.3 sigma in Scenarios I and III,
respectively. We also present an exhaustive list of numerical predictions in
each scenario. In particular, we predict the CP phase in B_s -> J psi phi and
the difference between the B_s and B_d semileptonic asymmetries, which will be
both measured by the LHCb experiment.
