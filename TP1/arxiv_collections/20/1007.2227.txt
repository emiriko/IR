We present a combined experimental and theoretical study on strong-field
ionization of a three-dimensionally oriented asymmetric top molecule,
benzonitrile (C$_7$H$_5$N), by circularly polarized, nonresonant femtosecond
laser pulses. Prior to the interaction with the strong field, the molecules are
quantum-state selected using a deflector, and 3-dimensionally (3D) aligned and
oriented adiabatically using an elliptically polarized laser pulse in
combination with a static electric field. A characteristic splitting in the
molecular frame photoelectron momentum distribution reveals the position of the
nodal planes of the molecular orbitals from which ionization occurs. The
experimental results are supported by a theoretical tunneling model that
includes and quantifies the splitting in the momentum distribution. The focus
of the present article is to understand strong-field ionization from
3D-oriented asymmetric top molecules, in particular the suppression of electron
emission in nodal planes of molecular orbitals. In the preceding article
[Dimitrovski et al., Phys. Rev. A 83, 023405 (2011)] the focus is to understand
the strong-field ionization of one-dimensionally-oriented polar molecules, in
particular asymmetries in the emission direction of the photoelectrons.
