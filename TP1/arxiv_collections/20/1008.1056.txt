We study coupled irreversible processes. For linear or linearized kinetics
with microreversibility, $\dot{x}=Kx$, the kinetic operator $K$ is symmetric in
the entropic inner product. This form of Onsager's reciprocal relations implies
that the shift in time, $\exp (Kt)$, is also a symmetric operator. This
generates the reciprocity relations between the kinetic curves. For example,
for the Master equation, if we start the process from the $i$th pure state and
measure the probability $p_j(t)$ of the $j$th state ($j\neq i$), and,
similarly, measure $p_i(t)$ for the process, which starts at the $j$th pure
state, then the ratio of these two probabilities $p_j(t)/p_i(t)$ is constant in
time and coincides with the ratio of the equilibrium probabilities. We study
similar and more general reciprocal relations between the kinetic curves. The
experimental evidence provided as an example is from the reversible water gas
shift reaction over iron oxide catalyst. The experimental data are obtained
using Temporal Analysis of Products (TAP) pulse-response studies. These offer
excellent confirmation within the experimental error.
