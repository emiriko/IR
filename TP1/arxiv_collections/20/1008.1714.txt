This reports on the fundamental objects revealed by Ross Street, which he
called `orientals'. Street's work was in part inspired by Robert's attempts to
use N-category ideas to construct nets of C*-algebras in Minkowski space for
applications to relativistic quantum field theory: Roberts' additional
challenge was that `no amount of staring at the low dimensional cocycle
conditions would reveal the pattern for higher dimensions'. This report takes
up this challenge, presenting a natural inductive construction of explicit
cubical cocyle conditions, and gives three ways in which the simplicial ones
can be derived from these. (A dual string-diagram version of this work, giving
rise to a Pascal's triangle of diagrams for cocycle conditions, has been
described elsewhere by Street). A consequence of this work is that the
Yang-Baxter equation, the `pentagon of pentagons', and higher simplex
equations, are in essence different manifestations of the same underlying
abstract structure. There has been recent interest in higher-categories, by
computer scientists investigating concurrency theory, as well as by physicists,
among others. The dual `string' version of this paper makes clear the
relationship with higher-dimensional simplex equations in physics. Much work in
this area has been done since these notes were written: no attempt has been
made to update the original report. However, all diagrams have been redrawn by
computer, replacing all original hand-drawn pictures.
