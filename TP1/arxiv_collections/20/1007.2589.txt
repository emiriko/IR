On the basis of an exact vacuum solution of Einstein's equations, {\it vis}.
the pencil-of-light field, we study the light-like motion of test and non-test
objects. We also consider the quantum theoretical interaction of massless
scalar particles through virtual gravitons. The dragging phenomenon is
manifested and its agreement with astronomical observations established.
