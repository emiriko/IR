We present data on the magnetic and magneto-elastic coupling in the hexagonal
multiferroic manganite LuMnO3 from inelastic neutron scattering, magnetization
and thermal expansion measurements. We measured the magnon dispersion along the
main symmetry directions and used this data to determine the principal exchange
parameters from a spin-wave model. An analysis of the magnetic anisotropy in
terms of the crystal field acting on the Mn is presented. We compare the
results for LuMnO3 with data on other hexagonal RMnO3 compounds.
