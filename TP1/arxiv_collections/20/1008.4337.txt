An elementary introduction to functional methods and the Schwinger-Dyson
equations is presented. Emphasis is placed on practical topics not normally
covered in textbooks, such as a diagrammatic method for generating equations at
high order, different forms of Schwinger-Dyson equations, renormalisation, and
methods for solving Schwinger-Dyson equations.
