We argue that in the TeV-gravity scenario high energy hadrons colliding on
the 3-brane embedded in D=4+n-dimensional spacetime, with n dimensions smaller
than the hadron size, can be considered as cosmic membranes. In the
5-dimensional case these cosmic membranes produce effects similar to cosmic
strings in the 4-dimensional world. We calculate the corrections to the eikonal
approximation for the gravitational scattering of partons due to the presence
of effective hadron cosmic membranes. Cosmic membranes dominate the momentum
lost in the longitudinal direction for colliding particles that opens new
channels for particle decays.
