Although well established observations on cosmological, cluster, and galactic
scales strongly suggest the existence of dark matter (DM), our understanding of
its non-gravitational properties is still lacking. I review basic aspects of
particle dark matter and detection strategies, outlining the state of the art
for searches in direct detection experiments, indirect observations, and
particle production at colliders. A particular focus is dedicated to recent
experimental results which could have provided hints for unveiling the DM
nature.
