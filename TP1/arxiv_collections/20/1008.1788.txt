We investigate the spin-polarization of the ferromagnetic semiconductor
(Ga,Mn)As by point contact Andreev reflection spectroscopy. The conductance
spectra are analyzed using a recent theoretical model that accounts for
momentum- and spin-dependent scattering at the interface. This allows us to fit
the data without resorting, as in the case of the standard spin-dependent
Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk (BTK) model, to an effective temperature or a
statistical distribution of superconducting gaps. We find a transport
polarization PC{\approx}57%, in considerably better agreement with the
k{\cdot}p kinetic-exchange model of (Ga,Mn)As, than the significantly larger
estimates inferred from the BTK model. The temperature dependence of the
conductance spectra is fully analyzed.
