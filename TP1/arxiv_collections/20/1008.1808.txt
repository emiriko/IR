Regions of the ocean's thermocline unstable to salt fingering are often
observed to host thermohaline staircases, stacks of deep well-mixed convective
layers separated by thin stably-stratified interfaces. Decades after their
discovery, however, their origin remains controversial. In this paper we use 3D
direct numerical simulations to shed light on the problem. We study the
evolution of an analogous double-diffusive system, starting from an initial
statistically homogeneous fingering state and find that it spontaneously
transforms into a layered state. By analysing our results in the light of the
mean-field theory developed in Paper I, a clear picture of the sequence of
events resulting in the staircase formation emerges. A collective instability
of homogeneous fingering convection first excites a field of gravity waves,
with a well-defined vertical wavelength. However, the waves saturate early
through regular but localized breaking events, and are not directly responsible
for the formation of the staircase. Meanwhile, slower-growing, horizontally
invariant but vertically quasi-periodic gamma-modes are also excited and grow
according to the gamma-instability mechanism. Our results suggest that the
nonlinear interaction between these various mean-field modes of instability
leads to the selection of one particular gamma-mode as the staircase
progenitor. Upon reaching a critical amplitude, this progenitor overturns into
a fully-formed staircase. We conclude by extending the results of our
simulations to real oceanic parameter values, and find that the progenitor
gamma-mode is expected to grow on a timescale of a few hours, and leads to the
formation of a thermohaline staircase in about one day with an initial spacing
of the order of one to two metres.
