FS CMa type stars are a recently described group of objects with the B[e]
phenomenon that exhibit strong emission-line spectra and strong IR excesses. In
this paper we report the first attempt for a detailed modeling of IRAS
00470+6429, for which we have the best set of observations. Our modeling is
based on two key assumptions: the star has a main-sequence luminosity for its
spectral type (B2) and the circumstellar envelope is bimodal, composed of a
slowly outflowing disk-like wind and a fast polar wind. Both outflows are
assumed to be purely radial. We adopt a novel approach to describe the dust
formation site in the wind that employs timescale arguments for grain
condensation and a self-consistent solution for the dust destruction surface.
With the above assumptions we were able to reproduce satisfactorily many
observational properties of IRAS 00470+6429, including the H line profiles and
the overall shape of the spectral energy distribution. Our adopted recipe for
dust formation proved successful in reproducing the correct amount of dust
formed in the circumstellar envelope. Possible shortcomings of our model, as
well as suggestions for future improvements, are discussed.
