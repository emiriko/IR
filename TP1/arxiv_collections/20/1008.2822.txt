We calculate Tc map in region of weak electron-phonon coupling based on
simple phonon spectrum. By using linear-response method and density functional
theory, we calculate phonon spectra and Eliashberg functions of simple metals
under pressure. Based on the evolutions of superconducting parameters of simple
metals on the Tc map with increasing pressure, we find that there are two
different responses to pressure for simple metals: (1) enhancing
electron-phonon interaction $\lambda$ such as for La and Li, (2) increasing
phonon frequency such as for Pb, Pt. The $\lambda$ threshold effect is found,
which origins from the competition between electron-phonon interaction and
electron-electron Coulomb interaction and is the reason why Tc of most
superconductors of simple metals are higher than 0.1K.
