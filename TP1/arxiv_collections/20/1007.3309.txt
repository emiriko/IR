We undertake an exact numerical study of the effects of disorder on the
Anderson localization of electronic states in graphene. Analyzing the scaling
behaviors of inverse participation ratio and geometrically averaged density of
states, we find that Anderson metal-insulator transition can be introduced by
the presence of quenched random disorder. In contrast with the conventional
picture of localization, four mobility edges can be observed for the honeycomb
lattice with specific disorder strength and impurity concentration. Considering
the screening effects of interactions on disorder potentials, the experimental
findings of the scale enlarges of puddles can be explained by reviewing the
effects of both interactions and disorder.
