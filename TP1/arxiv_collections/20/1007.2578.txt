A bipartite Bell inequality is derived which is maximally violated on the
two-qubit state space if measurements describable by positive operator valued
measure (POVM) elements are allowed rather than restricting the possible
measurements to projective ones. In particular, the presented Bell inequality
requires POVMs in order to be maximally violated by a maximally entangled
two-qubit state. This answers a question raised by N. Gisin.
