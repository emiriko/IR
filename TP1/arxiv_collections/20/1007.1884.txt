We demonstrate feedback cooling of the motion of a single rubidium atom
trapped in a high-finesse optical resonator to a temperature of about 160 \mu
K. Time-dependent transmission and intensity-correlation measurements prove the
reduction of the atomic position uncertainty. The feedback increases the 1/e
storage time into the one second regime, 30 times longer than without feedback.
Feedback cooling therefore rivals state-of-the-art laser cooling, but with the
advantages that it requires less optical access and exhibits less optical
pumping.
