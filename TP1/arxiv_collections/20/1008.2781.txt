We propose four different mechanisms responsible for paramagnetic or
diamagnetic persistent currents in normal metal rings and determine the
circumstances for change of the current from paramagnetic to diamagnetic ones
and {\it vice versa}. It might qualitatively reproduce the experimental results
of Bluhm et al. (Phys. Rev. Lett. 102, 136802 (2009)).
