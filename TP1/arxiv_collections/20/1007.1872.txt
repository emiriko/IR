The D0 collaboration has recently announced evidence for a dimuon CP
asymmetry in B_{d,s} decays of order one percent. If confirmed, this asymmetry
requires new physics. We argue that for minimally flavor violating (MFV) new
physics, and at low tan beta=v_u/v_d, there are only two four-quark operators
(Q_{2,3}) that can provide the required CP violating effect. The scale of such
new physics must lie below 260 GeV sqrt{tan beta}. The effect is universal in
the B_s and B_d systems, leading to S_{psi K}~sin(2beta)-0.15 and S_{psi
phi}~0.25. The effects on epsilon_K and on electric dipole moments are
negligible. The most plausible mechanism is tree-level scalar exchange. MFV
supersymmetry with low tan beta will be excluded. Finally, we explain how a
pattern of deviations from the Standard Model predictions for S_{psi phi},
S_{psi K} and epsilon_K can be used to test MFV and, if MFV holds, to probe its
structure in detail.
