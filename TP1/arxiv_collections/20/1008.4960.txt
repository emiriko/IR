We have shown that the red cells found in the Red Rain (which fell on Kerala,
India, in 2001) survive and grow after incubation for periods of up to two
hours at 121 oC . Under these conditions daughter cells appear within the
original mother cells and the number of cells in the samples increases with
length of exposure to 121 oC. No such increase in cells occurs at room
temperature, suggesting that the increase in daughter cells is brought about by
exposure of the Red Rain cells to high temperatures. This is an independent
confirmation of results reported earlier by two of the present authors,
claiming that the cells can replicate under high pressure at temperatures up to
300 oC. The flourescence behaviour of the red cells is shown to be in
remarkable correspondence with the extended red emission observed in the Red
Rectangle planetary nebula and other galactic and extragalactic dust clouds,
suggesting, though not proving, an extraterrestrial origin.
