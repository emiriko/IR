When a metal undergoes a transition to an insulator it will lose its
electronic Fermi surface. Interestingly in some situations a `ghost' Fermi
surface of electrically neutral spin carrying fermions may survive into the
insulator. Such a novel ghost Fermi surface has been proposed to underlie the
properties of a few different materials but its direct detection has proven
elusive. In this paper we show that the ghost Fermi surface leads to slowly
decaying spatial oscillations of the electron density near impurities or other
defects. These and related oscillations stem from the sharpness of the ghost
Fermi surface and are direct analogs of the familiar Friedel oscillations in
metals. The oscillation period contains geometric information about the shape
of the ghost Fermi surface which can be potentially exploited to detect its
existence.
