Recently we discussed a multimetric gravity theory containing several copies
of standard model matter each of which couples to its own metric tensor. This
construction contained dark matter sectors interacting repulsively with the
visible matter sector, and was shown to lead to cosmological late-time
acceleration. In order to test the theory with high-precision experiments
within the solar system we here construct a simple extension of the
parametrized post-Newtonian (PPN) formalism for multimetric gravitational
backgrounds. We show that a simplified version of this extended formalism
allows the computation of a subset of the PPN parameters from the linearized
field equations. Applying the simplified formalism we find that the PPN
parameters of our theory do not agree with the observed values, but we are able
to improve the theory so that it becomes consistent with experiments of
post-Newtonian gravity and still features its promising cosmological
properties.
