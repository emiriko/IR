Dimension growth functions of groups have been introduced by Gromov in 1999.
We prove that every solvable finitely generated subgroups of the R. Thompson
group $F$ has polynomial dimension growth while the group $F$ itself, and some
solvable groups of class 3 have exponential dimension growth with exponential
control. We describe connections between dimension growth, expansion properties
of finite graphs and the Ramsey theory.
