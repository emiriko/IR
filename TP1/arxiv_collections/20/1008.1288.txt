Using classical molecular dynamics simulation, we have studied the effect of
edge-passivation by hydrogen (H-passivation) and isotope mixture (with random
or supperlattice distributions) on the thermal conductivity of rectangular
graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) (of several nanometers in size). We found that the
thermal conductivity is considerably reduced by the edge H-passivation. We also
find that the isotope mixing can reduce the thermal conductivities, with the
supperlattice distribution giving rise to more reduction than the random
distribution. These results can be useful in nanoscale engineering of thermal
transport and heat management using GNRs.
