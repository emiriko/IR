First principles calculations of the damping rates (inverse inelastic
lifetimes) of low energy quasiparticles in bulk Pb are presented. Damping rates
are obtained both for excited electrons and holes with energies up to 8 eV on a
set of k vectors throughout the Brillouin zone (BZ). Strong localization
effects in the calculated lifetimes are found. Averaged over the BZ inelastic
lifetimes versus quasiparticle energy are reported as well. In addition, the
effect of the spin-orbit induced splitting in the band structure on the
calculated lifetimes in Pb is investigated.
