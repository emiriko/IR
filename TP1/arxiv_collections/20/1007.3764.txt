In this paper, we apply the thermodynamic framework recently put into place
by Rajagopal and co-workers, to develop rate-type models for viscoelastic
fluids which do not possess instantaneous elasticity. To illustrate the
capabilities of such models we make a specific choice for the specific
Helmholtz potential and the rate of dissipation and consider the creep and
stress relaxation response associated with the model. Given specific forms for
the Helmholtz potential and the rate of dissipation, the rate of dissipation is
maximized with the constraint that the difference between the stress power and
the rate of change of Helmholtz potential is equal to the rate of dissipation
and any other constraint that may be applicable such as incompressibility. We
show that the model that is developed exhibits fluid-like characteristics and
is incapable of instantaneous elastic response. It also includes Maxwell-like
and Kelvin-Voigt-like viscoelastic materials (when certain material moduli take
special values).
