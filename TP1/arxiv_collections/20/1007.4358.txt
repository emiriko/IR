We report the realization of a fiber coupled polarization entangled
photon-pair source at 1310 nm based on a birefringent titanium in-diffused
waveguide integrated on periodically poled lithium niobate. By taking advantage
of a dedicated and high-performance setup, we characterized the quantum
properties of the pairs by measuring two-photon interference in both
Hong-Ou-Mandel and standard Bell inequality configurations. We obtained, for
the two sets of measurements, interference net visibilities reaching nearly
100%, which represent important and competitive results compared to similar
waveguide-based configurations already reported. These results prove the
relevance of our approach as an enabling technology for long-distance quantum
communication.
