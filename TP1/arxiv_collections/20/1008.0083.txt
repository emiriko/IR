In this paper we present mid-infrared spectra of a comprehensive set of
Herbig Ae/Be stars observed with the Spitzer Space Telescope. The
signal-to-noise ratio of these spectra is very high, ranging between about a
hundred and several hundreds. During the analysis of these data we tested the
validity of standard protoplanetary dust models and studied grain growth and
crystal formation. On the basis of the analyzed spectra, the major constituents
of protoplanetary dust around Herbig Ae/Be stars are amorphous silicates with
olivine and pyroxene stoichiometry, crystalline forsterite and enstatite and
silica. No other solid state features, indicating other abundant dust species,
are present in the Spitzer spectra. Deviations of the synthetic spectra from
the observations are most likely related to grain shape effects and
uncertainties in the iron content of the dust grains. Our analysis revealed
that larger grains are more abundant in the disk atmosphere of flatter disks
than in that of flared disks, indicating that grain growth and sedimentation
decrease the disk flaring. We did not find, however, correlations between the
value of crystallinity and any of the investigated system parameters. Our
analysis shows that enstatite is more concentrated toward the warm inner disk
than forsterite, in contrast to predictions of equilibrium condensation models.
None of the three crystal formation mechanisms proposed so far can alone
explain all our findings. It is very likely that all three play at least some
role in the formation of crystalline silicates.
