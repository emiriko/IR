We report the successful extraction of spin polarized current from the
organic-based room temperature ferrimagnetic semiconductor V[TCNE]x (x~2, TCNE:
tetracyanoethylene; TC ~ 400 K, EG ~ 0.5 eV, s ~ 10-2 S/cm) and its subsequent
injection into a GaAs/AlGaAs light-emitting diode (LED). The spin current
tracks the magnetization of V[TCNE]x~2, is weakly temperature dependent, and
exhibits heavy hole / light hole asymmetry. This result has implications for
room temperature spintronics and the use of inorganic materials to probe spin
physics in organic and molecular systems.
