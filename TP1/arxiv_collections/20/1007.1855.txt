Aim of this work is to extend the results of Cl\'ement, Da Prato & Pr\"uss on
the fractional white noise perturbation with Hurst parameter 0<H<1. We will
obtain similar results and it will turn out that the regularity of the solution
u(t) of the stochastic Volterra equation increases with Hurst parameter H.
