A comparison of modeled and observed Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) is
presented. 3D Eulerian multiphase chemistry-transport model TCAM is employed
for simulating AOD at mesoscale. MODIS satellite sensor and AERONET photometer
AOD are used for comparing spatial patterns and temporal timeseries. TCAM
simulations for year 2004 over a domain containing Po-Valley and nearly whole
Northern Italy are employed. For the computation of AOD, a configuration of
external mixing of the chemical species is considered. Furthermore, a
parametrization of the effect of moisture affecting both aerosol size and
composition is used. An analysis of the contributions of the granulometric
classes to the extinction coefficient reveals the dominant role of the
inorganic compounds of submicron size. For the analysis of spatial patterns,
summer and winter case study are considered. TCAM AOD reproduces spatial
patterns similar to those retrieved from space, but AOD values are generally
smaller by an order of magnitude. However, accounting also for moisture, TCAM
AOD significantly increases to values of the same magnitude of the observed
ones. The temporal performance of model AOD is tested in correspondence of
AERONET site "Venise" and some temporal structures are reproduced. The results
suggest encouraging perspectives in view of satellite AOD assimilation also at
the mesoscale and not only at the global and regional scale as already tested
in the literature.
