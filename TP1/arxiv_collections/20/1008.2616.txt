We investigate theoretically, numerically and experimentally nonlinear
optical waves in an absorbing out-of-equilibrium colloidal material at the
gelification transition. At sufficiently high optical intensity, absorption is
frustrated and light propagates into the medium. The process is mediated by the
formation of a matter-shock wave due to optically induced thermodiffusion, and
largely resembles the mechanism of hydrodynamical supercavitation, as it is
accompanied by a dynamic phase-transition region between the beam and the
absorbing material.
