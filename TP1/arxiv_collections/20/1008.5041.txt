A priority of physics instruction is to help students make the connection
between the formulae they think they are required to memorize and the real
world in which they interact every day. If you ask students to describe a
situation in real life involving physical principles, the most commonly cited
examples will pertain to vehicular motion. One situation in real life involving
physical principles is vehicle dynamics. Even students who have little interest
in physics eagerly discuss problems like how much a car can decelerate
travelling in a flat turn or how tricks like the Wheely can be performed on a
motorcycle. In the physics classroom, the motion of automotive vehicles is
probably the most interesting manifestation of the principles of physics. The
laws of physics limiting movements of vehicles are deduced here in a simple
derivation suited for classroom demonstration as well as for homework. Due to
limits on frictional forces there are subsequent limits for acceleration,
deceleration and speed in a flat turn. Frictional forces also determine the
behaviour of a vehicle at rapid speed in a turn.
