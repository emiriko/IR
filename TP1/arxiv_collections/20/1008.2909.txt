Multi-dimensional arrays are among the most fundamental and most useful data
structures of all. In C++, excellent template libraries exist for arrays whose
dimension is fixed at runtime. Arrays whose dimension can change at runtime
have been implemented in C. However, a generic object-oriented C++
implementation of runtime-flexible arrays has so far been missing. In this
article, we discuss our new implementation called Marray, a package of class
templates that fills this gap. Marray is based on views as an underlying
concept. This concept brings some of the flexibility known from script
languages such as R and MATLAB to C++. Marray is free both for commercial and
non-commercial use and is publicly available from www.andres.sc/marray
