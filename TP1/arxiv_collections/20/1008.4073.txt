A concept of implicit links for Complex Networks has been defined and a new
value - cohesion factor, which allows to evaluate numerically the presence of
such connection between any two nodes, has been introduced. We introduce a
generalization of such characteristics as the betweenness, which allows to rank
network nodes in more details. The effectiveness of the proposed concepts is
shown by the numerical examples.
