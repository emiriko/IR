We present the results of transmittance experiments on GdMnO3 multiferroic
manganite in the far infrared frequency range. The spectra allow to obtain the
positions and the intensity of the high frequency electromagnon (~ 75 cm-1) in
this compound. We present the comparative analysis of the high and low
frequency electromagnons across the phase diagram of GdMnO3. The traces of the
electromagnon excitation can be detected even at room temperature, i.e. deeply
in the paramagnetic state.
