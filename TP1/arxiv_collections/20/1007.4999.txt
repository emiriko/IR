A FORM program which is used to efficiently expand in components pure spinor
superfield expressions of kinematic factors is presented and comments on how it
works are made. It is highly customizable using the standard features of FORM
and can be used to help obtaining superstring effective actions from the
scattering amplitudes computed with the pure spinor formalism.
