Weblog is the fourth way of network exchange after Email, BBS and MSN. Most
bloggers begin to write blogs with great interest, and then their interests
gradually achieve a balance with the passage of time. In order to describe the
phenomenon that people's interest in something gradually decreases until it
reaches a balance, we first propose the model that describes the attenuation of
interest and reflects the fact that people's interest becomes more stable after
a long time. We give a rigorous analysis on this model by non-homogeneous
Poisson processes. Our analysis indicates that the interval distribution of
arrival-time is a mixed distribution with exponential and power-law feature,
that is, it is a power law with an exponential cutoff. Second, we collect blogs
in ScienceNet.cn and carry on empirical studies on the interarrival time
distribution. The empirical results agree well with the analytical result,
obeying a special power law with the exponential cutoff, that is, a special
kind of Gamma distribution. These empirical results verify the model, providing
an evidence for a new class of phenomena in human dynamics. In human dynamics
there are other distributions, besides power-law distributions. These findings
demonstrate the variety of human behavior dynamics.
