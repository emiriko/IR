The Exeter FCRAO CO Galactic Plane Survey consists of 12CO and 13CO (J=1-0)
observations over the galactic plane covering 55 degrees <= l <= 102 degrees,
|b| >= 1 degree and 141 degrees <= l <= 195 degrees, -3.5 degrees <= b <= 5.5
degrees with a spatial resolution of ~45" and a spectral resolution of
~0.15km/s. We will present the methodology of a threshold-based cloud and clump
determination method which retains hierarchical information, then discuss
associating sources with clouds in the catalogue. Once complete, this catalogue
of clouds and clumps will encompass the majority of the Northern Galactic
Plane, providing knowledge of the molecular structure of the galaxy and the
starting point for studies of the variation in star formation efficiency. In
addition, it will allow us to identify clouds that have no or little star
formation taking place inside them, which are often overlooked in the study of
the conditions required for star formation to take place.
