A dynamical formulation of coupled cluster theory is derived using a
variational principle. By allowing time-dependent single-particle functions, a
high degree of adaptivity is introduced, allowing complex systems to be
simulated with high accuracy. Equations of motion are derived which are shown
to be suitable for computer implementation. The method, called adaptive
time-dependent coupled cluster, is a strict generalization of the formulation
used in standard coupled cluster response theory, and also represents a
systematic hierarchy of size-consistent approximations, including standard
time-dependent Hartree--Fock as a trivial case.
