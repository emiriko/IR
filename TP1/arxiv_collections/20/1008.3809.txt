We show how to solve hyperbolic equations numerically on unbounded domains by
compactification, thereby avoiding the introduction of an artificial outer
boundary. The essential ingredient is a suitable transformation of the time
coordinate in combination with spatial compactification. We construct a new
layer method based on this idea, called the hyperboloidal layer. The method is
demonstrated on numerical tests including the one dimensional Maxwell equations
using finite differences and the three dimensional wave equation with and
without nonlinear source terms using spectral techniques.
