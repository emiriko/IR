We review the practical conditions required to achieve a non-equilibrium BEC
driven by quantum dynamics in a system comprising a microcavity field mode and
a distribution of localised two-level systems driven to a step-like population
inversion profile. A candidate system based on eight 3.8nm layers of
In(0.23)Ga(0.77)As in GaAs shows promising characteristics with regard to the
total dipole strength which can be coupled to the field mode.
