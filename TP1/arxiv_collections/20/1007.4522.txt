We investigate thermoelectric properties of correlated quantum dots and
molecules, described by a single level Anderson model coupled to conduction
electron leads, by using Wilson's numerical renormalization group method. In
the Kondo regime, the thermopower, $S(T)$, exhibits two sign changes, at
temperatures $T=T_{1}$ and $T=T_{2}>T_{1}$. We find that $T_{2}$ is of order
the level width $\Gamma$ and $T_{1}> T_{p}\approx T_{K}$, where $T_{p}$ is the
position of the Kondo induced peak in the thermopower and $T_{K}$ is the Kondo
scale. No sign change is found outside the Kondo regime, or, for weak
correlations, making a sign change in $S(T)$ a particularly sensitive signature
of strong correlations and Kondo physics. For molecules, we investigate the
effect of screening by conduction electrons on the thermoelectric transport. We
find that a large screening interaction enhances the figure of merit in the
Kondo and mixed valence regimes.
