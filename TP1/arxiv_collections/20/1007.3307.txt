We investigate the attractive Hubbard model in infinite spatial dimensions at
quarter filling. By combining dynamical mean-field theory with continuous-time
quantum Monte Carlo simulations in the Nambu formalism, we directly deal with
the superfluid phase in the population imbalanced system. We discuss the low
energy properties in the polarized superfluid state and the pseudogap behavior
in the vicinity of the critical temperature.
