We report exact numerical calculation of chemical potential, condensate
fraction and specific heat of $N$ non-interacting bosons confined in an
isotropic harmonic oscillator trap in one, two and three dimensions, as also
for interacting bosons in a 3D trap. Quasi phase transitions are observed in
all these cases, including one-dimension, as shown by a rapid change of all the
thermodynamic quantities at the transition point. The change becomes more rapid
as $N$ increases in 2D and 3D cases. However with increase in $N$, the sudden
change in the nature of specific heat, gets gradually wiped out in 1D, while it
becomes more drastic in 2D and 3D. The sudden change in the nature of
condensate fraction and chemical potential as $N$ increases becomes more
drastic even in 1D. Defining transition exponents, which characterize the
nature of a thermodynamic quantity at the transition point of a quasi phase
transition, we evaluate them by careful numerical calculation very near the
transition temperature. These exponents are found to be independent of the size
of the system and whether the bosons are interacting or not, demonstrating
their universality property.
