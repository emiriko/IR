Optimal partitioned cyclic difference packings (PCDPs) are shown to give rise
to optimal frequency-hopping sequences and optimal comma-free codes. New
constructions for PCDPs, based on almost difference sets and cyclic difference
matrices, are given. These produce new infinite families of optimal PCDPs (and
hence optimal frequency-hopping sequences and optimal comma-free codes). The
existence problem for optimal PCDPs in ${\mathbb Z}_{3m}$, with $m$ base blocks
of size three, is also solved for all $m\not\equiv 8,16\pmod{24}$.
