We report an extensive theoretical analysis of point-contact Andreev
reflection data available in literature on ferromagnetic CrO$_2$. We find that
the spectra can be well understood within a model of fully spin-polarized bands
in CrO$_2$ together with spin active scattering at the contact. This is in
contrast to analyses of the data within extended Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk
models, which lead to a spin polarization varying between 50~\% and 100~\%
depending on the transparency of the interface. We propose to utilize both the
temperature dependence of the spectra and the excess current at voltages above
the gap to resolve the spin-polarization in CrO$_2$ in a new generation of
experiments.
