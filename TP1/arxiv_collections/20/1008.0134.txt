A field theory appropriate for magnets that display helical order due to the
Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya mechanism, a class that includes MnSi and FeGe, is used to
derive the phase diagram in a mean-field approximation. The helical phase, the
conical phase in an external magnetic field, and recent proposals for the
structure of the A-phase and the non-Fermi-liquid region in the paramagnetic
phase are discussed. It is shown that the orientation of the helical pitch
vector along an external magnetic field within the conical phase occurs via two
distinct phase transitions. The Goldstone modes that result from the long-range
order in the various phases are determined, and their consequences for
electronic properties, in particular the specific heat, the single-particle
relaxation time, and the electrical and thermal conductivities, are derived.
Various aspects of the ferromagnetic limit, and qualitative differences between
the transport properties of helimagnets and ferromagnets, are also discussed.
