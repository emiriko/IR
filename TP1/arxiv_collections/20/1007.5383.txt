A total of 185 luminous blue variable (LBV) candidates with V < 18.5 and B-V
< 0.35 are selected based on the photometrical Survey of Local Group Galaxies
made by P. Massey et al. 2006. The candidates were selected using aperture
photometry of H-alpha images. The primary selection criterion is that the
prospective candidate should be a blue star with H-aplha emission. In order not
to miss appreciably reddened LBV candidates, we compose an additional list of
25 presumably reddened (0.35 < B-V < 1.2, V < 18.5) emission star candidates. A
comparison with the list of known variables in the M33 galaxy showed 29% of our
selected candidates to be photometrically variable. We also find our list to
agree well with the lists of emission-line objects obtained in earlier papers
using different methods.
