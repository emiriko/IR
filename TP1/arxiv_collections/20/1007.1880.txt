The mathematical interpretation of L0, L1 and L2 is needed to understand how
we should use these norms for optimization problems. The L0 norm is
combinatorics which is counting certain properties of an object or an operator.
This is the least amplitude dependent norm since it is counted regardless of
the magnitude. The L1 norm could be interpreted as minimal geometric
description. It is somewhat sensitive to amplitude information. In geophysics,
it has been used to edit outliers like spikes in seismic data. This is a good
application of L1 norm. The L2 norm could be interpreted as the numerically
simplest solution to fitting data with a differential equation. It is very
sensitive to amplitude information. Previous application includes least square
migration. In this paper, we will show how to combine the usage of L0 and L1
and L2. We will not be optimizing the 3 norms simultaneously but will go from
one norm to the next norm to optimize the data before the final migration.
