Context. Thanks to recent and ongoing large scale surveys, hundreds of brown
dwarfs have been discovered in the last decade. The Canada-France Brown Dwarf
Survey is a wide-field survey for cool brown dwarfs conducted with the MegaCam
camera on the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope telescope. Aims. Our objectives
are to find ultracool brown dwarfs and to constrain the field brown-dwarf
luminosity function and the mass function from a large and homogeneous sample
of L and T dwarfs. Methods. We identify candidates in CFHT/MegaCam i' and z'
images and follow them up with pointed near infrared (NIR) imaging on several
telescopes. Halfway through our survey we found ~50 T dwarfs and ~170 L or
ultra cool M dwarfs drawn from a larger sample of 1400 candidates with typical
ultracool dwarfs i' - z' colours, found in 780 square degrees. Results. We have
currently completed the NIR follow-up on a large part of the survey for all
candidates from mid-L dwarfs down to the latest T dwarfs known with utracool
dwarfs' colours. This allows us to draw on a complete and well defined sample
of 102 ultracool dwarfs to investigate the luminosity function and space
density of field dwarfs. Conclusions. We found the density of late L5 to T0
dwarfs to be 2.0pm0.8 x 10-3 objects pc-3, the density of T0.5 to T5.5 dwarfs
to be 1.4pm0.3 x 10-3 objects pc-3, and the density of T6 to T8 dwarfs to be
5.3pm3.1 x 10-3 objects pc-3 . We found that these results agree better with a
flat substellar mass function. Three latest dwarfs at the boundary between T
and Y dwarfs give the high density 8.3p9.0m5.1 x 10-3 objects pc-3. Although
the uncertainties are very large this suggests that many brown dwarfs should be
found in this late spectral type range, as expected from the cooling of brown
dwarfs, whatever their mass, down to very low temperature.
