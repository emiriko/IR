The $\EtMeP$ and $\EtMeSb$ nearly triangular organic salts are distinguished
from most other Pd[(dmit)$_2$] based salts, as they display valence bond and no
long range order, respectively. Under pressure, a superconducting phase is
revealed in EtMe$_3$P near the boundary of valence bond order. We use
slave-rotor theory with an enlarged unit cell to study competition between
uniform and broken translational symmetry states, offering a theoretical
framework capturing the superconducting, valence bond order, spin liquid, and
metallic phases on an isotropic triangular lattice. Our finite temperature
phase diagram manifests a remarkable resemblance to the phase diagram of the
EtMe$_3$P salt, where the re-entrant transitions of the type
insulator-metal-insulator can be explained by an entropy difference between
metal and the U(1) spin liquid. We find that the superconducting pairing
symmetry is $d \pm id$, and predict different temperature dependences of the
specific heat between the spin liquid and metal.
