We present further observations of the Lockman Hole field, made with the
Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope at 610 MHz with a resolution of 6 x 5 arcsec^2.
These complement our earlier observations of the central approx 5 deg^2 by
covering a further approx 8 deg^2, with an r.m.s. noise down to ~80 microJy
beam^-1. A catalogue of 4934 radio sources is presented.
