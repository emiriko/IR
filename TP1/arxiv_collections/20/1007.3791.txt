We evaluate the non-Markovian finite-temperature two-time correlation
functions (CF's) of system operators of a pure-dephasing spin-boson model in
two different ways, one by the direct exact operator technique and the other by
the recently derived evolution equations, valid to second order in the
system-environment interaction Hamiltonian. This pure-dephasing spin-boson
model that is exactly solvable has been extensively studied as a simple
decoherence model. However, its exact non-Markovian finite-temperature two-time
system operator CF's, to our knowledge, have not been presented in the
literature. This may be mainly due to the fact, illustrated in this article,
that in contrast to the Markovian case, the time evolution of the reduced
density matrix of the system (or the reduced quantum master equation) alone is
not sufficient to calculate the two-time system operator CF's of non-Markovian
open systems. The two-time CF's obtained using the recently derived evolution
equations in the weak system-environment coupling case for this non-Markovian
pure-dephasing model happen to be the same as those obtained from the exact
evaluation. However, these results significantly differ from the non-Markovian
two-time CF's obtained by wrongly directly applying the quantum regression
theorem (QRT), a useful procedure to calculate the two-time CF's for
weak-coupling Markovian open systems. This demonstrates clearly that the
recently derived evolution equations generalize correctly the QRT to
non-Markovian finite-temperature cases. It is believed that these evolution
equations will have applications in many different branches of physics.
