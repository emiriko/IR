It is shown that a recent extraction of the total cross section for pp->K+ n
Sigma+ from inclusive K+ production data is in conflict with experimental data
on the exclusive pp->K+ p Lambda reaction. The result may be interpreted as an
upper bound which is not inconsistent with the much lower values that already
exist in the literature.
