Standing spin wave mode frequencies and linewidths in partially disordered
perpendicular magnetized arrays of sub-micron Permalloy discs are measured
using broadband ferromagnetic resonance and compared to analytical results from
a single, isolated disc. The measured mode structure qualitatively reproduces
the structure expected from the theory. Fitted demagnetizing parameters
decrease with increasing array disorder. The frequency difference between the
first and second radial modes is found to be higher in the measured array
systems than predicted by theory for an isolated disc. The relative frequencies
between successive spin wave modes are unaffected by reduction of the
long-range ordering of discs in the array. An increase in standing spin wave
resonance linewidth at low applied magnetic fields is observed and grows more
severe with increased array disorder.
