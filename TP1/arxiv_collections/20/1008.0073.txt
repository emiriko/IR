We evoke the idea of representation of the chaotic attractor by the set of
unstable periodic orbits and disclose a novel noise-induced ordering
phenomenon. For long unstable periodic orbits forming the strange attractor the
weights (or natural measure) is generally highly inhomogeneous over the set,
either diminishing or enhancing the contribution of these orbits into system
dynamics. We show analytically and numerically a weak noise to reduce this
inhomogeneity and, additionally to obvious perturbing impact, make a
regularizing influence on the chaotic dynamics. This universal effect is rooted
into the nature of deterministic chaos.
