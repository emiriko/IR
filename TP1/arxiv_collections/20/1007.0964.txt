We study the hierarchy of the coefficients in the 1/Nc expansion for the
negative parity L=1 excited baryons from the perspective of the constituent
quark model. This is related to the problem of determining the spin-flavor
structure of the quark interaction. The most general two-body scalar
interaction between quarks contains the spin-flavor structures $t_1^a t_2^a,
\vec s_1\cdot \vec s_2$ and $ \vec s_1\cdot \vec s_2 t_1^a t_2^a$. We show that
in the limit of a zero range interaction all these structures are matched onto
the same hadronic mass operator $S_c^2$, which gives a possible explanation for
the dominance of this operator in the 1/Nc expansion for the L=1 states and
implies that in this limit it is impossible to distinguish between these
different spin-flavor structures. Modeling a finite range interaction through
the exchange of a vector and pseudoscalar meson, we propose a test for the
spin-flavor dependence of the quark forces. For the scalar part of the quark
interaction we find that both pion exchange and gluon exchange are compatible
with data.
