We present an experimental and theoretical study of magnetocrystalline
anisotropies in arrays of bars patterned lithographically into (Ga,Mn)As
epilayers grown under compressive lattice strain. Structural properties of the
(Ga,Mn)As microbars are investigated by high-resolution X-ray diffraction
measurements. The experimental data, showing strong strain relaxation effects,
are in good agreement with finite element simulations. SQUID magnetization
measurements are performed to study the control of magnetic anisotropy in
(Ga,Mn)As by the lithographically induced strain relaxation of the microbars.
Microscopic theoretical modeling of the anisotropy is performed based on the
mean-field kinetic-exchange model of the ferromagnetic spin-orbit coupled band
structure of (Ga,Mn)As. Based on the overall agreement between experimental
data and theoretical modeling we conclude that the micropatterning induced
anisotropies are of the magnetocrystalline, spin-orbit coupling origin.
