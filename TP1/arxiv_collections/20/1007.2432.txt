Recent work suggests a link between chiral asymmetry in the amino acid
iso-valine extracted from the Murchison meteorite and the extent of hydrous
alteration. We present the results of neutron scattering experiments on an
exchanged, 1-dimensionally ordered n-propyl ammonium vermiculite clay. The
vermiculite gel has a (001) d-spacing of order 5nm at the temperature and
concentration of the experiments and the d-spacing responds sensitively to
changes in concentration, temperature and electronic environment. The data show
that isothermal addition of D-histidine or L-histidine solutions produces
shifts in the d-spacing that are different for each enantiomer. This chiral
specificity is of interest for the question of whether clays could have played
an important role in the origin of biohomochirality.
