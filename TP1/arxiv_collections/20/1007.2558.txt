The effect of state-selective reactive decay on the relaxation kinetics of
quantum multistate systems is studied in detail in the Bloch-Redfield approach
(BRA). The results are applied to the analysis of this effect in radical pair
recombination kinetics. The BRA is shown to be able to describe quantitatively
most important specific features of the recombination kinetics including those
predicted by phenomenological treatment and by recently proposed approaches
based on quantum measurement theories.
