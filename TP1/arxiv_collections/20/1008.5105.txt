Degrading performance of indexing schemes for exact similarity search in high
dimensions has long since been linked to histograms of distributions of
distances and other 1-Lipschitz functions getting concentrated. We discuss this
observation in the framework of the phenomenon of concentration of measure on
the structures of high dimension and the Vapnik-Chervonenkis theory of
statistical learning.
