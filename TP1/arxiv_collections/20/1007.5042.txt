The standard classical expression of the state-resolved photo-dissociation
cross section is not consistent with an efficient Bohr quantization of product
internal motions. A new and strictly equivalent expression not suffering from
this drawback is proposed. This expression opens the way to more realistic
classical simulations of direct polyatomic photo-dissociations in the quantum
regime where only a few states are available to the products.
