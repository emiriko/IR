The Hipparcos orbiting observatory has revealed a large number of
helium-core-burning "clump" stars in the Galactic field. These low-mass stars
exhibit signatures of extra-mixing processes that require modeling beyond the
first dredge-up of standard models. The 12C/13C ratio is the most robust
diagnostic of deep mixing, because it is insensitive to the adopted stellar
parameters. In this work we present 12C/13C determinations in a sample of 34
Galactic clump stars as well as abundances of nitrogen, carbon and oxygen.
Abundances of carbon were studied using the C2 Swan (0,1) band head at 5635.5
A. The wavelength interval 7980-8130 A with strong CN features was analysed in
order to determine nitrogen abundances and 12C/13C isotope ratios. The oxygen
abundances were determined from the [O I] line at 6300 A. Compared with the Sun
and dwarf stars of the Galactic disk, mean abundances in the investigated clump
stars suggest that carbon is depleted by about 0.2 dex, nitrogen is enhanced by
0.2 dex and oxygen is close to abundances in dwarfs. Comparisons to
evolutionary models show that the stars fall into two groups: the one is of
first ascent giants with carbon isotope ratios altered according to the first
dredge-up prediction, and the other one is of helium-core-burning stars with
carbon isotope ratios altered by extra mixing. The stars investigated fall to
these groups in approximately equal numbers.
