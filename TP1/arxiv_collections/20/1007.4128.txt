Quantum communication is built on a set of disruptive concepts and
technologies. It is driven by fascinating physics and by promising
applications. It requires a new mix of competencies, from telecom engineering
to theoretical physics, from theoretical computer science to mechanical and
electronic engineering. First applications have already found their way to
niche markets and university labs are working on futuristic quantum networks,
but most of the surprises are still ahead of us. Quantum communication, and
more generally quantum information science and technologies, are here to stay
and will have a profound impact on the XXI century.
