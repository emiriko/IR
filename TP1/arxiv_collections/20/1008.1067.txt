In this paper, we review and substantially develop the recently proposed
"Microscopic Response Method", which has been devised to compute transport
coefficients and especially associated temperature dependence in complex
materials. The conductivity and Hall mobility of amorphous semiconductors and
semiconducting polymers are systematically derived, and shown to be more
practical than the Kubo formalism. The effect of a quantized lattice (phonons)
on transport coefficients is fully included and then integrated out, providing
the primary temperature dependence for the transport coefficients. For
higher-order processes, using a diagrammatic expansion, one can consistently
include all important contributions to a given order and directly write out the
expressions of transport coefficients for various processes.
