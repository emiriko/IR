A possibility of formation of static dual scalar and pseudoscalar density
wave condensates in dense quark matter is considered for the
Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model in an external magnetic field. Within a mean-field
approximation, the effective potential of the theory is obtained and its minima
are numerically studied; a phase diagram of the system is constructed. It is
shown that the presence of a magnetic field favors the formation of spatially
inhomogeneous condensate configurations at low temperatures and arbitrary
non-zero values of the chemical potential.
