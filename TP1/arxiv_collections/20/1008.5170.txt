In this paper we develop an intergraded model for request mechanism and data
transmission in the uplink phase in the presence of channel noise. This model
supports quality of service. The wireless channel is prone to many impairments.
Thus, certain techniques have to be developed to deliver data to the receiver.
We calculated the performance parameters for single and multichannel wireless
networks, like the requests throughput, data throughput and the requests
acceptance probability and data acceptance probability. The proposed model is
general model since it can be applied to different wireless networks such as
IEEE802.11a, IEEE802.16e, CDMA operated networks and Hiperlan\2.
