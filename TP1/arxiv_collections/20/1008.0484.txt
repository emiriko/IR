We calculate the orbital angular momentum of dark matter subhaloes in the
Aquarius simulations of cold dark matter galactic haloes. We calculate the
orientation of their angular momentum relative to that of the spin vector of
their host halo and find a variety of different configurations. All six
Aquarius haloes contain statistically significant populations of subhalo orbits
that are aligned with the main halo spin. All haloes posses a population of
subhaloes that rotates in the same direction as the main halo and three of them
possess, in addition, a population that rotates in the opposite direction.
These configurations arise from the filamentary accretion of subhaloes.
Quasi-planar distributions of coherently rotating satellites, such as those
inferred in the Milky Way and other galaxies, arise naturally in simulations of
a $\Lambda$CDM universe.
