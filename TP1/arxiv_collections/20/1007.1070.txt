The singlet-triplet relaxation in nanowire-based quantum dots induced by
confined phonons is investigated theoretically. Due to the
quasi-one-dimensional nature of the confined phonons, the singlet-triplet
relaxation rates exhibit multi-peaks as function of magnetic field and the
relaxation rate between the singlet and the spin up triplet state is found to
be enhanced at the vicinity of the singlet-triplet anti-crossing. We compare
the effect of the deformation-potential coupling and the piezoelectric coupling
and find that the deformation-potential coupling dominates the relaxation rates
in most cases.
