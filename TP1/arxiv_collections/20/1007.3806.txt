By employing an analytically solvable model including the Duschinsky rotation
effect, we investigated the applicability of the commonly used Born-Oppenheimer
(BO) approximation for separating the proton and proton donor-acceptor motions
in theories of proton coupled electron transfer (PCET) reactions. Comparison
with theories based on the BO approximation shows that, the BO approximation
for the proton coordinate is generally valid while some further approximations
may become inaccurate in certain range of parameters. We have also investigated
the effect of vibrationally coherent tunneling in the case of small
reorganization energy, and shown that it plays an important role on the rate
constant and kinetic isotope effect.
