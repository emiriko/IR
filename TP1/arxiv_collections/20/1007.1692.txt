Using first-principles calculations, we investigate the adsorption of H2
molecules on a three-coordinated benzyl-decorated titanium complex suggested in
a recent experiment [Hamaed et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 130, 6992 (2008)]. Unlike
the interpretation of the experimental results that the Ti(III) complex can
bind five H2 molecules via the Kubas interaction, the Ti(III) complex cannot
adsorb H2 molecules via the Kubas interaction. In contrast, a benzyl-released
Ti(III) complex can adsorb up to two H2 molecules with a binding energy of
~0.25 eV/H2 via the Kubas interaction, in good agreement with the measurement
of ~0.2 eV. The calculated occupation number of H2 molecules at 25 oC and -78
oC under 60 atm is 0.9 and 1.9, respectively, in good agreement with the
measurement of 1.1 and 2.4 near the conditions, respectively. Our results
suggest that the Ti complex in experiment might be a benzyl-released form.
