In order to analyse the effect of strain on the magnetic properties of
narrow-band manganites, the temperature and field dependent susceptibilities of
about 8.5 nm thick epitaxial Pr0.7Ca0.3MnO3 films, respectively grown on (001)
and (110) SrTiO3 substrates, have been compared. For ultrathin samples grown on
(001) SrTiO3, a bulk-like cluster-glass magnetic behaviour is found, indicative
of the possible coexistence of antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic phases. On
the contrary, ultrathin films grown on (110) substrates show a robust
ferromagnetism, with a strong spontaneous magnetization of about 3.4 mB /Mn
atom along the easy axis. On the base of high resolution reciprocal space
mapping analyses performed by x-ray diffraction, the different behaviours are
discussed in terms of the crystallographic constraints imposed by the epitaxy
of Pr0.7Ca0.3MnO3 on SrTiO3. We suggest that for growth on (110) SrTiO3, the
tensile strain on the film c-axis, lying within the substrate plane, favours
the ferromagnetic phase, possibly by allowing a mixed occupancy and
hybridization of both in-plane and out-of-plane eg orbitals. Our data allow to
shed some physics of inhomogeneous states in manganites and on the nature of
their ferromagnetic insulating state.
