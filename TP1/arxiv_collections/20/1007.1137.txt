We introduce a model for amorphous grain boundaries in graphene, and find
that stable structures can exist along the boundary that are responsible for
local density of states enhancements both at zero and finite (~0.5 eV)
energies. Such zero energy peaks in particular were identified in STS
measurements [J. \v{C}ervenka, M. I. Katsnelson, and C. F. J. Flipse, Nature
Physics 5, 840 (2009)], but are not present in the simplest pentagon-heptagon
dislocation array model [O. V. Yazyev and S. G. Louie, Physical Review B 81,
195420 (2010)]. We consider the low energy continuum theory of arrays of
dislocations in graphene and show that it predicts localized zero energy
states. Since the continuum theory is based on an idealized lattice scale
physics it is a priori not literally applicable. However, we identify stable
dislocation cores, different from the pentagon-heptagon pairs, that do carry
zero energy states. These might be responsible for the enhanced magnetism seen
experimentally at graphite grain boundaries.
