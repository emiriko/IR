The aim of this paper is to present a new fast-convergent numerically stable
space-time adaptive processing (STAP) algorithm derived using a novel technique
of feedback orthogonalization. The main advantages of this approach lie in its
perfected stability to computational errors and faults which makes its
real-time implementation on substantially faster and cheaper regular
fixed-point processors possible.
