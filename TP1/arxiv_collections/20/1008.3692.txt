In this article, we study a type of a one dimensional percolation model whose
basic features include a sequential dropping of particles on a substrate
followed by their transport via a pushing mechanism (see [S. N. Majumdar and D.
S. Dean, Phys. Rev. Ltt. A 11, 89 (2002)]). Consider an empty one dimensional
lattice with n empty sites and periodic boundary conditions (as a necklace with
n rings). Imagine then the particles which drop sequentially on this lattice,
uniformly at random on one of the n sites. Letting a site can settles at most
one particle, if a particle drops on an empty site, it stick there and
otherwise the particle moves according to a symmetric random walk until it
takes place in the first empty site it meet. We study here, the asymptotic
behavior of the arrangement of empty sites and of the total displacement of all
particles as well as the partial displacement of some particles.
