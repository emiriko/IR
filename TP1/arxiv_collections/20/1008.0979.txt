We realize and test in experiment a method recently proposed for measuring
absolute quantum efficiency of analog photodetectors. Similarly to the
traditional (Klyshko) method of absolute calibration, the new one is based on
the direct detection of two-mode squeezed vacuum at the output of a traveling
wave OPA. However, in the new method one measures the difference-photocurrent
variance rather than the correlation function of photocurrents (number of
coincidences), which makes the technique applicable for high-gain OPA. In this
work we test the new method versus the traditional one for the case of
photon-counting detectors where both techniques are valid.
