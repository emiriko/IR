In star forming regions, we can observe different evolutionary stages of
various objects and phenomena such as molecular clouds, protostellar jets and
outflows, circumstellar disks, and protostars. However, it is difficult to
directly observe the star formation process itself, because it is veiled by the
dense infalling envelope. Numerical simulations can unveil the star formation
process in the collapsing gas cloud. Recently, some studies showed protostar
formation from the prestellar core stage, in which both molecular clouds and
protostars are resolved with sufficient spatial resolution. These simulations
showed fragmentation and binary formation, outflow and jet driving, and
circumstellar disk formation in the collapsing gas clouds. In addition, the
angular momentum transfer and dissipation process of the magnetic field in the
star formation process were investigated. In this paper, I briefly review
recent developments in numerical simulations of low-mass star formation.
