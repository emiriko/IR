We report on the experimental realization of an internal bosonic Josephson
junction in a Rubidium spinor Bose-Einstein condensate. The measurement of the
full time dynamics in phase space allows the characterization of the
theoretically predicted $\pi$-phase modes and quantitatively confirms
analytical predictions, revealing a classical bifurcation. Our results suggest
that this system is a model system which can be tuned from classical to the
quantum regime and thus is an important step towards the experimental
investigation of entanglement generation close to critical points.
