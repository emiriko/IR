The tau lepton can be more composite than naively expected in models of
strong electroweak symmetry breaking with tri-bimaximal lepton mixing. New
leptonic resonances required by custodial symmetry, the tau custodians, can
then be the first signal of this lepton flavor realization. Tau custodians can
be very light, decaying almost exclusively into taus. The LHC reach for these
new leptons is up to masses of 240, 480 and 720 GeV for sqrt{s}=14 TeV and an
integrated luminosity of 30, 300 and 3000 fb^{-1}, respectively. Our analysis
can be extended to any pair produced particles decaying mostly into taus and
Standard Model bosons.
