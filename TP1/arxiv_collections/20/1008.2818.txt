A distributive lattice structure ${\mathbf M}(G)$ has been established on the
set of perfect matchings of a plane bipartite graph $G$. We call a lattice {\em
matchable distributive lattice} (simply MDL) if it is isomorphic to such a
distributive lattice. It is natural to ask which lattices are MDLs. We show
that if a plane bipartite graph $G$ is elementary, then ${\mathbf M}(G)$ is
irreducible. Based on this result, a decomposition theorem on MDLs is obtained:
a finite distributive lattice $\mathbf{L}$ is an MDL if and only if each factor
in any cartesian product decomposition of $\mathbf{L}$ is an MDL. Two types of
MDLs are presented: $J(\mathbf{m}\times \mathbf{n})$ and $J(\mathbf{T})$, where
$\mathbf{m}\times \mathbf{n}$ denotes the cartesian product between $m$-element
chain and $n$-element chain, and $\mathbf{T}$ is a poset implied by any
orientation of a tree.
