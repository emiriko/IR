We consider Cauchy problems of some dispersive PDEs with random initial data.
In particular, we construct local-in-time solutions to the mean-zero periodic
KdV almost surely for the initial data in the support of the mean-zero Gaussian
measures on H^s(T), s > s_0 where s_0 = -11/6 + \sqrt{61}/6 \thickapprox
-0.5316 < -1/2, by exhibiting nonlinear smoothing under randomization on the
second iteration of the integration formulation. We also show that there is no
nonlinear smoothing for the dispersionless cubic Szeg\"o equation under
randomization of initial data.
