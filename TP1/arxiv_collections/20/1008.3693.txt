Here I will review the high time resolution radio sky, focusing on
millisecond scales. This is primarily occupied by neutron stars, the well-known
radio pulsars and the recently identified group of transient sources known as
Rotating RAdio Transients (RRATs). The RRATs appear to be abundant in the
Galaxy, which at first glance may be difficult to reconcile with the observed
supernova rate. However, as I will discuss, it seems that the RRATs can be
explained as pulsars which are either extreme nullers, highly variable or
weak/distant. I will re-cap some recent results including a re-analysis of the
Parkes Multi-beam Pulsar Survey, which has identified several new sources, as
well as the unusual timing behaviour of RRAT J1819-1458. This leads to an
examination of where RRATs fit within the evolution of neutron stars
post-supernova.
