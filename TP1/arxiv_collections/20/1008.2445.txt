A trapping-detrapping model is proposed for explaining the current
fluctuation behavior in organic semiconductors (polyacenes) operating under
current-injection conditions. The fraction of ionized traps obtained from the
current-voltage characteristics, is related to the relative current noise
spectral density at the trap-filling transition. The agreement between theory
and experiments validates the model and provides an estimate of the
concentration and energy level of deep traps.
