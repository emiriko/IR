In this Letter we establish clear evidence for the resonant absorption
damping mechanism by analyzing observational data from the novel Coronal
Multi-Channel Polarimeter (CoMP). This instrument has established that in the
solar corona there are ubiquitous propagating low amplitude ($\approx$1 km
s$^{-1}$) Alfv\'{e}nic waves with a wide range of frequencies. Realistically
interpreting these waves as the kink mode from magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) wave
theory, they should exhibit a frequency dependent damping length due to
resonant absorption, governed by the TGV relation showing that transversal
plasma inhomogeneity in coronal magnetic flux tubes causes them to act as
natural low-pass filters. It is found that observed frequency dependence on
damping length (up to about 8 mHz) can be explained by the kink wave
interpretation and furthermore, the spatially averaged equilibrium parameter
describing the length scale of transverse plasma density inhomogeneity over a
system of coronal loops is consistent with the range of values estimated from
TRACE observations of standing kink modes.
