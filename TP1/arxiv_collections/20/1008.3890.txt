We use results from long-time core-collapse supernovae simulations to
investigate the impact of the late time evolution of the ejecta and of the
nuclear physics input on the calculated r-process abundances. Based on the
latest hydrodynamical simulations, heavy r-process elements cannot be
synthesized in the neutrino-driven winds that follow the supernova explosion.
However, by artificially increasing the wind entropy, elements up to A=195 can
be made. In this way one can reproduce the typical behavior of high-entropy
ejecta where the r-process is expected to occur. We identify which nuclear
physics input is more important depending on the dynamical evolution of the
ejecta. When the evolution proceeds at high temperatures (hot r-process), an
(n,g)-(g,n) equilibrium is reached. While at low temperature (cold r-process)
there is a competition between neutron captures and beta decays. In the first
phase of the r-process, while enough neutrons are available, the most relevant
nuclear physics input are the nuclear masses for the hot r-process and the
neutron capture and beta-decay rates for the cold r-process. At the end of this
phase, the abundances follow a steady beta flow for the hot r-process and a
steady flow of neutron captures and beta decays for the cold r-process. After
neutrons are almost exhausted, matter decays to stability and our results show
that in both cases neutron captures are key for determining the final
abundances, the position of the r-process peaks, and the formation of the
rare-earth peak. In all the cases studied, we find that the freeze out occurs
in a timescale of several seconds.
