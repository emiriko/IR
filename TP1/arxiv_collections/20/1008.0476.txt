We discuss the resummation of the large logarithmic terms appearing in the
heavy quark effects on parton distribution functions inside the virtual photon.
We incorporate heavy quark mass effects by changing the initial condition of
the leading-order DGLAP evolution equation. In a certain kinematical limit, we
recover the logarithmic terms of the next-to-leading order heavy quark effects
obtained in the previous work. This method enables us to resum the large
logarithmic terms due to heavy quark mass effects on the parton distributions
in the virtual photon. We numerically calculate parton distributions using the
formulae derived in this work, and discuss the property of the resummed heavy
quark effects.
