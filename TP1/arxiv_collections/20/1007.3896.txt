The two-user discrete memoryless state-dependent multiple-access channel
(MAC) models a scenario in which two encoders transmit independent messages to
a single receiver via a MAC whose channel law is governed by the pair of
encoders' inputs and by an i.i.d. state random variable. In the cooperative
state-dependent MAC model it is further assumed that Message 1 is shared by
both encoders whereas Message 2 is known only to Encoder 2 - the cognitive
transmitter. The capacity of the cooperative state-dependent MAC where the
realization of the state sequence is known non-causally to the cognitive
encoder has been derived by Somekh-Baruch et. al.
  In this work we dispense of the assumption that Message 1 is shared a-priori
by both encoders. Instead, we study the case in which Encoder 2 cribs causally
from Encoder 1. We determine the capacity region for both, the case where
Encoder 2 cribs strictly causal and the case where Encoder 2 cribs causally
from Encoder 1.
