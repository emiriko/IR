The processes of D^{(*)}-mesons and \Lambda_c-baryons production in
e^+e^--annihilation at 10.58 GeV and 91.18 GeV energies are concerned. At the
10.58 GeV energy the production of charmed particles via the B-mesons decays is
also concerned. Scaling violation of the fragmentation functions is calculated
at the NLL-accuracy. Nonperturbative fragmentation functions are retrieved from
the experimental data of B-factories and are approximated by simple analytic
expressions. It is proved, that the difference between nonperturbative
fragmentation functions of mesons and baryons can be easily explained by quark
counting.
