Algorithms are developed for calculating dealiased linear convolution sums
without the expense of conventional zero-padding or phase-shift techniques. For
one-dimensional in-place convolutions, the memory requirements are identical
with the zero-padding technique, with the important distinction that the
additional work memory need not be contiguous with the input data. This
decoupling of data and work arrays dramatically reduces the memory and
computation time required to evaluate higher-dimensional in-place convolutions.
The technique also allows one to dealias the higher-order convolutions that
arise from Fourier transforming cubic and higher powers. Implicitly dealiased
convolutions can be built on top of state-of-the-art fast Fourier transform
libraries: vectorized multidimensional implementations for the complex and
centered Hermitian (pseudospectral) cases have been implemented in the
open-source software FFTW++.
