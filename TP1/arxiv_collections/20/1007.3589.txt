Registries play a key role in service-oriented applications. Originally, they
were neutral players between service providers and clients. The UDDI Business
Registry (UBR) was meant to foster these concepts and provide a common
reference for companies interested in Web services. The more Web services were
used, the more companies started create their own local registries: more
efficient discovery processes, better control over the quality of published
information, and also more sophisticated publication policies motivated the
creation of private repositories. The number and heterogeneity of the different
registries - besides the decision to close the UBR are pushing for new and
sophisticated means to make different registries cooperate. This paper proposes
DIRE (DIstributed REgistry), a novel approach based on a publish and subscribe
(P/S) infrastructure to federate different heterogeneous registries and make
them exchange information about published services. The paper discusses the
main motivations for the P/S-based infrastructure, proposes an integrated
service model, introduces the main components of the framework, and exemplifies
them on a simple case study.
