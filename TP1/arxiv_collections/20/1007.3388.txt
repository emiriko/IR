In this paper we study the geometrical structures of multi-qubit states based
on symplectic toric manifolds. After a short review of symplectic toric
manifolds, we discuss the space of a single quantum state in terms of these
manifolds. We also investigate entangled multipartite states based on moment
map and Delzant's construction of toric manifolds and algebraic toric
varieties.
