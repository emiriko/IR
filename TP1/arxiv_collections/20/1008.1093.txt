The dipole-coupled two-level atoms(qubits) in a single-mode resonant cavity
is studied by extended bosonic coherent states. The numerically exact solution
is presented. For finite systems, the first-order quantum phase transitions
occur at the strong interatomic interaction. Similar to the original Dicke
model, this system exhibits a second-order quantum phase transition from the
normal to the superradiant phases. Finite-size scaling for several observables,
such as the average fidelity susceptibility, the order parameter, and
concurrence are performed for different interatomic interactions. The obtained
scaling exponents suggest that interatomic interactions do not change the
universality class.
