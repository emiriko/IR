We study the universal enveloping algebras of the one-parameter family of
solvable 5-dimensional non-Lie Malcev algebras. We explicitly determine the
universal nonassociative enveloping algebras (in the sense of Perez-Izquierdo
and Shestakov) and the centers of the universal enveloping algebras. We also
determine the universal alternative enveloping algebras.
