In this comment, we show that the special attack [S.-J. Qin, F. Gao, Q.-Y.
Wen, F.-C. Zhu, Opt. Commun. 281 (2008) 5472.], which claims to be able to
obtain all the transmitted secret message bit values of the protocol of the
multiparty quantum secret sharing of secure direct communication using single
photons with random phase shift operations, fails. Furthermore, a class of
similar attacks are also shown to fail to extract the secrete message.
