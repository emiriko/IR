An optomechanical interface that converts quantum states between optical
fields with distinct wavelengths is proposed. A mechanical mode couples to two
optical modes via radiation pressure and mediates the quantum state mapping
between the two optical modes. A sequence of optomechanical $\pi/2$ pulses
enables state-swapping between optical and mechanical states as well as the
cooling of the mechanical mode. Theoretical analysis shows that high fidelity
conversion can be realized for states with small photon numbers in systems with
experimentally achievable parameters. The pulsed conversion process also makes
it possible to maintain high conversion fidelity at elevated bath temperatures.
