The RAdial Velocity Experiment (RAVE) is a spectroscopic survey of the Milky
Way. We use the subsample of spectra with spectroscopically determined values
of stellar parameters to determine the distances to these stars. The list
currently contains 235,064 high quality spectra which show no peculiarities and
belong to 210,872 different stars. The numbers will grow as the RAVE survey
progresses. The public version of the catalog will be made available through
the CDS services along with the ongoing RAVE public data releases.
  The distances are determined with a method based on the work by Breddels et
al.~(2010). Here we assume that the star undergoes a standard stellar evolution
and that its spectrum shows no peculiarities. The refinements include: the use
of either of the three isochrone sets, a better account of the stellar ages and
masses, use of more realistic errors of stellar parameter values, and
application to a larger dataset. The derived distances of both dwarfs and
giants match within ~21% to the astrometric distances of Hipparcos stars and to
the distances of observed members of open and globular clusters. Multiple
observations of a fraction of RAVE stars show that repeatability of the derived
distances is even better, with half of the objects showing a distance scatter
of \simlt 11%.
  RAVE dwarfs are ~300 pc from the Sun, and giants are at distances of 1 to 2
kpc, and up to 10 kpc. This places the RAVE dataset between the more local
Geneva-Copenhagen survey and the more distant and fainter SDSS sample. As such
it is ideal to address some of the fundamental questions of Galactic structure
and evolution in the pre-Gaia era. Individual applications are left to separate
papers, here we show that the full 6-dimensional information on position and
velocity is accurate enough to discuss the vertical structure and kinematic
properties of the thin and thick disks.
