We demonstrate an efficient photon number detector for visible wavelengths
using a silicon avalanche photodiode. Under subnanosecond gating, the device is
able to resolve up to four photons in an incident optical pulse. The detection
efficiency at 600 nm is measured to be 73.8%, corresponding to an avalanche
probability of 91.1% of the absorbed photons, with a dark count probability
below 1.1x10^{-6} per gate. With this performance and operation close to room
temperature, fast-gated silicon avalanche photodiodes are ideal for optical
quantum information processing that requires single-shot photon number
detection.
