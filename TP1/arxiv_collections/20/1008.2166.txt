Associated with the Davis-Januszkiewicz theory of small covers, this paper
deals with the theory of 2-torus manifolds from the viewpoint of equivariant
bordism. We define a differential operator on the "dual" algebra of the
unoriented $G_n$-representation algebra introduced by Conner and Floyd, where
$G_n=(\Z_2)^n$. With the help of $G_n$-colored graphs (or mod 2 GKM graphs), we
may use this differential operator to give a very simple description of tom
Dieck-Kosniowski-Stong localization theorem in the setting of 2-torus
manifolds. We then apply this to study the $G_n$-equivariant unoriented bordism
classification of $n$-dimensional 2-torus manifolds. We show that the
$G_n$-equivariant unoriented bordism class of each $n$-dimensional 2-torus
manifold contains an $n$-dimensional small cover as its representative, solving
the conjecture posed in [19]. In addition, we also obtain that the graded
noncommutative ring formed by the equivariant unoriented bordism classes of
2-torus manifolds of all possible dimensions is generated by the classes of all
generalized real Bott manifolds (as special small covers over the products of
simplices). This gives a strong connection between the computation of
$G_n$-equivariant bordism groups or ring and the Davis-Januszkiewicz theory of
small covers. As a computational application, with the help of computer, we
completely determine the structure of the group formed by equivariant bordism
classes of all 4-dimensional 2-torus manifolds. Finally, we give some essential
relationships among 2-torus manifolds, coloring polynomials, colored simple
convex polytopes, colored graphs.
