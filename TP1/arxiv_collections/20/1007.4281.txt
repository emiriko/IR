Maudlin has claimed that no local theory can reproduce the predictions of
standard quantum mechanics that violate Bell's inequality for Bohm's version
(two spin-half particles in a singlet state) of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen
problem. It is argued that, on the contrary, standard quantum mechanics itself
is a counterexample to Maudlin's claim, because it is local in the appropriate
sense (measurements at one place do not influence what occurs elsewhere there)
when formulated using consistent principles in place of the inconsistent
appeals to "measurement" found in current textbooks. This argument sheds light
on the claim of Blaylock that counterfactual definiteness is an essential
ingredient in derivations of Bell's inequality.
