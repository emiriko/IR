The Goldberger-Wise mechanism enables one to stabilize the length of the
warped extra dimension employed in Randall-Sundrum models. In this work we
generalize this mechanism to models with multiple warped throats sharing a
common ultraviolet brane. For independent throats this generalization is
straight forward. If the throats possess a discrete interchange symmetry like
Z_n the stabilizing dynamics may respect the symmetry, resulting in equal
throat lengths, or they may break it. In the latter case the ground state of an
initially symmetric configuration is a stabilized asymmetric configuration in
which the throat lengths differ. We focus on two- (three-) throat setups with a
Z_2 (Z_3) interchange symmetry and present stabilization dynamics suitable for
either breaking or maintaining the symmetry. Though admitting more general
application, our results are relevant for existing models in the literature,
including the two throat model with Kaluza-Klein parity and the three throat
model of flavor based on a broken Z_3 symmetry.
