Cloet and Miller, in arXiv:1008.4345, state that "existing data rule out a
value of the third Zemach moment large enough to explain the current puzzle
with the proton charge radius determined from the Lamb shift in muonic
Hydrogen. This is in contrast with the recent claim of De R\'ujula
[arXiv:1008.3861]". To be more precise: it is not. It is, however, contrary to
what they claim that I claim. Cloet and Miller have simply misinterpreted my
claims.
