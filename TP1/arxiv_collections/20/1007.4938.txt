We introduce an Ising approach to study the spread of malware. The Ising
spins up and down are used to represent two states--online and offline--of the
nodes in the network. Malware is allowed to propagate amongst online nodes and
the rate of propagation was found to increase with data traffic. For a more
efficient network, the spread of infection is much slower; while for a
congested network, infection spreads quickly.
