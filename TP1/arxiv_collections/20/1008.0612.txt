After a successful eleven-year campaign at Kitt Peak, we moved the Wisconsin
H-Alpha Mapper (WHAM) to Cerro Tololo in early 2009. Here we present some of
the early data after a few months under southern skies. These maps begin to
complete the first all-sky, kinematic survey of the diffuse H-alpha emission
from the Milky Way. Much of this emission arises from the Warm Ionized Medium
(WIM), a significant component of the ISM that extends a few kiloparsecs above
the Galactic disk. While this first look at the data focuses on the H-alpha
survey, WHAM is also capable of observing many other optical emission lines,
revealing fascinating trends in the temperature and ionization state of the
WIM. Our ongoing studies of the physical conditions of diffuse ionized gas will
continue from the southern hemisphere following the H-alpha survey. In
addition, future observations will cover the full velocity range of the
Magellanic Stream, Bridge, and Clouds to trace the ionized gas associated with
these neighboring systems.
