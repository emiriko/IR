As a result of applying the original optical variability search method on
publicly available data, we have found eight new cataclysmic variables and two
possible Optically Violent Variable quasars among the previously unidentified
X-ray sources in the ROSAT catalog. We describe the search method and present
the characteristics of the newly identified variable stars. The obtained
results demonstrate the large potential of the concept of Virtual Observatory
for identifying new objects of astrophysical interest.
