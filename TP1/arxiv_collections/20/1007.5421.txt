A Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is a common statistical model which is widely
used for analysis of biological sequence data and other sequential phenomena.
In the present paper we show how HMMs can be extended with side-constraints and
present constraint solving techniques for efficient inference. Defining HMMs
with side-constraints in Constraint Logic Programming have advantages in terms
of more compact expression and pruning opportunities during inference.
  We present a PRISM-based framework for extending HMMs with side-constraints
and show how well-known constraints such as cardinality and all different are
integrated. We experimentally validate our approach on the biologically
motivated problem of global pairwise alignment.
