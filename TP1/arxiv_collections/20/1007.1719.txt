In this paper we consider a branching particle system consisting of particles
moving according to the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process in R^d and undergoing a
binary, supercritical branching with a constant rate \lambda>0. This system is
known to fulfil a law of large numbers (under exponential scaling). In the
paper we prove the corresponding central limit theorem. Moreover, in the second
part of the paper we consider U-statistics of the system, for which, under mild
assumptions, we prove a law of large numbers and a central limit theorem. The
limits are expressed in terms of multiple stochastic integrals with respect to
a random Gaussian measure. The second order behaviour depends qualitatively on
the growth rate of the system. In this paper we concentrate on the case when
the growth rate is relatively small comparing to smoothing properties of
particles' movement.
