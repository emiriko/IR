The thesis is contributed to the study of the decoherence dynamics of
dissipative qubit systems. We reveal the profound impact of the formation of a
bound state between the qubit and its local environment on the decoherence
dynamics of qubit system in non-Markovian regime. We find that the decoherence
can be suppressed greatly under the non-Markovian dynamics when the bound state
is formed. Consequently, the entanglement can be partially preserved in the
steady state. A criterion on this decoherence/disentanglement suppression is
given explicitly. It can give a useful guideline on the decoherence control in
experiment. We also find that the entanglement can be stably distributed among
all components and particularly it always satisfies an identity. Our unified
treatment includes the previous results in the literatures as special cases.
The result reveals the profound nature of the entanglement and should have
significant implications for quantum information processing.
