In a recent letter [Phys. Rev. Lett. 105 (2010) 036804] the unoccupied
electronic states of single layers of graphene on ruthenium are investigated.
Here we comment on the interpretation, which deviates in four points from [J.
Phys.: Condens. Matter 22 (2010) 302001] and outline the corresponding
consequences.
