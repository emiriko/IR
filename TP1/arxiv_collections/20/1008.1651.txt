In this article, we consider the operations of insertion and deletion working
in a graph-controlled manner. We show that like in the case of context-free
productions, the computational power is strictly increased when using a control
graph: computational completeness can be obtained by systems with insertion or
deletion rules involving at most two symbols in a contextual or in a
context-free manner and with the control graph having only four nodes.
