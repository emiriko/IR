We have reported the dependence of projectile mass along with the chemical
reactivity and nonlinear effects on ion beam induced nano structure formation
when 8 keV He1+, N1+, O1+, Ar1+ atomic ions and 16 keV N21+ and O21+ molecular
ions are bombarded on the Si (100) surface at an incidence angle of 600. Ex
situ atomic force microcopy (AFM) measurements reveals the ripple structure
development of various forms and dimensions depending on the projectiles mass,
chemical reactivity and molecular state. This experimental study explores the
necessary requirements for ion induced nanopatterning and their control.
