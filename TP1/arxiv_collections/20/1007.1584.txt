Using the recent results found in [1, 2] we prove that it is possible to
induce flexur in linear piezoelectric beams by means of quadratic Almansi type
boundary conditions for the electric potential. Beams constituted by
transversely isotropic piezoelectric materials whose symmetry axis is parallel
to the axis of the beam are considered. Our choice of boundary conditions for
the electric potential has been suggested by the results found in [1, 3]. An
explicit expression of material parameters that influenc flexur is given in
terms of piezoelectric moduli.
