We present the results of a multi-component synthetic spectral analysis of
the archival far ultraviolet spectra of several key nova-like variables
including members of the SW Sex, RW Tri, UX UMa and VY Scl subclasses: KR Aur,
RW Tri, V825 Her, V795 Her, BP Lyn, V425 Cas and HL Aqr. Accretion rates as
well as the possible flux contribution of the accreting white dwarf are
included in our analysis. Except for RW Tri which has a reliable trigonometric
parallax, we computed the distances to the nova-like systems using the method
of Knigge (2006). Our analysis of seven archival IUE spectra of RW Tri at its
parallax distance of 341 pc consistently indicates a low mass (0.4Msun) white
dwarf and an average accretion rate, 6.3 E-9Msun/yr. For KR Aur, we estimate
that the white dwarf has Teff=29,000K, log g = 8.4 and contributes 18% of the
FUV flux while an accretion disk with accretion rate of 3 E-10Msun/yr at an
inclination of 41 degrees, contributes the remainder. We find that an accretion
disk dominates the far UV spectrum of V425 Cas but a white dwarf contributes
non-negligibly with approximately 18% of the FUV flux. For the two high state
nova-likes, HL Aqr and V825 Her, their accretion disks totally dominate with 1
E-9Msun/yr and 3 E-9Msun/yr, respectively. For BP Lyn we find an accretion rate
of 1 E-8Msun/yr while for V795 Her, we find an accretion rate of 1 E-10Msun/yr.
We discuss the implications of our results for the evolutionary status of
nova-like variables.
