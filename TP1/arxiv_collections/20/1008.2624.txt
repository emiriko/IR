Although quantum mechanics is a very successful theory, its foundations are
still a subject of intense debate. One of the main problems is the fact that
quantum mechanics is based on abstract mathematical axioms, rather than on
physical principles. Quantum information theory has recently provided new ideas
from which one could obtain physical axioms constraining the resulting
statistics one can obtain in experiments. Information causality and macroscopic
locality are two principles recently proposed to solve this problem. However
none of them were proven to define the set of correlations one can observe. In
this paper, we present an extension of information causality and study its
consequences. It is shown that the two above-mentioned principles are
inequivalent: if the correlations allowed by nature were the ones satisfying
macroscopic locality, information causality would be violated. This gives more
confidence in information causality as a physical principle defining the
possible correlation allowed by nature.
