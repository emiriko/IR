FeTe0.5Se0.5 superconducting wires have been fabricated using ex-situ PIT
method with an Fe sheath. Among the other FeAs-based superconductor,
FeTe0.5Se0.5 has great advantage for application due to binary composition and
less toxic. Surprisingly, superconducting current was observed in the
as-fabricated wire without any heat treatments. Zero resistivity and transport
critical current density (Jc) were 3.2 K and 2.8 A/cm2, respectively. In
addition, by annealing at 200 degC for 2 h, critical temperature Tczero and Jc
were enhanced up to 9.1 K, and 64.1 A/cm2, respectively. This suggests that the
grain connectivity was improved by heat treatment, and superconducting property
of FeTe0.5Se0.5 wire was enhanced.
