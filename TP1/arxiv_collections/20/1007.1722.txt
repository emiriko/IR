This paper presents a tool stack for the implementation, specification and
test of software following the practices of Behavior Driven Development (BDD)
in Python language. The usage of this stack highlights the specification and
validation of the software's expected behavior, reducing the error rate and
improving documentation. Therefore, it is possible to produce code with much
less defects at both functional and unit levels, in addition to better serving
to stakeholders' expectations.
