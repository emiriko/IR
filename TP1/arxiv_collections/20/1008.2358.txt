The energy spectra and the corresponding two- component spinor wavefunctions
of the Dirac equation for the Rosen-Morse potential with spin and pseudospin
symmetry are obtained. The $s-$wave ($\kappa = 0$ state) solutions for this
problem are obtained by using the basic concept of the supersymmetric quantum
mechanics approach and function analysis (standard approach) in the
calculations. Under the spin symmetry and pseudospin symmetry, the energy
equation and the corresponding two-component spinor wavefunctions for this
potential and other special types of this potential are obtained. Extension of
this result to $\kappa \neq 0$ state is suggested.
