The recently published final results of experiment E04-108 in Jefferson Lab
Hall C extend the recoil polarization measurements of the ratio of the proton
electric and magnetic form factors to $Q^2 = 8.5$ GeV$^2$, an increase in $Q^2$
coverage of more than 50\%. A global fit of $G_E^p$ and $G_M^p$ to selected
data for electron-proton elastic scattering cross sections and polarization
observables is presented, illustrating the statistical impact of the new
results.
