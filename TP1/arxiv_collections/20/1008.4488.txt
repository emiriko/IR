We study the heat transfer between weakly coupled systems with flat
interface. We present simple analytical results which can be used to estimate
the heat transfer coefficient. As applications we consider the heat transfer
across solid-solid contacts, and between a membrane (graphene) and a solid
substrate (amorphous SiO2). For the latter system the calculated value of the
heat transfer coefficient is in good agreement with the value deduced from
experimental data.
