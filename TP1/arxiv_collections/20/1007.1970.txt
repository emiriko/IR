HESS J1632-478 is an extended and still unidentified TeV source in the
galactic plane. In order to identify the source of the very high energy
emission and to constrain its spectral energy distribution, we used a deep
observation of the field obtained with XMM-Newton together with data from
Molonglo, Spitzer and Fermi to detect counterparts at other wavelengths. The
flux density emitted by HESS J1632-478 peaks at very high energies and is more
than 20 times weaker at all other wavelengths probed. The source spectrum
features two large prominent bumps with the synchrotron emission peaking in the
ultraviolet and the external inverse Compton emission peaking in the TeV. HESS
J1632-478 is an energetic pulsar wind nebula with an age of the order of 10^4
years. Its bolometric (mostly GeV-TeV) luminosity reaches 10% of the current
pulsar spin down power. The synchrotron nebula has a size of 1 pc and contains
an unresolved point-like X-ray source, probably the pulsar with its wind
termination shock.
