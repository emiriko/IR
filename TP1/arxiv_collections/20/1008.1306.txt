Usually, we study the statistical behaviours of noninteracting Fermions in
finite (mainly two and three) dimensions. For a fixed number of fermions, the
average energy per fermion is calculated in two and in three dimensions and it
becomes equal to 50 and 60 per cent of the fermi energy respectively. However,
in the higher dimensions this percentage increases as the dimensionality
increases and in infinite dimensions it becomes 100 per cent. This is an
intersting result, at least pedagogically. Which implies all fermions are
moving with Fermi momentum. This result is not yet discussed in standard text
books of quantum statistics. In this paper, this fact is discussed and
explained. I hope, this article will be helpful for graduate students to study
the behaviours of free fermions in generalised dimensionality.
