We present empirical potentials for dilute transition metal solutes in
a-iron. It is in the Finnis-Sinclair form and is therefore suitable for billion
atom molecular dynamics simulations. First principles calculation shows that
there are clear trends across the transition metal series which enable us to
relate the rescaling parameters to principal quantum number and number of d
electrons. The potential has been developed using a rescaling technique to
provide solute-iron and solute-solute interactions from an existing iron
potential.
