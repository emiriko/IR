We develop a theory based on relative entropy to show the uniqueness and L^2
stability (up to a translation) of extremal entropic Rankine-Hugoniot
discontinuities for systems of conservation laws (typically 1-shocks, n-shocks,
1-contact discontinuities and n-contact discontinuities of large amplitude)
among bounded entropic weak solutions having an additional trace property. The
existence of a convex entropy is needed. No BV estimate is needed on the weak
solutions considered. The theory holds without smallness condition. The
assumptions are quite general. For instance, strict hyperbolicity is not needed
globally. For fluid mechanics, the theory handles solutions with vacuum.
