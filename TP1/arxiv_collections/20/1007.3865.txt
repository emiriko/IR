The coefficient of the log term in the entanglement entropy associated with
hyperspherical surfaces in flat space-time is shown to equal the conformal
anomaly by conformally transforming Euclideanised space--time to a sphere and
using already existing formulae for the relevant heat--kernel coefficients
after cyclic factoring. The analytical reason for the result is that the
conformal anomaly on the lune has an extremum at the ordinary sphere limit. A
proof is given. Agreement with a recent evaluation of the coefficient is found.
