We study the non-equilibrium dynamics of cold atoms held in an optical
lattice potential. The expansion of an initially confined atom cloud occurs in
two phases: an initial quadratic expansion followed by a ballistic behaviour at
long times. Accounting for this gives a good description of recent experimental
results, and provides a robust method to extract the effective intersite
tunneling from time-of-flight measurements.
