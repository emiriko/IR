In silicon sensors high densities of electron-hole pairs result in a change
of the current pulse shape and spatial distribution of the collected charge
compared to the situation in presence of low charge carrier densities. This
paper presents a detailed comparison of numerical simulations with time
resolved current measurements on planar silicon sensors using 660~nm laser
light to create different densities of electron hole pairs.
