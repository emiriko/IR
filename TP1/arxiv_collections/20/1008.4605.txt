Entropic entanglement measures of a two-dimensional system of two
Coulombically interacting particles confined in an anisotropic harmonic
potential are discussed in dependence on the anisotropy and the interaction
strength. The harmonic approximation appears exact in the strong interaction
limit, allowing determination of the asymptotic expression for the linear
entropy. Entanglement properties are dramatically influenced by the anisotropy
of the confining potential in the strong-correlation regime.
