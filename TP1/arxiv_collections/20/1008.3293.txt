We investigate the computational efficiency of two stochastic based
alternatives to the Sequential Propagator Method used in Lattice QCD
calculations of heavy-light semileptonic form factors. In the first method, we
replace the sequential propagator, which couples the calculation of two of the
three propagators required for the calculation, with a stochastic propagator so
that the calculations of all three propagators are independent. This method is
more flexible than the Sequential Propagator Method but introduces stochastic
noise. We study the noise to determine when this method becomes competitive
with the Sequential Propagator Method, and find that for any practical
calculation it is competitive with or superior to the Sequential Propagator
Method. We also examine a second stochastic method, the so-called ``one-end
trick", concluding it is relatively inefficient in this context. The
investigation is carried out on two gauge field ensembles, using the
non-perturbatively improved Wilson-Sheikholeslami-Wohlert action with N_f=2
mass-degenerate sea quarks. The two ensembles have similar lattice spacings but
different sea quark masses. We use the first stochastic method to extract
${\mathcal O}(a)$-improved, matched lattice results for the semileptonic form
factors on the ensemble with lighter sea quarks, extracting f_+(0).
