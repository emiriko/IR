A stationary Gaussian process is said to be long-range dependent (resp.,
anti-persistent) if its spectral density $f(\lambda)$ can be written as
$f(\lambda)=|\lambda|^{-2d}g(|\lambda|)$, where $0<d<1/2$ (resp., $-1/2<d<0$),
and $g$ is continuous and positive. We propose a novel Bayesian nonparametric
approach for the estimation of the spectral density of such processes. We prove
posterior consistency for both $d$ and $g$, under appropriate conditions on the
prior distribution. We establish the rate of convergence for a general class of
priors and apply our results to the family of fractionally exponential priors.
Our approach is based on the true likelihood and does not resort to Whittle's
approximation.
