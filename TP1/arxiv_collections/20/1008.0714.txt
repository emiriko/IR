The temporal evolution of a perturbation of the equilibrium distribution of a
condensed Bose gas is investigated using the kinetic equation which describes
collision between condensate and noncondensate atoms. The dynamics is studied
in the low momentum limit where an analytical treatment is feasible. Explicit
results are given for the behavior at large times in different temperature
regimes.
