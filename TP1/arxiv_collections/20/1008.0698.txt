In this work, new types of EWs are introduced. They are constructed by using
real skew-symmetric operators defined on a single party subsystem of a
bipartite dxd system and a maximal entangled state in that system. A canonical
form for these witnesses is proposed which is called canonical EW in
corresponding to canonical real skew-symmetric operator. Also for each possible
partition of the canonical real skew-symmetric operator corresponding EW is
obtained. The method used for dxd case is extended to d1xd2 systems. It is
shown that there exist Cd2xd1 distinct possibilities to construct EWs for a
given d1xd2 Hilbert space. The optimality and nd-optimality problem is studied
for each type of EWs. In each step, a large class of quantum PPT states is
introduced. It is shown that among them there exist entangled PPT states which
are detected by the constructed witnesses. Also the idea of canonical EWs is
extended to obtain other EWs with greater PPT entanglement detection power.
