In this paper, we study distance-regular graphs $\Gamma$ that have a pair of
distinct vertices, say x and y, such that the number of common neighbors of x
and y is about half the valency of $\Gamma$. We show that if the diameter is at
least three, then such a graph, besides a finite number of exceptions, is a
Taylor graph, bipartite with diameter three or a line graph.
