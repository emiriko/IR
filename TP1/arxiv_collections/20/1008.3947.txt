In this article we provide new applications for exponential approximation
using the framework of Pek\"oz and R\"ollin (in press), which is based on
Stein's method. We give error bounds for the nearly critical Galton-Watson
process conditioned on non-extinction, and for the occupation times of Markov
chains; for the latter, in particular, we give a new exponential approximation
rate for the number of revisits to the origin for general two dimensional
random walk, also known as the Erd\H{o}s-Taylor theorem.
