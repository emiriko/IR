We give a survey of recent classification results for crossed product von
Neumann algebras arising from measure preserving group actions on probability
spaces. This includes II_1 factors with uncountable fundamental groups and the
construction of W*-superrigid actions where the crossed product entirely
remembers the initial group action that it was constructed from.
