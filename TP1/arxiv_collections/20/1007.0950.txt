Much has been studied on the spreading speed and traveling wave solutions for
cooperative reaction-diffusion systems. In this paper, we shall establish the
spreading speed for a large class of non-cooperative reaction-diffusion systems
and characterize the spreading speed as the slowest speed of a family of
non-constant traveling wave solutions. As an application, our results are
applied to a partially cooperative system describing interactions between
ungulates and grass.
