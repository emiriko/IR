Safe and efficient intracellular delivery of genes or drugs is critically
important in targeted cancer treatment and gene therapy applications.
Ultrasound (US) has been demonstrated to alter the cell membrane permeability
due to a biophysical mechanism (Sonoporation) and exploited as a promising
non-invasive gene transfer method. The sonoporation process could induce the
formation of transient pores without significantly affecting cell viability.
This research is aimed at investigating some bioeffects due to Therapeutic
Ultrasound (pulsed-1 MHz) which could allow to enhance drugs or genes delivery
in a non tumoral cell line. We have used the NIH-3T3 cell line as model system
and exposed it to US at two different distances from the source; the effects of
this pulsed ultrasonic wave on cells were assessed by Fourier transform
infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopic imaging analysis. This technique combined with a
focal plane array (FPA) detector has been widely used to study the general
biochemical changes in vitro; moreover, the development of FPA detectors and
shortening of measurement times specifically for IR imaging, from several hours
to few minutes, have made possible to image the distribution of molecular
species in biological samples. We have also performed a cytokinesis-block
micronucleus (CBMN) assay to reveal the presence or not of micronuclei (named
Howell-Jolly bodies) formed during the cell division due to the DNA damage. The
results of IR analysis combined with the cytogenetic analysis have shown that
these experimental conditions can not cause DNA mutations in the NIH-3T3 cell
line. Finally, the comparison between the spectral parameters of the average
spectrum extracted from the spectral map and those of the set of all spectra
from the spectral map could be limited by the presence of bad pixels inside the
map.
