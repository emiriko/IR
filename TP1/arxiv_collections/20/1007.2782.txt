Numerical simulations are used to discuss various aspects of "optical rogue
wave" statistics observed in noise-driven fiber supercontinuum generation
associated with highly incoherent spectra. In particular, we consider how long
wavelength spectral filtering influences the characteristics of the statistical
distribution of peak power, and we contrast the statistics of the spectrally
filtered SC with the statistics of both the peak power of the most red-shifted
soliton in the SC and the maximum peak power across the full temporal field
with no spectral selection. For the latter case, we show that the unfiltered
statistical distribution can still exhibit a long-tail, but the extreme-events
in this case correspond to collisions between solitons of different
frequencies. These results confirm the importance of collision dynamics in
supercontinuum generation. We also show that the collision-induced events
satisfy an extended hydrodynamic definition of "rogue wave" characteristics.
