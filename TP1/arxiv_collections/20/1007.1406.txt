We present point-contact (PC) Andreev-reflection measurements of a
superconducting epitaxial c-axis oriented nickel borocarbide film LuNi2B2C
(Tc=15.9 K). The averaged value of the superconducting gap is found to be 2.6
+/-0.2 meV in the one-gap approach, whereas the two-gap approach results in
2.14+/-0.36 meV and 3.0+/-0.27 meV. The better fit of the Andreev-reflection
spectra for the LuNi2B2C - Cu PC obtained by the two-gap approach provides
evidence for multiband superconductivity in LuNi2B2C. For the first time, PC
electron-phonon interaction (EPI) spectra have been measured for this compound.
They demonstrate pronounced phonon maximum at 8.5+/-0.4meV and a second shallow
one at 15.8+/-0.6 meV. The electron-phonon coupling constant estimated from the
PC EPI spectra turned out to be small (~ 0.1), like in other superconducting
rare-earth nickel borocarbides. Possible reasons for this are discussed.
