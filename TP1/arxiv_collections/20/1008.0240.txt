Analyzing some of the basic aspects of the dynamics of two bosons
(interacting through a central force) and their importance in determining the
ground state of a system like liquid $^4He$, it is unequivocally concluded that
our conventional belief in the existence $p=0$ condensate in the superfluid
state of such systems [including the state of Bose Einstein condensate (BEC) of
trapped dilute gases] is a myth.
