Recently it was shown that the main distinguishing features of quantum
mechanics (QM) can be reproduced by a model based on classical random fields,
so called prequantum classical statistical field theory (PCSFT). This model
provides a possibility to represent averages of quantum observables, including
correlations of observables on subsystems of a composite system (e.g.,
entangled systems), as averages with respect to fluctuations of classical
(Gaussian) random fields. In this note we consider some consequences of PCSFT
for quantum information theory. They are based on the observation \cite{W} of
two authors of this paper that classical Gaussian channels (important in
classical signal theory) can be represented as quantum channels. Now we show
that quantum channels can be represented as classical linear transformations of
classical Gaussian signal
