We investigate whether a two-qubit quantum gate can be implemented in a
scattering process involving a flying and a static qubit. To this end, we focus
on a paradigmatic setup made out of a mobile particle and a quantum impurity,
whose respective spin degrees of freedom couple to each other during a
one-dimensional scattering process. Once a condition for the occurrence of
quantum gates is derived in terms of spin-dependent transmission coefficients,
we show that this can be actually fulfilled through the insertion of an
additional narrow potential barrier. An interesting observation is that under
resonance conditions the above enables a gate only for isotropic Heisenberg
(exchange) interactions and fails for an XY interaction. We show the existence
of parameter regimes for which gates able to establish a maximum amount of
entanglement can be implemented. The gates are found to be robust to variations
of the optimal parameters.
