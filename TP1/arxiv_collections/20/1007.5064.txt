Epitaxial graphene layers were grown on the C-face of 4H- and 6H-SiC using an
argon-mediated growth process. Variations in growth temperature and pressure
were found to dramatically affect the morphological properties of the layers.
The presence of argon during growth slowed the rate of graphene formation on
the C-face and led to the observation of islanding. The similarity in the
morphology of the islands and continuous films indicated that island nucleation
and coalescence is the growth mechanism for C-face graphene.
