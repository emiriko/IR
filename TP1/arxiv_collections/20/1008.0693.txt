One of the breakthrough areas of physical science over the past decade has
been research in the field of nanostructured materials of various substances,
almost all of the properties of which differ sharply from the properties of
macroscopic size. It is difficult to list the areas of science and technology,
where nanomaterials are not implemented due to their new original properties.
In this regard, the development of technologies for the production of nanoscale
structures is a topical issue which is of great interest in almost all areas of
science and industry. As we know, all the known technologies of nanostructured
materials have limited scope, and are inefficient. [1,2] The main purpose of
the work is the definition of technological parameters of dispersion
sustainable modes of various groups of substances.
