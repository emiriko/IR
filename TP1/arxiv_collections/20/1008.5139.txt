We report our detailed investigation of high-resolution imaging using
secondary electrons (SE) with a subnanometer probe in an aberration-corrected
transmission electron microscope, Hitachi HD2700C. This instrument also allows
us to acquire the corresponding annular-dark-field (ADF) images simultaneously
and separately. We demonstrate that atomic SE imaging is achievable for a wide
range of elements, from uranium to carbon. Using the ADF images as a reference,
we study the SE image intensity and contrast as a function of applied bias,
atomic number, crystal tilt and thickness to shed light on the origin of the
unexpected ultrahigh resolution in SE imaging. We have also demonstrated that
the SE signal is sensitive to the terminating species at a crystal surface.
Possible mechanisms for atomicscale SE imaging are proposed. The ability to
image both the surface and bulk of a sample at atomic scale is unprecedented,
and could revolutionize the field of electron microscopy and imaging.
