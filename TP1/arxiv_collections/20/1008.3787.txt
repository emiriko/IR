Chiral molecules with broken parity symmetries can be modeled as quantum
systems with cyclic-transition structures. By using these novel properties, we
design two-step laser pulses to distinguish left- and right-handed molecules
from the enantiomers. After the applied pulse drivings, one kind chiral
molecules are trapped in coherent population trapping state, while the other
ones are pumped to the highest states for ionizations. Then, different chiral
molecules can be separated.
