EPR paper contains an error. Its correction leads to a conclusion that
position and momentum of a particle can be defined precisely simultaneously,
EPR paradox does not exist and uncertainty relations have nothing to do with
quantum mechanics. Logic of the EPR paper shows that entangled states of
separated particles do not exist and therefore there are no nonlocality in
quantum mechanics. Bell's inequalities are never violated, and results of
experiments, proving their violation, are shown to be false. Experiments to
prove absence of nonlocality are proposed where Bell's inequalities are
replaced by precise prediction. Interpretation of quantum mechanics in terms of
classical field theory is suggested. Censorship against this paper is
demonstrated.
