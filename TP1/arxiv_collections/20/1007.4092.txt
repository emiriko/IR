The accurate representation of geostrophic balance is an essential
requirement for numerical modelling of geophysical flows. Significant effort is
often put into the selection of accurate or optimal balance representation by
the discretisation of the fundamental equations. The issue of accurate balance
representation is particularly challenging when applying dynamic mesh
adaptivity, where there is potential for additional imbalance injection when
interpolating to new, optimised meshes.
  In the context of shallow-water modelling, we present a new method for
preservation of geostrophic balance when applying dynamic mesh adaptivity. This
approach is based upon interpolation of the Helmholtz decomposition of the
Coriolis acceleration. We apply this in combination with a discretisation for
which states in geostrophic balance are exactly steady solutions of the
linearised equations on an f-plane; this method guarantees that a balanced and
steady flow on a donor mesh remains balanced and steady after interpolation
onto an arbitrary target mesh, to within machine precision. We further
demonstrate the utility of this interpolant for states close to geostrophic
balance, and show that it prevents pollution of the resulting solutions by
imbalanced perturbations introduced by the interpolation.
