Recently, in the series of works a new effect of acceleration of particles by
black holes was found. Under certain conditions, the energy in the centre of
mass frame can become infinitely large. The essential ingredient of such effect
is the rotation of a black hole. In the present Letter, we argue that the
similar effect exists for a nonrotating but charged black hole even for the
simplest case of radial motion of particles in the Reissner-Nordstr\"om
background. All main features of the effect under discussion due to rotating
black holes have their counterpart for the nonrotating charged ones.
