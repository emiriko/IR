We use CFHTLS deep optical data, WIRCam Deep Survey (WIRDS) NIR data and XMM
data to identify z>1.1 clusters in the CFHTLS D1 and D4 fields. Counterparts to
such clusters can not be identified without deep NIR data and as such the total
of =1deg2 of J , H & Ks band imaging provided by WIRDS is an indispensable tool
in such work. Using public XMM X-ray data, we identify extended X-ray sources
in the two fields. The resulting catalogue of extended X-ray sources was
analyzed for optical/NIR counterparts, using a red-sequence algorithm.
Redshifts of candidate groups and clusters were estimated using the median
photometric redshifts of detected counterparts and where available
spectroscopic data. Additionally, we surveyed X-ray point sources for potential
group systems at the limit of our detection range in the X-ray data. A
catalogue of z > 1.1 cluster candidates in the two fields has been compiled and
cluster masses, radii and temperatures have been estimated using the scaling
relations. The catalogue consists of 15 z > 1.1 candidates. Three of the
detections are previously published extended X-ray sources. Of note is JKSC 041
for which we identify possible structures at z = 0.8, z = 0.96, z = 1.13 and z
= 1.49. We also make an independent detection of the massive cluster, XMMXCS
J2215.9-1738. We use the z > 1.1 catalogue to compare the cluster number counts
in these fields with models based on WMAP 7-year cosmology and find that the
models slightly over-predict the observations, whilst at z>1.5 we do not detect
any clusters. We note that cluster number counts at z > 1.1 are highly
sensitive to the cosmological model, however a significant reduction in present
statistical (due to available survey area) and systematic (due to cluster
scaling relations) uncertainties is required in order to confidently constrain
cosmological parameters using cluster number counts at high redshift.
