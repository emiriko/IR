We consider stochastic differential equations driven by some Volterra
processes. Under time reversal, these equations are transformed into past
dependent stochastic differential equations driven by a standard Brownian
motion. We are then in position to derive existence and uniqueness of solutions
of the Volterra driven SDE considered at the beginning.
