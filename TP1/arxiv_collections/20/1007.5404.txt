The X-ray emission from accreting black-holes and neutron stars features
strong variability on sub-second time scales, with very complex and broad
phenomenology. From high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations to rapidly
changing X-ray burst oscillations to millisecond pulsations, these are weak
signals immersed in strong noise and their study is pushing instrument
capabilities to their limit. The scientific significance of fast time
variability studies are both astronomical (properties of accretion flows,
nature and evolution of sources) and physical (effects of General Relativity,
equation of state of degenerate matter). I first review the main observational
properties, then discuss the future prospects and observational needs.
