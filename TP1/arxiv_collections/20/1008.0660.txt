The two standard branching schemes for CSPs are d-way and 2-way branching.
Although it has been shown that in theory the latter can be exponentially more
effective than the former, there is a lack of empirical evidence showing such
differences. To investigate this, we initially make an experimental comparison
of the two branching schemes over a wide range of benchmarks. Experimental
results verify the theoretical gap between d-way and 2-way branching as we move
from a simple variable ordering heuristic like dom to more sophisticated ones
like dom/ddeg. However, perhaps surprisingly, experiments also show that when
state-of-the-art variable ordering heuristics like dom/wdeg are used then d-way
can be clearly more efficient than 2-way branching in many cases. Motivated by
this observation, we develop two generic heuristics that can be applied at
certain points during search to decide whether 2-way branching or a restricted
version of 2-way branching, which is close to d-way branching, will be
followed. The application of these heuristics results in an adaptive branching
scheme. Experiments with instantiations of the two generic heuristics confirm
that search with adaptive branching outperforms search with a fixed branching
scheme on a wide range of problems.
