Systematic observations of the magnetically generated fountain pressure in
the superfluid $^3$He A$_1$ have been carried out in a newly built apparatus
designed to reduce the effect of thermal gradients. In the same apparatus,
mechanical pumping and filtering of polarized nuclear spins were realized by
the pneumatic pumping action of an electrostatically actuated membrane. In both
experiments, the measured induced pressure was observed to decay at all
temperatures where the A$_1$ phase appeared in magnetic fields up to 13 T and
liquid pressures between 1 and 29 bar. The inferred spin relaxation rate tended
to increase as the low temperature phase boundary with the A$_2$ phase
(T$_{C2}$) was approached. The increase in spin relaxation rate near T$_{C2}$
can be explained by the presence of a minority spin condensate in the A$_1$
phase as predicted by Monien and Tewordt and by the application of the
Leggett-Takagi theory of spin relaxation in superfluid $^3$He.
