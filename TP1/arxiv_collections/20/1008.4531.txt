We discuss the signatures of the spin-2 graviton excitations predicted by the
Randall-Sundrum model with one warped extra dimension, in dilepton and diphoton
production at LHC. By using a specific angular analysis, we assess the ranges
in mass and coupling constant where such gravitons can be discriminated against
competitor spin-1 and spin-0 objects, that potentially could manifest
themselves in these processes with the same mass and rate of events. Depending
on the value of the coupling constant to quarks and leptons, the numerical
results indicate graviton identification mass ranges up to 1.1-2.4 TeV and
1.6-3.2 TeV for LHC nominal energy of 14 TeV and time-integrated luminosity of
10 and 100~${\rm fb}^{-1}$, respectively.
