We reply to the Comment by Mobius and Richter [arXiv:0908.3092, Phys. Rev.
Lett. 105, 039701 (2010)] on "Density of States and Critical Behavior of the
Coulomb Glass" [arXiv:0805.4640, Phys. Rev. Lett. 102, 067205 (2009)] and
address the issues raised with our results on the density of states. In
addition, we correct our statements about the random displacement version of
the Coulomb glass model where the Wigner crystal is not as robust to disorder
as stated. Still, our main result of a lack of a finite-temperature transition
in the Coulomb glass remains unchallenged.
