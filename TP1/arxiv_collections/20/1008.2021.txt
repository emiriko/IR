This paper presents an efficient, combined formulation of two widely used
abstraction methods for bit-level verification: counterexample-based
abstraction (CBA) and proof-based abstraction (PBA). Unlike previous work, this
new method is formulated as a single, incremental SAT-problem, interleaving CBA
and PBA to develop the abstraction in a bottom-up fashion. It is argued that
the new method is simpler conceptually and implementation-wise than previous
approaches. As an added bonus, proof-logging is not required for the PBA part,
which allows for a wider set of SAT-solvers to be used.
