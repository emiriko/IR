Rubisco, probably the most abundant protein in the biosphere, performs an
essential part in the process of carbon fixation through photosynthesis thus
facilitating life on earth. Despite the significant effect that Rubisco has on
the fitness of plants and other photosynthetic organisms, this enzyme is known
to have a remarkably low catalytic rate and a tendency to confuse its
substrate, carbon dioxide, with oxygen. This apparent inefficiency is puzzling
and raises questions regarding the roles of evolution versus biochemical
constraints in shaping Rubisco. Here we examine these questions by analyzing
the measured kinetic parameters of Rubisco from various organisms in various
environments. The analysis presented here suggests that the evolution of
Rubisco is confined to an effectively one-dimensional landscape, which is
manifested in simple power law correlations between its kinetic parameters.
Within this one dimensional landscape, which may represent biochemical and
structural constraints, Rubisco appears to be tuned to the intracellular
environment in which it resides such that the net photosynthesis rate is nearly
optimal. Our analysis indicates that the specificity of Rubisco is not the main
determinant of its efficiency but rather the tradeoff between the carboxylation
velocity and CO2 affinity. As a result, the presence of oxygen has only
moderate effect on the optimal performance of Rubisco, which is determined
mostly by the local CO2 concentration. Rubisco appears as an experimentally
testable example for the evolution of proteins subject both to strong selection
pressure and to biochemical constraints which strongly confine the evolutionary
plasticity to a low dimensional landscape.
