Idealized merging argon plasma jets are simulated in 2D using both gas
dynamic and MHD models. Results indicate that peak pressures of several hundred
kilobar can be achieved for high Mach number jets. Including a simple optically
thin Brehmstrahlung radiation model and plasma targets shows that extremely
high densities and magnetic fields can be achieved during jet merging on the
order of ~1000 times the initial density/field. Further investigations should
include detailed ionization processes and more accurate radiation modeling to
properly capture the radiation transport and subsequent target compression.
