The Bohr-van Leeuwen theorem is often summarized as saying that there is no
classical magnetic susceptibility, in particular no diamagnetism. This is
seriously misleading. The theorem assumes position dependent interactions but
this is not required by classical physics. Since the work of Darwin in 1920 it
has been known that the magnetism due to classical charged point particles can
only be described by allowing velocity dependent interactions in the
Lagrangian. Legendre transformation to an approximate Hamiltonian can give an
estimate of the Darwin diamagnetism for a system of charged point particles.
Comparison with experiment, however, requires knowledge of the number of
classically behaving electrons in the sample. A new repulsive effective
many-body force, which should be relevant in plasmas, is predicted by the
Hamiltonian.
