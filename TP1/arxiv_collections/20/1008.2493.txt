We have synthesized single crystals of FeTe1-xSx and investigated the
structural and physical properties. The actual S concentration was found to be
significantly smaller than the starting nominal value. The solubility limit of
S for the Te site for the crystals grown using a self-flux method was estimated
to be around 12 %. Although a suppression of antiferromagnetic transition was
observed by S substitution, bulk superconductivity was not observed. A phase
diagram of as-grown FeTe1-xSx single crystal was established on the basis of
the structural and physical properties.
