The field of quantum metrology promises measurement devices that are
fundamentally superior to conventional technologies. Specifically, when quantum
entanglement is harnessed the precision achieved is supposed to scale more
favourably with the resources employed, such as system size and the time
required. Here we consider measurement of magnetic field strength using an
ensemble of spins, and we identify a third essential resource: the initial
system polarisation, i.e. the low entropy of the original state. We find that
performance depends crucially on the form of decoherence present; for a
plausible dephasing model, we describe a quantum strategy which can indeed beat
the standard quantum limit.
