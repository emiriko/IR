Searches for a heavy Standard Model Higgs boson focus on the 'gold plated
mode' where the Higgs decays to two leptonic Z bosons. This channel provides a
clean signature, in spite of the small leptonic branching ratios. We show that
using fat jets the semi-leptonic ZZ mode significantly increases the number of
signal events with a similar statistical significance as the leptonic mode.
