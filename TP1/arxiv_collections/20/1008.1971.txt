We give a moduli interpretation of the outer automorphism group Out of a
finite dimensional algebra similar to that of the Picard group of a scheme. We
deduce that Out^0 is invariant under derived and stable equivalences. This
allows us to transfer gradings between algebras and gives rise to conjectural
homological constructions of interesting gradings on block of finite groups
with abelian defect. We give applications to the lifting of stable equivalences
to derived equivalences.
  We give a counterpart of the invariance result for smooth projective
varieties: the product Pic^0xAut^0 is invariant under derived equivalence.
