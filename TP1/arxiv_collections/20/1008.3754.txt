We present a theory of the DC electron transport in insulators near
Anderson-Mott transitions under the influence of coexisting electron
correlation and randomness. At sufficiently low temperatures, the DC electron
transport in Anderson-Mott insulators is determined by the single-particle
density of states (DOS) near the Fermi energy. Anderson insulators, caused by
randomness, are characterized by a nonzero DOS at the Fermi energy. However,
recently, the authors proposed that coexisting randomness and short-ranged
interaction in insulators open a soft Hubbard gap in the DOS, and the DOS
vanishes only at the Fermi energy. Based on the picture of the soft Hubbard
gap, we derive a formula for the critical behavior for the temperature
dependence of the DC resistivity. Comparisons of the present theory with
experimental results of electrostatic carrier doping into an organic conductor
kappa-(BEDT-TTF)_2Cu[N(CN)_2]Br demonstrate the evidence for the present
soft-Hubbard scaling.
