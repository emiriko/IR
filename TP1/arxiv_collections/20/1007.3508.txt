A micromagnetic numerical study of the precessional motion of the vortex and
antivortex states in soft ferromagnetic circular nanodots is presented using
Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert dynamics. For sufficiently small dot thickness and
diameter, the vortex state is metastable and spirals toward the center of the
dot when its initial displacement is smaller than a critical value. Otherwise,
the vortex spirals away from the center and eventually exits the dot which
remains in a state of in-plane magnetization (ground state). In contrast, the
antivortex is always unstable and performs damped precession resulting in
annihilation at the dot circumference. The vortex and antivortex frequencies of
precession are compared with the response expected on the basis of Thiele's
theory of collective coordinates. We also calculate the vortex restoring force
with an explicit account of the magnetostatic and exchange interaction on the
basis of the 'rigid' vortex and 'two-vortices side charges free' models and
show that neither model explains the vortex translation mode eigenfrequency for
nanodots of sufficiently small size.
