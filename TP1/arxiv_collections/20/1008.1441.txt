We determine the kind of parametric oscillators that are generated in the
usual factorization procedure of second-order linear differential equations
when one introduces a constant shift of the Riccati solution of the classical
harmonic oscillator. The mathematical results show that some of these
oscillators could be of physical nature. We give the solutions of the obtained
second-order differential equations and the values of the shift parameter
providing strictly periodic and antiperiodic solutions. We also notice that
this simple problem presents parity-time (PT) symmetry. Possible applications
are mentioned
