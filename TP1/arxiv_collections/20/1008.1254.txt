HERSCHEL-HIFI observations of water from the intermediate mass protostar
NGC7129 FIRS 2 provide a powerful diagnostic of the physical conditions in this
star formation environment. Six spectral settings, covering four H216O and two
H218O lines, were observed and all but one H218O line were detected. The four
H2 16 O lines discussed here share a similar morphology: a narrower, \approx 6
km/s, component centered slightly redward of the systemic velocity of NGC7129
FIRS 2 and a much broader, \approx 25 km/s component centered blueward and
likely associated with powerful outflows. The narrower components are
consistent with emission from water arising in the envelope around the
intermediate mass protostar, and the abundance of H2O is constrained to \approx
10-7 for the outer envelope. Additionally, the presence of a narrow
self-absorption component for the lowest energy lines is likely due to
self-absorption from colder water in the outer envelope. The broader component,
where the H2O/CO relative abundance is found to be \approx 0.2, appears to be
tracing the same energetic region that produces strong CO emission at high J.
