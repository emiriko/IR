We consider finite temperature correlation functions in massive integrable
Quantum Field Theory. Using a regularization by putting the system in finite
volume, we develop a novel approach (based on multi-dimensional residues) to
the form factor expansion for thermal correlators. The first few terms are
obtained explicitly in theories with diagonal scattering. We also discuss the
validity of the LeClair-Mussardo proposal.
