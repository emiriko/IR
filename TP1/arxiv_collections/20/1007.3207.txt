There is widespread emphasis on reform in the teaching of introductory
statistics at the college level. Underpinning this reform is a consensus among
educators and practitioners that traditional curricular materials and
pedagogical strategies have not been effective in promoting statistical
literacy, a competency that is becoming increasingly necessary for effective
decision-making and evidence-based practice. This paper explains the historical
context of, and rationale for reform-oriented teaching of introductory
statistics (at the college level) in the health, social and behavioral sciences
(evidence-based disciplines). A firm understanding and appreciation of the
basis for change in pedagogical approach is important, in order to facilitate
commitment to reform, consensus building on appropriate strategies, and
adoption and maintenance of best practices. In essence, reform-oriented
pedagogy, in this context, is a function of the interaction among content,
pedagogy, technology, and assessment. The challenge is to create an appropriate
balance among these domains.
