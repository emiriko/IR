The preparation of neutron-optical phase gratings with light-optical
holography is reviewed. We compare the relevant concepts of i) Kogelnik's
theory for Bragg diffraction of light by thick volume gratings, which can be
used to analyze holographic gratings with both light and neutrons, and ii) the
dynamical theory of neutron diffraction. Without going into mathematical
detail, we intend to illuminate their correspondence. The findings are
illustrated by analyzing data obtained from reconstruction of nanoparticle
holographic gratings with both light and neutrons.
