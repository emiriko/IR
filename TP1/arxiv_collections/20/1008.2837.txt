We have carried out direction-dependent ^{59}Co NMR experiments on a single
crystal sample of the ferromagnetic superconductor UCoGe in order to study the
magnetic properties in the normal state. The Knight shift and nuclear
spin-lattice relaxation rate measurements provide microscopic evidence that
both static and dynamic susceptibilities are ferromagnetic with strong Ising
anisotropy. We discuss that superconductivity induced by these magnetic
fluctuations prefers spin-triplet pairing state.
