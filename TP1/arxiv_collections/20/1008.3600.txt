We report a new structure, called the Shielded Ohmic Contact (ShOC) rectifier
which utilizes trenches filled with a high barrier metal to shield an Ohmic
contact during the reverse bias. When the device is forward biased, the Ohmic
contact conducts with a low forward drop. However, when reverse biased, the
Ohmic contact is completely shielded by the high barrier Schottky contact
resulting in a low reverse leakage current. Two dimensional numerical
simulation is used to evaluate and explain the superior performance of the
proposed ShOC rectifier.
