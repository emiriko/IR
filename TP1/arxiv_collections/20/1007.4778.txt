We study the long Josephson junction (LJJ) model which takes into account the
second harmonic of the Fourier expansion of Josephson current. The dependence
of the static magnetic flux distributions on parameters of the model are
investigated numerically. Stability of the static solutions is checked by the
sign of the smallest eigenvalue of the associated Sturm-Liouville problem. New
solutions which do not exist in the traditional model, have been found.
Investigation of the influence of second harmonic on the stability of magnetic
flux distributions for main solutions is performed.
