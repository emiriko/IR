We classify the physical observables in spontaneously broken nonlinearly
realized gauge theories in the recently proposed loopwise expansion governed by
the Weak Power-Counting (WPC) and the Local Functional Equation. The latter
controls the non-trivial quantum deformation of the classical nonlinearly
realized gauge symmetry, to all orders in the loop expansion. The
Batalin-Vilkovisky (BV) formalism is used. We show that the dependence of the
vertex functional on the Goldstone fields is obtained via a canonical
transformation w.r.t. the BV bracket associated with the BRST symmetry of the
model. We also compare the WPC with strict power-counting renormalizability in
linearly realized gauge theories. In the case of the electroweak group we find
that the tree-level Weinberg relation still holds if power-counting
renormalizability is weakened to the WPC condition.
