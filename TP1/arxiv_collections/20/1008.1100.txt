All known up to now models of chemical oscillations are based exclusively on
kinetic considerations. The chemical gross-process equation is split usually by
elementary steps, each step is supplied by an arrow and a differential
equation, joint solution to such a construction under certain, often ad hoc
chosen conditions and with ad hoc numerical coefficients leads to chemical
oscillations. Kinetic perception of chemical oscillations reigns without
exclusions. However, as it was recently shown by the author for the laser and
for the electrochemical systems, chemical oscillations follow also from
solutions to the basic expressions of discrete thermodynamics of chemical
equilibria. Graphically those solutions are various fork bifurcation diagrams,
and, in certain types of chemical systems, oscillations are well pronounced in
the bistable bifurcation areas. In this work we describe a general
thermodynamic approach to chemical oscillations as opposite to kinetic models,
and depict some of their new features like spontaneity and fractality. The
paper doubts exclusivity of the kinetic approach to chemical oscillations, and
its aim is to discuss and exemplify thermodynamically predicted chemical
oscillations in closed chemical systems.
