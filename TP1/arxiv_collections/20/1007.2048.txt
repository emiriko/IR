The results of an observational campaign on the new $\delta$ Scuti pulsator
\astrobj{HD~207331} are reported. The star was observed photometrically from
August 26 to September 2, 2009 from the Observatorio San Pedro M\'artir (0.84-m
telescope, Mexico) and the Observatorio del Teide (0.80-m telescope, Spain). An
overall run of 53.8 h of useful data was collected from the two sites. Four
oscillation frequencies for \astrobj{HD~207331} have been found above a 99\%
confidence level. These results confirm the multiperiodic pulsation nature of
the star suggested in previous observations with sparse data. Spectroscopic
observations carried out in 2009 allowed us to derive its spectral type and
luminosity class as well as to estimate its rotation rate. A simple comparison
with models is performed.
