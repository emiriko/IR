In this paper, we show how a power-law correction to the Einstein-Hilbert
action provides a viable modified theory of gravity, passing the Solar-System
tests, when the exponent is between the values 2 and 3. Then, we implement this
paradigm on a cosmological setting outlining how the main phases of the
Universe thermal history are properly reproduced. As a result, we find two
distinct constraints on the characteristic length scale of the model, i.e., a
lower bound from the Solar-System test and an upper one by guaranteeing the
matter dominated Universe evolution.
