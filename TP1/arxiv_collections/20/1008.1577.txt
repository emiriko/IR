Central to the gravitational wave detection problem is the challenge of
separating features in the data produced by astrophysical sources from features
produced by the detector. Matched filtering provides an optimal solution for
Gaussian noise, but in practice, transient noise excursions or ``glitches''
complicate the analysis. Detector diagnostics and coincidence tests can be used
to veto many glitches which may otherwise be misinterpreted as gravitational
wave signals. The glitches that remain can lead to long tails in the matched
filter search statistics and drive up the detection threshold. Here we describe
a Bayesian approach that incorporates a more realistic model for the instrument
noise allowing for fluctuating noise levels that vary independently across
frequency bands, and deterministic ``glitch fitting'' using wavelets as
``glitch templates'', the number of which is determined by a trans-dimensional
Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. We demonstrate the method's effectiveness
on simulated data containing low amplitude gravitational wave signals from
inspiraling binary black hole systems, and simulated non-stationary and
non-Gaussian noise comprised of a Gaussian component with the standard
LIGO/Virgo spectrum, and injected glitches of various amplitude, prevalence,
and variety. Glitch fitting allows us to detect significantly weaker signals
than standard techniques.
