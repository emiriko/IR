In relativistic heavy ion collisions heavy flavor probes are crucial to
understand the interactions between partons and the produced hot nuclear
matter. Measurements in p+p collisions provide information about how the heavy
quarks are produced and fragment and in d+Au collisions are sensitive to
possible effects from cold nuclear matter. Azimuthal correlation measurements
involving heavy flavor probes are complementary to single particle spectra
measurements and provide additional information about production and
interactions of heavy quarks. Measurements of electrons with heavy flavor decay
with other hadrons from the event can provide information about how the heavy
quark interacts with the produced matter and can be compared to similar
measurements from light hadron correlations. Correlations between electrons
from heavy flavor decay with muons, also from heavy flavor decay, can provide
further information about heavy flavor production and cold nuclear matter
effects in d+Au collisions with a very clean signal. We present PHENIX results
for electron-hadron correlations in p+p and Au+Au collisions and electron-muon
correlations in p+p and d+Au collisions and discuss the implications of these
measurements.
