We investigate the effect of single-particle excitations on heavy-ion
reactions at energies near the Coulomb barrier. To this end, we describe
single-particle degrees of freedom with the random matrix theory and solve the
coupled-channels equations for one-dimensional systems. We find that the
single-particle excitations hinder the penetrability at energies above the
barrier, leading to a smeared barrier distribution. This indicates that the
single-particle excitations provide a promising way to explain the difference
in a quasi-elastic barrier distribution recently observed in $^{20}$Ne +
$^{90,92}$Zr systems.
