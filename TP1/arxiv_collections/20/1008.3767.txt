In this paper we consider disjoint decomposition of algebraic and non-linear
partial differential systems of equations and inequations into so-called simple
subsystems. We exploit Thomas decomposition ideas and develop them into a new
algorithm. For algebraic systems simplicity means triangularity, squarefreeness
and non-vanishing initials. For differential systems the algorithm provides not
only algebraic simplicity but also involutivity. The algorithm has been
implemented in Maple.
