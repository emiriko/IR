Rare B decays to three charged kaons are analysed. The weak decay amplitudes
are derived in the QCD factorization approach. The strong final state
interactions between pairs of kaons are described using the kaon scalar and
vector form factors. The scalar form factors at low K+K- effective mass
distributions are constrained by chiral symmetry and are related to the coupled
channel meson-meson amplitudes describing all the transitions between three
channels consisting of two kaons, two pions and four pions. The vector form
factors are fitted to the data on e+e- collisions. The model results are
compared with the Belle and BaBar data.
