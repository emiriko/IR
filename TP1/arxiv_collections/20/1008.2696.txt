Spectroscopic observations with the EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) on Hinode
have revealed large areas of high speed outflows at the periphery of many solar
active regions. These outflows are of interest because they may connect to the
heliosphere and contribute to the solar wind. In this Letter we use slit
rasters from EIS in combination with narrow band slot imaging to study the
temperature dependence of an active region outflow and show that it is more
complicated than previously thought. Outflows are observed primarily in
emission lines from Fe XI - Fe XV. Observations at lower temperatures (Si VII),
in contrast, show bright fan-like structures that are dominated by downflows.
The morphology of the outflows is also different than that of the fans. This
suggests that the fan loops, which often show apparent outflows in imaging
data, are contained on closed field lines and are not directly related to the
active region outflows.
