When the neutrino mass eigenstate $\nu_2$ is trimaximally mixed, the mixing
matrix is called trimaximal. The middle column of trimaximal mixing matrix is
identical to tri-bimaximal mixing and the other two columns are subject to
unitarity constraints. This corresponds to a mixing matrix with four
independent parameters in the most general case. Apart from the two Majorana
phases, the mixing matrix has only one free parameter in the CP conserving
limit. Trimaximality results into interesting interplay between mixing angles
and CP violation. A notion of maximal CP violation naturally emerges here: CP
violation is maximal for maximal 2-3 mixing. Similarly, there is a natural
constraint on the deviation from maximal 2-3 mixing which takes its maximal
value in the CP conserving limit.
