We show that the two branches of collective modes discovered recently in
under-doped Cuprates with huge spectral weight are a necessary consequence of
the loop-current state. Such a state has been shown in earlier experiments to
be consistent with the symmetry of the order parameter competing with
superconductivity in four families of Cuprates. We also predict a third branch
of excitations and suggest techniques to discover it. Using parameters to fit
the observed modes, we show that the direction of the effective moments in the
ground state lies in a cone at an angle to the c-axis as observed in
experiments.
