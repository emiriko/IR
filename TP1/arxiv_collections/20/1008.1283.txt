In this paper, we present experimental evidence of a newly discovered
third-order nonlinear optical process Self-Induced Spin-to-Orbital Conversion
(SISTOC) of the photon angular momentum. This effect is the physical mechanism
at the origin of the depolarization of very intense laser beams propagating in
isotropic materials. The SISTOC process, like self-focusing, is triggered by
laser heating leading to a radial temperature gradient in the medium. In this
work we tested the occurrence of SISTOC in a terbium gallium garnet (TGG) rod
for an impinging laser power of about 100~W. To study the SISTOC process we
used different techniques: polarization analysis, interferometry and tomography
of the photon orbital angular momentum. Our results confirm, in particular,
that the apparent depolarization of the beam is due to the occurrence of
maximal entanglement between the spin and orbital angular momentum of the
photons undergoing the SISTOC process. This explanation of the true nature of
the depolarization mechanism could be of some help in finding novel methods to
reduce or to compensate for this usually unwanted depolarization effect in all
cases where very high laser power and good beam quality are required.
