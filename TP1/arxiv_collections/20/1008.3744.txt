The quantum nonlinear dimer consisting of an electron shuttling between the
two sites and in weak interaction with vibrations, is studied numerically under
the application of a DC electric field. A field-induced resonance phenomenon
between the vibrations and the electronic oscillations is found to influence
the electronic transport greatly. For initially delocalization of the electron,
the resonance has the effect of a dramatic increase in the transport. Nonlinear
frequency mixing is identified as the main mechanism that influences transport.
A characterization of the frequency spectrum is also presented.
