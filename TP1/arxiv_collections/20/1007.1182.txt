A new production mechanism for the Standard Model Higgs boson in
Ultraperipheral Collisions at LHC, which allows Central Exclusive Diffractive
production by Double Pomeron Exchange in photon-proton processes, is presented.
The Higgs boson is centrally produced by gluon fusion with two Large Rapidity
Gaps emerging in the final state, being the main experimental signature for
this process. As already studied for Pomeron-Pomeron and two-photon processes,
the Higgs boson photoproduction is studied within this new mechanism in
proton-proton ($pp$) and proton-nucleus ($pA$) collisions, where each system
has a different dynamics to be taken into account. As a result, this mechanism
predicts a production cross section for $pp$ collisions of about 1.8 fb, which
is similar to that obtained in Pomeron-Pomeron processes. Besides, in $pPb$
collisions the cross sections have increased to about 0.6 pb, being comparable
with the results of two-photon processes in $pAu$ collisions. Therefore, as the
Rapidity Gap Survival Probability is an open question in high-energy Physics,
an analysis for different values of this probability shows how competitive are
the mechanisms in the LHC kinematical regime.
