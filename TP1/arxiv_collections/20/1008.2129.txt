A procedure is developed to automatically correct the bit flip and the
arbitrary phase change errors in Generalized Bell states (GBS). The phase and
parity characteristics of the GBS are encoded in ancilla bits without altering
the state under consideration. The same information is then used to correct the
state at a different point, through appropriate unitrary control operations. It
is also shown that the distributed/indirect measurements on ancilla can yield
the error syndrome. The restricted error correction circuit obtained for
N-qubit entangled states of the Bell type, are generalized for the
corresponding higher dimensions, thus opening up the possibility of designing
of task specific error correction circuits.
