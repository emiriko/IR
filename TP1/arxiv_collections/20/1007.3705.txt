We investigate the development of a gapped phase in the field theory of Dirac
fermions in graphene with long-range Coulomb interaction. In the large-N
approximation, we show that the chiral symmetry is only broken below a critical
number of two-component Dirac fermions $N_c = 32/\pi^2$, that is exactly half
the value found in quantum electrodynamics in 2+1 dimensions. Adopting
otherwise a ladder approximation, we give evidence of the existence of a
critical coupling at which the anomalous dimension of the order parameter of
the transition diverges. This result is consistent with the observation that
chiral symmetry breaking may be driven by the long-range Coulomb interaction in
the Dirac field theory, despite the divergent scaling of the Fermi velocity in
the low-energy limit.
