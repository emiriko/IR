We study the fermion mass and mixing hierarchy problems within the context of
the SU(5) 4+1d domain-wall brane model of Davies, George and Volkas. In this
model, the ordinary fermion mass relations of SU(5) grand unified theories are
avoided since the masses are proportional to overlap integrals of the profiles
of the electroweak Higgs and the chiral components of each fermion, which are
split into different 3+1d hyperplanes according to their hypercharges. We show
that the fermion mass hierarchy without electroweak mixing can be generated
naturally from these splittings, that generation of the CKM matrix looks
promising, and that the Cabibbo angle along with the mass hierarchy can be
generated for the case of Majorana neutrinos from a more modest hierarchy of
parameters. We also show that under some assumptions made on the parameter
space, the generation of realistic lepton mixing angles is not possible without
fine-tuning, which argues for a flavour symmetry to enforce the required
relations.
