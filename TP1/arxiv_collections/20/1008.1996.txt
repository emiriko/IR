We show that by changing a single non-dimensional number, the thermal Rossby
number, global atmospheric simulations with only axisymmetric forcing pass from
an Earth-like atmosphere to a superrotating atmosphere that more resembles the
atmospheres of Venus or Titan. The transition to superrotation occurs under
conditions in which equatorward-propagating Rossby waves generated by
baroclinic instability at intermediate and high latitudes are suppressed, which
will occur when the deformation radius exceeds the planetary radius. At large
thermal Rossby numbers following an initial, nearly axisymmetric phase, a
global baroclinic wave of zonal wavenumber one generated by mixed
barotropic-baroclinic instability dominates the eddy flux of zonal momentum.
The global wave converges eastward zonal momentum to the equator and deposits
westward momentum at intermediate latitudes during spinup and before
superrotation emerges, and the baroclinic instability ceases once superrotation
is established. A global barotropic mode of zonal wavenumber one generated by a
mix of high- and low-latitude barotropic instability is responsible for
maintaining superrotation in the statistically steady state. At intermediate
thermal Rossby numbers, momentum flux by the global baroclinic mode is
subdominant relative to smaller baroclinic modes, and thus strong superrotation
does not develop.
