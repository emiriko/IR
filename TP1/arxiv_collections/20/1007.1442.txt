In this paper, we shall establish the spreading speed and existence of
traveling waves for a non-cooperative system arising from epidermal wound
healing and characterize the spreading speed as the slowest speed of a family
of non-constant traveling wave solutions. Our results on the spreading speed
and traveling waves can also be applied to a large class of non-cooperative
reaction-diffusion systems.
