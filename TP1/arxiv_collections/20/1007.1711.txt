To shed light on the role of magnetism on the superconducting mechanism of
the oxygen-free FeAs pnictides, we investigate the effect of magnetic ordering
on phonon dynamics in the low-temperature orthorhombic parent compounds, which
present a spin-density wave. The study covers both the 122 (AFe2As2; A=Ca, Sr,
Ba) and 1111 (AFeAsF; A=Ca, Sr) phases. We extend our recent work on the Ca
(122 and 1111) and Ba (122) cases by treating computationally and
experimentally the 122 and 1111 Sr compounds. The effect of magnetic ordering
is investigated through detailed non-magnetic and magnetic lattice dynamical
calculations. The comparison of the experimental and calculated phonon spectra
shows that the magnetic interactions/ordering have to be included in order to
reproduce well the measured density of states. This highlights a
spin-correlated phonon behavior which is more pronounced than the apparently
weak electron-phonon coupling estimated in these materials. Furthermore, there
is no noticeable difference between phonon spectra of the 122 Ba and Sr,
whereas there are substantial differences when comparing these to CaFe2As2
originating from different aspects of structure and bonding.
