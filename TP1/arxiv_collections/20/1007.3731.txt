We consider superconductivity in the light of the quantum gravity theoretical
framework introduced in [1]. In this framework, the degree of quantum
delocalization depends on the geometry of the energy distribution along space.
This results in a dependence of the critical temperature characterizing the
transition to the superconducting phase on the complexity of the structure of a
superconductor. We consider concrete examples, ranging from low to high
temperature superconductors, and discuss how the critical temperature can be
predicted once the quantum gravity effects are taken into account.
