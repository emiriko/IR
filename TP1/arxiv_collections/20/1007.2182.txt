We develop a quantum Monte Carlo procedure to compute the Renyi mutual
information of an interacting quantum many-body system at non-zero temperature.
Performing simulations on a spin-1/2 XXZ model, we observe that for a subregion
of fixed size embedded in a system of size L, the mutual information converges
at large L to a limiting function which displays non-monotonic temperature
behavior corresponding to the onset of correlations. For a region of size L/2
embedded in a system of size L, the mutual information divided by L converges
to a limiting function of temperature, with apparently nontrivial corrections
near critical points.
