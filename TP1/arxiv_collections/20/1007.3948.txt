The present paper considers volume formulae, as well as trigonometric
identities, that hold for a tetrahedron in 3-dimensional spherical space of
constant sectional curvature +1. The tetrahedron possesses a certain symmetry:
namely rotation through angle $\pi$ in the middle points of a certain pair of
its skew edges.
