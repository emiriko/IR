The designable integrability(DI) of the variable coefficient nonlinear
Schr\"odinger equation (VCNLSE) is first introduced by construction of an
explicit transformation which maps VCNLSE to the usual nonlinear Schr\"odinger
equation(NLSE). One novel feature of VCNLSE with DI is that its coefficients
can be designed artificially and analytically by using transformation. A
special example between nonautonomous NLSE and NLSE is given here. Further, the
optical super-lattice potentials (or periodic potentials) and multi-well
potentials are designed, which are two kinds of important potential in
Bose-Einstein condensation(BEC) and nonlinear optical systems. There are two
interesting features of the soliton of the VCNLSE indicated by the analytic and
exact formula. Specifically, its the profile is variable and its trajectory is
not a straight line when it evolves with time $t$.
