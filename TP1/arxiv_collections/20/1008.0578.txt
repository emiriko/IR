When we teach physics to prospective scientists and engineers we are teaching
more than the "facts" of physics - more, even, than the methods and concepts of
physics. We are introducing them to a complex culture - a mode of thinking and
the cultural code of behavior of a community of practicing scientists. This
culture has components that are often part of our hidden curriculum:
epistemology - how we decide that we know something; ontology - how we parse
the observable world into categories, objects, and concepts; and discourse -
how we hold a conversation in order to generate new knowledge and
understanding. Underlying all of this is intuition - a culturally created sense
of meaning. To explicitly identify teach our hidden curriculum we must pay
attention to students' intuition and perception of physics, not just to their
reasoning.
