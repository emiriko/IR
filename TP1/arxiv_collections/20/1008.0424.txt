Based on the double-slit experiment of electrons, we suggest a proposal of
thought experiment to distinguish between the Bohmian Interpretation (BI) and
the Standard Quantum Mechanics (SQM). We mainly focus on the discussion of the
meaning of the wave function (Schr\"{o}dinger-$\psi$). The key technique is
require to insert some slow-electrons or weak electron current into the space
between the double-slit and the detector plane. We find that the two theories
finally give out two totally different results about the affections which the
externally inserted electrons cause to the original pattern of the interference
fringes. Under the BI, the externally inserted electrons also can be influenced
by the Quantum Potential (QP) in a totally same way with the electrons which
come from the slits, so the positions they arrived at are preferred to certain
bright zones, and the interference pattern will become more clearer. While
under the SQM, the Schr\"{o}dinger-$\psi$ does not represent an objectively
real field, but only a mathematical construction of the probability
characteristics of the particle itself, so the externally inserted electrons
and the electrons which come from the slits have no correlations with each
other. No any priority positions at the detector plane the externally inserted
electrons will arrive. And the affections are only the addition of a uniform
bright background. In such a meaning, the dark zones of the fringes of the
interference pattern have been filled.
