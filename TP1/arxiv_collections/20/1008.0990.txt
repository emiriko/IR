In this paper we present the design, modeling, and experimental testing of
surface electrode ion traps fabricated in a heterostructure configuration
comprising a silicon substrate, silicon dioxide insulators, and aluminum
electrodes. This linear trap has a geometry with symmetric RF leads, two
interior DC electrodes, and 40 individual lateral DC electrodes. Plasma
enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) was used to grow silicon dioxide
pillars to electrically separate overhung aluminum electrodes from an aluminum
ground plane. In addition to fabrication, we report techniques for modeling the
control voltage solutions and the successful demonstration of trapping and
shuttling ions in two identically constructed traps.
