We introduce a dissipation term in the Gross-Pitaevskii equation that
describes the stimulated relaxation of condensed bosons due to scattering with
a different type of particles. This situation applies to Bose-Einstein
condensates of quasi-particles in the solid state, such as magnons and
excitons. Our model is compatible with the phenomenology of superfluidity:
supercurrents are stable up to a critical speed and decay when they are faster.
