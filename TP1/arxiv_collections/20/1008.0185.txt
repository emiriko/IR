Digitized images of full disk CaK spectroheliograms from two solar
observatories were used to study cycle variation of ephemeral regions (ERs)
over ten solar cycles 14-23. We calculate monthly averaged unsigned latitude of
ERs and compare it with annual sunspot number. We find that average latitude of
ERs can be used as a predictor for strength of solar cycle. For a short-term
prediction (dT about 1-2 years), maximum latitude of ephemeral regions (in
current cycle) defines the amplitude of that cycle (higher is the latitude of
ERs, larger are the amplitudes of sunspot cycle). For a long-term prediction
(dT about 1.5 solar cycles), latitude of ERs at declining phase of n-th cycle
determines the amplitude of (n+2)-th sunspot cycle (lower is the latitude of
ERs, stronger is the cycle). Using this latter dependency, we forecast the
amplitude of sunspot cycle 24 at W=92 +/- 13 (in units of annual sunspot
number).
