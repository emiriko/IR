We report here the discovery of an new near-equal mass Trans-Neptunian
Binaries (TNBs) L5c02 and the and the putative detection of a second TNB
(L4k12) among the year two and three detections of the Canada-France-Eclipic
Plane Survey (CFEPS). These new binaries (internal designation L4k12 and L5c02)
have moderate separations of 0.4" and 0.6" respectively. The follow-up
observation confirmed the binarity of L5c02, but L4k12 are still lack of more
followup observations. L4k12 has a heliocentric orbital inclination of ~
35?degree, marking this system as having the highest heliocentric orbital
inclination among known near-equal mass binaries. Both systems are members of
the classical main Kuiper belt population. Based on the sample of objects
searched we determine that the fraction of near-equal mass wide binaries with
separations > 0.4" is 1.5% to 20% in the cold main classical Kuiper belt and,
if our detection the binarity L4k12 holds, 3% to 43% in the hot main classical
objects are binary. In this manuscript we describe our detection process, the
sample of objects surveyed, our confirmation observations.
