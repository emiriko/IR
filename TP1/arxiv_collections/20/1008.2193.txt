A famous conjecture of Lov\'asz states that every connected vertex-transitive
graph contains a Hamilton path. In this article we confirm the conjecture in
the case that the graph is dense and sufficiently large. In fact, we show that
such graphs contain a Hamilton cycle and moreover we provide a polynomial time
algorithm for finding such a cycle.
