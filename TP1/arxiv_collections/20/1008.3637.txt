We study cosmological vector and tensor perturbations in Horava-Lifshitz
gravity, adopting the most general Sotiriou-Visser-Weinfurtner generalization
without the detailed balance but with projectability condition. After deriving
the general formulas in a flat FRW background, we find that the vector
perturbations are identical to those given in general relativity. This is true
also in the non-flat cases. For the tensor perturbations, high order
derivatives of the curvatures produce effectively an anisotropic stress, which
could have significant efforts on the high-frequency modes of gravitational
waves, while for the low-frenquency modes, the efforts are negligible. The
power spectrum is scale-invariant in the UV regime, because of the particular
dispersion relations. But, due to lower-order corrections, it will eventually
reduce to that given in GR in the IR limit. Applying the general formulas to
the de Sitter and power-law backgrounds, we calculate the power spectrum and
index, using the uniform approximations, and obtain their analytical
expressions in both cases.
