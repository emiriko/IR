The promise of perfect imaging in the optical domain, where light can be
imaged without aberrations and with ultra-high resolution, could revolutionize
technology and nanofabrication [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. Recently it has been shown
theoretically that perfect imaging can be achieved in a dielectric medium with
spatially varying refractive index [7, 8]. The lens geometry is defined using
transformation optics [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15] for projecting a spherical
space onto a real plane space, forming Maxwells fish eye [16, 17, 18, 19]. Most
transformation optics demonstrations have been achieved for Euclidean spaces
and in the microwave regime, due to ease of fabrication. Here we demonstrate a
transformation to a non-Euclidean space [20] in the optical regime using
silicon nanophotonic structures.
