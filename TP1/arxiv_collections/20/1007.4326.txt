Quantum-mechanical WKB-method is elaborated for the known quantum oscillator
problem in curved 3-spaces models Euclid, Riemann, and Lobachevsky E_{3},
H_{3}, S_{3} in the framework of the complex variable function theory.
Generalized generally covariant Schr\"{o}dinger equation is considered. In all
three space models, exact energy levels are found with the help of constructing
special formal WKB-sieries.
