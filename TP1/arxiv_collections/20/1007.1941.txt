Nonlinear optical effects can be enhanced in tapered optical fibers with
diameters less than the wavelength of the propagating light. Here we report on
the observation of two-photon absorption using tapered fibers in rubidium vapor
at power levels of less than 150 nW. Transit-time broadening produces
two-photon absorption spectra with sharp peaks that are very different from
conventional line shapes.
