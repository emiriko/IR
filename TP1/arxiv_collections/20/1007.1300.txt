Quantum molecular dynamic simulations are introduced to study the dynamical,
electrical, and optical properties of carbon dioxide under dynamic
compressions. The principal Hugoniot derived from the calculated equation of
states is demonstrated to be well accordant with experimental results.
Molecular dissociation and recombination are investigated through pair
correlation functions, and decomposition of carbon dioxide is found to be
between 40 and 50 GPa along the Hugoniot, where nonmetal-metal transition is
observed. In addition, the optical properties of shock compressed carbon
dioxide are also theoretically predicted along the Hugoniot.
