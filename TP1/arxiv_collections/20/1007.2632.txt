This article reports a measurement of the low-energy excitation spectrum
along the critical line for a quantum spin chain having a local interaction
between three Ising spins and longitudinal and transverse magnetic fields. The
measured excitation spectrum agrees with that predicted by the (D$_4$, A$_4$)
conformal minimal model under a nontrivial correspondence between translations
at the critical line and discrete lattice translations. Under this
correspondence, the measurements confirm a prediction that the critical line of
this quantum spin chain and the critical point of the 2D 3-state Potts model
are in the same universality class.
