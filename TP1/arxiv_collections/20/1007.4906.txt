The in- and out-of-plane lower critical fields and magnetic penetration
depths for LiFeAs were examined. The anisotropy ratio $\gamma_{H_{c1}}(0)$ is
smaller than the expected theoretical value, and increased slightly with
increasing temperature from 0.6$T_c$ to $T_c$. This small degree of anisotropy
was numerically confirmed by considering electron correlation effect. The
temperature dependence of the penetration depths followed a power
law($\sim$$T^n$) below 0.3$T_c$, with $n$$>$3.5 for both $\lambda_{ab}$ and
$\lambda_c$. Based on theoretical studies of iron-based superconductors, these
results suggest that the superconductivity of LiFeAs can be represented by an
extended $s_\pm$-wave due to weak impurity scattering effect. And the
magnitudes of the two gaps were also evaluted by fitting the superfluid density
for both the in- and out-of-plane to the two-gap model. The estimated values
for the two gaps are consistent with the results of angle resolved
photoemission spectroscopy and specific heat experiments.
