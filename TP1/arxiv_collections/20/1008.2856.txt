We introduce the formalism of positive super currents on \mathbb{R}^{n}, in
strong analogy with the theory of positive currents in \mathbb{C}^{n}. We
consider intersection of currents and Lelong numbers, and as an application we
show that the formalism can be used to describe tropical varieties. This is
similar in spirit to the fact that in complex analysis the current of
integration of an analytic variety can be identified with a closed, positive
current.
