Context: Swift observations suggest that the X-ray afterglow emission of some
gamma-ray bursts (GRB) may have internal origins, and the conventional external
shock (ES) cannot be the exclusive source of the afterglow emission. Aims: If
the central compact objects of some GRBs are millisecond magentars, the
magnetar winds could play an important role in the (internal) X-ray afterglow
emission, which is our focus here. Methods: The dynamics and the synchrotron
radiation of the termination shock (TS) of the magmnetar winds, as well as the
simultaneous GRB ES, are investigated by considering the magnetization of the
winds. Results: As a result of the competition between the emission of the wind
TS and the GRB ES, two basic types of X-ray afterglows are predicted, i.e., the
TS-dominated and the ES-dominated types. Moreover, our results also show that
both of the two types of afterglows have a shallow-decay phase and a
normal-decay one, as observed by the \textit{Swift} satellite. This indicates
that some observed X-ray afterglows could be (internally) produced by the
magnetar winds, but not necessarily GRB ESs.
