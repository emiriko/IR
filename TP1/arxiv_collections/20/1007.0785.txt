We present simple equations for a canonical-basis formulation of the
time-dependent Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (TDHFB) theory. The equations are
obtained from the TDHFB theory with an approximation that the pair potential is
assumed to be diagonal in the canonical basis. The canonical-basis formulation
significantly reduces the computational cost. We apply the method to
linear-response calculations for even-even light nuclei and demonstrate its
capability and accuracy by comparing our results with recent calculations of
the quasi-particle random-phase approximation with Skyrme functionals. We show
systematic studies of E1 strength distributions for Ne and Mg isotopes. The
evolution of the low-lying pygmy strength seems to be determined by the
interplay of several factors, including the neutron excess, separation energy,
neutron shell effects, deformation, and pairing.
