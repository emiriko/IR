We propose a method to achieve significant optical signal delays exploiting
the effect of Autler-Townes splitting in an inhomogeneously broadened quantum
dot medium. The absorption and slow-down effects are compared for three schemes
i.e. $\Xi$, V and $\Lambda$, corresponding to different excitation
configurations. Qualitative differences of the V-scheme compared to the $\Xi$-
and $\Lambda$-scheme are found, which show that features of Autler-Townes
splitting are only revealed in the V-scheme. The underlying physical mechanisms
causing this discrepancy are analyzed and discussed. Finally we compare field
propagation calculations of the schemes showing significantly larger achievable
signal delays for the V-scheme despite finite absorption of the coupling field.
This opens the possibility for using waveguide structures for both coupling and
probe fields, thus significantly increasing the achievable signal delays.
