In this paper we demonstrate how chemical free energy can be produced by a
geological process. We provide a thermodynamic framework in which to assess how
life emerged at the off-axis hydrothermal vent system; the RNA - clays system
has been investigated from the entropic point of view, showing that the
stabilization of the system in a state further away from equilibrium state, by
an inorganic heterogeneous compartmetalization phenomena, is able to produce
chemical free energy useful for RNA self - replication.
