The recently commissioned Compact Array Broadband Backend (CABB) on the
Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) provides 2 GHz bandwidth in each
frequency and polarisation, significantly increasing the sensitivity of the
Array. This increased sensitivity allows for larger samples of sources to be
targeted whilst also probing fainter radio luminosities. Using CABB, we have
observed a large sample of objects at 20 GHz to investigate the high-frequency
radio luminosity distribution of X-ray selected QSOs at redshifts less than 1.
Observing at high frequencies allows us to focus on the core emission of the
AGN, hence recording the most recent activity.
