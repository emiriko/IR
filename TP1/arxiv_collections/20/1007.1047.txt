Two recent quantum oscillation studies find contradictory results concerning
the existence of spin zeros - zeros of the oscillatory signal induced by Zeeman
splitting of the Landau levels. We discuss these experiments in light of
calculations of the oscillations assuming a spin density wave state. We find
that the lack of spin zeros reported in one of the experiments is consistent
with either hole or electron pockets in such a state, if the staggered moment
is perpendicular to the external field. An analysis for field directions near
the planes might be able to differentiate between the two. On the other hand,
if spin zeros exist as reported in the other experiment, then the staggered
moment would have to have a substantial longitudinal component. We suggest
several experiments to test whether this is indeed the case.
