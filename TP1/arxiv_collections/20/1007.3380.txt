The spectra of two-dimensional photonic crystal slab nanocavities with
embedded InAs quantum dots are measured by photoluminescence and reflectance.
In comparing the spectra taken by these two different methods, consistency with
the nanocavities' resonant wavelengths is found. Furthermore, it is shown that
the reflectance method can measure both active and passive cavities. Q-factors
of nanocavities, whose resonant wavelengths range from 1280 to 1620 nm, are
measured by the reflectance method in cross polarization. Experimentally,
Q-factors decrease for longer wavelengths and the intensity, reflected by the
nanocavities on resonance, becomes minimal around 1370 nm. The trend of the
Q-factors is explained by the change of the slab thickness relative to the
resonant wavelength, showing a good agreement between theory and experiment.
The trend of reflected intensity by the nanocavities on resonance can be
understood as effects that originate from the PC slab and the underlying air
cladding thickness. In addition to three dimensional finite-difference
time-domain calculations, an analytical model is introduced that is able to
reproduce the wavelength dependence of the reflected intensity observed in the
experiment.
