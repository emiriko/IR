This article presents a distributed algorithm for a group of robotic agents
with omnidirectional vision to deploy into nonconvex polygonal environments
with holes. Agents begin deployment from a common point, possess no prior
knowledge of the environment, and operate only under line-of-sight sensing and
communication. The objective of the deployment is for the agents to achieve
full visibility coverage of the environment while maintaining line-of-sight
connectivity with each other. This is achieved by incrementally partitioning
the environment into distinct regions, each completely visible from some agent.
Proofs are given of (i) convergence, (ii) upper bounds on the time and number
of agents required, and (iii) bounds on the memory and communication
complexity. Simulation results and description of robust extensions are also
included.
