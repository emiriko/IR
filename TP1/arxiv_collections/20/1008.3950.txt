The planar solution is discussed for an N=3 Chern-Simons-matter theory
constructed recently by Gaiotto and Tomasiello. The planar resolvent is
obtained in terms of contour integrals. If the sum of two Chern-Simons levels
k_1,k_2 is small, the expectation value of a supersymmetric Wilson loop grows
exponentially with the total 't Hooft coupling, as is expected from AdS/CFT
correspondence. If one of the Chern-Simons levels, say k_2, is taken to
infinity, for which one of the 't Hooft coupling constants becomes zero, then
the exponential behavior disappears.
