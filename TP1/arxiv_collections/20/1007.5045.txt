In this paper we apply the global isomorphism approach [V.~L. Kulinskii, J.
Phys. Chem. B \textbf{114} 2852 (2010)] between the Lennard-Jones fluids and
Lattice Gas model to the study of the liquid-vapor equilibrium for the systems
with the short-ranged potentials like Buckingham and the $Mie$-potentials. The
estimates for the critical point locus correlate quite well with the available
numerical data. Also within the proposed approach we give the explanation for
the correlation between the value of the second virial coefficient at the
critical temperature and the particle volume found in [G. A. Vliegenthart and
H. N. W. Lekkerkerker, J. Chem. Phys. \textbf{112} 5364 (2000)].
