These are notes of the lectures given during the Toric Topology Workshop at
the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology in February 2010. We
describe several approaches to moment-angle manifolds and complexes, including
the intersections of quadrics, complements of subspace arrangements and level
sets of moment maps. We overview the known results on the topology of
moment-angle complexes, including the description of their cohomology rings, as
well as the homotopy and diffeomorphism types in some particular cases. We also
discuss complex-analytic structures on moment-angle manifolds and methods for
calculating invariants of these structures.
