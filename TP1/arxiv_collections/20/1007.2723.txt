In this thesis we analyse the type of states and ensembles which achieve the
capacity for certain quantum channels carrying classical information. We first
concentrate on the product-state capacity of a particular quantum channel, that
is, the capacity which is achieved by encoding the output states from a source
into codewords comprised of states taken from ensembles of non-entangled states
and sending them over copies of the quantum channel. Using the "single-letter"
formula proved independently by Holevo and by Schumacher and Westmoreland we
obtain the product-state capacity of the qubit quantum amplitude-damping
channel, which is determined by a transcendental equation in a single real
variable and can be solved numerically. We demonstrate that the product-state
capacity of this channel can be achieved using a minimal ensemble of
non-orthogonal pure states. Next we consider the classical capacity of two
quantum channels with memory, namely a periodic channel with quantum
depolarising channel branches and a convex combination of quantum channels. We
prove that the classical capacity for each of the classical memory channels
mentioned above is, in fact, equal to the respective product-state capacities.
For those channels this means that the classical capacity is achieved without
the use of entangled input-states. Next we introduce the channel coding theorem
for memoryless quantum channels, providing a known proof by Winter for the
strong converse of the theorem. We then consider the strong converse to the
channel coding theorem for a periodic quantum channel.
