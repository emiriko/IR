We show through a nonlinear Fokker-Planck formalism, and confirm by molecular
dynamics simulations, that the overdamped motion of interacting particles at
T=0, where T is the temperature of a thermal bath connected to the system, can
be directly associated with Tsallis thermostatistics. For sufficiently high
values of T, the distribution of particles becomes Gaussian, so that the
classical Boltzmann-Gibbs behavior is recovered. For intermediate temperatures
of the thermal bath, the system displays a mixed behavior that follows a novel
type of thermostatistics, where the entropy is given by a linear combination of
Tsallis and Boltzmann-Gibbs entropies.
