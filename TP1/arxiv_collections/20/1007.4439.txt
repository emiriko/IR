We consider a Dirac field on a $(1 + 2)$-dimensional uncharged BTZ black hole
background. We first find out the Dirac Hamiltonian, and study its
self-adjointness properties. We find that, in analogy to the Kerr-Newman-AdS
Dirac Hamiltonian in $(1+3)$ dimensions, essential self-adjointness on
$C_0^{\infty}(r_+,\infty)^2$ of the reduced (radial) Hamiltonian is implemented
only if a suitable relation between the mass $\mu$ of the Dirac field and the
cosmological radius $l$ holds true. The very presence of a boundary-like
behaviour of $r=\infty$ is at the root of this problem. Also, we determine in a
complete way qualitative spectral properties for the non-extremal case, for
which we can infer the absence of quantum bound states for the Dirac field.
Next, we investigate the possibility of a quantum loss of angular momentum for
the $(1 + 2)$-dimensional uncharged BTZ black hole. Unlike the corresponding
stationary four-dimensional solutions, the formal treatment of the level
crossing mechanism is much simpler. We find that, even in the extremal case, no
level crossing takes place. Therefore, no quantum loss of angular momentum via
particle pair production is allowed.
