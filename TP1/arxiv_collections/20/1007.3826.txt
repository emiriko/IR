In this paper second-order elliptic and parabolic partial differential
systems are considered on $C^1$ domains. Existence and uniqueness results are
obtained in terms of Sobolev spaces with weights so that we allow the
derivatives of the solutions to blow up near the boundary. The coefficients of
the systems are allowed to substantially oscillate or blow up near the
boundary.
