We apply to the semantics of Arithmetic the idea of ``finite approximation''
used to provide computational interpretations of Herbrand's Theorem, and we
interpret classical proofs as constructive proofs (with constructive rules for
$\vee, \exists$) over a suitable structure $\StructureN$ for the language of
natural numbers and maps of G\"odel's system $\SystemT$. We introduce a new
Realizability semantics we call ``Interactive learning-based Realizability'',
for Heyting Arithmetic plus $\EM_1$ (Excluded middle axiom restricted to
$\Sigma^0_1$ formulas). Individuals of $\StructureN$ evolve with time, and
realizers may ``interact'' with them, by influencing their evolution. We build
our semantics over Avigad's fixed point result, but the same semantics may be
defined over different constructive interpretations of classical arithmetic
(Berardi and de' Liguoro use continuations). Our notion of realizability
extends intuitionistic realizability and differs from it only in the atomic
case: we interpret atomic realizers as ``learning agents''.
