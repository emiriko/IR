The conductance change due to a local perturbation in a phase-coherent
nanostructure is calculated. The general expressions to first and second order
in the perturbation are applied to the scanning gate microscopy of a
two-dimensional electron gas containing a quantum point contact. The
first-order correction depends on two scattering states with electrons incoming
from opposite leads and is suppressed on a conductance plateau; it is
significant in the step regions. On the plateaus, the dominant second-order
term likewise depends on scattering states incoming from both sides. It is
always negative, exhibits fringes, and has a spatial decay consistent with
experiments.
