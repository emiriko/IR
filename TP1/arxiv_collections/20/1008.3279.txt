This paper presents an inverse problem for the nonlinear 1-d
Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (K-S) equation. More precisely, we study the nonlinear
inverse problem of retrieving the anti-diffusion coefficient from the
measurements of the solution on a part of the boundary and at some positive
time everywhere. Uniqueness and Lipschitz stability for this inverse problem
are proven with the Bukhgeim-Klibanov method. The proof is based on a global
Carleman estimate for the linearized K-S equation.
