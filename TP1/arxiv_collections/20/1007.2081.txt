Looking at rational mixture theories within the context of a new perspective,
this work aims to put forward a proposal for an Eshelbian approach to the
nonlinear mechanics of a constrained solid-fluid mixture, made up of an
inhomogeneous poroelastic solid and an inviscid compressible fluid, which do
not undergo any chemical reaction.
