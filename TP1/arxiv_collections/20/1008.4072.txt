Employing a microscopic transport model we investigate the evolution of high
energetic jets moving through a viscous medium. For the scenario of an
unstoppable jet we observe a clearly strong collective behavior for a low
dissipative system $\eta/s \approx 0.005$, leading to the observation of
cone-like structures. Increasing the dissipation of the system to $\eta/s
\approx 0.32$ the Mach Cone structure vanishes. Furthermore, we investigate
jet-associated particle correlations. A double-peak structure, as observed in
experimental data, is even for low-dissipative systems not supported, because
of the large influence of the head shock.
