I review the basic physics of ultracold dilute trapped atomic gases, with
emphasis on Bose-Einstein condensation and quantized vortices. The hydrodynamic
form of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (a nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger equation)
illuminates the role of the density and the quantum-mechanical phase. One
unique feature of these experimental systems is the opportunity to study the
dynamics of vortices in real time, in contrast to typical experiments on
superfluid $^4$He. I discuss three specific examples (precession of single
vortices, motion of vortex dipoles, and Tkachenko oscillations of a vortex
array). Other unusual features include the study of quantum turbulence and the
behavior for rapid rotation, when the vortices form dense regular arrays.
Ultimately, the system is predicted to make a quantum phase transition to
various highly correlated many-body states (analogous to bosonic quantum Hall
states) that are not superfluid and do not have condensate wave functions. At
present, this transition remains elusive. Conceivably, laser-induced synthetic
vector potentials can serve to reach this intriguing phase transition.
