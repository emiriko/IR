Using the finite-element discrete variable representation of the
nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) we extend previous work [K.~Balzer et
al., Phys. Rev. A \textbf{81}, 022510 (2010)] to nonequilibrium situations and
compute---from the two-time Schwinger-Keldysh-Kadanoff-Baym equations---the
response of the helium atom and the heteronuclear molecule lithium hydride to
laser fields in the uv and xuv regime. In particular, by comparing the
one-electron density and the dipole moment to time-dependent Hartree-Fock
results on one hand and the full solution of the time-dependent Schr\"odinger
equation on the other hand, we demonstrate that the time-dependent second Born
approximation carries valuable information about electron-electron correlation
effects. Also, we outline an efficient distributed memory concept which enables
a parallel and well scalable algorithm for computing the NEGF in the two-time
domain.
