In this study, we solve the Klein-Gordon equation with equal scalar and
vector q-deformed hyperbolic modified P\"{o}schl-Teller potential. The explicit
expressions of bound state spectra and the normalized eigenfunctions for s-wave
bound states are obtained analytically. The energy equations and the
corresponding wave functions for the special cases of the equally mixed
q-deformed hyperbolic modified P\"{o}schl-Teller potential for spinless
particle are briefly discussed.
