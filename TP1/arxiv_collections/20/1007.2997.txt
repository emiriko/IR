In this work we present new fundamental tools for studying the variations of
the Willmore functional of immersed surfaces into $R^m$. This approach gives
for instance a new proof of the existence of a Willmore minimizing embedding of
an arbitrary closed surface in arbitrary codimension. We explain how the same
approach can solve constraint minimization problems for the Willmore
functional. We show in particular that, for a given closed surface and a given
conformal class for this surface, there is an immersion in $R^m$, away possibly
from isolated branched points, which minimizes the Willmore energy among all
possible Lipschitz immersions in $R^m$ having an $L^2-$bounded second
fundamental form and realizing this conformal class. This branched immersion is
either a smooth Conformal Willmore branched immersion or an isothermic branched
immersion. We show that branched points do not exist whenever the minimal
energy in the conformal class is less than $8\pi$ and that these immersions
extend to smooth conformal Willmore embeddings or global isothermic embeddings
of the surface in that case. Finally, as a by-product of our analysis, we
establish that inside a compact subspace of the moduli space the following
holds : weak limit of Palais Smale Willmore sequences are Conformal Willmore,
that weak limits of Palais Smale sequences of Conformal Willmore are either
Conformal Willmore or Global Isothermic and finally we observe also that weakly
converging Palais Smale sequences of Global Isothermic Immersions are Global
Isothermic. The analysis developped along the paper - in particular these last
results - opens the door to the possibility of constructing new critical saddle
points of the Willmore functional without or with constraints using min max
methods
