We continue our discussion of the general bosonic prototype of the new
orbifold-string theories of permutation type. Supplementing the extended
physical-state conditions of the previous paper, we construct here the extended
Virasoro generators with cycle central charge
$\hat{c}_j(\sigma)=26f_j(\sigma)$, where $f_j(\sigma)$ is the length of cycle
$j$ in twisted sector $\sigma$. We also find an equivalent, reduced formulation
of each physical-state problem at reduced cycle central charge
$c_j(\sigma)=26$. These tools are used to begin the study of the target
space-time dimension $\hat{D}_j(\sigma)$ of cycle $j$ in sector $\sigma$, which
is naturally defined as the number of zero modes (momenta) of each cycle. The
general model-dependent formulae derived here will be used extensively in
succeeding papers, but are evaluated in this paper only for the simplest case
of the "pure" permutation orbifolds.
