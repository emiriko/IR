We propose an asymptotically non-free, natural model for dynamical
electro-weak symmetry breaking characterized by the emergence of a weakly
coupled Higgs in the IR regime. Due to the large anomalous dimension of the
Higgs operator, the model is capable of solving the hierarchy problem without
losing the phenomenologically appealing features typical of a weakly coupled
sector. We speculate on the possibility that such a scenario be realized as a
strongly coupled phase of non-supersymmetric non-abelian gauge theories.
