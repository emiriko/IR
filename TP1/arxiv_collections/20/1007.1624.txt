Analysis is presented on 15 months of data taken with the Large Area
Telescope (LAT) on the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope for 11 non-blazar AGNs,
including 7 FRI radio galaxies and 4 FRII radio sources consisting of 2 FRII
radio galaxies and 2 steep spectrum radio quasars. The broad line FRI radio
galaxy 3C 120 is reported here as a gamma-ray source for the first time. The
analysis is based on directional associations of LAT sources with radio sources
in the 3CR, 3CRR and MS4 (collectively referred to as 3C-MS) catalogs. Seven of
the eleven LAT sources associated with 3C-MS radio sources have spectral
indices larger than 2.3 and, except for the FRI radio galaxy NGC 1275 that
shows possible spectral curvature, are well described by a power law. No
evidence for time variability is found for any sources other than NGC 1275. The
gamma-ray luminosities of FRI radio galaxies are significantly smaller than
those of BL Lac objects detected by the LAT, whereas the gamma-ray luminosities
of FRII sources are quite similar to those of FSRQs, which could reflect
different beaming factors for the gamma-ray emission. A core dominance study of
the 3CRR sample indicate that sources closer to the jet axis are preferentially
detected with the Fermi-LAT, insofar as the gamma-ray--detected misaligned AGNs
have larger core dominance at a given average radio flux. The results are
discussed in view of the AGN unification scenario.
