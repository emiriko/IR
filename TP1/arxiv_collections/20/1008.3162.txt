We present updated predictions for the total cross section for Higgs boson
production through gluon fusion at hadron colliders. In addition to
renormalization-group improvement at next-to-next-to-next-to-leading
logarithmic accuracy, we incorporate the two-loop electroweak corrections,
which leads to the most precise predictions at present. Numerical results are
given for Higgs masses between 115 GeV and 200 GeV at the Tevatron with
\sqrt{s}=1.96 TeV and the LHC with \sqrt{s}=7-14 TeV.
