An effective optimization strategy has been developed to construct highly
accurate bound state wave functions in various three-body systems. Our
procedure appears to be very effective for computations of weakly bound states
and various excited states, including rotationally excited states, i.e. states
with $L \ge 1$. The efficiency of our procedure is illustrated by computations
of the excited $P^{*}(L = 1)-$states in the $dd\mu, dt\mu$ and $tt\mu$ muonic
molecular ions, $P(L = 1)-$states in the non-symmetric $pd\mu, pt\mu$ and
$dt\mu$ ions and $2^{1}P(L = 1)-$ and $2^{3}P(L = 1)-$states in He atom(s).
