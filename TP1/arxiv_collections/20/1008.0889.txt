Intensive experiments have revealed that the superconductivity of the
hole-doped cuprates can be strongly suppressed at the so-called magic doping
fractions. Despite great research efforts, the origin of the `magic doping'
remains mysterious. Recently, we have developed a real-space theory of
high-temperature superconductivity which reveals the intrinsic relationship
between the localized Cooper pair and the localized hole pair
(arXiv:1007.3536). Here we report that the theory can naturally explain the
emergence of non-superconducting checkerboard phases and the magic doping
problem in hole-doped cuprate superconductors. It clearly shows that there
exist only seven `magic numbers' in the cuprate family at $x=$1/18, 1/16, 2/25,
1/9, 1/8, 2/9 and 1/4 with 6a*6a, 4a*4a, 5a*5a, 3a*3a, 4a*4a, 3a*3a and 2a*2a
checkerboard patterns, respectively. Moreover, our framework leads directly to
a satisfactory explanation of the most recent discovery [M. J. Lawler, et al.
Nature 466, 347 (2010)] of the symmetries broken within each copper-oxide unit
in hole-doped cuprate superconductors. These findings may shed new light on the
mechanism of superconductivity.
