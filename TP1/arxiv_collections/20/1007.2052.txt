The longitudinal asymmetry induced by parity-violating (PV) components in the
nucleon-nucleon potential is studied in the charge-exchange reaction 3He(n,p)3H
at vanishing incident neutron energies. An expression for the PV observable is
derived in terms of T-matrix elements for transitions from the {2S+1}L_J=1S_0
and 3S_1 states in the incoming n-3He channel to states with J=0 and 1 in the
outgoing p-3H channel. The T-matrix elements involving PV transitions are
obtained in first-order perturbation theory in the hadronic weak-interaction
potential, while those connecting states of the same parity are derived from
solutions of the strong-interaction Hamiltonian with the
hyperspherical-harmonics method. The coupled-channel nature of the scattering
problem is fully accounted for. Results are obtained corresponding to realistic
or chiral two- and three-nucleon strong-interaction potentials in combination
with either the DDH or pionless EFT model for the weak-interaction potential.
The asymmetries, predicted with PV pion and vector-meson coupling constants
corresponding (essentially) to the DDH "best values" set, range from -9.44 to
-2.48 in units of 10^{-8}, depending on the input strong-interaction
Hamiltonian. This large model dependence is a consequence of cancellations
between long-range (pion) and short-range (vector-meson) contributions, and is
of course sensitive to the assumed values for the PV coupling constants.
