From a theory of an abstract quantum information the theory of general
relativity can be deduced by means of few and physically good founded reasons.
"Abstract" quantum information means that primarily no special meaning is
connected with it. Therefore it is named with a new denotation: Protyposis.
From the Protyposis and by using group-theoretical methods follows a
cosmological model, which has an isotropic and homogeneous metric and solves
the so-called cosmological problems. The Protyposis is subject to an equation
of states for energy density and pressure that fulfils all the energy
conditions and that also gives an explanation for the "dark energy". If it is
demanded that the relations between spacetime structure and the material
content should remain valid for variations from this ideal cosmology, then
general relativity results from this quantum theoretical considerations as a
description for local inhomogenities.
