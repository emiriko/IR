We give two proofs that the $h$-vector of any paving matroid is a pure
O-sequence, thus answering in the affirmative a conjecture made by R. Stanley,
for this particular class of matroids. We also investigate the problem of
obtaining good lower bounds for the number of bases of a paving matroid given
its rank and number of elements.
