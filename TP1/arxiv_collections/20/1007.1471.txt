A counterpart of the Mollow triplet (luminescence lineshape of a two-level
system under coherent excitation) is obtained for the case of incoherent
excitation in a cavity. Its analytical expression, in excellent agreement with
numerical results, pinpoints analogies and differences between the conventional
resonance fluorescence spectrum and its cavity QED analogue under incoherent
excitation.
