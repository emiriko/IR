The climate belongs to the class of non-equilibrium forced and dissipative
systems, for which most results of quasi-equilibrium statistical mechanics,
including the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, do not apply. We show for the
first time how the Ruelle linear response theory, developed for studying
rigorously the impact of perturbations on general observables of
non-equilibrium statistical mechanical systems, can be applied to analyze the
climatic response. We choose as test bed the Lorenz 96 model, which has a
well-recognized prototypical value. We recapitulate the main aspects of the
response theory and propose some new results. We then analyze the frequency
dependence of the response of both local and global observables to
perturbations with localized as well as global spatial patterns. We derive
analytically the asymptotic behaviour, validity of Kramers-Kronig relations,
and sum rules for the susceptibilities, and related them to parameters
describing the unperturbed properties of the system. We verify the theoretical
predictions from the outputs of the simulations with great precision. The
theory is used to explain differences in the response of local and global
observables, in defining the intensive properties of the system and in
generalizing the concept of climate sensitivity to all time scales. We also
show how to reconstruct the linear Green function, which maps perturbations of
general time patterns into changes in the expectation value of the considered
observable. Finally, we propose a general methodology to study Climate Change
problems by resorting to few, well selected simulations and discuss the
specific case of surface temperature response to changes of the $CO_2$
concentration. This approach may provide a radically new perspective to study
rigorously the problem of climate sensitivity and climate change.
