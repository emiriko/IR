Since1984 asteroid study is conducted at Department of Astronomy, Bandung
Institute of Technology. At present there are two main streams in our research,
dynamical and physical study. Astronomers determine the orbital elements of
more than 12000 asteroids, and the number is increasing. In the distribution of
orbital elements of asteroids, there are several features such as Kirkwood gap,
groups, and families. To know the dynamical evolution of asteroids, it is very
important to study these features. Recently some small bodies of our solar
system have been approached to the Earth, one of them was Toutatis. These
objects are interested to study. Based on 2384 asteroids taken from NASA.File
the phenomenon of orbital elements a, e, i, {\Omega}, {\omega} and Tisserand
invariant, T of Near-Earth asteroids are briefly described.
