Using orbital integration and analytical arguments, we have found a new
mechanism (an "eccentricity trap") to halt type I migration of planets near the
inner edge of a protoplanetary disk. Because asymmetric eccentricity damping
due to disk-planet interaction on the innermost planet at the disk edge plays a
crucial role in the trap, this mechanism requires continuous eccentricity
excitation and hence works for a resonantly interacting convoy of planets. This
trap is so strong that the edge torque exerted on the innermost planet can
completely halt type I migrations of many outer planets through mutual resonant
perturbations. Consequently, the convoy stays outside the disk edge, as a
whole. We have derived semi-analytical formula for the condition for the
eccentricity trap and predict how many planets are likely to be trapped. We
found that several planets or more should be trapped by this mechanism in
protoplanetary disks that have cavities. It can be responsible for the
formation of non-resonant, multiple, close-in super-Earth systems extending
beyond 0.1AU. Such systems are being revealed by radial velocity observations
to be quite common around solar-type stars.
