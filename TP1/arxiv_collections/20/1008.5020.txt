For the very first time, the correlation femtoscopy method is applied to a
kinematically complete measurement of meson production in the collisions of
hadrons. The shape of the two-proton correlation function derived for the pp ->
ppeta reaction differs from that for the pp -> pp(pions) and both do not show a
peak structure opposite to results determined for inclusive measurements of
heavy ion collisions.
