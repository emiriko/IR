We point out that the type III seesaw mechanism introducing fermion triplets
predicts peculiar Higgs boson signatures of displaced vertices with two b jets
and one or two charged particles which can be cleanly identified. In a
supersymmetric theory, the scalar partner of the fermion triplet contains a
neutral dark matter candidate which is almost degenerate with its charged
components. A Higgs boson can be produced together with such a dark matter
triplet in the cascade decay chain of a strongly produced squark or gluino.
When the next lightest supersymmetric particle (NLSP) is bino/wino-like, there
appears a Higgs boson associated with two charged tracks of a charged lepton
and a heavy charged scalar at a displacement larger than about 1 mm. The
corresponding production cross-section is about 0.5 fb for the squark/gluino
mass of 1 TeV. In the case of the stau NLSP, it decays mainly to a Higgs boson
and a heavy charged scalar whose decay length is larger than 0.1 mm for the
stau NLSP mixing with the left-handed stau smaller than 0.3. As this process
can have a large cascade production $\sim 2$ pb for the squark/gluino mass
$\sim 1$ TeV, one may be able to probe it at the early stage of the LHC
experiment.
