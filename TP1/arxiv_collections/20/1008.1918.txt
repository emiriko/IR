The photon spectrum accompanying the orbital K-electron capture in the first
forbidden unique decay of 81Kr was measured. The total radiation intensity for
the photon energies larger than 50 keV was found to be 1.47(6) x 10^{-4} per
K-capture. Both the shape of the spectrum and its intensity relative to the
ordinary, non-radiative capture rate, are compared to theoretical predictions.
The best agreement is found for the recently developed model which employs the
length gauge for the electromagnetic field.
