A new systematic correction for Casimir force measurements is proposed and
applied to the results of an experiment that was performed more than a decade
ago. This correction brings the experimental results into good agreement with
the Drude model of the metallic plates' permittivity. The systematic is due to
time-dependent fluctuations in the distance between the plates caused by
mechanical vibrations or tilt, or position measurement uncertainty, and is
similar to the correction for plate roughness.
