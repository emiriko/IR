We investigate the stability and fluctuations of a soft wall model that has
an asymptotically AdS metric and a scalar field that has an asymptotically
power-law dependence in the conformal coordinate. By imposing UV boundary
conditions, the soft wall mass scale can be fixed to be near the TeV scale and
causes the radion to no longer be massless. A hierarchy between the weak scale
and the Planck scale can be generated for various particle spectrum behavior,
although natural values only occur for a gravitational sector containing scalar
fields that act like unparticles. In addition, if bulk Standard Model fields
have nonstandard couplings to the gravitational sector, then a discrete
particle spectrum can be realized in the nongravitational sector. This allows
for the possibility of an unparticle solution to the hierarchy problem.
