In some interesting work of James Lidsey, the dynamics of
Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) cosmology with positive curvature
and a perfect fluid matter source is shown to be modeled in terms of a
time-dependent, harmonically trapped Bose-Einstein condensate. In the present
work, we extend this dynamic correspondence to both FLRW and Bianchi I
cosmologies in arbitrary dimension, especially when a cosmological constant is
present.
