In a recent Letter [Phys. Rev. Lett. 103, 156101 (2009)], we presented
experiments on critical Casimir induced colloidal aggregation in a system with
negligibly small van der Waals forces. We presented a simple model based on a
competition between repulsive electrostatic and attractive critical Casimir
forces to account for the observed aggregation. A recent comment [A. Gambassi,
S. Dietrich, arXiv:1006.5897v1] proposed that the simple model should be
regarded with caution as to its domain of application, and that it can be
refined in a number of different ways. Here, we revisit our experimental
finding and give a reply to the comment.
