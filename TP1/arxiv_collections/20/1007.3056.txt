The kinematics and elemental abundances of resolved stars in the nearby
Universe can be used to infer conditions at high redshift, trace how galaxies
evolve and constrain the nature of dark matter. This approach is complementary
to direct study of systems at high redshift, but I will show that analysis of
individual stars allows one to break degeneracies, such as between star
formation rate and stellar Initial Mass Function, that complicate the analysis
of unresolved, distant galaxies.
