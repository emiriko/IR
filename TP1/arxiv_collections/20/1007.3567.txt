BH3 mimetics have been proposed as new anticancer therapeutics. They target
anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins, up-regulation of which has been implicated in
the resistance of many cancer cells, particularly leukemia and lymphoma cells,
to apoptosis. Using probabilistic computational modeling of the mitochondrial
pathway of apoptosis, verified by single-cell experimental observations, we
develop a model of Bcl-2 inhibition of apoptosis. Our results clarify how Bcl-2
imparts its anti-apoptotic role by increasing the time-to-death and
cell-to-cell variability. We also show that although the commitment to death is
highly impacted by differences in protein levels at the time of stimulation,
inherent stochastic fluctuations in apoptotic signaling are sufficient to
induce cell-to-cell variability and to allow single cells to escape death. This
study suggests that intrinsic cell-to-cell stochastic variability in apoptotic
signaling is sufficient to cause fractional killing of cancer cells after
exposure to BH3 mimetics. This is an unanticipated facet of cancer
chemoresistance.
