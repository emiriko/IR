In this paper we define distributions on moment spaces corresponding to
measures on the real line with an unbounded support. We identify these
distributions as limiting distributions of random moment vectors defined on
compact moment spaces and as distributions corresponding to random spectral
measures associated with the Jacobi, Laguerre and Hermite ensemble from random
matrix theory. For random vectors on the unbounded moment spaces we prove a
central limit theorem where the centering vectors correspond to the moments of
the Marchenko-Pastur distribution and Wigner's semi-circle law.
