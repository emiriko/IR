We perform a study of exclusive production of$D^+_sD^-_s$, $D^{*+}_sD^-_s$,
and $D^{*+}_sD^{*-}_s$ final states in initial-state-radiation events from $e^+
e^-$ annihilations at a center-of-mass energy near 10.58 GeV, to search for
charmonium $1^{--}$ states. The data sample corresponds to an integrated
luminosity of 525 $fb^{-1}$ and was recorded by the BaBar experiment at the
PEP-II storage ring. The $D^+_sD^-_s$, $D^{*+}_sD^-_s$, and $D^{*+}_sD^{*-}_s$
mass spectra show evidence of the known $\psi$ resonances. Limits are extracted
for the branching ratios of the decays $X(4260)\to D^{(*)+}_sD^{(*)-}_s$.
