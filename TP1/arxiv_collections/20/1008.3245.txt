It has been conjectured that the relative phase between strong and
electromagnetic amplitudes is universally $-90^{\circ}$ in charmonium decays.
$\psi^{\prime}$ decaying into pseudoscalar pair provides a possibility to test
this conjecture. However, the experimentally observed cross section for such a
process is depicted by the two-fold integral which takes into account the
initial state radiative (ISR) correction and energy spread effect. Using the
generalized linear regression approach, a complex energy-dependent factor is
approximated by a linear function of energy. Taking advantage of this
simplification, the integration of ISR correction can be performed and an
analytical expression with accuracy at the level of 1% is obtained. Then, the
original two-fold integral is simplified into a one-fold integral, which
reduces the total computing time by two orders of magnitude. Such a simplified
expression for the observed cross section usually plays an indispensable role
in the optimization of scan data taking, the determination of systematic
uncertainty, and the analysis of data correlation.
