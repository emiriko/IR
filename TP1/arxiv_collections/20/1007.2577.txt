We measure the lifetime ($T_{1}$) and coherence ($T_{2}$) of two-level defect
states (TLSs) in the insulating barrier of a Josephson phase qubit and compare
to the interaction strength between the two systems. We find for the average
decay times a power law dependence on the corresponding interaction strengths,
whereas for the average coherence times we find an optimum at intermediate
coupling strengths. We explain both the lifetime and the coherence results
using the standard TLS model, including dipole radiation by phonons and
anti-correlated dependence of the energy parameters on environmental
fluctuations.
