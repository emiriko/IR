We prove a one-parameter family of sharp integral inequalities for functions
on the $n$-dimensional unit ball. The inequalities are conformally invariant,
and the sharp constants are attained for functions that are equivalent to a
constant function under conformal transformations. As a limiting case, we
obtain an inequality that generalizes Carleman's inequality for harmonic
functions in the plane to poly-harmonic functions in higher dimensions.
