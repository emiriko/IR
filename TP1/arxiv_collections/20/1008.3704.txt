Ballistic semiconductor structures have allowed the realization of
optics-like phenomena in electronics, including magnetic focusing and lensing.
An extension that appears unique to graphene is to use both n and p carrier
types to create electronic analogs of optical devices having both positive and
negative indices of refraction. Here, we use gate-controlled density with both
p and n carrier types to demonstrate the analog of the fiber-optic guiding in
graphene. Two basic effects are investigated: (1) bipolar p-n junction guiding,
based on the principle of angle-selective transmission though the graphene p-n
interface, and (2) unipolar fiber-optic guiding, using total internal
reflection controlled by carrier density. Modulation of guiding efficiency
through gating is demonstrated and compared to numerical simulations, which
indicates that interface roughness limits guiding performance, with
few-nanometer effective roughness extracted. The development of p-n and
fiber-optic guiding in graphene may lead to electrically reconfigurable wiring
in high-mobility devices.
