The spin-1/2 Ising-Heisenberg model on diamond-like decorated Bethe lattices
is exactly solved with the help of decoration-iteration transformation and
exact recursion relations. It is shown that the model under investigation
exhibits reentrant phase transitions whenever a sufficiently high coordination
number of the underlying Bethe lattice is considered.
