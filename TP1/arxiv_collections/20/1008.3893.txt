We model the spreading of a crisis by constructing a global economic network
and applying the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) epidemic model with a
variable probability of infection. The probability of infection depends on the
strength of economic relations between the pair of countries, and the strength
of the target country. It is expected that a crisis which originates in a large
country, such as the USA, has the potential to spread globally, like the recent
crisis. Surprisingly we show that also countries with much lower GDP, such as
Belgium, are able to initiate a global crisis. Using the {\it k}-shell
decomposition method to quantify the spreading power (of a node), we obtain a
measure of ``centrality'' as a spreader of each country in the economic
network. We thus rank the different countries according to the shell they
belong to, and find the 12 most central countries. These countries are the most
likely to spread a crisis globally. Of these 12 only six are large economies,
while the other six are medium/small ones, a result that could not have been
otherwise anticipated. Furthermore, we use our model to predict the crisis
spreading potential of countries belonging to different shells according to the
crisis magnitude.
