We have performed a comprehensive chemical abundance analysis of the
extremely metal-poor ([Ar/H]<-2) halo planetary nebula (PN) BoBn 1 based on IUE
archive data, Subaru/HDS spectra, VLT/UVES archive data, and Spitzer/IRS
spectra. We have detected over 600 lines in total and calculated ionic and
elemental abundances of 13 elements using detected optical recombination lines
(ORLs) and collisionally excited lines (CELs). The estimations of C, N, O, and
Ne abundances from the ORLs and Kr, Xe, and Ba from the CELs are done the first
for this nebula, empirically and theoretically. The C, N, O, and Ne abundances
from ORLs are systematically larger than those from CELs. The abundance
discrepancies apart from O could be explained by a temperature fluctuation
model, and that of O might be by a hydrogen deficient cold component model. We
have detected 5 fluorine and several s-process elements. The amounts of [F/H],
[Kr/H], and [Xe/H] suggest that BoBn 1 is the most F-rich among F detected PNe
and is a heavy s-process element rich PN. We have confirmed dust in the nebula
that is composed of amorphous carbon and PAHs with a total mass of 5.8 x 10^-6
Msun. The photo-ionization models built with non-LTE theoretical stellar
atmospheres indicate that the progenitor was a 1-1.5 Msun star that would
evolve into a white dwarf with an ~0.62 Msun core mass and ~0.09 Msun ionized
nebula. The derived elemental abundances have been reviewed from the standpoint
of theoretical nucleosynthesis models. It is likely that the elemental
abundances except N could be explained either by a 1.5 Msun single star model
or by a binary model composed of 0.75 Msun + 1.5 Msun stars. Careful
examination implies that BoBn 1 has evolved from a 0.75 Msun + 1.5 Msun binary
and experienced coalescence during the evolution to become a visible PN,
similar to the other extremely metal-poor halo PN, K 648 in M 15.
