Using the brick wall method, we study statistical entropy for spherically
symmetric black holes in Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity. In particular, a Lifshitz
scalar field is considered in order to incorporate foliation preserving
diffeomorphism which eventually gives a modified dispersion relation. Finally,
we obtain the area law without UV cutoff for $z > 3$, and discuss some of
consequences in connection with the generalized uncertainty principle.
