With the discovery of new exploit techniques, new protection mechanisms are
needed as well. Mitigations like DEP (Data Execution Prevention) or ASLR
(Address Space Layout Randomization) created a significantly more difficult
environment for vulnerability exploitation. Attackers, however, have recently
developed new exploitation methods which are capable of bypassing the operating
system's security protection mechanisms. In this paper we present a short
summary of novel and known mitigation techniques against return-oriented
programming (ROP) attacks. The techniques described in this article are related
mostly to x86-32 processors and Microsoft Windows operating systems.
