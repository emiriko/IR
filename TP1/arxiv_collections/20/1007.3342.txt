The inter-layer magnetoresistance in a multilayered massless Dirac fermion
system, $\alpha$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$I$_3$, under hydrostatic pressure was
investigated. We succeeded in detecting the zero-mode (n=0) Landau level and
its spin splitting in the magnetic field normal to the 2D plane. We
demonstrated that the effective Coulomb interaction in the magnetic field
intensifies the spin splitting of zero-mode Landau carriers. At temperatures
below 2K, magnetic fields above several Tesla break the twofold valley
degeneracy.
