We report ac magnetic susceptibility and dc magnetization measurements on the
superconducting ferromagnet UCoGe (with superconducting and Curie temperatures
of $T_{{\rm SC}} \sim 0.5$~K and $T_{{\rm Curie}} \sim 2.5$~K, respectively).
In the normal, ferromagnetic state ($T_{{\rm SC}} < T < T_{{\rm Curie}}$), the
magnetization curve exhibits a hysteresis loop similar to that of a regular
itinerant ferromagnet. Upon lowering the temperature below $T_{{\rm SC}}$, the
spontaneous magnetization is unchanged, but the hysteresis is markedly
enhanced. Even deeply inside the superconducting state, ferromagnetism is not
completely shielded, and there is no Meissner region, a magnetic field region
of $H < H_{\rm c1}$ (a lower critical field). From these results, we suggest
that UCoGe is the first material in which ferromagnetism robustly survives in
the superconducting state and a spontaneous vortex state without the Meissner
state is realized.
