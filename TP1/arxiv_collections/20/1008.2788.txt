In normal mesoscopic metals of a ring topology persistent currents can be
induced by threading the center of the ring with a magnetic flux. This
phenomenon is an example of the famous Aharonov-Bohm effect. In the paper we
study the current {\it vs} the external constant magnetic flux characteristics
of the system driven by both the classical and the quantum thermal
fluctuations. The problem is formulated in terms of Langevin equations in
classical and quantum Smoluchowski regimes. We analyze the impact of the
quantum thermal fluctuations on the current-flux characteristics. We
demonstrate that the current response can be changed from paramagnetic to
diamagnetic when the quantum nature of the thermal fluctuations increases.
