We present a first application of the recently proposed LITMUS test for
magnetic helicity, as well as a thorough study of its applicability under
different circumstances. In order to apply this test to the galactic magnetic
field, the newly developed critical filter formalism is used to produce an
all-sky map of the Faraday depth. The test does not detect helicity in the
galactic magnetic field. To understand the significance of this finding, we
made an applicability study, showing that a definite conclusion about the
absence of magnetic helicity in the galactic field has not yet been reached.
This study is conducted by applying the test to simulated observational data.
We consider simulations in a flat sky approximation and all-sky simulations,
both with assumptions of constant electron densities and realistic
distributions of thermal and cosmic ray electrons. Our results suggest that the
LITMUS test does indeed perform very well in cases where constant electron
densities can be assumed, both in the flat-sky limit and in the galactic
setting. Non-trivial distributions of thermal and cosmic ray electrons,
however, may complicate the scenario to the point where helicity in the
magnetic field can escape detection.
