In this work we study the convex set of quantum states from a quantum logical
point of view. We consider an algebraic structure based on the convex subsets
of this set. The relationship of this algebraic structure with the lattice of
propositions of quantum logic is shown. This new structure is suitable for the
study of compound systems and shows new differences between quantum and
classical mechanics. This differences are linked to the nontrivial correlations
which appear when quantum systems interact. They are reflected in the new
propositional structure, and do not have a classical analogue. This approach is
also suitable for an algebraic characterization of entanglement.
