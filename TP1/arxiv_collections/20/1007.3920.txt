We classify local unitary equivalence classes of symmetric states via a
classification of their local unitary stabilizer subgroups. For states whose
local unitary stabilizer groups have a positive number of continuous degrees of
freedom, the classification is exhaustive. We show that local unitary
stabilizer groups with no continuous degrees of freedom are isomorphic to
finite subgroups of the rotation group SO(3), and give examples of states with
discrete stabilizers.
