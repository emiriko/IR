In this paper we study the existence of minimizers for a class of constrained
minimization problems that are invariant under translations. We call
$$I_{\rho^{2}}:=\inf_{B_{\rho}}I(u) \ $$ where $B_{\rho}=\{u\in
H^{m}(\R^{N}):\|u\|_{2}=\rho\},$ and $I(u)=1/2\|u\|^{2}_{D^{m,2}}+T(u)$, $T$
fulfilling general assumptions. We show that the regularity of the function
$$(0,\infty)\ni s \mapsto I_{s^2}\,$$ and the behaviour of
$\frac{I_{s^2}}{s^2}$ in the neighborhood of zero allows to prove the strong
subadditivity inequality. As byproduct the strong convergence of the minimizing
sequences (up to translations) is proved. We give an application to the energy
functional $I$ associated to the Schr\"odinger-Poisson equation in $\R^{3}$
orbitally stable standing waves with arbitray charge for the following
Schr\"odinger-Poisson type equation \label{SP} i\psi_{t}+ \Delta \psi -
(|x|^{-1}*|\psi|^{2}) \psi+|\psi|^{p-2}\psi=0 \text{in} \R^{3}, \text{with} \
2<p<3. When $2<p<3$, In particular we prove that $I$ achieves its minimum on
the constraint $\{u\in H^{1}(\R^{3}): \|u\|_{2}=\rho\}$ for every $\rho>0$ and,
as a consequence, the set of minimizers is orbitally stable. This covers the
physically relevant case, $p=8/3$, the so called Schr\"odinger-Poisson-Slater
system.
