The essential role of long range elastic interactions in recrystallization is
demonstrated using a simple analytical model: pileup rearrangements following
absorption of leading dislocations by a dislocation-free embryo provides an
additional driving force that results in a drastic decrease of both the
nucleation critical radius and the saddle point energy. A very sharp transition
is evidenced, at which the saddle point totally disappears and nucleation
becomes spontaneous. This transition occurs for a well defined critical stress
corresponding to both a critical density of geometrically necessary
dislocations and a critical strain, without invoking any critical nucleus size
that may be reached with the help of some dislocation microstructure
instability. The present model is illustrated here by the case of
polycrystalline ice, but may apply to other crystalline material with
significant plastic anisotropy, as Zircaloy for instance.
