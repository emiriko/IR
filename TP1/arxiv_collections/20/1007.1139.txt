We theoretically investigate the electro-mechanics of a Suspended Carbon
Nanotube with a Deflection Sensitive Resistance subjected to a homogeneous
Magnetic Field and a constant Voltage Bias. We show that, (with the exception
of a singular case), for a sufficiently high magnetic field the
time-independent state of charge transport through the nanotube becomes
unstable to selfexcitations of the mechanical vibration accompanied by
oscialltions in the voltage drop and current across the nanotube.
