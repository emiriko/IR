We propose an all optical way to measure the recently proposed "photovoltaic
Hall effect", i.e., a DC Hall effect induced by a circularly polarized light in
the absence of static magnetic fields. For this, we have calculated the Faraday
rotation angle induced by the photovoltaic Hall effect with the Kubo formula
extended for photovoltaic optical response in the presence of strong AC
electric fields treated with the Floquet formalism. We also point out the
possibility of observing the effect in three-dimensional graphite, and more
generally in multi-band systems such as materials described by the dp-model.
