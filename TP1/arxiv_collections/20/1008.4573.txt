The IfA Deep survey uncovered ~130 thermonuclear supernovae (TNSNe, i.e. Type
Ia) candidates at redshifts from z=0.1 out to beyond z=1. The TNSN explosion
rates derived from these data have been controversial, conflicting with
evidence emerging from other surveys. This work revisits the IfA Deep survey to
re-evaluate the photometric evidence. Applying the SOFT program to the light
curves of all SN candidates, we derive new classification grades and redshift
estimates. We find a volumetric rate for z~0.5 that is substantially smaller
than the originally published values, bringing the revised IfA Deep rate into
good agreement with other surveys. With our improved photometric analysis
techniques, we are able to confidently extend the rate measurements to higher
redshifts, and we find a steadily increasing TNSN rate, with no indication of a
peak out to z=1.05.
