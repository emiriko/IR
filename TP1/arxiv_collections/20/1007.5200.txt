We present dynamical models of NGC 4494, which we built using our iterative
method presented in a previous paper. These models are live N-body models
consisting of equal mass particles, and they are steady state as confirmed by a
fully self-consistent evolution. Our goals were twofold. The first one --
namely to test whether our iterative method could indeed be used to construct
galactic models following given observational constraints, both photometric and
kinematic -- was fully achieved. Our method allowed us to go beyond a simple
spherical model and to make full sets of rotating, axisymmetric models without
any limitations to the velocity distribution. Our second goal was to understand
better the structure of NGC 4494, and more specifically to set constraints on
its halo mass. For this we tried three families of models: without halo, with a
light halo and with a heavy halo, respectively. Our models reproduce well the
photometry and the kinematics, the latter except specific regions where some
non-equilibrium or non-axisymmetric structure could be present in the galaxy
(e.g. the kinematically decoupled core). However, the lower order moments of
the velocity distribution (up to and including the second order) do not allow
us to discriminate between the three halos. On the other hand, when we extend
the comparison to the higher order moments of the velocity distribution
obtained from the long-slit data, we find that our light halo model fits the
data better than the no halo, or the heavy halo models. They also reproduce the
shape of the angular dependence of the PNe velocity dispersion in the outermost
parts of the galaxy, but not the amplitude of its azimuthal variation. This may
imply that a yet more general class of models, such as triaxial, may be
necessary for a yet better fit.
