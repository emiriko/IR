Let $G$ be a connected reductive algebraic group defined over the finite
field $\F_q$, where $q$ is a power of a good prime for $G$, and let $F$ denote
the corresponding Frobenius endomorphism, so that $G^F$ is a finite reductive
group. Let $u \in G^F$ be a unipotent element and let $\Gamma_u$ be the
associated generalised Gelfand-Graev representation of $G^F$. Under the
assumption that $G$ has a connected centre, we show that the dimension of the
endomorphism algebra of $\Gamma_u$ is a polynomial in $q$, with degree given by
$\dim C_G(u)$. When the centre of $G$ is disconnected, it is impossible, in
general, to parametrise the (isomorphism classes of) generalised Gelfand-Graev
representations independently of $q$, unless one adopts a convention of
considering separately various congruence classes of $q$. Subject to such a
convention we extend our result.
