We propose a temporally multiplexed version of the Duan-Lukin-Cirac-Zoller
(DLCZ) quantum repeater protocol using controlled inhomogeneous spin broadening
in atomic gases. A first analysis suggests that the advantage of multiplexing
is negated by noise due to spin wave excitations corresponding to unobserved
directions of Stokes photon emission. However, this problem can be overcome
with the help of a moderate-finesse cavity which is in resonance with Stokes
photons, but invisible to the anti-Stokes photons. Our proposal promises
greatly enhanced quantum repeater performance with atomic gases.
