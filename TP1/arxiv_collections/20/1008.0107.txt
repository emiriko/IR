The paper considers the electrodisintegration of the deuteron for kinematic
conditions of the JLab experiment E-94-019. The calculations have been
performed within the covariant Bethe-Salpeter approach with a separable kernel
of nucleon-nucleon interactions. The results have been obtained using the
relativistic plane wave impulse approximation and compared with experimental
data and other models. The influence of nucleon electromagnetic form factors
has been investigated.
