We discuss, in terms of rate-distortion theory, the fitness of molecular
codes as the problem of designing an optimal information channel. The fitness
is governed by an interplay between the cost and quality of the channel, which
induces smoothness in the code. By incorporating this code fitness into
population dynamics models, we suggest that the emergence and evolution of
molecular codes may be explained by simple channel design considerations.
