We provide quantitative predictions for the rapidity, centrality and energy
dependencies of inclusive charged-hadron productions for the forthcoming LHC
measurements in nucleus-nucleus collisions based on the idea of gluon
saturation in the color-glass condensate framework. Our formulation gives very
good descriptions of the first data from the LHC for the inclusive
charged-hadron production in proton-proton collisions, the deep inelastic
scattering at HERA at small Bjorken-x, and the hadron multiplicities in
nucleus-nucleus collisions at RHIC.
