We present an algorithm to identify individual neural spikes observed on
high-density multi-electrode arrays (MEAs). Our method can distinguish large
numbers of distinct neural units, even when spikes overlap, and accounts for
intrinsic variability of spikes from each unit. As MEAs grow larger, it is
important to find spike-identification methods that are scalable, that is, the
computational cost of spike fitting should scale well with the number of units
observed. Our algorithm accomplishes this goal, and is fast, because it
exploits the spatial locality of each unit and the basic biophysics of
extracellular signal propagation. Human intervention is minimized and
streamlined via a graphical interface. We illustrate our method on data from a
mammalian retina preparation and document its performance on simulated data
consisting of spikes added to experimentally measured background noise. The
algorithm is highly accurate.
