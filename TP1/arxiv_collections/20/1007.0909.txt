We find that the electronic spin rotation induced by drift transport around a
closed path in a wide variety of nonmagnetic semiconductors at zero magnetic
field depends solely on the physical path taken. Physical paths that produce
any possible spin rotation due to transport around a closed path are
constructed for electrons experiencing strain or electric fields in (001),
(110), or (111)-grown zincblende semiconductor quantum wells. Spin decoherence
due to travel along the path is negligible compared to the background spin
decoherence rate. The small size of the designed paths (<100 nm scale in GaAs)
may lead to applications in nanoscale spintronic circuits.
