We solve the neutron-deuteron (nd) scattering in the Faddeev formalism,
employing the NN sector of the quark-model baryon-baryon interaction fss2. The
energy-dependence of the NN interaction, inherent to the resonating-group
formulation of the quark-model baryon-baryon interaction, is eliminated by the
standard off-shell transformation utilizing the normalization kernel of
two-cluster systems. An extra nonlocality originating from this procedure is
very important to reproduce all the nd scattering observables below E_n < 65
MeV. A new algorithm to solve the Alt-Glassberger-Sandhas (AGS) equations is
presented in the Noyes-Kowalski method. The treatment of the moving singularity
from the three-body Green function is shown in detail, which is based on the
spline function method originally developed by the Bochum-Krakow group. The
predicted elastic differnetial cross sections reproduce the observed deep cross
section minima at E_n=35-65 MeV and $\theta_{c.m}=130^{\circ}-135^{\circ}$,
which is consitent with the nearly correct triton binding energy predicted by
fss2 without the three-body force.
