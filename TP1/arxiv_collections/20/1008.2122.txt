We propose an approach for constructing secret and private keys based on the
long-known Slepian-Wolf code, due to Wyner, for correlated sources connected by
a virtual additive noise channel. Our work is motivated by results of Csisz\'ar
and Narayan which highlight innate connections between secrecy generation by
multiple terminals that observe correlated source signals and Slepian-Wolf
near-lossless data compression. Explicit procedures for such constructions and
their substantiation are provided. The performance of low density parity check
channel codes in devising a new class of secret keys is examined.
