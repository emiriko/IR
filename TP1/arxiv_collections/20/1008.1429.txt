In a previous paper the authors developed an operator-algebraic approach to
Lewis Bowen's sofic measure entropy that yields invariants for actions of
countable sofic groups by homeomorphisms on a compact metrizable space and by
measure-preserving transformations on a standard probability space. We show
here that these measure and topological entropy invariants both coincide with
their classical counterparts when the acting group is amenable.
