Ribosome is a molecular machine that polymerizes a protein where the sequence
of the amino acid residues, the monomers of the protein, is dictated by the
sequence of codons (triplets of nucleotides) on a messenger RNA (mRNA) that
serves as the template. The ribosome is a molecular motor that utilizes the
template mRNA strand also as the track. Thus, in each step the ribosome moves
forward by one codon and, simultaneously, elongates the protein by one amino
acid. We present a theoretical model that captures most of the main steps in
the mechano-chemical cycle of a ribosome. The stochastic movement of the
ribosome consists of an alternating sequence of pause and translocation; the
sum of the durations of a pause and the following translocation is the time of
dwell of the ribosome at the corresponding codon. We derive the analytical
expression for the distribution of the dwell times of a ribosome in our model.
Whereever experimental data are available, our theoretical predictions are
consistent with those results. We suggest appropriate experiments to test the
new predictions of our model, particularly, the effects of the quality control
mechanism of the ribosome and that of their crowding on the mRNA track.
