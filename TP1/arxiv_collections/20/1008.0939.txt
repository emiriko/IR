We show that the existence of the water-like anomalies in kinetic
coefficients in the core-softened systems depends on the trajectory in $\rho-T$
plane along which the kinetic coefficients are calculated. In particular, it is
shown that the diffusion anomaly does exist along the isotherms, but disappears
along the isochores. We analyze the applicability of the Rosenfeld entropy
scaling relations to the systems with the core-softened potentials
demonstrating the water-like anomalies. It is shown that the validity of the of
Rosenfeld scaling relation for the diffusion coefficient also depends on the
trajectory in the $\rho-T$ plane along which the kinetic coefficients and the
excess entropy are calculated. In particular, it is valid along isochors, but
it breaks down along isotherms.
