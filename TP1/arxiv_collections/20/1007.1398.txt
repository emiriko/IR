The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is a well-known model organism used to
investigate fundamental questions in biology. Motility assays of this small
roundworm are designed to study the relationships between genes and behavior.
Commonly, motility analysis is used to classify nematode movements and
characterize them quantitatively. Over the past years, C. elegans' motility has
been studied across a wide range of environments, including crawling on
substrates, swimming in fluids, and locomoting through microfluidic substrates.
However, each environment often requires customized image processing tools
relying on heuristic parameter tuning. In the present study, we propose a novel
Multi-Environment Model Estimation (MEME) framework for automated image
segmentation that is versatile across various environments. The MEME platform
is constructed around the concept of Mixture of Gaussian (MOG) models, where
statistical models for both the background environment and the nematode
appearance are explicitly learned and used to accurately segment a target
nematode. Our method is designed to simplify the burden often imposed on users;
here, only a single image which includes a nematode in its environment must be
provided for model learning. In addition, our platform enables the extraction
of nematode `skeletons' for straightforward motility quantification. We test
our algorithm on various locomotive environments and compare performances with
an intensity-based thresholding method. Overall, MEME outperforms the
threshold-based approach for the overwhelming majority of cases examined.
Ultimately, MEME provides researchers with an attractive platform for C.
elegans' segmentation and `skeletonizing' across a wide range of motility
assays.
