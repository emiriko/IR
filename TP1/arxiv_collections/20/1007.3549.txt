Liquid xenon detectors such as XENON10 and XENON100 obtain a significant
fraction of their sensitivity to light (<10 GeV) particle dark matter by
looking for nuclear recoils of only a few keV, just above the detector
threshold. Yet in this energy regime a correct treatment of the detector
threshold and resolution remains unclear. The energy dependence of the
scintillation yield of liquid xenon for nuclear recoils also bears heavily on
detector sensitivity, yet numerous measurements have not succeeded in obtaining
concordant results. In this article we show that the ratio of detected
ionization to scintillation can be leveraged to constrain the scintillation
yield. We also present a rigorous treatment of liquid xenon detector threshold
and energy resolution. Notably, the effective energy resolution differs
significantly from a simple Poisson distribution. We conclude with a
calculation of dark matter exclusion limits, and show that existing data from
liquid xenon detectors strongly constrain recent interpretations of light dark
matter.
