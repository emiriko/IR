Ink Drop Spread (IDS) is the engine of Active Learning Method (ALM), which is
the methodology of soft computing. IDS, as a pattern-based processing unit,
extracts useful information from a system subjected to modeling. In spite of
its excellent potential in solving problems such as classification and modeling
compared to other soft computing tools, finding its simple and fast hardware
implementation is still a challenge. This paper describes a new hardware
implementation of IDS method based on the memristor crossbar structure. In
addition of simplicity, being completely real-time, having low latency and the
ability to continue working after the occurrence of power breakdown are some of
the advantages of our proposed circuit.
