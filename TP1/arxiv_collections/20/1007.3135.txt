The combination of high pressure techniques with neutron scattering proves to
be a powerful tool for studying the phase transitions and physical properties
of solids in terms of inter-atomic distances. In our report we are going to
review a high pressure technique based on a gas medium compression. This
technique covers the pressure range up to ~0.7GPa (in special cases 1.4GPa) and
typically uses compressed helium gas as the pressure medium. We are going to
look briefly at scientific areas where high pressure gas vessels are
intensively used in neutron scattering experiments. After that we are going to
describe the current situation in high pressure gas technology; specifically
looking at materials of construction, designs of seals and pressure vessels and
the equipment used for generating high pressure gas.
