Base sequences BS(m,n) are quadruples (A;B;C;D) of {+1,-1}-sequences, A and B
of length m and C and D of length n, the sum of whose non-periodic
auto-correlation functions is zero. Base sequences and some special subclasses
of BS(n+1,n) known as normal and near-normal sequences, NS(n) and NN(n), as
well as T-sequences and orthogonal designs play a prominent role in modern
constructions of Hadamard matrices. In our previous papers (see the references)
we have classified the near-normal sequences NN(s) for all even integers s <=
32 (they do not exist for odd s>1). We now extend the classification to the
case s=34. Moreover we construct the first example of near-normal sequences
NN(36). Consequently, we construct for the first time T-sequences of length 73.
For all smaller lengths, T-sequences were already known. Another consequence is
that 73 is a Yang number, and a few important consequences of this fact are
given.
