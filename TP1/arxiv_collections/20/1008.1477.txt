We study the similarities and differences between different models concerning
subdiffusion. More particularly, we calculate first passage time (FPT)
distributions for subdiffusion, derived from Greens' functions of nonlinear
equations obtained from Sharma-Mittal's, Tsallis's and Gauss's nonadditive
entropies. Then we compare these with FPT distributions calculated from a
fractional model using a subdiffusion equation with a fractional time
derivative. All of Greens' functions give us exactly the same standard relation
$<(\Delta x)^2> =2 D_\alpha t^\alpha$ which characterizes subdiffusion
($0<\alpha<1$), but generally FPT's are not equivalent to one another. We will
show here that the FPT distribution for the fractional model is asymptotically
equal to the Sharma--Mittal model over the long time limit only if in the
latter case one of the three parameters describing Sharma--Mittal entropy $r$
depends on $\alpha$, and satisfies the specific equation derived in this paper,
whereas the other two models mentioned above give different FTPs with the
fractional model. Greens' functions obtained from the Sharma-Mittal and
fractional models - for $r$ obtained from this particular equation - are very
similar to each other. We will also discuss the interpretation of subdiffusion
models based on nonadditive entropies and the possibilities of experimental
measurement of subdiffusion models parameters.
