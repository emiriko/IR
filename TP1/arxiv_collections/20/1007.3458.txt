We describe a parallel hybrid symplectic integrator for planetary system
integration that runs on a graphics processing unit (GPU). The integrator
identifies close approaches between particles and switches from symplectic to
Hermite algorithms for particles that require higher resolution integrations.
The integrator is approximately as accurate as other hybrid symplectic
integrators but is GPU accelerated.
