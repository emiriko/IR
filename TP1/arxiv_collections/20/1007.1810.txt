We propose another method to compute the Casimir force in noncommutative
Randall-Sundrum braneworld model considered by K. Nouicer and Y. Sabri
recently. Our method can be used to compute the Casimir force to any order in
the noncommutative parameter. Contrary to the claim made by K. Nouicer and Y.
Sabri that repulsive Casimir force can appear in the first order approximation,
we show that the Casimir force is always attractive at any order of
approximation.
