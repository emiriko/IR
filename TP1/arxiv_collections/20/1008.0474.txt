A generalized Anderson model for a magnetic ion in a harmonic potential is
formulated. The model is investigated by the numerical renormalization
group(NRG) method. In addition to the conventional s-wave screening, the model
exhibits phonon assisted p-wave Kondo effect as well as Yu and Anderson type
Kondo effect. It is shown that the s-wave Kondo and the Yu-Anderson Kondo
belong to the same fixed point. At the boundary between the s-wave and p-wave
Kondo regions line of fixed points of the two channel Kondo effect is
identified.
