It is shown that broad-line region (BLR) line profiles ranging from the
classic "logarithmic" profile to double-peaked, disk-like profiles are readily
explained by the distribution of BLR gas proposed by Gaskell, Klimek, &
Nazarova (2007; GKN) without any need to invoke fundamental differences in the
AGNs other than differing viewing angles. It is argued that the highly-variable
thermal energy generation in AGNs originates off axis in regions that cannot be
axially symmetric. This off-axis model readily explains the varying degrees of
temporal correlation found in multi-wavelength variability studies, the strong,
variable asymmetry of BLR line profiles, the varying time delays in the
response of the BLR to different continuum events, how narrow velocity ranges
of line profiles will often appear to respond differently or not at all to
continuum variability, complex changes in the Balmer decrement with velocity,
inconsistent and variable inflow/outflow signatures found in velocity-resolved
reverberation mapping, the diversity of velocity-dependent polarizations
observed, and polarization variability. The fundamentally non-axisymmetric
nature of AGN continuum variability severely limits what can be learned from
reverberation mapping. In particular, high-fidelity reverberation mapping is
not possible. There will be systematic orientation-dependent errors in black
hole mass determinations. The effects of off-axis emission will mask subtle
signatures of possible close supermassive black hole binaries. Some tests of
the off-axis-variability model are proposed.
