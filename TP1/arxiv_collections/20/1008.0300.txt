We introduce the CoRoT detrend algorithm (CDA) for detrending CoRoT stellar
light curves. The algorithm CDA has the capability to remove random jumps and
systematic trends encountered in typical CoRoT data in a fully automatic
fashion. Since enormous jumps in flux can destroy the information content of a
light curve, such an algorithm is essential. From a study of 1030 light curves
in the CoRoT IRa01 field, we developed three simple assumptions which upon CDA
is based. We describe the algorithm analytically and provide some examples of
how it works. We demonstrate the functionality of the algorithm in the cases of
CoRoT0102702789, CoRoT0102874481, CoRoT0102741994, and CoRoT0102729260. Using
CDA in the specific case of CoRoT0102729260, we detect a candidate exoplanet
around the host star of spectral type G5, which remains undetected in the raw
light curve, and estimate the planetary parameters to be Rp=6.27Re and P=1.6986
days.
