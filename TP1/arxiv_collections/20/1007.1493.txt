The generalized second law is proven for rapidly-evolving semiclassical
Rindler horizons at each instant of time, for arbitrary interacting quantum
fields minimally coupled to general relativity. The proof requires the
background spacetime to have boost and null translation symmetry. Possible
extensions to more general horizons and matter-gravity couplings are discussed.
