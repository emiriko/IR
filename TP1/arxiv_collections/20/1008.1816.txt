We show that a result equivalent to Overhauser's famous Hartree-Fock
instability theorem can be established for the case of a two-dimensional
electron gas in the presence of Rashba spin-obit coupling. In this case it is
the spatially homogeneous paramagnetic chiral ground state that is shown to be
differentially unstable with respect to a certain class of distortions of the
spin-density-wave and charge-density-wave type. The result holds for all
densities. Basic properties of these inhomogeneous states are analyzed.
