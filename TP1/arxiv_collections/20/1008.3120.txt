We study three newly observed D(2550), D(2610), and D(2760) by the BaBar
Collaboration utilizing the mass spectra and investigating the strong decays.
Our calculation indicates that D(2610) is an admixture of $2^3S_1$ and $1^3D_1$
with $J^P=1^-$. $D(2760)$ can be explained as either the orthogonal partner of
D(2610) or $1^3D_3$. Our estimate of the decay width for $D(2550)$, assuming it
as $2^1S_0$, is far below the experimental value. the threshold effect because
the strong decay of $D(2550)\to D_0^*\pi$ is forbidden.} The decay behavior of
the remaining two 1D charmed mesons, i.e., $^3D_2$ and $^1D_2$ ($J^P=2^-$)
states, is predicted, which will help future experimental search for these
missing $D$-wave charmed mesons.
