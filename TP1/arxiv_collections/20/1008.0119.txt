The well known scaling of the Edwards-Wilkinson equation is essentially
determined by dimensional analysis. Once a drift term is added, more
sophisticated reasoning is required, which initially suggests that the drift
term dominates over the diffusion. However, the diffusion term is dangerously
irrelevant and the resulting scaling in fact non-trivial. In the present
article we compare the resulting scaling of the Edwards-Wilkinson equation with
drift and Neumann boundary conditions to the published case with Dirichlet
boundary conditions.
