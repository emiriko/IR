We calculate the low temperature corrections to the free energy for a sphere
in front of a plane. First, the scalar field obeying Dirichet or Neumann
boundary conditions is considered. Second, the electromagnetic field is
studied, the sphere being perfectly conducting and being a dielectric ball with
both, constant permittivity and permittivity of the plasma model.
