We experimentally demonstrate a detection scheme suitable for state analysis
of single optically trapped atoms in less than 1 {\mu}s with an overall
detection efficiency {\eta} exceeding 98%. The method is based on
hyperfine-state-selective photoionization and subsequent registration of the
correlated photoion-electron pairs by coincidence counting via two opposing
channel electron multipliers. The scheme enables the calibration of absolute
detection efficiencies and might be a key ingredient for future quantum
information applications or precision spectroscopy of ultracold atoms.
