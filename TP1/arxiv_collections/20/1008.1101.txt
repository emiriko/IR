We use computer simulation to study crystal-forming model proteins equipped
with interactions that are both orientationally specific and nonspecific.
Distinct dynamical pathways of crystal formation can be selected by tuning the
strengths of these interactions. When the nonspecific interaction is strong,
liquidlike clustering can precede crystallization; when it is weak, growth can
proceed via ordered nuclei. Crystal yields are in certain parameter regimes
enhanced by the nonspecific interaction, even though it promotes association
without local crystalline order. Our results suggest that equipping nanoscale
components with weak nonspecific interactions (such as depletion attractions)
can alter both their dynamical pathway of assembly and optimize the yield of
the resulting material.
