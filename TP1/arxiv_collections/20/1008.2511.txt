The variational procedure to construct compact and accurate wave functions
for three-electron atoms and ions is developed. The procedure is based on the
use of six-dimensional gaussoids written in the relative four-body coordinates
$r_{12}, r_{13}, r_{23}, r_{14}, r_{24}$ and $r_{34}$. The non-linear
parameters in each basis function have been optimized carefully. By using these
variational wave functions we have determined the energies and other bound
state properties are determined for the ground $1^2S$-states in a number of
three-electron atoms and ions. The three-electron atomic systems considered in
this work include the neutral Li atom and nine positively charged lithium-like
ions: Be$^+$, B$^{2+}$, C$^{3+}, ...$Na$^{8+}$ and Mg$^{9+}$. Our variational
wave functions are used to determine the hyperfine structure splitting and
field shifts for some lithium-like ions. The explicit formulas of the $Q^{-1}$
expansion are derived for the total energies of these three-electron systems.
