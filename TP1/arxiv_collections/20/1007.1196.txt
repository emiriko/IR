Using observations made with the XMM-Newton Observatory, we report the
probable X-ray detection of the high-magnetic-field radio pulsar PSR
J1734-3333. This pulsar has an inferred surface dipole magnetic field of B =
5.2e13 G, just below that of one anomalous X-ray pulsar (AXP). We find that the
pulsar has an absorbed 0.5-2.0 keV flux of (5-15)e-15 erg/s/cm^2 and that its
X-ray luminosity L_X is well below its spin down luminosity E_dot, with L_X <
0.1E_dot. No pulsations were detected in these data although our derived upper
limit is unconstraining. Like most of the other high-B pulsars, PSR J1734-3333
is X-ray faint with no sign of magnetar activity. We collect and tabulate the
properties of this and all other known high-B radio pulsars with measured X-ray
luminosities or luminosity upper limits and plot L_X versus B for them all.
