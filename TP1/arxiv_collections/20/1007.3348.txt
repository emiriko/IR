Following his observation the author has described in the papers [1] to [4]
the formation of a Lightning Ball (LB)with the help of a new theory of symmetry
breaking of the vortex ring. In the frame of this theory he emphasizes the
primordial rule of the thunder (shock-wave) during the lightning strike in the
creation of the LB. The shock-waves and the sound waves propagate very fast but
the subsequent enlargement of the vortex ring (air masses) is very slow. This
is the reason why the rotating air ring (cylinder) only appeared some seconds
later in the observation because of the great inertia of the system. As a
consequence of the stationary Mach shock-waves reflections theory the stable
distance of the LB to the ground and its very stable horizontal path, in spite
of strong winds and rain can be explained.
