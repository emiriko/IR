The formation of planetesimals via gravitational instability of the dust
layer in a protoplanetary disks demands that there be local patches where dust
is concentrated by a factor of $\sim$ a few $\times 10^3$ over the background
value. Vortices in protoplanetary disks may concentrate dust to these values
allowing them to be the nurseries of planetesimals. The concentration of dust
in the cores of vortices increases the dust-gas ratio of the core compared to
the background disk, creating a "heavy vortex." In this work, we show that
these vortices are subject to an instability which we have called the
heavy-core instability. Using Floquet theory, we show that this instability
occurs in elliptical protoplanetary vortices when the gas-dust density of the
core of the vortex is heavier than the ambient gas-dust density by a few tens
of percent. The heavy-core instability grows very rapidly, with a growth
timescale of a few vortex rotation periods. While the nonlinear evolution of
this instability remains unknown, it will likely increase the velocity
dispersion of the dust layer in the vortex because instability sets in well
before sufficient dust can gather to form a protoplanetary seed. This
instability may thus preclude vortices from being sites of planetesimal
formation.
