We perform a numerical simulation of the corona of the young, rapidly
rotating K0 dwarf AB Doradus using a global MHD model. The model is driven by a
surface map of the radial magnetic field constructed using Zeeman-Doppler
Imaging. We find that the global structure of the stellar corona is dominated
by strong azimuthal tangling of the magnetic field due to the rapid rotation.
The MHD solution enables us to calculate realistic Alfv\'en surfaces and we can
therefore estimate the stellar mass loss rate and angular momentum loss rate
without making undue theoretical simplifications. We consider three cases,
parametrized by the base density of the corona, that span the range of possible
solutions for the system. We find that overall, the mass and angular-momentum
loss rates are higher than in the solar case; the mass loss rates are 10 to 500
times higher, and the angular momentum loss rate can be up to $3\times{10}^4$
higher than present day solar values. Our simulations show that this model can
be use to constrain the wide parameter space of stellar systems. It also shows
that an MHD approach can provide more information about the physical system
over the commonly used potential field extrapolation.
