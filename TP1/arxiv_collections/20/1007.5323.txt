A modified double slit experiment of light was implemented. In the
experiment, a spatial shape filter is used to manipulate the shape of cross
section of laser beam. When this modified laser beam was shined on the double
slit, the intensity distribution of laser beam on double slit is asymmetrical.
In this way, the laser light was directed to pass through only one or two slits
of double slit in different sections. So the which-way information is
predetermined before the photons pass through the slits. At the same time, the
visible interference pattern can be observed on a monitor screen after the
double slit. A couple of new phenomena had been observed from this experiment.
The results of this experiment raise questions about Wave-Particle Duality
model of quantum theory, which is the foundation for the Copenhagen explanation
that is generally regarded as the principal interpretation of quantum theory.
As the observed properties from this experiment cannot be fully explained using
the quantum theory, especially the Copenhagen explanation, a new model of
photon is proposed. The new model for photon should be also applicable to all
other micro entity like electron, atoms, molecules etc., according to L. de
Broglie assumption.
