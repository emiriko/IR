Although the powering mechanism for quasars is now widely recognized to be
the accretion of matter in a geometrically thin disk, the transport of matter
to the inner region of the disk where luminosity is emitted remains an unsolved
question. Miralda-Escud\'e & Kollmeier (2005) proposed a model whereby quasars
are fuelled when stars are captured by the accretion disk as they plunge
through the gas. Such plunging stars can then be destroyed and deliver their
mass to the accretion disk.
  Here we present the first detailed calculations for the capture of stars
originating far from the accretion disk near the zone of influence of the
central black hole. In particular we examine the effect of adding a perturbing
mass to a fixed stellar cusp potential on bringing stars into the accretion
disk where they can be captured. The work presented here will be discussed in
detail in an upcoming publication Kennedy et al. (2010).
