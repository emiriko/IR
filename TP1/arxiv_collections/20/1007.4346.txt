Arbitrary quantum state transfer(AQST) is discussed in a system that atoms
are trapped in three separate cavities which are connected via optical fibers.
Through three parties cooperation, the AQST can be selectively implemented
deterministically. The target state can be transferred to any of the parties
with 100 percent fidelity and $\frac{1}{2}$ success probability.
