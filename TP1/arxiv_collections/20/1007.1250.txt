We construct a 2-dimensional twisted nonabelian multiplicative integral. This
is done in the context of a Lie crossed module (an object composed of two Lie
groups interacting), and a pointed manifold. The integrand is a
connection-curvature pair, that consists of a Lie algebra valued 1-form and a
Lie algebra valued 2-form, satisfying a certain differential equation. The
geometric cycle of the integration is a kite in the pointed manifold. A kite is
made up of a 2-dimensional simplex in the manifold, together with a path
connecting this simplex to the base point of the manifold. The multiplicative
integral is an element of the second Lie group in the crossed module.
  We prove several properties of the multiplicative integral. Among them is the
2-dimensional nonabelian Stokes Theorem, which is a generalization of
Schlesinger's Theorem. Our main result is the 3-dimensional nonabelian Stokes
Theorem. This is a totally new result.
  The methods we use are: the CBH Theorem for the nonabelian exponential map;
piecewise smooth geometry of polyhedra; and some basic algebraic topology.
  The motivation for this work comes from twisted deformation quantization and
descent for nonabelian gerbes. Similar questions arise in nonabelian gauge
theory.
