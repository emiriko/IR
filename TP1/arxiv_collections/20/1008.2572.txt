We study the ground state of a finite size ensemble of interacting qubits
driven by a quantum field. We find a maximally entangled W-state in the
ensemble part of the system for a certain coupling parameters region. The area
of this region decreases as the ensemble size increases and, in the classical
limit, becomes the line in parameter space that defines the phase transition of
the system. In the classical limit, we also study the dynamics of the system
and its transition from order to disorder for initial energies close to the
ground state energy. We find that a critical energy providing this transition
is related to the minimum of the projection of the total angular momentum of
the quantum system in the $z$-direction.
