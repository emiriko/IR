Dense and cold clouds seem to populate the broad line region surrounding the
central black hole in AGNs. These clouds could interact with the AGN jet base
and this could have observational consequences. We want to study the gamma-ray
emission produced by these jet-cloud interactions, and explore under which
conditions this radiation would be detectable. We investigate the
hydrodynamical properties of jet-cloud interactions and the resulting shocks,
and develop a model to compute the spectral energy distribution of the emission
generated by the particles accelerated in these shocks. We discuss our model in
the context of radio-loud AGNs, with applications to two representative cases,
the low-luminous Centaurus A, and the powerful 3C 273. Some fraction of the jet
power can be channelled to gamma-rays, which would be likely dominated by
synchrotron self-Compton radiation, and show typical variability timescales
similar to the cloud lifetime within the jet, which is longer than several
hours. Many clouds can interact with the jet simultaneously leading to fluxes
significantly higher than in one interaction, but then variability will be
smoothed out. Jet-cloud interactions may produce detectable gamma-rays in
non-blazar AGNs, of transient nature in nearby low-luminous sources like Cen A,
and steady in the case of powerful objects of FR II type.
