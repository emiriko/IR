We experimentally and theoretically demonstrate the purity (polarization)
control of qubits entangled with multiple spins, using induced dephasing in
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) setups to simulate repeated quantum
measurements. We show that one may steer the qubit ensemble towards a
quasi-equilibrium state of certain purity, by choosing suitable time intervals
between dephasing operations. These results demonstrate that repeated dephasing
at intervals associated with the anti-Zeno regime lead to ensemble
purification, whereas those associated with the Zeno regime lead to ensemble
mixing.
