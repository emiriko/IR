The main goal of the IceCube Deep Core Array is to search for neutrinos of
astrophysical origins. Atmospheric neutrinos are commonly considered as a
background for these searches. We show that the very high statistics
atmospheric neutrino data can be used to obtain precise measurements of the
main oscillation parameters.
