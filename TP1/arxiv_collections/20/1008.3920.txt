We report ground-state quantum beats in spontaneous emission from a
continuously driven atomic ensemble. Beats are visible only in an intensity
autocorrelation and evidence spontaneously generated coherence in radiative
decay. Our measurement realizes a quantum eraser where a first photon detection
prepares a superposition and a second erases the "which-path" information in
the intermediate state.
