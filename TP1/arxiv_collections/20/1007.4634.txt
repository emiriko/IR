We present a decoherence-based interpretation for the quantum Zeno effect
(QZE) where measurements are dynamically treated as dispersive couplings of the
measured system to the apparatus, rather than the von Neumann's projections. It
is found that the explicit dependence of the survival probability on the
decoherence time quantitatively distinguishes this dynamic QZE from the usual
one based on projection measurements. By revisiting the cavity-QED experiment
of the QZE [J. Bernu, et al., Phys. Rev. Lett, 101, 180402 (2008)], we suggest
an alternative scheme to verify our theoretical consideration that frequent
measurements slow down the increase of photon number inside a microcavity due
to the nondemolition couplings with the atoms in large detuning.
