Ground-state and finite-temperature phase diagrams of a geometrically
frustrated spin-1/2 Ising-Heisenberg model on a triangle-hexagon lattice are
investigated within the generalized star-triangle mapping transformation. It is
shown that the ground state is constituted by two different spontaneously
long-range ordered phases and one disordered spin-liquid phase.
