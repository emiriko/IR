Phenyl-disubstituted polyacetylene (PDPA) is an organic semiconductor which
has been studied during the last years for its efficient photo-luminescence. In
contrast, the molecular geometry, providing the basis for the electronic and
optical properties, has been hardly investigated. In this paper, we apply a
density-functional-theory based molecular-dynamics approach to reveal the
molecular structure of PDPA in detail. We find that oligomers of this material
are limited in length, being stable only up to eight repeat units, while the
polymer is energetically unfavorable. These facts, which are in excellent
agreement with experimental findings, are explained through a detailed analysis
of the bond lengths. A consequence of the latter is the appearance of
pronounced torsion angles of the phenyl rings with respect to the plane of the
polyene backbone, ranging from $55^{\circ}$ up to $95^{\circ}$. We point out
that such large torsion angles do not destroy the conjugation of the $\pi$
electrons from the backbone to the side phenyl rings, as is evident from the
electronic charge density.
