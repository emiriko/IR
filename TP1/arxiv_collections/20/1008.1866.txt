Direct photon emission in heavy-ion collisions is calculated within a
relativistic micro+macro hybrid model and compared to the microscopic transport
model UrQMD. In the hybrid approach, the high-density part of the collision is
calculated by an ideal 3+1-dimensional hydrodynamic calculation, while the
early (pre-equilibrium-) and late (rescattering-) phase are calculated with the
transport model. We study both models with Au+Au-collisions at \sqrt{s_NN} =
200 GeV and compare the results to experimental data published by the PHENIX
collaboration.
