We experimentally demonstrate single-spin magnetometry with multi-pulse
sensing sequences. The use of multi-pulse sequences can greatly increase the
sensing time per measurement shot, resulting in enhanced ac magnetic field
sensitivity. We theoretically derive and experimentally verify the optimal
number of sensing cycles, for which the effects of decoherence and increased
sensing time are balanced. We perform these experiments for oscillating
magnetic fields with fixed phase as well as for fields with random phase.
Finally, by varying the phase and frequency of the ac magnetic field, we
measure the full frequency-filtering characteristics of different multi-pulse
schemes and discuss their use in magnetometry applications.
