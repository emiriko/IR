We propose a conductance measurement to detect the backscattering of chiral
Majorana edge states. Because normal and Andreev processes have equal
probability for backscattering of a single chiral Majorana edge state, there is
qualitative difference from backscattering of a chiral Dirac edge state, giving
rise to half-integer Hall conductivity and decoupling of fluctuation in
incoming and outgoing modes. The latter can be detected through thermal noise
measurement. These experimental signatures of Majorana fermions are robust at
finite temperature and do not require the size of the backscattering region to
be mesoscopic.
