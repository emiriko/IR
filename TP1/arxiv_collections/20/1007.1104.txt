Using non-equilibrium Green's functions (NEGF), we calculate the current
through an interacting region connected to non-interacting leads. The problem
is reformulated in such a way that a Landauer-like term appears in the current
as well as extra terms corresponding to non-equilibrium many-body effects. The
interaction in the central region renormalizes not only the Green's functions
but also the coupling at the contacts between the central region and the leads,
allowing the total current to be further expressed as a generalized
Landauer-like current formula. The general expression for the dynamical
functional that renormalizes the contacts is provided. We analyze in detail
under what circumstances Landauer-like approaches to the current, i.e. without
contact renormalization, are valid for interacting electron-electron and/or
electron-phonon systems. Numerical NEGF calculations are then performed for a
model electron-phonon coupled system in order to validate our analytical
approach. We show that the conductance for the off-resonant transport regime is
adequately described by Landauer-like approach in the small-bias limit, while
for the resonant regime the Landauer-like approach results depart from the
exact results even at small finite bias. The validity of applying a
Landauer-like approach to inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy is also
studied in detail.
