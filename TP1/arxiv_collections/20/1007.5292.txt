We consider a topological quantum mechanics described by a phase space path
integral and study the 1-dimensional analog for the path integral
representation of the Kontsevich formula. We see that the naive bosonic
integral possesses divergences, that it is even naively non-invariant and thus
is ill-defined. We then consider a super-extension of the theory which
eliminates the divergences and makes the theory naively invariant. This
super-extension is equivalent to the correct choice of measure and was
discussed in the literature. We then investigate the behavior of this extended
theory under diffeomorphisms of the extended phase space and despite of its
naive invariance find out that the theory possesses anomaly under nonlinear
diffeomorphisms. We localize the origin of the anomaly and calculate the lowest
nontrivial anomalous contribution.
