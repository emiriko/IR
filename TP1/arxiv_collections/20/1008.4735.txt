We study a penetration of an electron with high energy E<<T through strongly
disordered wire of length L<<a (a being the localization length). Such an
electron can loose, but not gain the energy, when hopping from one localized
state to another. We have found a distribution function for the transmission
coefficient t. The typical t remains exponentially small in L/a, but with the
decrement, reduced compared to the case of direct elastic tunnelling. The
distribution function has a relatively strong tail in the domain of anomalously
high t; the average <t>~(a/L)^2 is controlled by rare configurations of
disorder, corresponding to this tail.
