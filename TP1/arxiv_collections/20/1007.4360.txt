A two-component hydrodynamic model is constructed of the global superfluid
flow induced by two-component Ekman pumping during the recovery stage of a
glitch. The model successfully accounts for the quasi-exponential recovery
observed in pulsars like Vela and the "overshoot" observed in pulsars like the
Crab. By fitting the model to high-resolution timing data, three important
constitutive coefficients in bulk nuclear matter can be extracted: the shear
viscosity, the mutual friction parameter, and the charged fluid fraction. The
fitted coefficients for the Crab and Vela are compared with theoretical
predictions for several equations of state, including the color-flavor locked
and two-flavor color superconductor phases of quark matter.
