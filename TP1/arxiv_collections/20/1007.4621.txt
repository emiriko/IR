Let $C$ be a smooth projective curve of genus $g \ge 1$ over a finite field
$\F$ of cardinality $q$. In this paper, we first study $\#\J_C$, the size of
the Jacobian of $C$ over $\F$ in case that $\F(C)/\F(X)$ is a geometric Galois
extension. This improves results of Shparlinski \cite{shp}. Then we study
fluctuations of the quantity $\log \#\J_C-g \log q$ as the curve $C$ varies
over a large family of hyperelliptic curves of genus $g$. For fixed genus and
growing $q$, Katz and Sarnak showed that $\sqrt{q}\left(\log \# \J_C-g \log
q\right)$ is distributed as the trace of a random $2g \times 2g$ unitary
symplectic matrix. When the finite field is fixed and the genus grows, we find
the limiting distribution of $\log \#\J_C-g \log q$ in terms of the
characteristic function. When both the genus and the finite field grow, we find
that $\sqrt{q}\left(\log \# \J_C-g \log q\right)$ has a standard Gaussian
distribution.
