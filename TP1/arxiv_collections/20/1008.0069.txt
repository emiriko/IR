This paper addresses the problem of finding an asymptotic solution for first
and second order integro-differential equations containing an arbitrary kernel,
by evaluating the corresponding inverse Laplace and Fourier transforms. The aim
of the paper is to go beyond the tauberian theorem in the case of
integral-differential equations which are widely used by the scientific
community. The results are applied to the convolute form of the Lindblad
equation setting generic conditions on the kernel in such a way as to generate
a positive definite density matrix, and show that the structure of the
eigenvalues of the correspondent liouvillian operator plays a crucial role in
determining the positivity of the density matrix.
