We report a new possibility of using the $\mct2$ (Constransverse mass)
variable for mass measurement in single step decay chains involving missing
particles with moderate transverse momentum. We show that its experimental
feasibility is enhanced compared to the corresponding $\mt2$-kink method. We
apply this method to reconstruct a pair of chargino decay chains.
