We employ a conformal mapping to explore the thermodynamics of strongly
interacting matter at finite values of the baryon chemical potential $\mu$.
This method allows us to identify the singularity corresponding to the critical
point of a second-order phase transition at finite $\mu$, given information
only at $\mu=0$. The scheme is potentially useful for computing thermodynamic
properties of strongly interacting hot and dense matter in lattice gauge
theory. The technique is illustrated by an application to a chiral effective
model.
