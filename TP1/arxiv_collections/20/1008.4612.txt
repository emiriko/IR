Relativistic nuclear collisions data on two-particle correlations exhibit
structures as function of relative azimuthal angle and rapidity. A unified
description of these near-side and away-side structures is proposed for low to
moderate transverse momentum. It is based on the combined effect of tubular
initial conditions and hydrodynamical expansion. Contrary to expectations, the
hydrodynamics solution shows that the high energy density tubes (leftover from
the initial particle interactions) give rise to particle emission in two
directions and this is what leads to the various structures. This description
is sensitive to some of the initial tube parameters and may provide a probe of
the strong interaction. This explanation is compared with an alternative one
where some triangularity in the initial conditions is assumed. A possible
experimental test is suggested.
