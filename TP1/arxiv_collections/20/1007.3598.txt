Scanning tunneling spectroscopies in the subKelvin temperature range were
performed on superconducting Silicon epilayers doped with Boron in the atomic
percent range. The resulting local differential conductance behaved as expected
for a homogeneous superconductor, with an energy gap dispersion below +/- 10%.
The spectral shape, the amplitude and temperature dependence of the
superconductivity gap follow the BCS model, bringing further support to the
hypothesis of a hole pairing mechanism mediated by phonons in the weak coupling
limit.
