We present first insights into the far-IR properties for a sample of IRAC and
MIPS-24um detected Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs) at z ~ 3, as derived from
observations in the northern field of the Great Observatories Origins Survey
(GOODS-N) carried out with the PACS instrument on board the Herschel Space
Observatory. Although none of our galaxies are detected by Herschel, we employ
a stacking technique to construct, for the first time, the average spectral
energy distribution of infrared luminous LBGs from UV to radio wavelengths. We
derive a median IR luminosity of L_{IR} = 1.6 x 10^12 Lo, placing the
population in the class of ultra luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs).
Complementing our study with existing multi-wavelength data, we put constraints
on the dust temperature of the population and find that for their L_{IR},
MIPS-LBGs are warmer than submm-luminous galaxies while they fall in the locus
of the L_{IR}-T_{d} relation of the local ULIRGs. This, along with estimates
based on the average SED, explains the marginal detection of LBGs in current
sub-mm surveys and suggests that these latter studies introduce a bias towards
the detection of colder ULIRGs in the high-z universe, while missing high-z
ULIRGS with warmer dust.
