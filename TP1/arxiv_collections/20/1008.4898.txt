In this paper we introduce WiNV - A framework for web-based interactive
scalable network visualization. WiNV enables a new class of rich and scalable
interactive cross-platform capabilities for visualizing large-scale networks
natively in a user's browser. Extensive experiments show that our system can
visualize networks that consist of tens of thousands of nodes while maintaining
fast, high-quality interaction.
