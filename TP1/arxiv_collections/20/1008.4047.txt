Beamforming is central to the processing function of all phased arrays and
becomes particularly challenging with a large number of antenna element (e.g.
>100,000). The ability to beamform efficiently with reasonable power
requirements is discussed in this paper. Whilst the most appropriate
beamforming technology will change over time due to semiconductor and
processing developments, we present a hierarchical structure which is
technology agnostic and describe both Radio-Frequency (RF) and digital
hierarchical beamforming approaches. We present implementations of both RF and
digital beamforming systems on two antenna array demonstrators, namely the
Electronic Multi Beam Radio Astronomy ConcEpt (EMBRACE) and the
dualpolarisation all-digital array (2-PAD). This paper will compare and
contrast both digital and analogue implementations without considering the deep
system design of these arrays.
