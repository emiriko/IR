1E 1207.4-5209, the peculiar Central Compact object in the G296.5+10.0
supernova remnant, has been proposed to be an "anti-magnetar" - a young neutron
star born with a weak dipole field. Accretion, possibly of supernova fallback
material, has also been invoked to explain a large surface temperature
anisotropy as well as the generation of peculiar cyclotron absorption features
superimposed to its thermal spectrum. Interestingly enough, a faint
optical/infrared source was proposed as a possible counterpart to 1E
1207.4-5209, but later questioned, based on coarse positional coincidence.
Considering the large offset of 1E 1207.4-5209 with respect to the center of
its host supernova remnant, the source should move at ~70 mas/yr. Thus, we
tested the association by measuring the proper motion of the proposed optical
counterpart. Using HST observations spanning 3.75 years, we computed a 3 sigma
upper limit of 7 mas/yr. Absolute astrometry on the same HST data set also
places the optical source significantly off the 99% confidence Chandra
position. This allows us to safely rule out the association. Using the HST data
set, coupled to ground-based observations collected at the ESO/VLT, we set the
deepest limits ever obtained to the optical/infrared emission from 1E
1207.4-5209. By combining such limits to the constraints derived from X-ray
timing, we rule out accretion as the source of the thermal anisotropy of the
neutron star.
