A stochastic version of an inviscid dyadic model of turbulence, with
multiplicative noise, is proved to exhibit energy dissipation in spite of the
formal energy conservation. As a consequence, global regular solutions cannot
exist. After some reductions, the main tool is the escape bahavior at infinity
of a certain birth and death process.
