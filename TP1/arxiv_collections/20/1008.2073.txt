The Rossby wave instability in astrophysical disks is as a potentially
important mechanism for driving angular momentum transport in disks. We aim to
understand this instability in an approximate three-dimensional disk model
environment which we assume to be a single homentropic annular layer we analyze
using disk shallow-water theory. We consider the normal mode stability analysis
of two kinds of radial profiles of the mean potential vorticity: The first type
is a single step and the second kind is a symmetrical step of finite width
describing either a localized depression or peak of the mean potential
vorticity. For single potential vorticity steps we find there is no
instability. There is no instability when the symmetric step is a localized
peak. However, the Rossby wave instability occurs when the symmetrical step
profile is a depression, which, in turn, corresponds to localized peaks in the
mean enthalpy profile. This is in qualitative agreement with previous
two-dimensional investigations of the instability. For all potential vorticity
depressions, instability occurs for regions narrower than some maximum radial
length scale. We interpret the instability as resulting from the interaction of
at least two Rossby edgewaves. We identify the Rossby wave instability in the
restricted three-dimensional framework of disk shallow water theory. Additional
examinations of generalized barotropic flows are needed. Viewing disk vortical
instabilities from the conceptual perspective of interacting edgewaves can be
useful.
