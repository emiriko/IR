Recent studies have shown that the elemental abundances in the Sun are
anomalous when compared to most (about 85%) nearby solar twin stars. Compared
to its twins, the Sun exhibits a deficiency of refractory elements (those with
condensation temperatures Tc>900K) relative to volatiles (Tc<900K). This
finding is speculated to be a signature of the planet formation that occurred
more efficiently around the Sun compared with the majority of solar twins.
Furthermore, within this scenario, it seems more likely that the abundance
patterns found are specifically related to the formation of terrestrial
planets. In this work we analyze abundance results from six large independent
stellar abundance surveys to determine whether they confirm or reject this
observational finding. We show that the elemental abundances derived for solar
analogs in these six studies are consistent with the Tc trend suggested as a
planet formation signature. The same conclusion is reached when those results
are averaged heterogeneously. We also investigate the dependency of the
abundances with first ionization potential (FIP), which correlates well with
Tc. A trend with FIP would suggest a different origin for the abundance
patterns found, but we show that the correlation with Tc is statistically more
significant. We encourage similar investigations of metal-rich solar analogs
and late F-type dwarf stars, for which the hypothesis of a planet formation
signature in the elemental abundances makes very specific predictions. Finally,
we examine a recent paper that claims that the abundance patterns of two stars
hosting super-Earth like planets contradict the planet formation signature
hypothesis. Instead, we find that the chemical compositions of these two stars
are fully compatible with our hypothesis.
