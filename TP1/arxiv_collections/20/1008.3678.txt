Quasi one-dimensional systems are systems of particles in domains which are
of infinite extent in one direction and of uniformly bounded size in all other
directions, e.g. on a cylinder of infinite length. The main result proven here
is that for such particle systems with Coulomb interactions and neutralizing
background, the so-called "jellium", at any temperature and at any finite-strip
width there is translation symmetry breaking. This extends the previous result
on Laughlin states in thin, two-dimensional strips by Jansen, Lieb and Seiler
(2009). The structural argument which is used here bypasses the question of
whether the translation symmetry breaking is manifest already at the level of
the one particle density function. It is akin to that employed by Aizenman and
Martin (1980) for a similar statement concerning symmetry breaking at all
temperatures in strictly one-dimensional Coulomb systems. The extension is
enabled through bounds which establish tightness of finite-volume charge
fluctuations.
