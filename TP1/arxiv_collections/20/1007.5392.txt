Structural, mechanical, electronic, and thermodynamic properties of fluorite
and tetragonal phases of ZrH$_{2}$ are systematically studied by employing the
density functional theory within generalized gradient approximation. The
existence of the bistable structure for ZrH$_{2}$ is mainly due to the
tetragonal distortions. And our calculated lattice constants for the stable
face-centered tetragonal (fct) phase with \emph{c/a}=0.885 are consistent well
with experiments. Through calculating elastic constants, the mechanically
unstable characters of face-centered cubic (fcc) phase and fct structure with
\emph{c/a}=1.111 are predicted. As for fct0.885 structure, our calculated
elastic constants explicitly indicate that it is mechanically stable. Elastic
moduli, Poisson's ratio, and Debye temperature are derived from elastic
constants. After analyzing total and partial densities of states and valence
electron charge distribution, we conclude that the Zr$-$H bonds in ZrH$_{2}$
exhibit weak covalent feature. But the ionic property is evident with about 1.5
electrons transferring from each Zr atom to H. Phonon spectrum results indicate
that fct0.885 and fct1.111 structures are dynamically stable, while the fcc
structure is unstable.
