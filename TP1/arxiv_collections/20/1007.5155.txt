In this paper, we discuss the dissociative electron attachment process in
Ammonia. Kinetic energy and angular distributions of H^{-} and NH_{2}^{-}
fragment anions across the two well known resonances at 5.5 eV and 10.5 eV are
reported. The angular distributions show deviation of axial recoil
approximation akin to that observed in water.
