In the recent years, the trace norm of graphs has been extensively studied
under the name of graph energy. The trace norm is just one of the Ky Fan
k-norms, given by the sum of the k largest singular values, which are studied
more generally in the present paper. Several relations to chromatic number,
spectral radius, spread, and to other fundamental parameters are outlined. Some
results are extended to more general matrices.
