We use an empirical approach to characterize the effect of charge-transfer
efficiency (CTE) losses in images taken with the Wide-Field Channel of the
Advanced Camera for Surveys. The study is based on profiles of warm pixels in
168 dark exposures taken between September and October 2009. The dark exposures
allow us to explore charge traps that affect electrons when the background is
extremely low. We develop a model for the readout process that reproduces the
observed trails out to 70 pixels. We then invert the model to convert the
observed pixel values in an image into an estimate of the original pixel
values. We find that when we apply the image-restoration process to science
images with a variety of stars on a variety of background levels, it restores
flux, position, and shape. This means that the observed trails contain
essentially all of the flux lost to inefficient CTE. The Space Telescope
Science Institute is currently evaluating this algorithm with the aim of
optimizing it and eventually providing enhanced data products. The empirical
procedure presented here should also work for other epochs (eg., pre-SM4),
though the parameters may have to be recomputed for the time when ACS was
operated at a higher temperature than the current -81 C. Finally, this
empirical approach may also hold promise for other instruments, such as WFPC2,
STIS, the ACS's HRC, and even WFC3/UVIS.
