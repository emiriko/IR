A large amount of population models use the concept of a carrying capacity.
Simulated populations are bounded by invoking finite resources through a
survival probability, commonly referred to as the Verhulst factor. The fact,
however, that resources are not easily accounted for in actual biological
systems makes the carrying capacity parameter ill-defined. Henceforth, we deem
it essential to consider cases for which the parameter is unnecessary. This
work demonstrates the possibility of Verhulst-free steady states using the
Penna aging model, with one semelparous birth per adult. Stable populations are
obtained by setting a mutation threshold that is higher than the reproduction
age.
