In this paper we present an efficient computer aided mass classification
method in digitized mammograms using Artificial Neural Network (ANN), which
performs benign-malignant classification on region of interest (ROI) that
contains mass. One of the major mammographic characteristics for mass
classification is texture. ANN exploits this important factor to classify the
mass into benign or malignant. The statistical textural features used in
characterizing the masses are mean, standard deviation, entropy, skewness,
kurtosis and uniformity. The main aim of the method is to increase the
effectiveness and efficiency of the classification process in an objective
manner to reduce the numbers of false-positive of malignancies. Three layers
artificial neural network (ANN) with seven features was proposed for
classifying the marked regions into benign and malignant and 90.91% sensitivity
and 83.87% specificity is achieved that is very much promising compare to the
radiologist's sensitivity 75%.
