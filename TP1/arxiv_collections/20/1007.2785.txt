We consider unparticle inspired corrections of the type
${(\frac{R_{G}}{r})}^\beta$ to the Newtonian potential in the context of the
gravitational quantum well. The new energy spectrum is computed and bounds on
the parameters of these corrections are obtained from the knowledge of the
energy eigenvalues of the gravitational quantum well as measured by the GRANIT
experiment.
