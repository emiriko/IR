The fractional Boltzmann equation for resonance radiation transport in plasma
is proposed. We start from the standard Boltzmann equation, averaging over
frequencies leads to appearance of fractional derivative. This fact is in
accordance with the conception of latent variables leading to hereditary and
non-local dynamics (in particular, fractional dynamics). The presence of the
fractional material derivative in the equation is concordant with heavy tailed
distribution of photon path lengths and with spatiotemporal coupling peculiar
to the process. We discuss some methods of solution of the obtained equation
and demonstrate numerical results in some simple cases.
