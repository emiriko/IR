In a recent publication [Phys. Rev. A 79, 065602 (2009)] it was shown that an
avoided-crossing resonance can be defined in different ways, according to
level-structural or dynamical aspects, which do not coincide in general. Here a
simple $3$-level system in a $\Lambda$ configuration is discussed, where the
difference between both definitions of the resonance may be observed. We also
discuss the details of a proposed experiment to observe this difference, using
microwave fields coupling hyperfine magnetic sublevels in alkali atoms.
