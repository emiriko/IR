Spectroscopic and photometric data for likely member stars of five Galactic
globular clusters (M3, M53, M71, M92, and NGC 5053) and three open clusters
(M35, NGC 2158, and NGC 6791) are processed by the current version of the SEGUE
Stellar Parameter Pipeline (SSPP), in order to determine estimates of
metallicities and radial velocities for the clusters. These results are then
compared to values from the literature. We find that the mean metallicity
(<[Fe/H]>) and mean radial velocity (<RV>) estimates for each cluster are
almost all within 2{\sigma} of the adopted literature values; most are within
1{\sigma}. We also demonstrate that the new version of the SSPP achieves small,
but noteworthy, improvements in <[Fe/H]> estimates at the extrema of the
cluster metallicity range, as compared to a previous version of the pipeline
software. These results provide additional confidence in the application of the
SSPP for studies of the abundances and kinematics of stellar populations in the
Galaxy.
