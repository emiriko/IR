Double ionization processes triggered by intense linearly polarized laser
fields have revealed the paramount role of electron-electron collisions. It has
been shown that the correlated dynamics of such electronic collisions can be
modeled by a two dimensional symplectic map which captures the bare essentials
of the energy exchange processes occurring during a recollision between the two
electrons. We investigate linear and nonlinear properties of this map and
connect them to the dynamical organization of phase space and related
statistical data
