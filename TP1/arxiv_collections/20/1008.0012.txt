Local structure of FeSe(1-x)Te(x) has been studied by extended x-ray
absorption fine-structure (EXAFS) measurements as a function of temperature.
Combination of Se and Fe K edge EXAFS has permitted to quantify the local
interatomic distances and their mean-square relative displacements. The Fe-Se
and Fe-Te bond lengths in the ternary system are found to be very different
from the average crystallographic Fe-Se/Te distance, and almost identical to
the Fe-Se and Fe-Te distances for the binary FeSe and FeTe systems, indicating
distinct site occupation by the Se and Te atoms. The results provide a clear
evidence of local inhomogeneities and coexisting electronic components in the
FeSe1-xTex, characterized by different local structural configurations, with
direct implication on the fundamental electronic structure of these
superconductors.
