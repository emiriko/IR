Binary radio pulsars are generally believed to have been spun up to
millisecond periods (i.e. recycling) via mass accretion from their donor stars,
and they are the descendants of neutron star low-mass X-ray binaries. However,
some studies indicate that the formation of pulsars from the accretion-induced
collapse (AIC) of accreting white dwarfs (WDs) cannot be excluded. In this
work, we use a population synthesis code to examine if the AIC channel can
produce eccentric binary millisecond pulsars (BMSPs) in the Galaxy. Our
simulated results indicate that, only when the natal MSPs receive a relatively
strong kick ($\ga100\rm km\,s^{-1}$), can the AIC channel produce $\sim 10-180$
eccentric ($e>0.1$) BMSPs in the Galaxy, most of which are accompanied by a
Helium star. Such a kick seems to be highly unlikely in the conventional AIC
process, hence the probability of forming eccentric BMSPs via the AIC channel
can be ruled out. Even if a high kick is allowed, the AIC channel cannot
produce eccentric BMSPs with an orbital period of $\ga 20$ days. Therefore, we
propose that the peculiar BMSP PSR J1903+0327 cannot be formed by the AIC
channel. However, the AIC evolutionary channel may produce some fraction of
isolated millisecond pulsars, and even sub-millisecond pulsars if they really
exist.
