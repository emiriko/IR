We present measurements of the mean mid-infrared-to-submillimeter flux
densities of massive (M\ast \approx 2 \times 10^11 Msun) galaxies at redshifts
1.7 < z < 2.9, obtained by stacking positions of known objects taken from the
GOODS NICMOS Survey (GNS) catalog on maps: at 24 {\mu}m (Spitzer/MIPS); 70,
100, and 160{\mu}m (Herschel/PACS); 250, 350, 500{\mu}m (BLAST); and 870{\mu}m
(LABOCA). A modified blackbody spectrum fit to the stacked flux densities
indicates a median [interquartile] star-formation rate of SFR = 63 [48, 81]
Msun yr^-1 . We note that not properly accounting for correlations between
bands when fitting stacked data can significantly bias the result. The galaxies
are divided into two groups, disk-like and spheroid-like, according to their
Sersic indices, n. We find evidence that most of the star formation is
occurring in n \leq 2 (disk-like) galaxies, with median [interquartile] SFR =
122 [100,150] Msun yr^-1, while there are indications that the n > 2
(spheroid-like) population may be forming stars at a median [interquartile] SFR
= 14 [9,20] Msun yr^-1, if at all. Finally, we show that star formation is a
plausible mechanism for size evolution in this population as a whole, but find
only marginal evidence that it is what drives the expansion of the
spheroid-like galaxies.
