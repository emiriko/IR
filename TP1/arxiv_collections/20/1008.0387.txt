There exists an infinite series of ratios by which one can derive the Riemann
zeta function $\zeta(s)$ from Catalan numbers and central binomial coefficients
which appear in the terms of the series. While admittedly the derivation is not
deep it does indicate some combinatorial aspect to the Riemann zeta function.
But we actually do find also four additional new closed formulas, which include
a formula by which one can compute $\zeta(s)$ for a countably infinite number
of discrete positive values for $s$ where the formula contains Catalan numbers
not in infinite series. The Riemann zeta function has applications in physics,
such as in computations related to the Casimir effect. Our result indicates a
link between the Riemann zeta function, combinatorics, Catalan numbers, the
central binomial coefficient and the content of a hypersphere, under certain
conditions.
