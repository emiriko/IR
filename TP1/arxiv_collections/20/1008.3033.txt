A particle-number projection technique is used to calculate transfer
probabilities in the $^{16}$O+$^{208}$Pb reaction below the fusion barrier. The
time evolution of the many-body wave function is obtained with the
time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) mean-field theory. The agreement with
experimental data for the sum of the proton-transfer channels is good,
considering that TDHF has no parameter adjusted on reaction mechanism. Some
perspectives for extensions beyond TDHF to include cluster-transfers are
discussed.
