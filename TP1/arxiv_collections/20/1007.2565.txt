We consider random walks in random Dirichlet environment (RWDE) which is a
special type of random walks in random environment where the exit probabilities
at each site are i.i.d. Dirichlet random variables. On ${\mathbb Z}^d$, RWDE
are parameterized by a 2d-uplet of positive reals called weights. In this
paper, we characterize for $d\ge 3$ the weights for which there exists an
absolutely continuous invariant probability for the process viewed from the
particle. We can deduce from this result and from [27] a complete description
of the ballistic regime for $d\ge 3$.
