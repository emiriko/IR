We determine explicitly the Picard groups of the universal Jacobian stack and
of its compactification over the stack of stable curves. Along the way, we
prove some results concerning the gerbe structure of the universal Jacobian
stack over its rigidification by the natural action of the multiplicative group
and relate this with the existence of generalized Poincar\'e line bundles. We
also compare our results with Kouvidakis-Fontanari computations of the divisor
class group of the universal (compactified) Jacobian scheme.
