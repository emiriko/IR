In this paper orthogonal multifilters for astronomical image processing are
presented. We obtained new orthogonal multifilters based on the orthogonal
wavelet of Haar and Daubechies. Recently, multiwavelets have been introduced as
a more powerful multiscale analysis tool. It adds several degrees of freedom in
multifilter design and makes it possible to have several useful properties such
as symmetry, orthogonality, short support, and a higher number of vanishing
moments simultaneously. Multifilter decomposition of scanned photographic
plates with astronomical images is made.
