Since the detection of the asymptotic properties of the dipole gravity modes
in the Sun, the quest to find the individual gravity modes has continued. A
deeper analysis of the GOLF/SoHO data unveils the presence of a pattern of
peaks that could be interpreted as individual dipole gravity modes. The
computed collapsed spectrum -around these candidate modes- uncovers the
presence of a quasi constant frequency splitting, in contrast with regions
where no g modes are expected in which the collapsogram gives random results.
Besides, the same technique applied to VIRGO/SoHO unveils some common signals
between both power spectra. Thus, we can identify and characterize the modes,
for example, with their central frequency and splittings. This would open the
path towards new investigations to better constrain the solar core.
