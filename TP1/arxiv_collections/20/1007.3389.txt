We provide a comprehensive study of strong coupling constants of decuplet
baryons with light nonet vector mesons in the framework of light cone QCD sum
rules. Using the symmetry arguments, we argue that all coupling constants
entering the calculations can be expressed in terms of only one invariant
function even if the $SU(3)_f$ symmetry breaking effects are taken into
account. We estimate the order of $SU(3)_f$ symmetry violations, which are
automatically considered by the employed approach.
