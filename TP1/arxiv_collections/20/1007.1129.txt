We describe sufficient conditions which guarantee that a finite set of
mapping classes generate a right-angled Artin group quasi-isometrically
embedded in the mapping class group. Moreover, under these conditions, the
orbit map to Teichmuller space is a quasi-isometric embedding for both of the
standard metrics. As a consequence, we produce infinitely many genus h surfaces
(for any h at least 2) in the moduli space of genus g surfaces (for any g at
least 3) for which the universal covers are quasi-isometrically embedded in the
Teichmuller space.
