The Planck satellite experiment, which was launched the 14th of may 2009,
will give an accurate measurement of the anisotropies of the Cosmic Microwave
Background (CMB) in temperature and polarization. This measurement is polluted
by the presence of diffuse galactic polarized foreground emissions. In order to
obtain the level of accuracy required for the Planck mission it is necessary to
deal with these foregrounds. In order to do this, have develloped and
implemented coherent 3D models of the two main galactic polarized emissions :
the synchrotron and thermal dust emissions. We have optimized these models by
comparing them to preexisting data : the K-band of the WMAP data, the ARCHEOPS
data at 353 GHz and the 408 MHz all-sky continuum survey. By extrapolation of
these models at the frequencies where the CMB is dominant, we are able to
estimate the contamination to the CMB Planck signal due to these polarized
galactic emissions.
