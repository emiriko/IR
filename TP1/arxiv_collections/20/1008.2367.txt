We perform a comprehensive study of the impact of new-physics operators with
different Lorentz structures on decays involving the b -> s mu+ mu- transition.
We examine the effects of new vector-axial vector (VA), scalar-pseudoscalar
(SP) and tensor (T) interactions on the differential branching ratios and
forward-backward asymmetries (A_{FB}'s) of Bsbar -> mu+ mu-, Bdbar -> Xs mu+
mu-, Bsbar -> mu+ mu- gamma, Bdbar -> Kbar mu+ mu-, and Bdbar -> K* mu+ mu-,
taking the new-physics couplings to be real. In Bdbar -> K* mu+ mu-, we further
explore the polarization fraction f_L, the angular asymmetry A_T^{(2)}, and the
longitudinal-transverse asymmetry A_{LT}. We identify the Lorentz structures
that would significantly impact these observables, providing analytical
arguments in terms of the contributions from the individual operators and their
interference terms. In particular, we show that while the new VA operators can
significantly enhance most of the asymmetries beyond the Standard Model
predictions, the SP and T operators can do this only for A_{FB} in Bdbar ->
Kbar mu+ mu-.
