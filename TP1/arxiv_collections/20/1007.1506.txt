We study the effect of the induced interaction on the superfluidtransition
temperature of a spin-polarized Fermi gas. In the BCS limit, the polarization
is very small in the superfluid state, and the effect of the induced
interaction is almost the same as in the spin-balanced case. The temperature Tt
and the polarization Pt of the tricritical point are both reduced from
mean-field results by a factor about 2.22. This reduction is also significant
beyond the BCS limit. In the unitary limit, we find (Pt,Tt/TF)=(0.42,0.16), in
comparison with mean-field and experimental results.
