We study cosmic-rays in decaying dark matter scenario, assuming that the dark
matter is the lightest superparticle and it decays through a R-parity violating
operator. We calculate the fluxes of cosmic-rays from the decay of the dark
matter and those from the standard astrophysical phenomena in the same
propagation model using the GALPROP package. We reevaluate the preferred
parameters characterizing standard astrophysical cosmic-ray sources with taking
account of the effects of dark matter decay. We show that, if energetic leptons
are produced by the decay of the dark matter, the fluxes of cosmic-ray positron
and electron can be in good agreements with both PAMELA and Fermi-LAT data in
wide parameter region. It is also discussed that, in the case where sizable
number of hadrons are also produced by the decay of the dark matter, the mass
of the dark matter is constrained to be less than 200-300 GeV in order to avoid
the overproduction of anti-proton. We also show that the cosmic gamma-ray flux
can be consistent with the results of Fermi-LAT observation if the mass of the
dark matter is smaller than nearly 4 TeV.
