We search for single-photon decays of the Upsilon(1S) resonance,
Upsilon->gamma+invisible, where the invisible state is either a particle of
definite mass, such as a light Higgs boson A0, or a pair of dark matter
particles, chi chi-bar. Both A0 and chi are assumed to have zero spin. We tag
Upsilon(1S) decays with a dipion transition Upsilon(2S)->pi+pi-Upsilon(1S) and
look for events with a single energetic photon and significant missing energy.
We find no evidence for such processes in the mass range m_A0<=9.2 GeV and
m_chi<=4.5 GeV in the sample of 98e6 Upsilon(2S) decays collected with the
BaBar detector and set stringent limits on new physics models that contain
light dark matter states.
