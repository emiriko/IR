We propose new summary statistics for intensity-reweighted moment stationary
point processes that generalise the well known J-, empty space, and
nearest-neighbour distance distribution functions, represent them in terms of
generating functionals and conditional intensities, and relate them to the
inhomogeneous reduced second moment function. Extensions to space time and
marked point processes are briefly discussed.
