We analyze the ground states and the elementary collective excitations
(phonons) of a class of systems, which form cluster crystals in the absence of
attractions. Whereas the regime of moderate-to-high-temperatures in the phase
diagram has been analyzed in detail by means of density functional
considerations (Likos C N, Mladek B M, Gottwald D and Kahl G 2007 {\it
J.~Chem.~Phys.}\ {\bf 126} 224502), the present approach focuses on the
complementary regime of low temperatures. We establish the existence of an
infinite cascade of isostructural transitions between crystals with different
lattice site occupancy at $T=0$ and we quantitatively demonstrate that the
thermodynamic instabilities are bracketed by mechanical instabilities arising
from long-wavelength acoustical phonons. We further show that all optical modes
are degenerate and flat, giving rise to perfect realizations of Einstein
crystals. We calculate analytically the complete phonon spectrum for the whole
class of models as well as the Helmholtz free energy of the systems. On the
basis of the latter, we demonstrate that the aforementioned isostructural phase
transitions must terminate at an infinity of critical points at low
temperatures, brought about by the anharmonic contributions in the Hamiltonian
and the hopping events in the crystals.
