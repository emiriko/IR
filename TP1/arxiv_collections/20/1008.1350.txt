We give conditions to prove the existence of an Extremal Index for general
stationary stochastic processes by detecting the presence of one or more
underlying periodic phenomena. This theory, besides giving general useful tools
to identify the extremal index, is also tailored to dynamical systems. In fact,
we apply this idea to analyse the possible Extreme Value Laws for the
stochastic process generated by observations taken along dynamical orbits with
respect to various measures. As in the authors' previous works on this topic,
the analogy of these laws in the context of hitting time statistics is
explained and exploited extensively.
