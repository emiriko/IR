The model is a particular case of causal set. This is a discrete model of
spacetime in a microscopic level. In paper the most general properties of the
model are investigated without any reference to a dynamics. The dynamics of the
model is introduced in [arXiv: 1004.5077]. These two papers introduce a
consistent description of the model.
