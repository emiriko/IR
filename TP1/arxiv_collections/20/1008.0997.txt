High spatial and sensitivity images of the Luminous Blue Variable IRAS
18576+0341 were obtained using the mid infrared imager VISIR at the Very Large
Telescope and the Very Large Array interferometer. The resulting mid-infrared
continuum maps show a similar clumpy and approximately circular symmetric
nebula, which contrasts sharply with the asymmetry that characterizes the
ionized component of the envelope, as evidenced from the radio and [Ne II] line
images obtained with comparable spatial resolution. In particular, there is
excellent overall agreement between the 12.8 micron map and the radio images,
consistent with free-free emission from circumstellar ionized material
surrounding a central stellar wind. The color temperature and optical depth
maps obtained from mid-infrared images show only slight fluctuations,
suggesting quite uniform dust characteristics over the dust shell. We explore
various possibilities to understand the cause of the different morphology of
the dusty and gaseous component of the circumstellar envelope which are
compatible with the observations.
