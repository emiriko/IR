Pseudogap (PG), a phenomenon of opening of gap like features above
superconducting (SC) transition temperature (Tc), has been universally observed
in the high-Tc cuprates (HTC) (1,2), some heavy fermion superconductors (3),
and iron pnictides (4-7). Here, we report the observation of PG behavior in
optical conductivity in an underdoped Ba0.6+{\delta}K0.4-{\delta}Fe2As2
(Tconset =36 K) single crystal far above Tc, up to 100 K (~ 3Tc). Unique scale
separation in Ba0.6+{\delta}K0.4-{\delta}Fe2As2 compound - magnetic and SC
correlation energy scales being widely separated - enabled us to establish that
the PG structures observed in the range of 50 cm-1 - 150 cm-1 in optical
conductivity is caused by the SC correlation and the magnetic correlation
origin is ruled out. Theoretical calculations, based on the preformed Cooper
pair model (8), provided an excellent description to the temperature evolution
of the optical conductivity data from below to above Tc.
