We study the heat transfer between weakly coupled systems with flat
interface. We present a simple analytical result which can be used to estimate
the heat transfer coefficient. As an application we consider the heat transfer
between graphene and amorphous SiO2. The calculated value of the heat transfer
coefficient is in good agreement with the value deduced from experimental data.
