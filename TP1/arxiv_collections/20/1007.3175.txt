We introduce a version of discrete Morse theory specific for manifolds with
boundary. The idea is to consider Morse functions for which all boundary cells
are critical. We obtain "Relative Morse Inequalities" relating the homology of
the manifold to the number of interior critical cells. We also derive a Ball
Theorem, in analogy to Forman's Sphere Theorem. The main corollaries of our
work are:
  -- For each d \ge 3 and for each k \ge 0, there is a PL d-sphere on which any
discrete Morse function has more than k critical (d-1)-cells. (This solves a
problem by Chari.)
  -- For fixed d and k, there are exponentially many combinatorial types of
simplicial d-manifolds (counted with respect to the number of facets) that
admit discrete Morse functions with at most k critical interior (d-1)-cells.
(This connects discrete Morse theory to enumerative combinatorics/discrete
quantum gravity.)
  -- The barycentric subdivision of any constructible d-ball is collapsible.
(This "almost" solves a problem by Hachimori.)
  -- Every constructible ball collapses onto its boundary minus a facet. (This
improves a result by the author and Ziegler.)
  -- Any 3-ball with a knotted spanning edge cannot collapse onto its boundary
minus a facet. (This strengthens a classical result by Bing and a recent result
by the author and Ziegler.)
