Self-similar solutions of the coherent diffusion equation are derived and
measured. The set of real similarity solutions is generalized by the
introduction of a nonuniform phase surface, based on the elegant Gaussian modes
of optical diffraction. In an experiment of light storage in a gas of diffusing
atoms, a complex initial condition is imprinted, and its diffusion dynamics is
monitored. The self-similarity of both the amplitude and the phase pattern is
demonstrated, and an algebraic decay associated with the mode order is
measured. Notably, as opposed to a regular diffusion spreading, a self-similar
contraction of a special subset of the solutions is predicted and observed.
