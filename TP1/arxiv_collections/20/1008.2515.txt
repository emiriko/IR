A short introduction to the complex phenomena encountered in transition metal
oxides with either charge or orbital or joint charge-and-orbital order, usually
accompanied by magnetic order, is presented. It is argued that all the types of
above ordered phases in these systems follow from strong Coulomb interactions
as a result of certain compromise between competing instabilities towards
various types of magnetic order and optimize the gain of kinetic energy in
doped systems. This competition provides a natural explanation of the stripe
order observed in doped cuprates, nickelates and manganites. In the undoped
correlated insulators with orbital degrees of freedom the orbital order
stabilizes particular types of anisotropic magnetic phases, and we contrast the
case of decoupled spin and orbital degrees of freedom in the manganites with
entangled spin-orbital states which decide about certain rather exotic
phenomena observed in the perovskite vanadates at finite temperature. Examples
of successful concepts in the theoretical approaches to these complex systems
are given and some open problems of current interest are indicated.
