We present a wide field study of the Globular Clusters/Low Mass X-ray
Binaries connection in the cD elliptical NGC1399, combining HST/ACS and Chandra
high resolution data. We find evidence that LMXB formation likelihood is
influenced by GCs structural parameters, in addition to the well known effects
of mass and metallicity, independently from galactocentric distance.
