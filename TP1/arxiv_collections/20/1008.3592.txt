The magnetic chemically peculiar star CU Virginis is a unique astrophysical
laboratory for stellar magnetospheres and coherent emission processes. It is
the only known main sequence star to emit a radio pulse every rotation period.
Here we report on new observations of the CU Virginis pulse profile in the 13
and 20\,cm radio bands. The profile is known to be characterised by two peaks
of 100$\%$ circularly polarised emission that are thought to arise in an
electron-cyclotron maser mechanism. We find that the trailing peak is stable at
both 13 and 20\,cm, whereas the leading peak is intermittent at 13\,cm. Our
measured pulse arrival times confirm the discrepancy previously reported
between the putative stellar rotation rates measured with optical data and with
radio observations. We suggest that this period discrepancy might be caused by
an unknown companion or by instabilities in the emission region. Regular
long-term pulse timing and simultaneous multi-wavelength observations are
essential to clarify the behaviour of this emerging class of transient radio
source.
