We investigate the optical conductivity as a function of temperature with
light polarized along the in-plane orthorhombic $a$- and $b$-axes of
Ba(Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$)$_2$As$_2$ for $x$=0 and 2.5$\%$ under uniaxial pressure.
The charge dynamics at low frequencies on these detwinned, single domain
compounds tracks the anisotropic $dc$ transport properties across their
structural and magnetic phase transitions. Our findings allow us to estimate
the dichroism, which extends to relatively high frequencies. These results are
consistent with a scenario in which orbital order plays a significant role in
the tetragonal-to-orthorhombic structural transition.
