We investigate the evolution of sub-horizon cold dark matter perturbation in
the dark energy dominated era of the Universe. By generalising the Meszaros
equation to be valid for an arbitrary equation of state parameter, we derive
the $w$-Meszaros equation. Its solutions determine the evolution of the cold
dark matter perturbation by neglecting dark energy perturbations. Our
analytical results provide a qualitative understanding of this evolution.
