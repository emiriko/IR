Making use of the recently developed chiral power counting for the physics of
nuclear matter [1,2], we evaluate the in-medium chiral quark condensate up to
next-to-leading order for both symmetric nuclear matter and neutron matter. Our
calculation includes the full in-medium iteration of the leading order local
and one-pion exchange nucleon-nucleon interactions. Interestingly, we find a
cancellation between the contributions stemming from the quark mass dependence
of the nucleon mass appearing in the in-medium nucleon-nucleon interactions.
Only the contributions originating from the explicit quark mass dependence of
the pion mass survive. This cancellation is the reason of previous observations
concerning the dominant role of the long-range pion contributions and the
suppression of short-range nucleon-nucleon interactions. We find that the
linear density contribution to the in-medium chiral quark condensate is only
slightly modified for pure neutron matter by the nucleon-nucleon interactions.
For symmetric nuclear matter the in-medium corrections are larger, although
smaller compared to other approaches due to the full iteration of the lowest
order nucleon-nucleon tree-level amplitudes. Our calculation satisfies the
Hellmann-Feynman theorem to the order worked out. Also we address the problem
of calculating the leading in-medium corrections to the pion decay constant. We
find that there are no extra in-medium corrections that violate the
Gell-Mann-Oakes-Renner relation up to next-to-leading order.
