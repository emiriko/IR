We present IRAC/MIPS Spitzer Space Telescope observations of the solar type
and the low mass stellar population of the young (~5 Myr) Lambda Orionis
cluster. Combining optical and 2MASS photometry, we identify 436 stars as
probable members of the cluster. Given the distance (450 pc) and the age of the
cluster, our sample ranges in mass from 2 solar mass to objects below the
substellar limit. With the addition of the Spitzer mid-infrared data, we have
identified 49 stars bearing disks in the stellar cluster. Using spectral energy
distribution (SED) slopes, we place objects in several classes: non-excess
stars (diskless), stars with optically thick disks, stars with ``evolved
disks''( with smaller excesses than optically thick disk systems), and
``transitional disks'' candidates (in which the inner disk is partially or
fully cleared). The disk fraction depends on the stellar mass, ranging from ~6%
for K type stars (Rc-J<2) to ~27% for stars with spectral type M5 or later
(Rc-J>4). We confirm the dependence of disk fraction on stellar mass in this
age range found in other studies. Regarding clustering levels, the overall
fraction of disks in the Lambda Orionis cluster is similar to those reported in
other stellar groups with ages normally quoted as ~5 Myr.
