This resource letter provides an introduction to some of the main current
topics in experimental tests of general relativity as well as to some of the
historical literature. It is intended to serve as a guide to the field for
upper-division undergraduate and graduate students, both theoretical and
experimental, and for workers in other fields of physics who wish learn about
experimental gravity. The topics covered include alternative theories of
gravity, tests of the principle of equivalence, solar-system and binary-pulsar
tests, searches for new physics in gravitational arenas, and tests of gravity
in new regimes, involving astrophysics and gravitational radiation.
