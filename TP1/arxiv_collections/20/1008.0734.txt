The Kantorovich function $(x^TAx)(x^T A^{-1} x)$, where $A$ is a positive
definite matrix, is not convex in general. From matrix/convex analysis point of
view, it is interesting to address the question: When is this function convex?
In this paper, we investigate the convexity of this function by the condition
number of its matrix. In 2-dimensional space, we prove that the Kantorovich
function is convex if and only if the condition number of its matrix is bounded
above by $3+2\sqrt{2}, $ and thus the convexity of the function with two
variables can be completely characterized by the condition number. The upper
bound `$3+2\sqrt{2} $' is turned out to be a necessary condition for the
convexity of Kantorovich functions in any finite-dimensional spaces. We also
point out that when the condition number of the matrix (which can be any
dimensional) is less than or equal to $\sqrt{5+2\sqrt{6}}, $ the Kantorovich
function is convex. Furthermore, we prove that this general sufficient
convexity condition can be remarkably improved in 3-dimensional space. Our
analysis shows that the convexity of the function is closely related to some
modern optimization topics such as the semi-infinite linear matrix inequality
or 'robust positive semi-definiteness' of symmetric matrices. In fact, our main
result for 3-dimensional cases has been proved by finding an explicit solution
range to some semi-infinite linear matrix inequalities.
