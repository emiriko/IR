Let $\mathbb{M}$ be a smooth connected manifold endowed with a smooth measure
$\mu$ and a smooth locally subelliptic diffusion operator $L$ satisfying
$L1=0$, and which is symmetric with respect to $\mu$. We show that if $L$
satisfies, with a non negative curvature parameter, the generalized curvature
inequality introduced by the first and third named authors in \cite{BG}, then
the following properties hold:
  1 The volume doubling property; 2 The Poincar\'e inequality; 3 The parabolic
Harnack inequality.
  The key ingredient is the study of dimensional reverse log-Sobolev
inequalities for the heat semigroup and corresponding non-linear reverse
Harnack type inequalities. Our results apply in particular to all Sasakian
manifolds whose horizontal Webster-Tanaka-Ricci curvature is non negative, all
Carnot groups with step two, and to wide subclasses of principal bundles over
Riemannian manifolds whose Ricci curvature is non negative.
