This paper is to create a practical steganographic implementation for 4-bit
images.The proposed technique converts 4 bit image into 4 shaded Gray Scale
image. This image will be act as reference image to hide the text. Using this
grey scale reference image any text can be hidden. Single character of a text
can be represented by 8-bit. The 8-bit character can be split into 4X2 bit
information. If the reference image and the data file are transmitted through
network separately, we can achieve the effect of Steganography. Here the image
is not at all distorted because said image is only used for referencing. Any
huge mount of text material can be hidden using a very small image. Decipher
the text is not possible intercepting the image or data file separately. So, it
is more secure.
