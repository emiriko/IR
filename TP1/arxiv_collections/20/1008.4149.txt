We present a calculation of the three-quark core contribution to nucleon and
Delta-baryon masses and Delta electromagnetic form factors in a
Poincare-covariant Faddeev approach. A consistent setup for the dressed-quark
propagator, the quark-quark, quark-'diquark' and quark-photon interactions is
employed, where all ingredients are solutions of their respective
Dyson-Schwinger or Bethe-Salpeter equations in a rainbow-ladder truncation. The
resulting Delta electromagnetic form factors concur with present experimental
and lattice data.
