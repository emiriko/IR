Base sequences BS(m,n) are quadruples (A;B;C;D) of {+1,-1}-sequences, with A
and B of length m and C and D of length n, such that the sum of their
nonperiodic autocorrelation functions is a delta-function. Normal sequences
NS(n) are base sequences (A;B;C;D) in BS(n,n) such that A=B. We introduce a
definition of equivalence for normal sequences NS(n), and construct a canonical
form. By using this canonical form, we have enumerated the equivalence classes
of NS(n) for n <= 40.
