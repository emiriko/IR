We seek to establish additional observational signatures of the effects of
clumping in OB star winds. The action of clumping on strategic wind-formed
spectral lines is tested to steer the development of models for clumped winds
and thus improve the reliability of mass-loss determinations for massive
stars.The SiIV 1400 resonance line doublets of B0 to B5 supergiants are
analysed using empirical line-synthesis models. The focus is on decoding
information on wind clumping from measurements of ratios of the radial optical
depths (tau_(rad)(w)) of the red and blue components of the SiIV doublet. We
exploit in particular the fact that the two doublet components are decoupled
and formed independently for targets with relatively low wind terminal
velocities. Line-synthesis analyses reveal that the mean ratio of tau_(rad)(w)
of the blue to red SiIV components are rarely close to the canonical value of ~
2 (expected from atomic constants), and spread instead over a range of values
between ~1 and 2. These results are interpreted in terms of a photosphere that
is partially obscured by optically thick structures in the outflowing gas.The
spectroscopic signatures established in this study demonstrate the wide-spread
existence of wind clumping in B supergiants. The additional information in
unsaturated doublet profiles provides a means to quantify the porosity of the
winds.
