The recent measurement of an anomalous like-sign dimuon asymmetry by the D0
collaboration has prompted theoretical speculation on possible sources of
physics beyond the Standard Model that may affect lifetimes and lifetime
differences in neutral B meson systems. One observable that deserves closer
attention is the width difference in the B_d system, Delta Gamma_d. Since the
Standard Model prediction for this quantity is well below 1%, it serves as a
"null test" whereby the measurement of a larger value would cleanly reveal the
presence of new physics. Methods to measure Delta Gamma_d at current and future
experiments are reviewed and an attractive new approach is proposed.
