The annihilation of huge quantities of captured dark matter (DM) particles
inside low-mass stars has been shown to change some of the stellar properties,
such as the star's effective temperature or the way the energy is transported
throughout the star. While in the classical picture, without DM, a star of 1
M_sun is expected to have a radiative interior during the main sequence, the
same star evolving in a halo of DM with a density rho_x > 10^8 GeV cm^-3 will
develop a convective core in order to evacuate the energy from DM annihilation
in a more efficient way. This convective core leaves a discontinuity in the
density and sound-speed profiles that can be detected by the analysis of the
stellar oscillations. In this paper we present an approach towards the use of
asteroseismology to detect the signature produced by the presence of DM inside
a star, and we propose a new methodology to infer the properties of a DM halo
from the stellar oscillations (such as the product of the DM density and the DM
particle-nucleon scattering cross-section).
