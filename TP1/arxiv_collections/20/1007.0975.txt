Recently observed oscillations in the solar atmosphere have been interpreted
and modeled as magnetohydrodynamic wave modes. This has allowed the estimation
of parameters that are otherwise hard to derive, such as the coronal
magnetic-field strength. This work crucially relies on the initial detection of
the oscillations, which is commonly done manually. The volume of Solar Dynamics
Observatory (SDO) data will make manual detection inefficient for detecting all
of the oscillating regions. An algorithm is presented which automates the
detection of areas of the solar atmosphere that support spatially extended
oscillations. The algorithm identifies areas in the solar atmosphere whose
oscillation content is described by a single, dominant oscillation within a
user-defined frequency range. The method is based on Bayesian spectral analysis
of time-series and image filtering. A Bayesian approach sidesteps the need for
an a-priori noise estimate to calculate rejection criteria for the observed
signal, and it also provides estimates of oscillation frequency, amplitude and
noise, and the error in all these quantities, in a self-consistent way. The
algorithm also introduces the notion of quality measures to those regions for
which a positive detection is claimed, allowing simple post-detection
discrimination by the user. The algorithm is demonstrated on two Transition
Region and Coronal Explorer (TRACE) datasets, and comments regarding its
suitability for oscillation detection in SDO are made.
