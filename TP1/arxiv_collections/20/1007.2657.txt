We report surface reconstruction (RC)-dependent growths of SrTiO3 and SrVO3
on a SrTiO3 (001) surface with two different coexisting surface RCs, namely
(2x1) and c(6x2). Up to the coverage of several layers, epitaxial growth was
forbidden on the c(6x2) RC under the growth conditions that permitted
layer-by-layer epitaxial growth on the (2x1) RC. Scanning tunneling microscopy
examination of the lattice structure of the c(6x2) RC revealed that this
RC-selective growth mainly originated from the significant
structural/stoichiometric dissimilarity between the c(6x2) RC and the cubic
perovskite films. As a result, the formation of SrTiO3 islands was forbidden
from the nucleation stage.
