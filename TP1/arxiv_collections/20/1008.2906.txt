We consider the hamiltonian operator associated with planar sec- tions of
infinitely long cylindrical solenoids and with a homogeneous magnetic field in
their interior. First, in the Sobolev space $\mathcal H^2$, we characterize all
generalized boundary conditions on the solenoid bor- der compatible with
quantum mechanics, i.e., the boundary conditions so that the corresponding
hamiltonian operators are self-adjoint. Then we study and compare the
scattering of the most usual boundary con- ditions, that is, Dirichlet, Neumann
and Robin.
