This study introduces a new signal analysis method called SCSA, based on a
semi-classical approach. The main idea in the SCSA is to interpret a
pulse-shaped signal as a potential of a Schr\"odinger operator and then to use
the discrete spectrum of this operator for the analysis of the signal. We
present some numerical examples and the first results obtained with this method
on the analysis of arterial blood pressure waveforms.
