By means of numerical integration we investigate the coherent and incoherent
phases in a generalized Kuramoto model of phase-coupled oscillators with
distance-dependent delay. Preserving the topology of a complete graph, we
arrange the nodes on a square lattice while introducing finite interaction
velocity, which gives rise to non-uniform delay. It is found that such delay
facilitates incoherence and removes reentrant behavior found in models with
uniform delay. A coupling-delay phase diagram is obtained and compared with
previous results for uniform delay.
