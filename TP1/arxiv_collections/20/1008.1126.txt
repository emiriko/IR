Based on first-principles calculations we revealed fundamental properties of
infinite and finite size monatomic chains of carbon atoms in equilibrium and
under an applied strain. Distributions of bond lengths and magnetic moments at
atomic sites exhibit interesting even-odd disparity depending on the number of
carbon atoms in the chain and on the type of saturation of carbon atoms at both
ends. It was shown that, the $\pi$-bands of carbon atomic chains behave as a
one dimensional free electron system. A local perturbation created by a small
displacement of the single carbon atom at the center of a long chain induces
oscillations of atomic forces and charge density, which are carried to long
distances over the chain. These long ranged oscillations are identified as
Friedel oscillations showing $1/r$ decay rate in one dimensional systems.
