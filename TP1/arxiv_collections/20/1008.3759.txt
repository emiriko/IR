Real-Time availability of information is of most importance in large scale
distributed interactive simulation in network-centric communication.
Information generated from multiple federates must be distributed and made
available to interested parties and providing the required QoS for consistent
communication. The remainder of this paper discuss design alternative for
realizing high performance distributed interactive simulation (DIS) application
using the OMG Data Distribution Service (DDS), which is a QoS enabled
publish/subscribe platform standard for time-critical, data-centric and large
scale distributed networks. The considered application, in the civil domain, is
used for remote education in driving schools. An experimental design evaluates
the bandwidth and the latency performance of DDS and a comparison with the High
Level Architecture performance is given.
