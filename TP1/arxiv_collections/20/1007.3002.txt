The transfer of quantum states has played an important role in quantum
information processing. In fact, transfer of quantum states from point $A$ to
$B$ with unit fidelity is very important for us and we focus on this case. In
recent years, in represented works, they designed Hamiltonian in a way that a
mirror symmetry creates with with respect to network center. In this paper, we
stratify the spin network with respect to an arbitrary vertex of the spin
network o then we design coupling coefficient in a way to create a mirror
symmetry in Hamiltonian with respect to center. By using this Hamiltonian and
represented approach, initial state that have been encoded on the first vertex
in suitable time and with unit fidelity from it's antipodes vertex can be
received. In his work, there is no need to external control.
