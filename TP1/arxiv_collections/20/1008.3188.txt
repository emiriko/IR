In the present work we analyze and compare the information coming from
different observational data sets in the context of a sort of f(T) theories. We
perform a joint analysis with measurements of the most recent type Ia
supernovae (SNe Ia), Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO), Cosmic Microwave
Background radiation (CMB), Gamma-Ray Bursts data (GRBs) and Hubble parameter
observations (OHD) to constraint the only new parameter these theories have. It
is shown that when the new combined BAO/CMB parameter is used to put
constraints, the result is different from previous works. We also show that
when we include Observational Hubble Data (OHD) the simpler LambdaCDM model is
excluded to one sigma level, leading the effective equation of state of these
theories to be of phantom type. Also, analyzing a tension criterion for SNe Ia
and other observational sets, we obtain more consistent and better suited data
sets to work with these theories.
