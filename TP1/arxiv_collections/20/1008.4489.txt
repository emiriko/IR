Using 58 million J/psi decays obtained by BESII, a charged kappa particle is
observed in the analysis of the Kspi+- system recoiling against K*(892)-+
selected in J/psi -> KsKspi+pi-. The mass and width values of the charged kappa
are obtained to be (826+-49_{-34}^{+49}) MeV/c^2 and (449+-156_{-81}^{+144})
MeV/c^2 for the Breit-Wigner parameters, and the pole position is determined to
be (764+-63_{-54}^{+71})-i(306+-149_{-85}^{+143}) MeV/c^2. They are in good
agreement with those of the neutral kappa observed by the BES collaboration.
