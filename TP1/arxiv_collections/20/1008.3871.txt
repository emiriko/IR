In the present article we study the radial symmetry of minimizers of the
energy functional, corresponding to the repulsive Hartree equation in external
Coulomb potential. To overcome the difficulties, resulting from the "bad" sign
of the nonlocal term, we modify the reflection method and then, by using
Pohozaev integral identities we get the symmetry result.
