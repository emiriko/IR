The incommensurate (IC) spin ordering in quasi-1D edge-shared cuprate
NaCu_2O_2 has been studied by ^{23}Na nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy
in an external magnetic field near 6 Tesla applied along the main
crystallographic axes. The NMR lineshape evolution above and below T_N\approx12
K yields a clear signature of an IC static modulation of the local magnetic
field consistent with a Cu^{2+} spin spiral polarized in the bc-plane rather
than in the ab-plane as reported from earlier neutron diffraction data.
