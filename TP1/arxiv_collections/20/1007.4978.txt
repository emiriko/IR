We use the parallax measurements of RE J 0317-853 to determine its mass,
radius, and cooling age and thereby constrain its evolutionary origins. We
observed RE J 0317-853 with the the Hubble Space Telescope's Fine Guidance
System to measure the parallax of RE J 0317-853 and its binary companion, the
non-magnetic white dwarf LB 9802. In addition, we acquired spectra of
comparison stars with the Boller & Chivens spectrograph of the SMARTS telescope
to correct the parallax zero point. For the corrected parallax, we determine
the radius, mass, and the cooling age with the help of evolutionary models from
the literature. The properties of RE J 0317-853 are constrained using the
parallax information. We discuss the different cases of the core composition
and the uncertain effective temperature. We confirm that RE J 0317-853 is close
to the Chandrasekhar's mass limit in all cases and almost as old as its
companion LB 9802. The precise evolutionary history of RE J 0317-853 depends on
our knowledge of its effective temperature. It is possible that it had a single
star progenitor possible if we assume that the effective temperature is at the
cooler end of the possible range from 30000 to 50000; if T_eff is instead at
the hotter end, a binary-merger scenario for RE J 0317-853 becomes more
plausible.
