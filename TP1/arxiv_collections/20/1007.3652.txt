In this note we provide regularity conditions of closedness type which
guarantee some surjectivity results concerning the sum of two maximal monotone
operators by using representative functions. The first regularity condition we
give guarantees the surjectivity of the monotone operator $S(\cdot +
p)+T(\cdot)$, where $p\in X$ and $S$ and $T$ are maximal monotone operators on
the reflexive Banach space $X$. Then, this is used to obtain sufficient
conditions for the surjectivity of $S+T$ and for the situation when $0$ belongs
to the range of $S+T$. Several special cases are discussed, some of them
delivering interesting byproducts.
