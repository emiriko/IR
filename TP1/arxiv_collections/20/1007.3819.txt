We introduce fixpoint definitions, a rule-based reformulation of fixpoint
constructs. The logic FO(FD), an extension of classical logic with fixpoint
definitions, is defined. We illustrate the relation between FO(FD) and FO(ID),
which is developed as an integration of two knowledge representation paradigms.
The satisfiability problem for FO(FD) is investigated by first reducing FO(FD)
to difference logic and then using solvers for difference logic. These
reductions are evaluated in the computation of models for FO(FD) theories
representing fairness conditions and we provide potential applications of
FO(FD).
