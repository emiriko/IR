Infrared photometry of the probable triple WC4 (+O?) +O8I: system HD 36402
(BAT99-38) in the LMC shows emission characteristic of heated dust. Although HD
36402 is close to two luminous YSOs, it is possible to distinguish its emission
at wavelengths less than 10 microns. Simple modelling indicates a dust
temperature near 800 K and mass of about 1.5e-7 Msol amorphous carbon grains.
The dust emission appears to be variable. It is apparent that Wolf Rayet dust
formation occurs also in metal-poor environments.
