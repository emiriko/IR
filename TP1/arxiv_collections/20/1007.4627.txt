We present thin-shell wormhole solutions in Einstein-Yang-Mills-Gauss-Bonnet
(EYMGB) theory in higher dimensions d\geq5. Exact black hole solutions are
employed for this purpose where the radius of thin-shell lies outside the event
horizon. For some reasons the cases d=5 and d>5 are treated separately. The
surface energy-momentum of the thin-shell creates surface pressures to resist
against collapse and rendering stable wormholes possible. We test the stability
of the wormholes against spherical perturbations through a linear
energy-pressure relation and plot stability regions. Apart from this restricted
stability we investigate the possibility of normal (i.e. non-exotic) matter
which satisfies the energy conditions. For negative values of the Gauss-Bonnet
(GB) parameter we obtain such physical wormholes.
