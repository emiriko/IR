The role of nucleus in strong-field nonsequential double ionization of Ar
atoms is investigated using three-dimensional classical ensembles. By adjusting
the nuclear Coulomb potential, we can excellently reproduce the experimental
correlated electron and ion momentum spectra with laser intensities above the
recollision threshold [Phys. Rev. Lett. 93, 263001 (2004)] and below the
recollision threshold [Phys. Rev. Lett. 101, 053001 (2008)] quantitatively.
Analysis reveals the detailed electronic dynamics when the nuclear Coulomb
attraction plays a key role in the recollision process of nonsequential double
ionization of Ar atoms. Comparison between our results for Ar and those for He
shows that atom species have a strong influence on nonsequential double
ionization.
