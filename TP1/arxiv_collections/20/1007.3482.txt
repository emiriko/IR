Let X be the variety of Borel subgroups of a simple and strongly inner linear
algebraic group G over a field k. We prove that the torsion part of the second
quotient of Grothendieck's gamma-filtration on X is a cyclic group of order the
Dynkin index of G. As a byproduct of the proof we obtain an explicit cycle that
generates this cyclic group; we provide an upper bound for the torsion of the
Chow group of codimension-3 cycles on X; we relate the generating cycle with
the Rost invariant and the torsion of the respective generalized Rost motives;
we use this cycle to obtain a uniform lower bound for the essential dimension
of (almost) all simple linear algebraic groups.
