A model of the DN interaction is presented which is developed in close
analogy to the meson-exchange KbarN potential of the Juelich group utilizing
SU(4) symmetry constraints. The main ingredients of the interaction are
provided by vector meson (rho, omega) exchange and higher-order box diagrams
involving D*N, D\Delta, and D*\Delta intermediate states. The coupling of DN to
the pi-Lambda_c and pi-Sigma_c channels is taken into account. The interaction
model generates the Lambda_c(2595) resonance dynamically as a DN quasi-bound
state. Results for DN total and differential cross sections are presented and
compared with predictions of an interaction model that is based on the
leading-order Weinberg-Tomozawa term. Some features of the Lambda_c(2595)
resonance are discussed and the role of the near-by pi-Sigma_c threshold is
emphasized. Selected predictions of the orginal KbarN model are reported too.
Specifically, it is pointed out that the model generates two poles in the
partial wave corresponding to the Lambda(1405) resonance.
