We study charge fractionalization in bilayer graphene which is intimately
related to its zero modes. In the unbiased case, the valley zero modes occur in
pairs rendering it unsuitable for charge fractionalization. A bias plays the
role of a bosonic field with nontrivial topology allowing for the exploration
of Dirac-like dynamics at higher particle momenta. It also induces an odd
number of zero modes, which, together with the conjugation symmetry between
positive and negative energy states, are the requisite conditions for charge
fractionalization. A self-conjugate, localized zero mode is constructed for a
semi-infinite graphene sheet with zigzag edge; scenarios can occur readily
where one sublattice component (pseudospin) dominates. While the other valley
also has a similar zero mode, a layer asymmetry can be invoked to lift this
degeneracy allowing for detection of distinguishable charge-1/2 edge states per
valley.
