We study distributed optimization in networked systems, where nodes cooperate
to find the optimal quantity of common interest, x=x^\star. The objective
function of the corresponding optimization problem is the sum of private (known
only by a node,) convex, nodes' objectives and each node imposes a private
convex constraint on the allowed values of x. We solve this problem for generic
connected network topologies with asymmetric random link failures with a novel
distributed, decentralized algorithm. We refer to this algorithm as AL-G
(augmented Lagrangian gossiping,) and to its variants as AL-MG (augmented
Lagrangian multi neighbor gossiping) and AL-BG (augmented Lagrangian broadcast
gossiping.) The AL-G algorithm is based on the augmented Lagrangian dual
function. Dual variables are updated by the standard method of multipliers, at
a slow time scale. To update the primal variables, we propose a novel,
Gauss-Seidel type, randomized algorithm, at a fast time scale. AL-G uses
unidirectional gossip communication, only between immediate neighbors in the
network and is resilient to random link failures. For networks with reliable
communication (i.e., no failures,) the simplified, AL-BG (augmented Lagrangian
broadcast gossiping) algorithm reduces communication, computation and data
storage cost. We prove convergence for all proposed algorithms and demonstrate
by simulations the effectiveness on two applications: l_1-regularized logistic
regression for classification and cooperative spectrum sensing for cognitive
radio networks.
