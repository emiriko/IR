We performed electric and thermoelectric transport measurements of bilayer
graphene in a magnetic field up to 15 Tesla. The transverse thermoelectric
conductivity $\rm\alpha_{xy}$, determined from four transport coefficients,
attains a peak value of $\rm\alpha_{xy, peak}$ whenever chemical potential lies
in the center of a Landau level. The temperature dependence of $\rm\alpha_{xy,
peak}$ is dictated by the disorder width $\rm W_L$. For $\rm k_BT/W_L\leq$0.2,
$\rm\alpha_{xy, peak}$ is nominally linear in temperature, which gives
$\rm\alpha_{xy,peak}/T=0.19 \pm 0.03 n A/K^2$ independent of the magnetic
field, temperature and Landau Level index. At $\rm k_BT/W_L\geq$0.5,
$\rm\alpha_{xy, peak}$ saturates to a value close to the predicted universal
value of $\rm 4\times(ln2)k_Be/h$ according to the theory of Girvin and Jonson.
We remark that an anomaly is found in $\rm\alpha_{xy}$ near the charge neutral
point, similar to that in single-layer graphene
