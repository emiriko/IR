We characterize the Schatten class membership of the canonical solution
operator to $\bar\partial$ acting on $L^2(e^{-2\phi})$, where $\phi$ is a
subharmonic function with $\Delta\phi$ a doubling measure. The obtained
characterization is in terms of $\Delta\phi$. As part of our approach, we study
Hankel operators with anti-analytic symbols acting on the corresponding Fock
space of entire functions in $L^2(e^{-2\phi})$.
