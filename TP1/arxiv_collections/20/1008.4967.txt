This study presents comparative CP sensitivities for various sets of water
Cerenkov and liquid argon detectors combined with various running scenarios
associated with DAEdALUS and LBNE neutrino beams at DUSEL. LBNE-only running
scenarios show fairly small differences in sensitivity for the various detector
combinations. On the other hand, the DAEdALUS-only and DAEdALUS-plus-LBNE
running gives significantly better sensitivity for a detector combination that
includes at least 200 kt of Gd-doped water Cerenkov detector, exceeding the
sensitivity of a Project-X 10 year run. A 300 kt Gd-doped water Cerenkov
detector yields the best sensitivity for combined running.
