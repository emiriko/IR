We have studied a Bose-Einstein condensate of $^{87}Rb$ atoms under an
oscillatory excitation. For a fixed frequency of excitation, we have explored
how the values of amplitude and time of excitation must be combined in order to
produce quantum turbulence in the condensate. Depending on the combination of
these parameters different behaviors are observed in the sample. For the lowest
values of time and amplitude of excitation, we observe a bending of the main
axis of the cloud. Increasing the amplitude of excitation we observe an
increasing number of vortices. The vortex state can evolve into the turbulent
regime if the parameters of excitation are driven up to a certain set of
combinations. If the value of the parameters of these combinations is exceeded,
all vorticity disappears and the condensate enters into a different regime
which we have identified as the granular phase. Our results are summarized in a
diagram of amplitude versus time of excitation in which the different
structures can be identified. We also present numerical simulations of the
Gross-Pitaevskii equation which support our observations.
