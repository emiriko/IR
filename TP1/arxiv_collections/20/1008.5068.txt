Argon with an admixture of CF4 is expected to be a good candidate for the gas
mixture to be used for a time projection chamber (TPC) in the future linear
collider experiment because of its small transverse diffusion of drift
electrons especially under a strong magnetic field. In order to confirm the
superiority of this gas mixture over conventional TPC gases we carried out
cosmic ray tests using a GEM-based TPC operated mostly in Ar-CF4-isobutane
mixtures under 0 - 1 T axial magnetic fields. The measured gas properties such
as gas gain and transverse diffusion constant as well as the observed spatial
resolution are presented.
