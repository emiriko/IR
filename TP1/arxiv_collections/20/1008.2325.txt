The ATLAS experiment has been taking data efficiently since LHC collisions
started, first at the injection energy of 450 GeV/beam and at 1.18 TeV/beam in
2009, then at 3.5 TeV/beam in 2010. Many results have already been obtained
based on this data demonstrating the performance of the detector, as well as
first physics measurements. Only a selection of highlights will be presented
here.
