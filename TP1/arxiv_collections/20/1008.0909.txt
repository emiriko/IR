Page switching is a technique that increases the memory in microcontrollers
without extending the address buses. This technique is widely used in the
design of 8-bit MCUs. In this paper, we present an algorithm to reduce the
overhead of page switching. To pursue small code size, we place the emphasis on
the allocation of functions into suitable pages with a heuristic algorithm,
thereby the cost-effective placement of page selection instructions. Our
experimental results showed the optimization achieved a reduction in code size
of 13.2 percent.
