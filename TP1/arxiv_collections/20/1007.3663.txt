Answer set programming - the most popular problem solving paradigm based on
logic programs - has been recently extended to support uninterpreted function
symbols. All of these approaches have some limitation. In this paper we propose
a class of programs called FP2 that enjoys a different trade-off between
expressiveness and complexity. FP2 programs enjoy the following unique
combination of properties: (i) the ability of expressing predicates with
infinite extensions; (ii) full support for predicates with arbitrary arity;
(iii) decidability of FP2 membership checking; (iv) decidability of skeptical
and credulous stable model reasoning for call-safe queries. Odd cycles are
supported by composing FP2 programs with argument restricted programs.
