Two thirds of the F star members of the 12 Myr old Beta Pictoris Moving Group
(BPMG) show significant excess emission in the mid-infrared, several million
years after the expected dispersal of the protoplanetary disc. Theoretical
models of planet formation suggest that this peak in the mid-infrared emission
could be due to the formation of Pluto-sized bodies in the disc, which ignite
the collisional cascade and enhance the production of small dust. Here we
present resolved mid-infrared imaging of the disc of HD191089 (F5V in the BPMG)
and consider its implications for the state of planet formation in this system.
HD191089 was observed at 18.3 microns using T-ReCS on Gemini South and the
images were compared to models of the disc to constrain the radial distribution
of the dust. The emission observed at 18.3 microns is shown to be significantly
extended beyond the PSF at a position angle of 80 degrees. This is the first
time dust emission has been resolved around HD191089. Modelling indicates that
the emission arises from a dust belt from 28-90 AU, inclined at 35 degrees from
edge on with very little emission from the inner 28AU of the disc, indicating
the presence of an inner cavity. The steep slope of the inner edge is more
consistent with truncation by a planet than with ongoing stirring. A tentative
brightness asymmetry F(W)/F(E)=0.80+/-0.12 (1.8 sigma) between the two sides of
the disc could be evidence for perturbations from a massive body on an
eccentric orbit in the system.
