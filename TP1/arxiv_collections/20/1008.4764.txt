We show that the moment-angle manifolds corresponding to complete simplicial
fans admit non-Kaehler complex-analytic structures. This generalises the known
construction of complex-analytic structures on polytopal moment-angle
manifolds, coming from identifying them as LVM-manifolds. We proceed by
describing Dolbeault cohomology and some Hodge numbers of moment-angle
manifolds by applying the Borel spectral sequence to holomorphic principal
bundles over toric varieties.
