An experimental and theoretical study on the structure and energetics of
stellated gold clusters at several sizes is presented. Systematic molecular
dynamics simulations on Kepler-Poisont classified clusters are performed based
on cubo-octahedral and icosahedral cores, following present and previous
studies that suggest stellated clusters grew up from these seeds. For cluster
sizes up to 10802 atoms full atomistic molecular dynamics simulations at room
temperature have been carried out. Results show that stellated clusters in the
bigger size regime maintain their star-like shape at room temperature, and by
means of linear fitting of energy data to proper function models, it is
predicted that the two type of stellated structures might coexist at room
temperature for relatively large sizes, being these findings in good agreement
with experimental results.
