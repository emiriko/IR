The advanced features of today's smart phones and hand held devices, like the
increased memory and processing capabilities, allowed them to act even as
information providers. Thus a smart phone hosting web services is not a fancy
anymore. But the relevant discovery of these services provided by the smart
phones has became quite complex, because of the volume of services possible
with each Mobile Host providing some services. Centralized registries have
severe drawbacks in such a scenario and alternate means of service discovery
are to be addressed. P2P domain with it resource sharing capabilities comes
quite handy and here in this paper we provide an alternate approach to UDDI
registry for discovering mobile web services. The services are published into
the P2P network as JXTA modules and the discovery issues of these module
advertisements are addressed. The approach also provides alternate means of
identifying the Mobile Host.
