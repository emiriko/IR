After discussing some subtle issues concerning the computation of deflection
angle, a general but simple expression of bending angle of light rays in weak
deflection limit has been presented for a general static and spherically
symmetric space-time. In this context the importance of proper choice of polar
axis has been highlighted. Applying the prescribed method the explicit
expression of bending angle up to an accuracy of second order in mass is
obtained for the Schwarzschild geometry without restricting the source and the
observer to be at infinite distance away from the lens.
