I show that the classical Hamilton-Jacobi (H-J) equation can be used as a
technique to study quantum mechanical problems. I first show that the the
Schr\"odinger equation is just the classical H-J equation, constrained by a
condition that forces the solutions of the H-J equation to be everywhere $C^2$.
That is, quantum mechanics is just classical mechanics constrained to ensure
that ``God does not play dice with the universe.'' I show that this condition,
which imposes global determinism, strongly suggests that $\psi^*\psi$ measures
the density of universes in a multiverse. I show that this interpretation
implies the Born Interpretation, and that the function space for $\psi$ is
larger than a Hilbert space, with plane waves automatically included. Finally,
I use H-J theory to derive the momentum-position uncertainty relation, thus
proving that in quantum mechanics, uncertainty arises from the interference of
the other universes of the multiverse, not from some intrinsic indeterminism in
nature.
