Using high temperature annealing conditions with a graphite cap covering the
C-face of an 8deg off-axis 4H-SiC sample, large and homogeneous single
epitaxial graphene layers have been grown. Raman spectroscopy shows evidence of
the almost free-standing character of these monolayer graphene sheets, which
was confirmed by magneto-transport measurements. We find a moderate p-type
doping, high carrier mobility and half integer Quantum Hall effect typical of
high quality graphene samples. This opens the way to a fully compatible
integration of graphene with SiC devices on the wafers that constitute the
standard in today's SiC industry.
