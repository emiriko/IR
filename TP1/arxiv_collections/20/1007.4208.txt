We study symmetry restoration at finite temperature in the standard model
during the electroweak phase transition in the presence of a weak magnetic
field. We compute the finite temperature effective potential up to the
contribution of ring diagrams, using the broken phase degrees of freedom, and
keep track of the gauge parameter dependence of the results. We show that under
these conditions, the phase transition becomes stronger first order.
