We experimentally demonstrate over two orders of magnitude increase in the
coherence time of nitrogen vacancy centres in diamond by implementing
decoupling techniques. We show that equal pulse spacing decoupling performs
just as well as non-periodic Uhrig decoupling and has the additional benefit
that it allows us to take advantage of "revivals" in the echo (due to the
coherent nature of the bath) to explore the longest coherence times. At short
times, we can extend the coherence of particular quantum states out from
T_2*=2.7 us out to an effective T_2 > 340 us. For preserving arbitrary states
we show the experimental importance of using pulse sequences, that through
judicious choice of the phase of the pulses, compensate the imperfections of
individual pulses for all input states. At longer times we use these
compensated sequences to enhance the echo revivals and show a coherence time of
over 1.6 ms in ultra-pure natural abundance 13C diamond.
