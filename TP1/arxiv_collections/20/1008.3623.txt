The validity of the CES approximation is investigated by comparison with
direct diagonalisation of a model vibronic Hamiltonian of $N$ identical
monomers interacting electronically. Even for quite short aggregates (N\gtrsim
6) the CES approximation is shown to give results in agreement with direct
diagonalisation, for all coupling strengths, except that of intermediate
positive coupling (the H-band region). However, previously excellent agreement
of CES calculations and measured spectra in the H-band region was obtained [A.
Eisfeld, J. S. Briggs, Chem. Phys. 324, 376]. This is shown to arise from use
of the measured monomer spectrum which includes implicitly dissipative effects
not present in the model calculation.
