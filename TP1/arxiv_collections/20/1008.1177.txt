Within an extended chiral constituent quark model, three- and five-quark
structure of the $S_{01}$ resonance $\Lambda(1405)$ is investigated with
respect to the coupling constants $g^2_{\Lambda^* \pi \Sigma}$ and
$g^2_{\Lambda^* \bar{K} N}$. Our findings corroborate with about 50% of
five-quark admixture in the $\Lambda(1405)$ needed in reproducing the strong
decay width, $\Gamma_{\Lambda(1405)\to (\Sigma \pi)^\circ}$.
