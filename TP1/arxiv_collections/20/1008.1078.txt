We regularize the potential distribution framework to calculate the excess
free energy of liquid water simulated with the BLYP-D density functional. The
calculated free energy is in fair agreement with experiments but the excess
internal energy and hence also the excess entropy are not. Our work emphasizes
the importance of thermodynamic characterization in assessing the quality of
electron density functionals in describing liquid water and hydration
phenomena.
