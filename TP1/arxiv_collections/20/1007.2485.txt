We consider freely decaying two-dimensional isotropic turbulence. It is
usually assumed that, in such turbulence, the energy spectrum at small wave
number, takes the form, where is the two-dimensional version of Loitsyansky's
integral. In this paper, we developed a simple model for large scale dynamics
of free decay two-dimensional turbulence based on the statistical solution of
Navier-Stokes equation. We provide one possible explanation for the large scale
dynamics in two-dimensional turbulence.
