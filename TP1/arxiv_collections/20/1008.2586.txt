We have successfully synthesized (Ca4Al2O6-y)(Fe2Pn2) (Pn = As and P)
(Al-42622(Pn)) using high-pressure synthesis technique. Al-42622(Pn) exhibit
superconductivity for both Pn = As and P with the transition temperatures of
28.3 K and 17.1 K, respectively. The a-lattice parameters of Al-42622(Pn) (a =
3.713 {\AA} and 3.692 {\AA} for Pn = As and P, respectively) are smallest among
the iron-pnictide superconductors. Correspondingly, Al-42622(As) has the
smallest As-Fe-As bond angle (102.1 {\deg}) and the largest As distance from
the Fe planes (1.500 {\AA}).
