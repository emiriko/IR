We present a model for the actin contractile ring of adherent animal cells.
The model suggests that the actin concentration within the ring and
consequently the power that the ring exerts both increase during contraction.
We demonstrate the crucial role of actin polymerization and depolymerization
throughout cytokinesis, and the dominance of viscous dissipation in the
dynamics. The physical origin of two phases in cytokinesis dynamics ("biphasic
cytokinesis") follows from a limitation on the actin density. The model is
consistent with a wide range of measurements of the midzone of dividing animal
cells.
