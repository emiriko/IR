We use a simple setup based on an infinite planar slab gain medium with no
mirrors to explore the possibility of realizing a recently discovered resonance
effect related to the mathematical concept of spectral singularity. In
particular we determine the range of the gain coefficient g and the width L of
the gain region required to achieve this resonance effect. We outline a method
that allows for amplifying waves of desired wavelength by adjusting the gain
coefficient (pumping intensity). We expect this method to have important
practical applications in building tunable lasers
