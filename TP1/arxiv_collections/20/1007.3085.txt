We show that a cosection of the obstruction sheaf of a perfect obstruction
theory localizes the virtual cycle to the non-surjective locus of the
cosection. We give algebraic constructions of localized Gysin maps and
localized virtual cycles. Various applications of these constructions are
discussed.
