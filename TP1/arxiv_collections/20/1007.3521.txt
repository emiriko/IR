We develop a scattering-matrix formalism to numerically study the resonant
scattering of light on generic assemblies of atoms. Protocols to eliminate the
artifacts of the method and extract physical information from the numerical
data are discussed. The efficiency of the approach is validated by comparing
its predictions with analytical results in simple geometries.Paper withdrawn.
