The Fermi surface topologies of underdoped samples the high-Tc superconductor
Bi2212 have been measured with angle resolved photoemission. By examining
thermally excited states above the Fermi level, we show that the Fermi surfaces
in the pseudogap phase of underdoped samples are actually composed of fully
enclosed hole pockets. The spectral weight of these pockets is vanishingly
small at the anti-ferromagnetic zone boundary, which creates the illusion of
Fermi "arcs" in standard photoemission measurements. The area of the pockets as
measured in this study is consistent with the doping level, and hence carrier
density, of the samples measured. Furthermore, the shape and area of the
pockets is well reproduced by a phenomenological model of the pseudogap phase
as a spin liquid.
