The random walk of test particle in low-density gas is considered basing on
approximate coarsened version of the collisional representation of the BBGKY
equations. The coarsening presumes that momentum relaxation rates of the test
particle and gas atoms are equal but allows to analyze the case when their
masses are different. It is shown that both the spectrum exponent and
probability distribution of 1/f-type diffusivity fluctuations of the test
particle essentially depend on ratio of the masses, and corresponding
distribution of its path is found.
