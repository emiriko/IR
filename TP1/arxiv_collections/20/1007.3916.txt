Pion-induced Drell-Yan processes are proposed as a potential tool to measure
the flavor dependence of the EMC effect, that is, the flavor-dependent
modification of quark distributions in the nuclear medium. Existing pionic
Drell-Yan data are compared with calculations using a recent model for nuclear
quark distributions that incorporates flavor-dependent nuclear effects. While
no firm conclusions can yet be drawn, we demonstrate that existing Drell-Yan
data seem to imply a flavor dependence of the EMC effect. We highlight how
pion-induced Drell-Yan experiments on nuclear targets can access important new
aspects of the EMC effect, not probed in deep inelastic scattering, and will
therefore provide very stringent constrains for models of nuclear quark
distributions. Predictions for possible future pion-induced Drell-Yan
experiments are also presented.
