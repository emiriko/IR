We consider the archetypal frustrated antiferromagnet
SrCr$_{9p}$Ga$_{12-9p}$O$_{19}$ in its well-known spin-liquid state, and
demonstrate that a Cr$^{3+}$ spin $S=3/2$ ion in direct proximity to a pair of
vacancies (in disordered $p<1$ samples) is cloaked by a spatially extended spin
texture that encodes the correlations of the parent spin-liquid. In this
spin-liquid regime, the combined object has a magnetic response identical to a
classical spin of length $S/2 = 3/4$, which dominates over the small intrinsic
susceptibility of the pure system. This fractional-spin texture leaves an
unmistakable imprint on the measured $^{71}$Ga nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
lineshapes, which we compute using Monte-Carlo simulations and compare with
experimental data.
