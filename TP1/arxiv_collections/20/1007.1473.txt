Video chat systems such as Chatroulette have become increasingly popular as a
way to meet and converse one-on-one via video and audio with other users online
in an open and interactive manner. At the same time, security and privacy
concerns inherent in such communication have been little explored. This paper
presents one of the first investigations of the privacy threats found in such
video chat systems, identifying three such threats, namely de-anonymization
attacks, phishing attacks, and man-in-the-middle attacks. The paper further
describes countermeasures against each of these attacks.
