Recent reports of periodic fluctuations in nuclear decay data of certain
isotopes have led to the suggestion that nuclear decay rates are being
influenced by the Sun, perhaps via neutrinos. Here we present evidence for the
existence of an additional periodicity that appears to be related to the Rieger
periodicity well known in solar physics.
