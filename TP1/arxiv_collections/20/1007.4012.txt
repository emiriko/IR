The problem of discriminating possible scenarios of TeV scale new physics
with large missing energy signature at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has
received some attention in the recent past. We consider the complementary, and
yet unexplored, case of theories predicting much softer missing energy spectra.
As there is enough scope for such models to fake each other by having similar
final states at the LHC, we have outlined a systematic method based on a
combination of different kinematic features which can be used to distinguish
among different possibilities. These features often trace back to the
underlying mass spectrum and the spins of the new particles present in these
models. As examples of "low missing energy look-alikes", we consider
Supersymmetry with R-parity violation, Universal Extra Dimensions with both
KK-parity conserved and KK-parity violated and the Littlest Higgs model with
T-parity violated by the Wess-Zumino-Witten anomaly term. Through detailed
Monte Carlo analysis of the four and higher lepton final states predicted by
these models, we show that the models in their minimal forms may be
distinguished at the LHC, while non-minimal variations can always leave scope
for further confusion. We find that, for strongly interacting new particle
mass-scale ~600 GeV (1 TeV), the simplest versions of the different theories
can be discriminated at the LHC running at sqrt{s}=14 TeV within an integrated
luminosity of 5 (30) fb^{-1}.
