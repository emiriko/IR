We performed a visual and numeric analysis of the deviation of the microwave
background temperature on WMAP maps. We proved that the microwave background
inhomogeneities possess the property of the central symmetry resulting from the
two kinds of central symmetry of the opposite signs. After the computer
modeling we have established the relation between the coefficient of the
central symmetry and the values of the symmetrical and antisymmetrical
components of the deviation of the temperature. The obtained distribution of
the symmetry coefficient on the map of the celestial sphere in Mollweide
projection testifies on a contribution of both kinds of central symmetry which
is approximately equal on the average in absolute magnitude but opposite by
sign and where one kind of the central symmetry prevails on some sections of
the celestial sphere and another kind - on the others. The average resulting
value of the symmetry coefficient on the sections with angular measures less
than 15-200 varies within the range from -50% to +50% with some prevalence of
the antisymmetry - the average coefficient of the central symmetry for the
whole celestial sphere is -4 +/- 1%. (antisymmetry 4%). Small scale structure
of the distribution indicates that it is the result of the combined action of
the mechanisms of the central symmetry and central antisymmetry, close to 100%.
