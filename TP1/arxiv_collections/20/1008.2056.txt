We show that a finite Hubbard-phonon interacting system has ferromagnetic or
unique spin-singlet ground state under the infrared singular condition. The key
tool is a unitary transformation introduced by Arai and Hirokawa. We construct
a concrete infrared singular representation using the operator algebraic
method. The method is essentially same as one for the van Hove model using the
Wightman functional method.
