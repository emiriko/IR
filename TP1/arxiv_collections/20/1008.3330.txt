A conceptual model of resistive magnetic reconnection via a stochastic
plasmoid chain is proposed. The global reconnection rate is shown to be
independent of the Lundquist number. The distribution of fluxes in the
plasmoids is shown to be an inverse square law. It is argued that there is a
finite probability of emergence of abnormally large plasmoids, which can
disrupt the chain (and may be responsible for observable large abrupt events in
solar flares and sawtooth crashes). A criterion for the transition from
magnetohydrodynamic to collisionless regime is provided.
