Traditionally, the primary mode for locomotion of amoeboid cells was thought
to be crawling on a substrate. Recently, it has been experimentally shown that
\textit{Dictostelium} amoeba and neutrophils can also swim in a directed
fashion. The mechanisms for amoeboid crawling and swimming were hypothesized to
be similar. In this letter, we show that the shape changes generated by a
crawling \textit{D. discoideum} cell are consistent with swimming.
