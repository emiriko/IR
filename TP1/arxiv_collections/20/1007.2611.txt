(Abridged) Lunar occultations (LO) are a very efficient and powerful
technique, that achieves the best combination of high angular resolution and
sensitivity possible today at near-infrared wavelengths. Given that the events
are fixed in time, that the sources are occulted randomly, and that the
telescope use is minimal, the technique is very well suited for service mode
observations. We have established a program of routine LO observations at the
VLT observatory, especially designed to take advantage of short breaks
available in-between other programs. We have used the ISAAC instrument in burst
mode, capable of producing continuous read-outs at millisecond rates on a
suitable subwindow. Given the random nature of the source selection, our aim
has been primarily the investigation of a large number of stellar sources at
the highest angular resolution in order to detect new binaries. Serendipitous
results such as resolved sources and detection of circumstellar components were
also anticipated. We have recorded the signal from background stars for a few
seconds, around the predicted time of occultation by the Moon's dark limb. At
millisecond time resolution, a characteristic diffraction pattern can be
observed. Patterns for two or more sources superimpose linearly, and this
property is used for the detection of binary stars. The detailed analysis of
the diffraction fringes can be used to measure specific properties such as the
stellar angular size and the presence of extended light sources such as a
circumstellar shell. We present a list of 191 stars for which LO data could be
recorded and analyzed. Results include the detection of 16 binary and 2 triple
stars, all but one of which were previously unknown. The projected angular
separations are as small as 4 milliarcseconds and magnitude differences as high
as ?K=5.8 mag...
