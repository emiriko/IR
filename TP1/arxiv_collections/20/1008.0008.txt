The Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) data have confirmed the pulsed emission
from all six high-confidence gamma-ray pulsars previously known from the EGRET
observations. We report results obtained from the analysis of 13 months of LAT
data for three of these pulsars (PSR J1057-5226, PSR J1709-4429, and PSR
J1952+3252) each of which had some unique feature among the EGRET pulsars. The
excellent sensitivity of LAT allows more detailed analysis of the evolution of
the pulse profile with energy and also of the variation of the spectral shape
with phase. We measure the cutoff energy of the pulsed emission from these
pulsars for the first time and provide a more complete picture of the emission
mechanism. The results confirm some, but not all, of the features seen in the
EGRET data.
