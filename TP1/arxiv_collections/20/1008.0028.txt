Eclipse exoplanet spectroscopy has yielded detection of H_2O, CH_4, CO_2 and
CO in the atmosphere of hot jupiters and neptunes. About 40 large terrestrial
planets are announced or confirmed, two of which are transiting, and another
deemed habitable. Hence the potential for eclipse spectroscopy of terrestrial
planets with James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has become an active field of
study. We explore the parameter space (type of stars, planet orbital periods
and types, and instruments/wavelengths) in terms of the signal-to-noise ratio
(S/N) achievable on the detection of spectroscopic features. We use analytic
formula and model data for both the astrophysical scene and the instrument, to
plot S/N contour maps, while indicating how the S/N scales with the fixed
parameters. We systematically compare stellar photon noise-only figures with
ones including detailed instrumental and zodiacal noises. Likelihood of
occurring targets is based both on model and catalog star population of the
solar neighborhood. The 9.6 micron ozone band is detectable (S/N = 3) with
JWST, for a warm super-earth 6.7 pc away, using ~2% of the 5-year nominal
mission time (summing observations, M4V and lighter host star for primary
eclipses, M5V for secondary). If every star up to this mass limit and distance
were to host a habitable planet, there should be statistically ~1 eclipsing
case. Investigation of systematic noises in the co-addition of 5 years worth-,
tens of days separated-, hours-long observations is critical, complemented by
dedicated characterisation of the instruments, currently in integration phase.
The census of nearby transiting habitable planets must be complete before the
beginning of science operations.
