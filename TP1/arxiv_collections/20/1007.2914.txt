The paper studies the rate of convergence of the weak Euler approximation for
It\^{o} diffusion and jump processes with H\"{o}lder-continuous generators. It
covers a number of stochastic processes including the nondegenerate diffusion
processes and a class of stochastic differential equations driven by stable
processes. To estimate the rate of convergence, the existence of a unique
solution to the corresponding backward Kolmogorov equation in H\"{o}lder space
is first proved. It then shows that the Euler scheme yields positive weak order
of convergence.
