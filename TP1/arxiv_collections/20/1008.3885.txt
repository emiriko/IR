Based on a phenomenological model with competing spin-density-wave (SDW) and
extended $s-$wave superconductivity, the vortex states in
Ba$_{1-x}$K$_{x}$Fe$_{2}$As$_{2}$ are investigated by solving Bogoliubov-de
Gennes equations. Our result for the optimally doped compound without induced
SDW is in qualitative agreement with recent scanning tunneling microscopy
experiment. We also propose that the main effect of the SDW on the vortex
states is to reduce the intensity of the in-gap peak in the local density of
states and transfer the spectral weight to form additional peaks outside the
gap.
