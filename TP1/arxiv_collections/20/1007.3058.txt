Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANET) is one of the most challenging research
area in the field of Mobile Ad Hoc Networks. In this research we proposed a
dynamic power adjustment protocol that will be used for sending the periodical
safety message. (Beacon)based on the analysis of the channel status depending
on the channel congestion and the power used for transmission. The Beacon Power
Control (BPC) protocol first sensed and examined the percentage of the channel
congestion, the result obtained was used to adjust the transmission power for
the safety message to reach the optimal power. This will lead to decrease the
congestion in the channel and achieve good channel performance and beacon
dissemination.
