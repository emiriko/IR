We obtain non-relativistic AdS4 X CP3 solutions with dynamical exponent 3 in
type IIA string theory, both with and without Romans mass. The
compactifications to four dimensions are found to describe Proca fields in
anti-de Sitter spacetime. This leads us to conclude that the massive and
massless IIA theories should be identified in four dimensions and the Romans
mass should be identified with the `flux' along CP3 in a definite manner. From
supergravity point of view, it is suggestive of some four-dimensional symmetry
that rotates Romans mass into the flux along CP3. We also provide M-theory
Galilean ABJM background which gives rise to the nonrelativistic type IIA
solution.
