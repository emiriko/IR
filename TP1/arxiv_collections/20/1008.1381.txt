We report the observation of Lifetime Enhanced Transport (LET) based on
perpendicular valleys in silicon by transport spectroscopy measurements of a
two-electron system in a silicon transistor. The LET is manifested as a
peculiar current step in the stability diagram due to a forbidden transition
between an excited state and any of the lower energy states due perpendicular
valley (and spin) configurations, offering an additional current path. By
employing a detailed temperature dependence study in combination with a rate
equation model, we estimate the lifetime of this particular state to exceed 48
ns. The two-electron spin-valley configurations of all relevant confined
quantum states in our device were obtained by a large-scale atomistic
tight-binding simulation. The LET acts as a signature of the complicated valley
physics in silicon; a feature that becomes increasingly important in silicon
quantum devices.
