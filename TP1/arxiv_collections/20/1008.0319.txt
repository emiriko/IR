Monopole shift in the proton states in odd neutron rich F isotopes has been
studied with neutron number changing from N = 10 to 20 for three different
interactions. The variation of monopole shift point out towards appearance of
shell closure at N = 14 and N = 16 and its disappearance at N = 20. Low lying
states of odd F isotopes have also been calculated in the limited configuration
space of {\it sd} shells for these interactions.
