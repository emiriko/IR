Revealing the nature of unassociated high-energy (> 100 MeV) gamma-ray
sources remains a challenge 35 years after their discovery. Of the 934
gamma-ray sources at high Galactic latitude (|b| > 15 degrees) in the First
Fermi-LAT catalogue (1FGL), 316 have no obvious associations at other
wavelengths. In this paper, we apply the K-means unsupervised classification
algorithm to isolate potential counterparts for 18 unassociated Fermi sources
contained within a 3000 square degree `overlap region' of the sky intensively
covered in radio and optical wavelengths. Combining our results with previous
works, we reach potential associations for 119 out of the 128 Fermi sources
within said region. If these associations are correct, we estimate that less
than 20% of all remaining unassociated 1FGL sources at high Galactic latitude
(|b| > 15 degrees) might host `exotic' counterparts distinct from known classes
of gamma-ray emitters. Potentially even these outliers could be explained by
high-redshift/dust-obscured analogues of the associated sample or by
intrinsically faint radio objects. Although such estimate leaves some room for
novel discoveries, it severely restricts the possibility of detecting dark
matter subhaloes and other unconventional types of gamma-ray emitters in the
1FGL. In closing, we argue that the identification of Fermi sources at the low
end of the flux density distribution will be a complex process that might only
be achieved through a clever combination of refined classification algorithms,
multi-wavelength efforts, and dedicated optical spectroscopy.
