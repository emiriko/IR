We have conducted a search for extended energy deposition trails left by
ultra-relativistic magnetic monopoles interacting in Antarctic ice. The
non-observation of any satisfactory candidates in the 31 days of accumulated
ANITA-II flight data results in an upper limit on the diffuse flux of
relativistic monopoles. We obtain a 90% C.L. limit of order
10^{-19}/(cm^2-s-sr) for values of Lorentz boost factor 10^{10}<gamma at the
anticipated energy E=10^{16} GeV. This bound is stronger than all previously
published experimental limits for this kinematic range.
