The quantum decision theory is examined in its simplest form of two-condition
two-choice setting. A set of inequalities to be satisfied by any quantum
conditional probability describing the decision process is derived.
Experimental data indicating the breakdown of classical explanations are
critically examined with quantum theory using the full set of quantum phases.
