The Standard-Model Extension (SME) provides a theoretical framework for tests
of Lorentz invariance. To date, most studies have focused on the minimal SME,
which restricts attention to operators of renormalizable dimension. Here, we
review recent studies involving the nonrenormalizable photon sector of the SME.
