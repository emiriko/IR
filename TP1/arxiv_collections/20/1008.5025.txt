The steady equilibrium conditions for a mixed gas of neutrons, protons,
electrons, positrons and radiation field (abbreviated as $npe^{\pm}$ gas)
with/without external neutrino flux are investigated, and a general chemical
potential equilibrium equation $\mu_n=\mu_p+C\mu_e$ is obtained to describe the
steady equilibrium at high temperatures ($T>10^9$K). An analytic fitting
formula of coefficient $C$ is presented for the sake of simplicity as the
neutrino and antineutrino are transparent. It is a simple method to estimate
the electron fraction for the steady equilibrium $npe^{\pm}$ gas that using the
corresponding equilibrium condition. As an example, we apply this method to the
GRB accretion disk and approve the composition in the inner region is
approximate equilibrium as the accretion rate is low. For the case with
external neutrino flux, we calculate the initial electron fraction of
neutrino-driven wind from proto-neutron star model M15-l1-r1. The results show
that the improved equilibrium condition makes the electron fraction decrease
significantly than the case $\mu_n=\mu_p+\mu_e$ when the time is less than 5
seconds post bounce, which may be useful for the r-process nucleosynthesis
