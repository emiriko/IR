The current-voltage characteristics through a metallic quantum dot which is
well coupled to a metallic lead are measured. It is shown that the I-V curves
are composed of two contributions. One is a suppression of the tunneling
conductivity at the Fermi level and the second is an oscillating feature which
shifts with gate voltage. The results indicate that Zero-Bias-Anomaly and
Coulomb Blockade phenomena coexist in an asymmetric strongly coupled quantum
dot.
