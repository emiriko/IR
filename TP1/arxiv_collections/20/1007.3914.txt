We present data for the temperature dependence of the magnetic penetration
depth lambda(T), heat capacity C(T), resistivity R(T) and magnetic torque ?tau
for highly homogeneous single crystal samples of Fe1:0Se0:44(4)Te0:56(4).
lambda(T) was measured down to 200mK in zero field. We find lambda(T) follows a
power law lambda~T^n with n = 2.2 +/- 0.1. This is similar to some 122
iron-arsenides and likely results from a sign-changing pairing state combined
with strong scattering. Magnetic fields of up to B =55T or 14T were used for
the ? tau(B) and C(T)/R(T) measurements respectively. The specific heat,
resistivity and torque measurements were used to map out the (H,T) phase
diagram in this material. All three measurements were conducted on exactly the
same single crystal sample so that the different information revealed by these
probes is clearly distinguished. Heat capacity data strongly resemble those
found for the high Tc cuprates, where strong fluctuation effects wipe-out the
phase transition at Hc2. Unusually, here we find the fluctuation effects appear
to be strongly anisotropic.
