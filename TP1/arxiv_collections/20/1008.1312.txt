In a recent paper it was suggested a novel interpretation of deformed special
relativity. In that new approach, nonlocal effects that had previously been
shown to occur and be incompatible with experiment to high precision, are
interpreted as coordinate artifacts that do not lead to real physical
consequences. It is argued here that if one follows through the consequences of
this thought, one finds that the theory one is dealing with needs to be
ordinary special relativity to precision even better than the bound on nonlocal
effect already requires. Consequently, the new approach cannot be understood as
a version of deformed special relativity that circumvents the bound.
