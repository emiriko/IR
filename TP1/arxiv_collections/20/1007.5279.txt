We present ultraviolet (UV) and optical photometry of 26 Type Ia supernovae
(SNe~Ia) observed from March 2005 to March 2008 with the NASA {\it Swift}
Ultraviolet and Optical Telescope (UVOT). The dataset consists of 2133
individual observations, making it by far the most complete study of the UV
emission from SNe~Ia to date. Grouping the SNe into three subclasses as derived
from optical observations, we investigate the evolution of the colors of these
SNe, finding a high degree of homogeneity within the normal subclass, but
dramatic differences between that group and the subluminous and SN 2002cx-like
groups. For the normal events, the redder UV filters on UVOT ($u$, $uvw1$) show
more homogeneity than do the bluer UV filters ($uvm2$, $uvw2$). Searching for
purely UV characteristics to determine existing optically based groupings, we
find the peak width to be a poor discriminant, but we do see a variation in the
time delay between peak emission and the late, flat phase of the light curves.
The UV light curves peak a few days before the $B$ band for most subclasses (as
was previously reported by Jha et al. 2006a), although the SN 2002cx-like
objects peak at a very early epoch in the UV. That group also features the
bluest emission observed among SNe~Ia. As the observational campaign is
ongoing, we discuss the critical times to observe, as determined by this study,
in order to maximize the scientific output of future observations.
