We prove a conjecture of J. Carlson, N. Mazza and J. Th\'evenaz; namely, we
will prove that if $G$ is a finite $p$-nilpotent group which contains a
non-cyclic elementary Abelian $p$-subgroup and $k$ is an algebraically closed
field of characteristic $p$, then all simple endo-trivial $kG$-modules are
$1$-dimensional.
