We consider the question of linear instability of an equilibrium of the
Relativistic Vlasov-Maxwell (RVM) System that has a strong magnetic field.
Standard instability results deal with systems where there are fewer particles
with higher energies. In this paper we extend those results to the class of
equilibria for which the number of particles does not depend monotonically on
the energy. Without the standard sign assumptions, the analysis becomes
significantly more involved.
