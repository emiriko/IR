The recent discovery of topological insulators with exotic metallic surface
states has garnered great interest in the fields of condensed matter physics
and materials science. A number of spectacular quantum phenomena have been
predicted when the surface states are under the influence of magnetism and
superconductivity, which could open up new opportunities for technological
applications in spintronics and quantum computing. To achieve this goal,
material realization of topological insulators with desired physical properties
is of crucial importance. Based on first-principles calculations, here we show
that a large number of ternary chalcopyrite compounds of composition
I-III-VI$_2$ and II-IV-V$_2$ can realize the topological insulating phase in
their native states. The crystal structure of chalcopyrites is derived from the
frequently used zinc-blende structure, and many of them possess a close lattice
match to important mainstream semiconductors, which is essential for a smooth
integration into current semiconductor technology. The diverse optical,
electrical and structural properties of chalcopyrite semiconductors, and
particularly their ability to host room-temperature ferromagnetism, make them
appealing candidates for novel spintronic devices.
