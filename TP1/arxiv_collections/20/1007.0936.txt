We analyze the rank-frequency distributions of words in selected English and
Polish texts. We show that for the lemmatized (basic) word forms the
scale-invariant regime breaks after about two decades, while it might be
consistent for the whole range of ranks for the inflected word forms. We also
find that for a corpus consisting of texts written by different authors the
basic scale-invariant regime is broken more strongly than in the case of
comparable corpus consisting of texts written by the same author. Similarly,
for a corpus consisting of texts translated into Polish from other languages
the scale-invariant regime is broken more strongly than for a comparable corpus
of native Polish texts. Moreover, we find that if the words are tagged with
their proper part of speech, only verbs show rank-frequency distribution that
is almost scale-invariant.
