We theoretically investigate the hyperfine-induced decoherence in a pair of
spin-cluster qubits, consisting of two exchange-coupled heterometallic wheels.
We identify two distinct regimes in the decoherence of intermolecular
entanglement and show that this can be substantially recovered through
dynamical decoupling. Different chemical elements and physical processes are
responsible for the decoherence of the singlet-triplet superposition, resulting
in a wider tunability of its decoherence time.
