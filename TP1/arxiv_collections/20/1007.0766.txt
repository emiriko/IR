A resistor-network picture of transitions is appropriate for the study of
energy absorption by weakly chaotic or weakly interacting driven systems. Such
"sparse" systems reach a novel non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) once coupled
to a bath. In the stochastic case there is an analogy to the physics of
percolating glassy systems, and an extension of the fluctuation-dissipation
phenomenology is proposed. In the mesoscopic case the quantum NESS might differ
enormously from the stochastic NESS, with saturation temperature determined by
the sparsity. A toy model where the sparsity of the system is modeled using a
log-normal random ensemble is analyzed.
