We report on the first observation of bosons condensed into the energy minima
of an $F$-band of a bipartite square optical lattice. Momentum spectra indicate
that a truly complex-valued staggered angular momentum superfluid order is
established. The corresponding wave function is composed of alternating local
$F_{2x^3-3x} + i F_{2y^3-3y}$-orbits and local $S$-orbits residing in the deep
and shallow wells of the lattice, which are arranged as the black and white
areas of a checkerboard. A pattern of staggered vortical currents arises, which
breaks time reversal symmetry and the translational symmetry of the lattice
potential. We have measured the populations of higher order Bragg peaks in the
momentum spectra for varying relative depths of the shallow and deep lattice
wells and find remarkable agreement with band calculations.
