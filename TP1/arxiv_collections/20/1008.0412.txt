We examine the relationship between wear and the generation of entropy in dry
sliding of metals. It is postulated that wear is related to irreversible
entropy generation within the MAZ. We present a model, that treats the MAZ as a
heat engine in the Carnot sense. The model assumes that the MAZ is a heat
engine that transports heat from a high temperature reservoir, represented by
the asperity contact layer, to a low temperature reservoir, represented by the
sub-contact layer. Consequently an entropy generation source that represents
the irreversibilities within the MAZ is defined and a study of the entropy
generation is attempted. Wear data, published elsewhere, of two materials,
Oxygen Free High conductivity Copper, and Commercially Pure Titanium are
analyzed using the developed model. It is found that wear for both materials is
correlated to entropy generation, and to the entropy flow within the MAZ.
Interestingly, moreover, in view of the contrasting wear trends of the test
materials, the relationship of the mass wear rate and the specific wear rate of
each material with respect to entropy generation are totally opposite to each
other. A common feature between the behavior of the two materials, was found in
wear behavior with respect to a so called Ratio of Residual Entropy. This ratio
determines wether the system is over or under supplied with entropy. It is
found that when the capacity to transport entropy exceeds the entropy supply
the mass wear rate increases, and when the entropy transport capacity of the
system is exceeded and entropy generation takes place the mass wear rate
decreases. This is attributed to the re-establishment of equilibrium within the
system.
