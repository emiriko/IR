The revelation principle has been known in the economics society for decades.
In this paper, I will investigate it from an energy perspective, i.e.,
considering the energy consumed by agents and the designer in participating a
mechanism. The main result is that when the strategies of agents are actions
rather than messages, an additional energy condition should be added to make
the revelation principle hold in the real world.
