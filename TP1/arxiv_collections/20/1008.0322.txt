Markov models are extensively used in the analysis of molecular evolution. A
recent line of research suggests that pairs of proteins with functional and
physical interactions co-evolve with each other. Here, by analyzing hundreds of
orthologous sets of three fungi and their co-evolutionary relations, we
demonstrate that co-evolutionary assumption may violate the Markov assumption.
Our results encourage developing alternative probabilistic models for the cases
of extreme co-evolution.
