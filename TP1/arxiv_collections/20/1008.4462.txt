Explicit generating sets are found for all primitive ideals in the generic
quantized coordinate rings of the 3x3 special and general linear groups over an
arbitrary algebraically closed field. (Previously, generators were only known
up to certain localizations.) The generating sets form polynormal regular
sequences, from which it follows that all primitive factor algebras of these
quantized coordinate rings are Auslander-Gorenstein and Cohen-Macaulay.
