We present a high-order accurate discontinuous Galerkin method for evolving
the spherically-reduced Baumgarte-Shapiro-Shibata-Nakamura (BSSN) system
expressed in terms of second-order spatial operators. Our multi-domain method
achieves global spectral accuracy and long-time stability on short
computational domains. We discuss in detail both our scheme for the BSSN system
and its implementation. After a theoretical and computational verification of
the proposed scheme, we conclude with a brief discussion of issues likely to
arise when one considers the full BSSN system.
