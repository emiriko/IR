The non-equilibrium dynamics of the three-dimensional Edwards-Anderson
spin-glass model with different bond distributions is investigated by means of
Monte Carlo simulation. A numerical method is used to determine the critical
temperature and the scaling exponents of the correlation and the integrated
response functions. The results obtained agree with those calculated in
equilibrium simulations and suggest that the universality class does not depend
on the exact form of the bond distribution.
