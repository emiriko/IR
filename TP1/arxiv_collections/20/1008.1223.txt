Since the $N^*(1535)$ resonance was found to have large coupling to the
strangeness due to its possible large $s\bar s$ component, we investigate the
possible contribution of the t-channel $N^*(1535)$ exchange for the $p\bar p
\to \phi\phi$ reaction. Our calculation indicates that the new mechanism gives
very significant contribution for the energies above 2.25 GeV and may be an
important source for evading the Okubo-Zweig-Iizuka rule in the $\phi$
production from $N \bar{N}$ annihilation.
