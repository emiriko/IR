Most biological rates and times decrease systematically with organism body
size. We use an ordinary differential equation (ODE) model of West Nile Virus
in birds to show that pathogen replication rates decline with host body size,
but natural immune system (NIS) response rates do not change systematically
with body size. This is surprising since the NIS has to search for small
quantities of pathogens through larger physical spaces in larger organisms, and
also respond by producing larger absolute quantities of antibody in larger
organisms. We call this scale-invariant detection and response. We hypothesize
that the NIS has evolved an architecture to efficiently neutralize pathogens.
We investigate a range of architectures using an Agent Based Model (ABM). We
find that a sub-modular NIS architecture, in which lymph node number and size
both increase sublinearly with body size, efficiently balances the tradeoff
between local pathogen detection and global response using antibodies. This
leads to nearly scale-invariant detection and response, consistent with
experimental data. Similar to the NIS, physical space and resources are also
important constraints on Artificial Immune Systems (AIS), especially
distributed systems applications used to connect low-powered sensors using
short-range wireless communication. We show that AIS problems, like distributed
robot control, will also require a sub-modular architecture to efficiently
balance the tradeoff between local search for a solution and global response or
proliferation of the solution between different components. This research has
wide applicability in other distributed systems AIS applications.
