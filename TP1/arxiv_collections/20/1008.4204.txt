We study the strong-coupling superconductivity near ferromagnetic quantum
critical points, mainly focusing on the upper critical fields $H_{c2}$. Based
on our simple model calculations, we discuss experimentally observed unusual
behaviors of $H_{c2}$ in a recently discovered ferromagnetic superconductor
UCoGe. Especially, the large anisotropy between $H_{c2}\parallel a$-axis and
$H_{c2}\parallel c$-axis, and the strong-coupling behaviors in
$H_{c2}^{\parallel a}$ are investigated. We also examine effects of
non-analytic corrections in the spin susceptibility on the superconductivity,
which can arise from effective long range interactions due to particle-hole
excitations.
