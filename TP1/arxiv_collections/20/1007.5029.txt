We combine variability information from the MAssive Compact Halo Objects
(MACHO) survey of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) with infrared photometry
from the Spitzer Space Telescope Surveying the Agents of a Galaxy's Evolution
(SAGE) survey to create a dataset of ~30 000 variable red sources. We
photometrically classify these sources as being on the first ascent of the Red
Giant Branch (RGB), or as being in one of three stages along the Asymptotic
Giant Branch (AGB): oxygen-rich, carbon-rich, or highly reddened with
indeterminate chemistry ("extreme" AGB candidates). We present linear
period-luminosity relationships for these sources using 8 separate infrared
bands (J, H, K, 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, 8.0, and 24 micron) as proxies for the
luminosity. We find that the wavelength dependence of the slope of the
period-luminosity relationship is different for different photometrically
determined classes of AGB stars. Stars photometrically classified as O-rich
show the least variation of slope with wavelength, while dust enshrouded
extreme AGB stars show a pronounced trend toward steeper slopes with increasing
wavelength. We find that O-rich AGB stars pulsating in the fundamental mode
obey a period-magnitude relation with a slope of -3.41 +/- 0.04 when magnitude
is measured in the 3.6 micron band, in contrast to C-rich AGB stars, which obey
a relation of slope -3.77 +/- 0.05.
