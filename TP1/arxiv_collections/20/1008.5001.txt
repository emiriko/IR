We have proposed and investigated a model of drying colloidal suspension drop
placed onto a horizontal substrate in which the sol to gel phase transition
occurs. The temporal evolution of volume fraction of the solute and the gel
phase dynamics were obtained from numerical simulations. Our model takes into
account the fact that some physical quantities are dependent on volume fraction
of the colloidal particles.
