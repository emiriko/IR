We compute the Hilbert series of general weighted flag varieties and discuss
a computer-aided method to determine their defining equations. We apply our
results to weighted flag varieties coming from the Lie groups of type G_2 and
GL(6), to construct some families of polarised projective varieties in
codimensions 8 and 6, respectively.
