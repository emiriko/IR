The Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) is a network
of three detectors built to detect local perturbations in the space-time metric
from astrophysical sources. These detectors, two in Hanford, WA and one in
Livingston, LA, are power-recycled Fabry-Perot Michelson interferometers. In
their fifth science run (S5), between November 2005 and October 2007, these
detectors accumulated one year of triple coincident data while operating at
their designed sensitivity. In this paper, we describe the calibration of the
instruments in the S5 data set, including measurement techniques and
uncertainty estimation.
