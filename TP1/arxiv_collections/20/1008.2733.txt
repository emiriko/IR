We show that given integers $N$, $d$ and $n$ such that ${N\ge2}$,
${(N,d,n)\ne(2,2,5)}$, and ${N+1\le n\le\tbinom{d+N}{N}}$, there is a family of
$n$ monomials in $K[X_0,\ldots,X_N]$ of degree $d$ such that their syzygy
bundle is stable. Case ${N\ge3}$ was obtained independently by Coand\v{a} with
a different choice of families of monomials [Coa09].
  For ${(N,d,n)=(2,2,5)}$, there are $5$ monomials of degree~$2$ in
$K[X_0,X_1,X_2]$ such that their syzygy bundle is semistable.
