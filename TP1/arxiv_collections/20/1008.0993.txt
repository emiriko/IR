Kinetic Alfven wave turbulence in solar wind is considered and it is shown
that non-Maxwellian electron distribution function has a significant effect on
the dynamics of the solar wind plasmas. Linear Landau damping leads to the
formation of a plateau in the parallel electron distribution function which
diminishes the Landau damping rate significantly. Nonlinear scattering of waves
by plasma particles is generalized to short wavelengths and it is found that
for the solar wind parameters this scattering is the dominant process as
compared to three wave decay and coalescence in the wave vector range .
Incorporation of these effects lead to the steepening of the wave spectrum
between the inertial and the dissipation ranges with a spectral index between 2
and 3. This region can be labeled as the scattering range. Such steepening has
been observed in the solar wind plasmas.
