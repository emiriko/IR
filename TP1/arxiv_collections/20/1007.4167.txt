I show that there is a significant lacuna in the proof of the theorem known
as "Topological Censorship" (a theorem forbidding a solution of Einstein's
equations to have some topological features, such as traversable wormholes,
without violating the averaged null energy condition). To fill the lacuna one
would probably have to revise the class of spacetimes for which the theorem is
formulated.
