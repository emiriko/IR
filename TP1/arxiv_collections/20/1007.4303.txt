Software visualization can be of great use for understanding and exploring a
software system in an intuitive manner. Spatial representation of software is a
promising approach of increasing interest. However, little is known about how
developers interact with spatial visualizations that are embedded in the IDE.
In this paper, we present a pilot study that explores the use of Software
Cartography for program comprehension of an unknown system. We investigated
whether developers establish a spatial memory of the system, whether clustering
by topic offers a sound base layout, and how developers interact with maps. We
report our results in the form of observations, hypotheses, and implications.
Key findings are a) that developers made good use of the map to inspect search
results and call graphs, and b) that developers found the base layout
surprising and often confusing. We conclude with concrete advice for the design
of embedded software maps.
