Density functionals for nuclei usually include an effective 3-body
interaction that depends on a fractional power of the density. Using insights
from the many-body theory of the low-density two-component Fermi gas, we
consider a new, nonlocal, form for the energy functional that is consistent
with the Fock space representation of interaction operators. In particular,
there is a unique spatially nonlocal generalization of the contact form of the
interaction that preserves the density-to-the-seven-thirds dependence required
by the many-body theory. We calculate the ground state energies for particles
in a harmonic trap using the nonlocal induced 3-body interaction, and compare
them to numerically accurate Green's Function Monte Carlo calculations. Using
no free parameters, we find that a nonlocality in the space domain provides a
better description of the weak-coupling regime than the local-density
approximation.
