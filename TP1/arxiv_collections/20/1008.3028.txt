CoRoT-3b is a 22 Jupiter-mass massive-planet/brown-dwarf object, orbiting an
F3-star with a period of 4.3 days. We analyzed the out-of-transit CoRoT-3
red-channel lightcurve obtained by the CoRoT mission and detected the
ellipsoidal modulation, with half the orbital period and amplitude of 59+/-9
ppm (parts per million) and the relativistic beaming effect, with the orbital
period and an amplitude of 27+/-9 ppm. Phases and amplitudes of both
modulations were consistent with our theoretical approximation.
