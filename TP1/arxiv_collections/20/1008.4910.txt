We determine the composition factors of a Jordan-H\"older series including
multiplicities of the locally analytic Steinberg representation. For this
purpose we prove the acyclicity of the evaluated locally analytic Tits complex
giving rise to the Steinberg representation. Further we describe some analogue
of the Jacquet functor applied to the irreducible principal series
representation constructed by Orlik and Strauch.
