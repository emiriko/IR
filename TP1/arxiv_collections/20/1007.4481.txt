A method to generate reactive trajectories, namely equilibrium trajectories
leaving a metastable state and ending in another one is proposed. The algorithm
is based on simulating in parallel many copies of the system, and selecting the
replicas which have reached the highest values along a chosen one-dimensional
reaction coordinate. This reaction coordinate does not need to precisely
describe all the metastabilities of the system for the method to give reliable
results. An extension of the algorithm to compute transition times from one
metastable state to another one is also presented. We demonstrate the interest
of the method on two simple cases: a one-dimensional two-well potential and a
two-dimensional potential exhibiting two channels to pass from one metastable
state to another one.
