The parameter $W_\mathrm{a}$, which characterizes nuclear spin-dependent
parity violation effects within the effective molecular spin-rotational
Hamiltonian, was computed for the electronic ground state of radium fluoride
(RaF) and found to be one of the largest absolute values predicted so far.
These calculations were performed with the complex generalised Hartree-Fock
method within a two-component (quasi-relativistic) zeroth-order regular
approximation framework. Peculiarities of the molecular electronic structure of
RaF lead to highly diagonal Franck-Condon matrices between vibrational states
of the electronic ground and first excited states, which renders the molecule
in principle suitable for direct laser cooling. As a trapped gas of cold
molecules offers a superior coherence time, RaF can be considered a promising
candidate for high-precision spectroscopic experiments aimed at the search of
molecular parity-violation effects.
