We study the symmetry of spin excitation spectra in 122-ferropnictide
superconductors by comparing the results of first-principles calculations with
inelastic neutron scattering (INS) measurements on BaFe1.85Co0.15As2 and
BaFe1.91Ni0.09As2 samples that exhibit neither static magnetic phases nor
structural phase transitions. In both the normal and superconducting (SC)
states, the spectrum lacks the 42/m screw symmetry around the (1/2 1/2 L) axis
that is implied by the I4/mmm space group. This is manifest both in the
in-plane anisotropy of the normal- and SC-state spin dynamics and in the
out-of-plane dispersion of the spin-resonance mode. We show that this effect
originates from the higher symmetry of the magnetic Fe sublattice with respect
to the crystal itself, hence the INS signal inherits the symmetry of the
unfolded Brillouin zone (BZ) of the Fe sublattice. The in-plane anisotropy is
temperature-independent and can be qualitatively reproduced in normal-state
density-functional-theory calculations without invoking a symmetry-broken
("nematic") ground state that was previously proposed as an explanation for
this effect. Below the SC transition, the energy of the magnetic resonant mode
Er, as well as its intensity and the SC spin gap inherit the normal-state
intensity modulation along the out-of-plane direction L with a period twice
larger than expected from the body-centered-tetragonal BZ symmetry. The
amplitude of this modulation decreases at higher doping, providing an analogy
to the splitting between even and odd resonant modes in bilayer cuprates.
Combining our and previous data, we show that at odd L a universal linear
relationship Er=4.3*kB*Tc holds for all studied Fe-based superconductors,
independent of their carrier type. Its validity down to the lowest doping
levels is consistent with weaker electron correlations in ferropnictides as
compared to the underdoped cuprates.
