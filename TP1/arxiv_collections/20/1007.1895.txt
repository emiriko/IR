We report on the fast relaxation behavior of a high-density magnon gas
created by a parametric amplification process. The magnon gas is probed using
the technique of spin-wave packet recovery by parallel parametric pumping.
Experimental results show a damping behavior which is in disagreement with both
the standard model of exponential decay and with earlier observations of
non-linear damping. In particular, the inherent magnon damping is found to
depend upon the presence of the parametric pumping field. A phenomenological
model which accounts for the dephasing of the earlier injected magnons is in
good agreement with the experimental data.
