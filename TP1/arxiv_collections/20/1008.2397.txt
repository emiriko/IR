Since the discovery of the first double neutron star (DNS) system in 1975 by
Hulse and Taylor, there are currently 8 confirmed DNS in our galaxy. For every
system, the masses of both neutron stars, the orbital semi- major axis and
eccentricity are measured, and proper motion is known for half of the systems.
Using the orbital parameters and kinematic information, if available, as
constraints for all system, we investigate the immediate progenitor mass of the
second-born neutron star and the magnitude of the supernova kick it received at
birth, with the primary goal to understand the core collapse mechanism leading
to neutron star formation. Compared to earlier studies, we use a novel method
to address the uncertainty related to the unknown radial velocity of the
observed systems. For PSR B1534+12 and PSR B1913+16, the kick magnitudes are
150 - 270 km/s and 190 - 450 km/s (with 95% confidence) respectively, and the
progenitor masses of the 2nd born neutron stars are 1.3 - 3.4 Msun and 1.4 -
5.0 Msun (95%), respectively. These suggest that the 2nd born neutron star was
formed by an iron core collapse supernova in both systems. For PSR J0737-3039,
on the other hand, the kick magnitude is only 5 - 120 km/s (95%), and the
progenitor mass of the 2nd born neutron star is 1.3 - 1.9 Msun (95%). Because
of the relatively low progenitor mass and kick magnitude, the formation of the
2nd born neutron star in PSR J0737-3039 is potentially connected to an electron
capture supernova of a massive O - Ne - Mg white dwarf. For the remaining 5
Galactic DNS, the kick magnitude ranges from several tens to several hundreds
of km/s, and the progenitor mass of the 2nd formed neutron star can be as low
as ~1.5 Msun, or as high as ~8 Msun. Therefore in these systems, it is not
clear which type of supernova is more likely to form the 2nd neutron star.
