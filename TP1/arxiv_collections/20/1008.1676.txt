Proton and neutron densities from Skyrme-Hartree-Fock (SHF) calculations are
used to generate non-local (g-folding) proton-nucleus optical potentials. They
are formed by folding the densities with realistic nucleon-nucleon
interactions. The potentials are then used to calculate differential cross
sections and spin observables for proton scattering. Good agreement with data
has been found, supporting those found previously when using SHF charge
densities in analyses of electron scattering data. That agreement was improved
by use of (shell model) occupation numbers to constrain the HF iterations.
That, in part, is also the case with analyses of proton scattering data. The
g-folding method is extended to exotic nuclei by including data for
neutron-rich sd-shell nuclei from the inverse kinematics of scattering from
hydrogen.
