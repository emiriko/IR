Motivated by recent best case analyses for some sorting algorithms and based
on the type of complexity we partition the algorithms into two classes:
homogeneous and non homogeneous algorithms. Although both classes contain
algorithms with worst and best cases, homogeneous algorithms behave uniformly
on all instances. This partition clarifies in a completely mathematical way the
previously mentioned terms and reveals that in classifying an algorithm as
homogeneous or not best case analysis is equally important with worst case
analysis.
