Cross-sections for Rutherford scattering, Coulomb bremsstrahlung and pair
creation, have been calculated at very high magnetic fields in order to
investigate the photo-production of protons at the polar caps of pulsars whose
spin is antiparallel with the polar magnetic flux density. The
Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal effect at very high magnetic fields is included in a
simple electron Green function.
