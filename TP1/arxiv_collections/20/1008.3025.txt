The general-relativistic Ohm's law for a two-component plasma which includes
the gravitomagnetic force terms even in the case of quasi-neutrality has been
derived. The equations that describe the electromagnetic processes in a plasma
surrounding a neutron star are obtained by using the general relativistic form
of Maxwell equations in a geometry of slow rotating gravitational object. In
addition to the general-relativistic effect first discussed by Khanna \&
Camenzind (1996) we predict a mechanism of the generation of azimuthal current
under the general relativistic effect of dragging of inertial frames on radial
current in a plasma around neutron star. The azimuthal current being
proportional to the angular velocity $\omega$ of the dragging of inertial
frames can give valuable contribution on the evolution of the stellar magnetic
field if $\omega$ exceeds $2.7\times 10^{17} (n/\sigma) \textrm{s}^{-1}$ ($n$
is the number density of the charged particles, $\sigma$ is the conductivity of
plasma). Thus in general relativity a rotating neutron star, embedded in
plasma, can in principle generate axial-symmetric magnetic fields even in
axisymmetry. However, classical Cowling's antidynamo theorem, according to
which a stationary axial-symmetric magnetic field can not be sustained against
ohmic diffusion, has to be hold in the general-relativistic case for the
typical plasma being responsible for the rotating neutron star.
