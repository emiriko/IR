For a given l-adic sheaf F on a commutative algebraic group over a finite
field k and an integer r we define the r-th local norm L-function of F at a
point t in G(k) and prove its rationality. This function gives information on
the sum of the local Frobenius traces of F over the points of G(k_r) (where k_r
is the extension of degree r of k) with norm t. For G the one-dimensional
affine line or the torus, these sums can in turn be used to estimate the number
of rational points on curves or the absolute value of exponential sums which
are invariant under a large group of translations or homotheties.
