Any decomposition of the total trajectory entropy production for Markovian
systems has a joint probability distribution satisfying a generalized detailed
fluctuation theorem, when all the contributing terms are odd with respect to
time reversal. The expression of the result does not bring into play dual
probability distributions, hence easing potential applications. We show that
several fluctuation theorems for perturbed non-equilibrium steady states are
unified and arise as particular cases of this general result. In particular, we
show that the joint probability distribution of the system and reservoir
trajectory entropies satisfy a detailed fluctuation theorem valid for all times
although each contribution does not do it separately.
