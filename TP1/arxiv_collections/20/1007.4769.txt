Context: Multiwavelength observations of gamma-ray burst prompt and afterglow
emission are a key tool to disentangle the various possible emission processes
and scenarios proposed to interpret the complex gamma-ray burst phenomenology.
Aims: We collected a large dataset on GRB060908 in order to carry out a
comprehensive analysis of the prompt emission as well as the early and late
afterglow. Methods: Data from Swift-BAT, -XRT and -UVOT together with data from
a number of different ground-based optical/NIR and millimeter telescopes
allowed us to follow the afterglow evolution from about a minute from the
high-energy event down to the host galaxy limit. We discuss the physical
parameters required to model these emissions. Results: The prompt emission of
GRB060908 was characterized by two main periods of activity, spaced by a few
seconds of low intensity, with a tight correlation between activity and
spectral hardness. Observations of the afterglow began less than one minute
after the high-energy event, when it was already in a decaying phase, and it
was characterized by a rather flat optical/NIR spectrum which can be
interpreted as due to a hard energy-distribution of the emitting electrons. On
the other hand, the X-ray spectrum of the afterglow could be fit by a rather
soft electron distribution. Conclusions: GRB060908 is a good example of a
gamma-ray burst with a rich multi-wavelength set of observations. The
availability of this dataset, built thanks to the joint efforts of many
different teams, allowed us to carry out stringent tests for various
interpretative scenarios showing that a satisfactorily modeling of this event
is challenging. In the future, similar efforts will enable us to obtain
optical/NIR coverage comparable in quality and quantity to the X-ray data for
more events, therefore opening new avenues to progress gamma-ray burst
research.
