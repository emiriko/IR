We present the discovery of nonradial pulsations in a hot subdwarf B star
based on 30.5 days of nearly continuous time-series photometry using the
\emph{Kepler} spacecraft. KIC 010139564 is found to be a short-period pulsator
of the V361 Hya (EC 14026) class with more than 10 independent pulsation modes
whose periods range from 130 to 190 seconds. It also shows one periodicity at a
period of 3165 seconds. If this periodicity is a high order g-mode, then this
star may be the hottest member of the hybrid DW Lyn stars. In addition to the
resolved pulsation frequencies, additional periodic variations in the light
curve suggest that a significant number of additional pulsation frequencies may
be present. The long duration of the run, the extremely high duty cycle, and
the well-behaved noise properties allow us to explore the stability of the
periodic variations, and to place strong constraints on how many of them are
independent stellar oscillation modes. We find that most of the identified
periodicities are indeed stable in phase and amplitude, suggesting a rotation
period of 2-3 weeks for this star, but further observations are needed to
confirm this suspicion.
