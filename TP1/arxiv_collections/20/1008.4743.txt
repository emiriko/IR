We study the high-energy limit of tree-level string production amplitudes
from decaying D-branes in bosonic string theory, interpreting the vertex
operators as external charges interacting with a Coulomb gas corresponding to
the rolling tachyon background, and performing an electrostatic analysis. In
particular, we consider two open string - one closed string amplitudes and four
open string amplitudes, and calculate explicit formulas for the leading
exponential behavior.
