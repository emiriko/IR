In this paper, we present the implementation of Bloch oscillations in an
atomic interferometer to increase the separation of the two interfering paths.
A numerical model, in very good agreement with the experiment, is developed.
The contrast of the interferometer and its sensitivity to phase fluctuations
and to intensity fluctuations are also calculated. We demonstrate that the
sensitivity to phase fluctuations can be significantly reduced by using a
suitable arrangement of Bloch oscillations pulses.
