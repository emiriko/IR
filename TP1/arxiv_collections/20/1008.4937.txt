Let $N \geq 2$ and let $1 < a_1 < ... < a_N$ be relatively prime integers.
The Frobenius number of this $N$-tuple is defined to be the largest positive
integer that has no representation as $\sum_{i=1}^N a_i x_i$ where
$x_1,...,x_N$ are non-negative integers. More generally, the $s$-Frobenius
number is defined to be the largest positive integer that has precisely $s$
distinct representations like this. We use techniques from the Geometry of
Numbers to give upper and lower bounds on the $s$-Frobenius number for any
nonnegative integer $s$.
