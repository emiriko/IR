We report on a systematic study of optical properties of (Ga,Mn)As epilayers
spanning the wide range of accessible substitutional Mn_Ga dopings. The growth
and post-growth annealing procedures were optimized for each nominal Mn doping
in order to obtain films which are as close as possible to uniform
uncompensated (Ga,Mn)As mixed crystals. We observe a broad maximum in the
mid-infrared absorption spectra whose position exhibits a prevailing blue-shift
for increasing Mn-doping. In the visible range, a peak in the magnetic circular
dichroism blue shifts with increasing Mn-doping. These observed trends confirm
that disorder-broadened valence band states provide a better one-particle
representation for the electronic structure of high-doped (Ga,Mn)As with
metallic conduction than an energy spectrum assuming the Fermi level pinned in
a narrow impurity band.
