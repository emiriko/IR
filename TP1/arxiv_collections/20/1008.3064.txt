We have performed new neutron diffuse scattering measurements in
Fe$_{1-x}$Cr$_x$ solid solutions, in a concentration range 0$<$x$<$0.15, where
the atomic distribution shows an inversion of the short range order. By
optimizing the signal-background ratio, we obtain an accurate determination of
the concentration of inversion x$_0$ =0.110(5). We determine the near neighbor
atomic short range order parameters and pair potentials, which change sign at
x$_0$. The experimental results are compared with previous first principle
calculations and atomistic simulations.
