Quantitative spectroscopy has been used to measure accurately the
Doppler-broadening of atomic transitions in $^{85}$Rb vapor. By using a
conventional platinum resistance thermometer and the Doppler thermometry
technique, we were able to determine $k_B$ with a relative uncertainty of
$4.1\times 10^{-4}$, and with a deviation of $2.7\times 10^{-4}$ from the
expected value. Our experiment, using an effusive vapour, departs significantly
from other Doppler-broadened thermometry (DBT) techniques, which rely on weakly
absorbing molecules in a diffusive regime. In these circumstances, very
different systematic effects such as magnetic sensitivity and optical pumping
are dominant. Using the model developed recently by Stace and Luiten, we
estimate the perturbation due to optical pumping of the measured $k_B$ value
was less than $4\times 10^{-6}$. The effects of optical pumping on atomic and
molecular DBT experiments is mapped over a wide range of beam size and
saturation intensity, indicating possible avenues for improvement. We also
compare the line-broadening mechanisms, windows of operation and detection
limits of some recent DBT experiments.
