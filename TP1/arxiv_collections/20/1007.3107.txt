An analytical expression for the transfer integral HAB between the localized
magnetic orbitals in superexchange-coupled dimers as a function of the type of
atoms and geometry of the molecule has been derived by explicitly including
orbital interactions. It is shown that HAB plays the key role for the magnetic
coupling constant J in understanding magneto-structural correlations. The
reliability and capability of this approach is confirmed by comparison with
numerical electronic structure calculations in the local spin-density
approximation on singly and doubly bridged Cu(II)-dimers with fluorine ligands.
All results can be calculated and understood within the analytical formalism
representing, therefore, a powerful tool for understanding the
magneto-structural correlations and also for constructing magnetic orbitals
analytically.
