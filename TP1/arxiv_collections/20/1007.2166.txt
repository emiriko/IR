Quantum interference incorporating spatially asymmetric potential profiles is
realized experimentally to manipulate a magnetic domain wall (DW) into a single
multilayered wire whose spacer has a thickness gradient for generating
asymmetrical interlayer exchange coupling from side to side. We demonstrate
experimentally how to guide a DW in a micron-scale ferromagnetic wire without
reflection symmetry of the interlayer exchange coupling. This is the ratcheting
of a DW in a form of ratchet potential using quantum interference. The
experimental results can be described well by numerical simulations considering
spatially asymmetric potential profiles due to quantum interference.
