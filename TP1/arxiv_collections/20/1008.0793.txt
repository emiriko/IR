We consider coherent thermal conductance through multilayer photonic crystal
heterostructures, consisting of a series of cascaded non-identical photonic
crystals. We show that thermal conductance can be suppressed exponentially with
the number of cascaded crystals, due to the mismatch between photonic bands of
all crystals in the heterostructure.
