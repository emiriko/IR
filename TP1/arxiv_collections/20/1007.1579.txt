This work presents some fundamental features of pyramidal site-controlled
InGaAs Quantum Dots (QDs) grown by MetalOrganic Vapour Phase Epitaxy on
patterned GaAs (111)B substrate. The dots self-form inside pyramidal recesses
patterned on the wafer via pre-growth processing. The major advantage of this
growth technique is the control it provides over the dot nucleation posi-tion
and the dimensions of the confined structures onto the sub-strate. The
fundamental steps of substrate patterning and the QD forma-tion mechanism are
described together with a discussion of the structural particulars. The
post-growth processes, including sur-face etching and substrate removal, which
are required to facili-tate optical characterization, are discussed. With this
approach extremely high uniformity and record spectral purity are both
achieved.
