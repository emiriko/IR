Reversible logic is emerging as an important research area having its
application in diverse fields such as low power CMOS design, digital signal
processing, cryptography, quantum computing and optical information processing.
This paper presents a new 4*4 universal reversible logic gate, IG. It is a
parity preserving reversible logic gate, that is, the parity of the inputs
matches the parity of the outputs. The proposed parity preserving reversible
gate can be used to synthesize any arbitrary Boolean function. It allows any
fault that affects no more than a single signal readily detectable at the
circuit's primary outputs. Finally, it is shown how a fault tolerant reversible
full adder circuit can be realized using only two IGs. It has also been
demonstrated that the proposed design offers less hardware complexity and is
efficient in terms of gate count, garbage outputs and constant inputs than the
existing counterparts.
