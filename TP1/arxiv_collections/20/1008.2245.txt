Motivated by experiments on doped transition metal oxides, this paper
considers the interplay of interactions, disorder, kinetic energy and
temperature in a simple system. An ensemble of two-site Anderson-Hubbard model
systems has already been shown to display a zero-bias anomaly which shares
features with that found in the two-dimensional Anderson-Hubbard model. Here
the temperature dependence of the density of states of this ensemble is
examined. In the atomic limit, there is no zero-bias anomaly at zero
temperature, but one develops at small nonzero temperatures. With hopping,
small temperatures augment the zero-temperature kinetic-energy-driven zero-bias
anomaly, while at larger temperatures the anomaly is filled in.
