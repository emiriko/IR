We study fountain codes transmitted over the binary-input symmetric-output
channel. For channels with small capacity, receivers needs to collects many
channel outputs to recover information bits. Since a collected channel output
yields a check node in the decoding Tanner graph, the channel with small
capacity leads to large decoding complexity. In this paper, we introduce a
novel fountain coding scheme with non-binary LDPC codes. The decoding
complexity of the proposed fountain code does not depend on the channel.
Numerical experiments show that the proposed codes exhibit better performance
than conventional fountain codes, especially for small number of information
bits.
