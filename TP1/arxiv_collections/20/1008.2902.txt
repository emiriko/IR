Orbital Kondo effect in a system of two single-level quantum dots attached to
external electron reservoirs is considered theoretically. The dots are coupled
via direct hoping term and Coulomb interaction. The Kondo temperature is
evaluated from the scaling approach and slave boson technique. The later method
is also used to calculate linear conductance of the system. Nonlinear
conductance, in turn, is calculated in terms of the nonequilibrium Green
function formalism.
