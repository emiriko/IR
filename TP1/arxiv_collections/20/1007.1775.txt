We consider the system of Maxwell-Stefan equations which describe
multicomponent diffusive fluxes in non-dilute solutions or gas mixtures. We
apply the Perron-Frobenius theorem to the irreducible and quasi-positive matrix
which governs the flux-force relations and are able to show normal ellipticity
of the associated multicomponent diffusion operator. This provides
local-in-time wellposedness of the Maxwell-Stefan multicomponent diffusion
system in the isobaric, isothermal case.
