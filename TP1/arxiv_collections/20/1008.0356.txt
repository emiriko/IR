We report on a study of the $nd$ and $n\,^3$He radiative captures at thermal
neutron energies, using wave functions obtained from either chiral or
conventional two- and three-nucleon realistic potentials with the
hyperspherical harmonics method, and electromagnetic currents derived in chiral
effective field theory up to one loop. The predicted $nd$ and $n\,^3$He cross
sections are in good agreement with data, but exhibit a significant dependence
on the input Hamiltonian. A comparison is also made between these and new
results for the $nd$ and $n\,^3$He cross sections obtained in the conventional
framework for both potentials and currents.
