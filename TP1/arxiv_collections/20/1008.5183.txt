We propose a possible mechanism of topological Hall effect in inhomogeneous
superconducting states. In our scenario, the Berry phase effect associated with
spatially modulated superconducting order parameter gives rise to a fictitious
Lorentz force acting on quasiparticles. In the case of the
Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov state, the topological Hall effect is detected
by applying an electromagnetic wave with a tuned wave number on a surface of
the system.
