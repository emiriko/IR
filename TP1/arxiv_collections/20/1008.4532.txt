In prediction with expert advice the goal is to design online prediction
algorithms that achieve small regret (additional loss on the whole data)
compared to a reference scheme. In the simplest such scheme one compares to the
loss of the best expert in hindsight. A more ambitious goal is to split the
data into segments and compare to the best expert on each segment. This is
appropriate if the nature of the data changes between segments. The standard
fixed-share algorithm is fast and achieves small regret compared to this
scheme.
  Fixed share treats the experts as black boxes: there are no assumptions about
how they generate their predictions. But if the experts are learning, the
following question arises: should the experts learn from all data or only from
data in their own segment? The original algorithm naturally addresses the first
case. Here we consider the second option, which is more appropriate exactly
when the nature of the data changes between segments. In general extending
fixed share to this second case will slow it down by a factor of T on T
outcomes. We show, however, that no such slowdown is necessary if the experts
are hidden Markov models.
