We compare some algebras appeared in the recent attempts to prove resolution
of singularities in positive characteristic. We also construct an algebra which
encodes the same information and it is equivalent, up to integral closure, to
the previous structures. In the case of characteristic zero one may use these
structures to obtain a resolution of singularities.
