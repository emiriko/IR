Regular families of coupled quantum networks are described such the unknown
state of a qubit can be perfectly routed from any node to any other node in a
time linear in the distance. Unlike previous constructions, the transfer can be
achieved perfectly on a network that is local on any specified number of
spatial dimensions. The ability to route the state, and the regularity of the
networks, vastly improve the utility of this scheme in comparison to perfect
state transfer schemes. The structures can also be used for entanglement
generation.
