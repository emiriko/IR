We report measurements of nonlinear magneto-optical rotation (NMOR) for the
D2 line of $^{87}$Rb atoms in an antirelaxation-coated vapor cell in the
presence of a radio-frequency (rf) field. The experimental NMOR signals as a
function of rf field frequency for various rf field powers are compared to a
theoretical model based on the density-matrix formalism. The comparison between
experiment and theory enables understanding of the ground-state atomic spin
polarization dynamics, illustrated using plots of the probability distribution
of the atomic angular momentum.
