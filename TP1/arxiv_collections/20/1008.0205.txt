Smectite clays are hydrated layer silicates that, like micas, occur naturally
in abundance. Importantly, they have readily modifiable interlayer spaces that
provide excellent sites for nanochemistry. Vermiculite is one such smectite
clay and in the presence of small chain-length alkyl-NH3Cl ions, forms
sensitive, 1-D ordered model clay systems with expandable nano-pore inter-layer
regions. These inter-layers readily adsorb organic molecules. N-propyl NH3Cl
vermiculite clay gels were used to determine the adsorption of alanine, lysine
and histidine by chiral HPLC. The results show that during reaction with fresh
vermiculite interlayers, significant chiral enrichment of either L- and
D-enantiomers occurs depending on the amino acid. Chiral enrichment of the
supernatant solutions is up to about 1% per pass. In contrast, addition to clay
interlayers already reacted with amino acid solutions resulted in little or no
change in D/L ratio during the time of the experiment. Adsorption of small
amounts of amphiphilic organic molecules in clay inter-layers is known to
produce Layer-by-Layer or Langmuir-Blodgett films. Moreover atomistic
simulations show that self-organization of organic species in clay interlayers
is important. These non-centrosymmetric, chirally active nanofilms may cause
clays to act subsequently as chiral amplifiers, concentrating organic material
from dilute solution and having different adsorption energetics for D- and
L-enantiomers. The additional role of clays in RNA oligimerization already
postulated by Ferris and others, together with the need for the organization of
amphiphilic molecules and lipids noted by Szostak and others, suggests that
such chiral separation by clays in lagoonal environments at normal biological
temperatures might also have played a significant role in the origin of
biochirality.
