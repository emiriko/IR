I briefly review recent observations of regions forming low mass stars. The
discussion is cast in the form of seven questions that have been partially
answered, or at least illuminated, by new data. These are the following: where
do stars form in molecular clouds; what determines the IMF; how long do the
steps of the process take; how efficient is star formation; do any theories
explain the data; how are the star and disk built over time; and what chemical
changes accompany star and planet formation. I close with a summary and list of
open questions.
