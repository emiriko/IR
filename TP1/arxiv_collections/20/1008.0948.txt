We study the influence of spin waves on transport through a single-level
quantum dot weakly coupled to ferromagnetic electrodes with noncollinear
magnetizations. Side peaks appear in the differential conductance due to
emission and absorption of spin waves. We, furthermore, investigate the
nonequilibrium magnon distributions generated in the source and drain lead. In
addition, we show how magnon-assisted tunneling can generate a fullly
spin-polarized current without an applied transport voltage. We discuss the
influence of spin waves on the current noise. Finally, we show how the magnonic
contributions to the exchange field can be detected in the finite-frequency
Fano factor.
