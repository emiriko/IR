This paper is concerned with a result of homogenization of an
integro-differential equation describing dislocation dynamics. Our model
involves both an anisotropic L\'{e}vy operator of order 1 and a potential
depending periodically on $u/\ep$. The limit equation is a non-local
Hamilton-Jacobi equation, which is an effective plastic law for densities of
dislocations moving in a single slip plane.
