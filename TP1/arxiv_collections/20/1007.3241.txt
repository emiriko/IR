Experimental measurements of magnetic fields generated in the cavity of a
self-injecting laser-wakefield accelerator are presented. Faraday rotation is
used to determine the existence of multi-megagauss fields, constrained to a
transverse dimension comparable to the plasma wavelength and several plasma
wavelengths longitudinally. The fields are generated rapidly and move with the
driving laser. In our experiment, the appearance of the magnetic fields is
correlated to the production of relativistic electrons, indicating that they
are inherently tied to the growth and wavebreaking of the nonlinear plasma
wave. This evolution is confirmed by numerical simulations, showing that these
measurements provide insight into the wakefield evolution with high spatial and
temporal resolution.
