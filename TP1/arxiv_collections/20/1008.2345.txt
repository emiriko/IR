This article describes a new family of cryptographically secure pseudorandom
number generators, based on coupled chaotic maps, that will serve as keystream
in a stream cipher. The maps are a modification of a piecewise linear map, by
dynamic changing of the coefficient values and perturbing its lesser
significant bits.
