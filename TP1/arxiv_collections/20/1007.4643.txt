We discuss the use of super-fermion formalism to represent and solve quantum
kinetic equations for the electron transport problem. Starting with the
Lindblad master equation for the molecule connected to two metal electrodes, we
convert the problem of finding the nonequilibrium steady state to the many-body
problem with non-Hermitian Liouvillian in super-Fock space. We transform the
Liouvillian to the normal ordered form, introduce nonequilibrium quasiparticles
by a set of canonical nonunitary transformations and develop general many-body
theory for the electron transport through the interacting region. The approach
is applied to the electron transport through a single level. We consider a
minimal basis hydrogen atom attached to two metal leads in Coulomb blockade
regime (out of equilibrium Anderson model) within the nonequilibrium
Hartree-Fock approximation as an example of the system with electron
interaction. Our approach agrees with exact results given by the Landauer
theory for the considered models.
