Template matching is one of the simplest methods used for eyes and mouth
detection. However, it can be modified and extended to become a powerful tool.
Since the patch itself plays a significant role in optimizing detection
performance, a study on the influence of patch size and shape is carried out.
The optimum patch size and shape is determined using the proposed method.
Usually, template matching is also combined with other methods in order to
improve detection accuracy. Thus, in this paper, the effectiveness of two image
processing methods i.e. grayscale and Haar wavelet transform, when used with
template matching are analyzed.
