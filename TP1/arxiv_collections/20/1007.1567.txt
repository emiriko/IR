Within the class of field theories with the field contents of the Skyrme
model, one submodel can be found which consists of the square of the baryon
current and a potential term only. For this submodel, a Bogomolny bound exists
and the static soliton solutions saturate this bound. Further, already on the
classical level, this BPS Skyrme model reproduces some features of the liquid
drop model of nuclei. Here, we investigate the model in more detail and,
besides, we perform the rigid rotor quantization of the simplest Skyrmion (the
nucleon). In addition, we discuss indications that the viability of the model
as a low energy effective field theory for QCD is further improved in the limit
of a large number of colors N_c.
