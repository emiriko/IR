Decay of Rabi oscillations of equivalent spins diluted in diamagnetic solid
matrix and coupled by magnetic dipole interactions is studied. It is shown that
these interactions result in random shifts of spin transient nutation
frequencies and thus lead to the decay of the transient signal. Averaging over
random spatial distribution of spins within the solid and over their spectral
positions within magnetic resonance line, we obtain analytical expressions for
the decay of Rabi oscillations. The rate of the decay in the case when the
half-width of magnetic resonance line exceeds Rabi frequency is found to depend
on the intensity of resonant microwave field and on the spin concentration. The
results are compared with the literature data for E1' centers in glassy silica
and [AlO4] centers in quartz.
