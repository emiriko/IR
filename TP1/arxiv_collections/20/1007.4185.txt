The Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS) is one of two focal-plane
instruments on the Chandra X-ray Observatory. During initial radiation-belt
passes, the exposed ACIS suffered significant radiation damage from trapped
soft protons scattering off the x-ray telescope's mirrors. The primary effect
of this damage was to increase the charge-transfer inefficiency (CTI) of the
ACIS 8 front-illuminated CCDs. Subsequently, the Chandra team implemented
procedures to remove the ACIS from the telescope's focus during high-radiation
events: planned protection during radiation-belt transits; autonomous
protection triggered by an on-board radiation monitor; and manual intervention
based upon assessment of space-weather conditions. However, as Chandra's
multilayer insulation ages, elevated temperatures have reduced the
effectiveness of the on-board radiation monitor for autonomous protection. Here
we investigate using the ACIS CCDs themselves as a radiation monitor. We
explore the 10-year database to evaluate the CCDs' response to particle
radiation and to compare this response with other radiation data and
environment models.
