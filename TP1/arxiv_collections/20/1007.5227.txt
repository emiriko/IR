We discuss how to extract information about the cosmological constant from
the Wheeler-DeWitt equation, considered as an eigenvalue of a Sturm-Liouville
problem in a generic spherically symmetric background. The equation is
approximated to one loop with the help of a variational approach with Gaussian
trial wave functionals. A canonical decomposition of modes is used to separate
transverse-traceless tensors (graviton) from ghosts and scalar. We show that no
ghosts appear in the final evaluation of the cosmological constant. A zeta
function regularization and a ultra violet cutoff are used to handle with
divergences. A renormalization procedure is introduced to remove the
infinities. We compare the result with the one obtained in the context of
noncommutative geometries
