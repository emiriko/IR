The CP violating asymmetry from the decay rates $H^\pm\to W^\pm h_1$ of
charged Higgs bosons into the lightest neutral Higgs boson and a $W^\pm$ boson
is calculated and discussed in the complex MSSM. The contributions from all
complex phases are considered, especially from the top-squark trilinear
coupling, which induces a large contribution to the CP asymmetry.
