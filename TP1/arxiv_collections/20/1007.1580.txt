We examine a sample of 65 galaxies in the Virgo cluster with negative radial
velocities relative to the Local Group. Some features of this sample are
pointed out. All of these objects are positioned compactly within a virial zone
of radius 6{\deg} in the cluster, but their centroid is displaced relative to
the dynamic center of the cluster, M87, by 1.1{\deg} to the northwest. The
dwarf galaxies in this sample are clumped on a scale of ~10' (50 kpc). The
observed asymmetry in the distribution of the blueshifted galaxies may be
caused by infall of a group of galaxies around M86 onto the main body of the
cluster. We offer another attempt to explain this phenomenon, assuming a mutual
tangential velocity of ~300 km/s between the Local Group and the Virgo cluster
owing to their being repelled from the local cosmological void.
