Cool-core clusters are characterized by strong surface brightness peaks in
the X-ray emission from the Intra Cluster Medium (ICM). This phenomenon is
associated with complex physics in the ICM and has been a subject of intense
debate and investigation in recent years. In order to quantify the evolution in
the cool-core cluster population, we robustly measure the cool-core strength in
a local, representative cluster sample, and in the largest sample of
high-redshift clusters available to date. We use high-resolution Chandra data
of three representative cluster samples spanning different redshift ranges: (i)
the local sample from the 400 SD survey with median z = 0.08, (ii) the high
redshift sample from the 400 SD Survey with median z=0.59, and (iii) 15
clusters drawn from the RDCS and the WARPS, with median z = 0.83. Our analysis
is based on the measurement of the surface brightness concentration, c_SB,
which allows us to characterize the cool-core strength in low signal-to-noise
data. We also obtain gas density profiles to derive cluster central cooling
times and entropy. In addition to the X-ray analysis, we search for radio
counterparts associated with the cluster cores. We find a statistically
significant difference in the c_SB distributions of the two high-z samples,
pointing towards a lack of concentrated clusters in the 400 SD high-z sample.
Taking this into account, we confirm a negative evolution in the fraction of
cool-core clusters with redshift, in particular for very strong cool-cores.
This result is validated by the central entropy and central cooling time, which
show strong anti-correlations with c_SB. However, the amount of evolution is
significantly smaller than previously claimed, leaving room for a large
population of well formed cool-cores at z~1.
