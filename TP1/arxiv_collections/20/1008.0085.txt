The dynamics of the survival probability of quantum walkers on a
one-dimensional lattice with random distribution of absorbing immobile traps
are investigated. The survival probability of quantum walkers is compared with
that of classical walkers. It is shown that the time dependence of survival
probability of quantum walkers has a piecewise stretched exponential character
depending on the density of traps in numerical and analytical observations. The
crossover between the quantum analogs of the Rosenstock and Donsker-Varadhan
behaviors is identified.
