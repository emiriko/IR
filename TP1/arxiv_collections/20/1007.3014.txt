This paper concerns self-similar tilings in dimension 2. We consider the
number of occurrences of a given tile in any domain bounded by a Jordan curve.
For a large class of self-similar tilings, including most known examples, we
give estimates of the oscillation of this number of occurrences around its
average frequency times the total number of tiles in the domain, which depend
only on the Jordan curve.
