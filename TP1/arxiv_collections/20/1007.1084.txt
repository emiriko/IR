Fractional calculus and q-deformed Lie algebras are closely related. Both
concepts expand the scope of standard Lie algebras to describe generalized
symmetries. A new class of fractional q-deformed Lie algebras is proposed,
which for the first time allows a smooth transition between different Lie
algebras. For the fractional harmonic oscillator, the corresponding fractional
q-number is derived. It is shown, that the resulting energy spectrum is an
appropriate tool to describe e.g. the ground state spectra of even-even nuclei.
In addition, the equivalence of rotational and vibrational spectra for
fractional q-deformed Lie algebras is shown and the $B_\alpha(E2)$ values for
the fractional q-deformed symmetric rotor are calculated. A first
interpretation of half integer representations of the fractional rotation group
is given in terms of a description of $K=1/2^-$ band spectra of odd-even
nuclei.
