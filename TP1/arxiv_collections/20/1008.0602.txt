We consider theoretical limits of partial secrecy in a setting where an
eavesdropper attempts to causally reconstruct an information sequence with low
distortion based on an intercepted transmission and the past of the sequence.
The transmitter and receiver have limited secret key at their disposal but not
enough to establish perfect secrecy with a one-time pad. From another
viewpoint, the eavesdropper is acting as an adversary, competing in a zero-sum
repeated game against the sender and receiver of the secrecy system. In this
case, the information sequence represents a sequence of actions, and the
distortion function captures the payoff of the game.
  We give an information theoretic region expressing the tradeoff between
secret key rate and max-min distortion for the eavesdropper. We also simplify
this characterization to a linear program. As an example, we discuss how to
optimally use secret key to hide Bernoulli-p bits from an eavesdropper so that
they incur maximal Hamming distortion.
