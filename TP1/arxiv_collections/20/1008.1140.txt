In 1973, Arimoto proved the strong converse theorem for the discrete
memoryless channels stating that when transmission rate $R$ is above channel
capacity $C$, the error probability of decoding goes to one as the block length
$n$ of code word tends to infinity. He proved the theorem by deriving the
exponent function of error probability of correct decoding that is positive if
and only if $R>C$. Subsequently, in 1979, Dueck and K\"orner determined the
optimal exponent of correct decoding. Arimoto's bound has been said to be equal
to the bound of Dueck and K\"orner. However its rigorous proof has not been
presented so far. In this paper we give a rigorous proof of the equivalence of
Arimoto's bound to that of Dueck and K\"orner.
