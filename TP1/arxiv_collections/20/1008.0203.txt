New data for X(3872) production in B decays provide a separation between X
production and decay, sharpen several experimental puzzles and impose serious
constraints on all models. Both charged and neutral B decays produce a narrow
neutral resonant state that decays to both J/\psi \rho and J/\psi \omega, while
no charged resonances in the same multiplet are found. This suggests that the X
is an isoscalar resonance whose production conserves isospin, while isospin is
violated only in the decay by an electromagnetic interaction allowing the
isospin-forbidden J/\psi \rho decay. A tetraquark isoscalar X model is proposed
which agrees with all present data, conserves isospin in its production and
breaks isospin only in an electromagnetic X(3872) --> J/\psi \rho^o decay. The
narrow X decay width results from the tiny phase space available for the J/\psi
\omega decay and enables competition with the electromagnetic isospin-forbidden
J/\psi \rho decay which has much larger phase space. Experimental tests are
proposed for this isospin production invariance.
