We provide a library to facilitate the implementation of new models in codes
such as matrix element and event generators or codes for computing dark matter
observables. The library contains a SLHA reader routine as well as
diagonalisation routines. This library is available in CalcHEP and micrOMEGAs.
The implementation of models based on this library is supported by LanHEP and
FeynRules.
