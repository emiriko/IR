A theoretical and experimental investigation is presented on the intermodal
coupling between the flexural vibration modes of a single clamped-clamped beam.
Nonlinear coupling allows an arbitrary flexural mode to be used as a
self-detector for the amplitude of another mode, presenting a method to measure
the energy stored in a specific resonance mode. Experimentally observed complex
nonlinear dynamics of the coupled modes are quantitatively captured by a model
which couples the modes via the beam extension; the same mechanism is
responsible for the well-known Duffing nonlinearity in clamped-clamped beams.
