In this paper the variant supercurrents based on consistency and completion
in off-shell N=1 supergravity are studied. We formulate the embedding relations
for supersymmetric current and energy tensor into supercurrent multiplet.
Corresponding linearized supergravity is obtained with appropriate choice of
Wess-Zumino gauge in each gravity supermultiplet.
