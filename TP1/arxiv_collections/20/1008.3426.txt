We present new radial velocities from AAOmega on the Anglo-Australian
Telescope for 307 galaxies (b_J < 19.5) in the region of the rich cluster Abell
1386. Consistent with other studies of galaxy clusters that constitute
sub-units of superstructures, we find that the velocity distribution of A1386
is very broad (21,000--42,000 kms^-1, or z=0.08--0.14) and complex. The mean
redshift of the cluster that Abell designated as number 1386 is found to be
~0.104. However, we find that it consists of various superpositions of
line-of-sight components. We investigate the reality of each component by
testing for substructure and searching for giant elliptical galaxies in each
and show that A1386 is made up of at least four significant clusters or groups
along the line of sight whose global parameters we detail. Peculiar velocities
of brightest galaxies for each of the groups are computed and found to be
different from previous works, largely due to the complexity of the sky area
and the depth of analysis performed in the present work. We also analyse A1386
in the context of its parent superclusters: Leo A, and especially the Sloan
Great Wall. Although the new clusters may be moving toward mass concentrations
in the Sloan Great Wall or beyond, many are most likely not yet physically
bound to it.
