We consider the relations between the gauge couplings at the electroweak
scale and the high scale where unification of the three gauge couplings is
expected. Threshold corrections are incorporated both at the supersymmetric and
at the grand unified scale and, where available three-loop running and two-loop
decoupling are employed. We study the impact of the current experimental
uncertainties of the coupling constants and the supersymmetric mass spectrum on
the prediction of the super-heavy masses within the so-called minimal
supersymmetric SU(5). As a main result of the three-loop analysis we confirm
that minimal supersymmetric SU(5) cannot be ruled out by the current
experimental data on proton decay rates.
