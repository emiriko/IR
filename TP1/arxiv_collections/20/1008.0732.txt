The definition and computation of the topological susceptibility in
non-abelian gauge theories is complicated by the presence of non-integrable
short-distance singularities. Recently, alternative representations of the
susceptibility were discovered, which are singularity-free and do not require
renormalization. Such an expression is here studied quantitatively, using the
lattice formulation of the SU(3) gauge theory and numerical simulations. The
results confirm the expected scaling of the susceptibility with respect to the
lattice spacing and they also agree, within errors, with computations of the
susceptibility based on the use of a chiral lattice Dirac operator.
