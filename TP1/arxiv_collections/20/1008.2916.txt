We consider a quasi-one-dimensional two-component systm, described by a pair
of Nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger/Gross-Pitaevskii Equations (NLSEs/GPEs), which are
coupled by the linear mixing, with local strength $\Omega $, and by the
nonlinear incoherent interaction. We assume the self-repulsive nonlinearity in
both components, and include effects of a harmonic trapping potential. The
model may be realized in terms of periodically modulated slab waveguides in
nonlinear optics, and in Bose-Einstein condensates too. Depending on the
strengths of the linear and nonlinear couplings between the components, the
ground states (GSs) in such binary systems may be symmetric or asymmetric. In
this work, we introduce a periodic spatial modulation of the linear coupling,
making $\Omega $ an odd, or even function of the coordinate. The sign flips of
$\Omega (x)$ strongly modify the structure of the GS in the binary system, as
the relative sign of its components tends to lock to the local sign of $\Omega
$. Using a systematic numerical analysis, and an analytical approximation, we
demonstrate that the GS of the trapped system contains one or several kinks
(dark solitons) in one component, while the other component does not change its
sign. Final results are presented in the form of maps showing the number of
kinks in the GS as a function of the system's parameters, with the odd/even
modulation function giving rise to the odd/even number of the kinks. The
modulation of $\Omega (x)$ also produces a strong effect on the transition
between states with nearly equal and strongly unequal amplitudes of the two
components.
