We present an analysis of a partially directed walk model of a polymer which
at one end is tethered to a sticky surface and at the other end is subjected to
a pulling force at fixed angle away from the point of tethering. Using the
kernel method, we derive the full generating function for this model in two and
three dimensions and obtain the respective phase diagrams.
  We observe adsorbed and desorbed phases with a thermodynamic phase transition
in between. In the absence of a pulling force this model has a second-order
thermal desorption transition which merely gets shifted by the presence of a
lateral pulling force. On the other hand, if the pulling force contains a
non-zero vertical component this transition becomes first-order.
  Strikingly, we find that if the angle between the pulling force and the
surface is beneath a critical value, a sufficiently strong force will induce
polymer adsorption, no matter how large the temperature of the system.
  Our findings are similar in two and three dimensions, an additional feature
in three dimensions being the occurrence of a reentrance transition at constant
pulling force for small temperature, which has been observed previously for
this model in the presence of pure vertical pulling. Interestingly, the
reentrance phenomenon vanishes under certain pulling angles, with details
depending on how the three-dimensional polymer is modeled.
