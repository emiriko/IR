Rest-frame UV emission lines offer the possibility to directly image the gas
around high-redshift galaxies with upcoming optical instruments. We use a suite
of large, hydrodynamical simulations to predict the nature and detectability of
emission lines from the intergalactic medium at 2<z<5. The brightest emission
comes from HI Ly-alpha and the strongest metal line, CIII, is about an order of
magnitude fainter, although HI Ly-alpha may be fainter if the gas is
self-shielded to the UV background or if dust is important. The highest surface
brightness regions for CIV, SiIII, SiIV and OVI are fainter than CIII by
factors of a few. The NV and NeVIII lines, as well as HeII H-alpha, are
substantially weaker but their maximum surface brightnesses still exceed 100
photon/cm^2/s/sr at z=2 (for 2" pixels). Lower ionisation lines arise in denser
and colder gas that produces clumpier emission. The brightest HI Ly-alpha
emission arises in highly overdense gas, but the highest surface brightness
emission from high-ionisation metal lines traces a wider range of
overdensities. Bright metal-line emission traces gas with temperatures close to
the peak of the corresponding emissivity curve. While HI Ly-alpha, HeII
H-alpha, CIII, SiIII, and SiIV are excellent probes of cold accretion flows and
the colder parts of outflows, CIV, NV, OVI, and NeVIII are powerful tracers of
the diffuse WHIM and galactic winds. A comparison of results from simulations
with varying physical prescriptions demonstrates that the predictions for the
brighter metal-line emission are robust to within factors of a few. Several
emission lines from the high-redshift IGM will become detectable in the near
future, possibly starting with the Cosmic Web Imager on Palomar. MUSE and the
Keck Cosmic Web Imager have the potential to revolutionise studies of the
interactions between high-redshift galaxies and their environment. (Abridged)
