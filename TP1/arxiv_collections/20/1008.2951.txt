We present a sum-rule extraction of the decay constants of the D, Ds, B, and
Bs mesons from the two-point correlator of heavy-light pseudoscalar currents
[1]. Our main emphasis is laid on the control over the uncertainties in the
decay constants, related both to the input QCD parameters and to the limited
accuracy of the method of sum rules. Gaining this control has become possible
due to the application of our novel procedure for extracting hadron observables
based on a dual threshold depending on the Borel parameter. For charmed mesons,
we obtain f_D=206.2\pm 7.3 (OPE)\pm 5.1 (syst) MeV and f_Ds=245.3\pm 15.7 (OPE)
\pm 4.5 (syst) MeV. For beauty mesons, the decay constants turn out to be
extremely sensitive to the precise value of the MSbar mass of the b-quark,
mb(mb). By requiring our sum-rule estimate to match the average of lattice
determinations of f_B, a very accurate value is extracted, mb(mb)=4.245\pm
0.025 GeV, yielding f_B = 193.4 \pm 12.3 (OPE) \pm 4.3 (syst) MeV and f_Bs =
232.5 \pm 18.6 (OPE) \pm 2.4 (syst) MeV.
