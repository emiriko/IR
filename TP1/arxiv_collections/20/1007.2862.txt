Differential growth processes play a prominent role in shaping leaves and
biological tissues. Using both analytical and numerical calculations, we
consider the shapes of closed, elastic strips which have been subjected to an
inhomogeneous pattern of swelling. The stretching and bending energies of a
closed strip are frustrated by compatibility constraints between the curvatures
and metric of the strip. To analyze this frustration, we study the class of
"conical" closed strips with a prescribed metric tensor on their center line.
The resulting strip shapes can be classified according to their number of
wrinkles and the prescribed pattern of swelling. We use this class of strips as
a variational ansatz to obtain the minimal energy shapes of closed strips and
find excellent agreement with the results of a numerical bead-spring model.
Within this class of strips, we derive a condition under which a strip can have
vanishing mean curvature along the center line.
