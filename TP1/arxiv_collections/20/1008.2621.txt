We study a single two-level atom interacting with a reservoir of modes
defined by its reservoir structure function. Within this framework we are able
to define a density of entanglement involving a continuum of reservoir modes.
The density of entanglement is derived for a system with a single excitation by
taking a limit of the global entanglement. Utilizing the density of
entanglement we quantify the entanglement between the atom and the modes, and
also between the reservoir modes themselves.
