The electronic and transport properties of an extended linear defect embedded
in a zigzag nanoribbon of realistic width are studied, within a tight binding
model approach. Our results suggest that such defect profoundly modify the
properties of the nanoribbon, introducing new conductance quantization values
and modifying the conductance quantization thresholds. The linear defect along
the nanoribbon behaves as an effective third edge of the system, which shows a
metallic behavior, giving rise to new conduction pathways that could be used in
nanoscale circuitry as a quantum wire.
