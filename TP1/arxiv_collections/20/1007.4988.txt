We study the influence of spin polarization on the degree of coherence of
electron transport through interacting quantum dots. To this end, we identify
transport regimes in which the degree of coherence can be related to the
visibility of the Aharonov-Bohm oscillations in the current through a
quantum-dot Aharonov-Bohm interferometer with one normal and one ferromagnetic
lead. For these regimes, we calculate the visibility and, thus, the degree of
coherence, as a function of the degree of spin polarization of the
ferromagnetic lead.
