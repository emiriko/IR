Fermi LAT (Large Area Telescope) and GBM (Gamma ray Burst Monitor)
observations of GRBs are briefly reviewed, keeping in mind EGRET expectations.
Using gamma\gamma constraints on outflow Lorentz factors, leptonic models are
pitted against hadronic models, and found to be energetically favored.
Interpretation of the Fermi data on GRBs helps establish whether GRBs
accelerate cosmic rays, including those reaching $\approx 10^{20}$ eV.
