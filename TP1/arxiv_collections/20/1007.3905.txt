In this work, we introduce matrix-valued diffusion processes which describe
the non-equilibrium situation of the matrix models for the beta-Hermite and the
beta-Laguerre ensembles. We also study the corresponding spectral measure
process and empirical/singular value process with regard to their limit laws.
