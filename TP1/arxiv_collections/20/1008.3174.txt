Conventional doping methods that directly add C or a C-bearing species to
Mg+B powder have the disadvantage of adding C inhomogeneously, yielding either
under-reacted regions or blocking phases. Pre-doped B powder provides a more
homogeneous distribution of the C dopant in MgB2. Powders containing varying
amounts of C were used to produce in-situ MgB2 strands which showed high values
of transport Jc (104 A/cm2 at 13.3T). Compared to SiC-added and malic
acid-treated strands the pre-doped MgB2 showed both higher values of Birr and
transport Jc, indicating that the pre-doping of B leads to more efficient C
substitution into the B-sublattice.
