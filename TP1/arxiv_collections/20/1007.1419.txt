On the basis of the perturbation theory in the fine structure constant
$\alpha$ and the ratio of the electron to muon masses we calculate one-loop
vacuum polarization and electron vertex corrections and the nuclear structure
corrections to the hyperfine splitting of the ground state of muonic helium
atom $(\mu\ e \ ^3_2He)$. We obtain total result for the ground state hyperfine
splitting $\Delta \nu^{hfs}=4166.471$ MHz which improves the previous
calculation of Lakdawala and Mohr due to the account of new corrections of
orders $\alpha^5$ and $\alpha^6$. The remaining difference between our
theoretical result and experimental value of the hyperfine splitting lies in
the range of theoretical and experimental errors and requires the subsequent
investigation of higher order corrections.
