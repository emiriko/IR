We obtain an intertwining relation between some Riemann-Liouville operators
of order a in (1,2) connecting through a certain multiplicative identity in law
the one-dimensional marginals of reflected completely asymmetric a-stable
L\'evy processes. An alternative approach based on recurrent extensions of
positive self-similar Markov processes and exponential functionals of L\'evy
processes is also discussed.
