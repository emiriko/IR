We calculate the scattering lengths of Nambu-Goldstone bosons interacting
with $D$ mesons in a covariant formulation of chiral perturbation theory, which
satisfies heavy-quark spin symmetry and analytical properties of loop
amplitudes. We compare our results with previous studies performed using heavy
meson chiral perturbation theory and show that recoil corrections are sizable
in most cases.
