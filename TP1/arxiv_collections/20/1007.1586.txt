EAGLE is a Phase A study of a multi-IFU, near-IR spectrometer for the
European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT). The design employs wide-field
adaptive optics to deliver excellent image quality across a large (38.5 arcmin
sq.) field. When combined with the light grasp of the E-ELT, EAGLE will be a
unique and efficient facility for spatially-resolved, spectroscopic surveys of
high-redshift galaxies and resolved stellar populations. Following a brief
overview of the science case, here we summarise the functional and performance
requirements that flow-down from it, provide illustrative performances from
simulated observations, and highlight the strong synergies with the James Webb
Space Telescope (JWST) and the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA).
