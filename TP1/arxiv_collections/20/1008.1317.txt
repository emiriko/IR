We introduce an analytical approximation scheme to diagonalize parabolically
confined two dimensional electron systems with both the Rashba and Dresselhaus
spin-orbit interactions. The starting point of our perturbative expansion is a
zeroth-order Hamiltonian for an electron confined in a quantum wire with an
effective spin-orbit induced magnetic field along the wire, obtained by
properly rotating the usual spin-orbit Hamiltonian. We find that the
spin-orbit-related transverse coupling terms can be recast into two parts W and
V, which couple crossing and non-crossing adjacent transverse modes,
respectively. Interestingly, the zeroth-order Hamiltonian together with W can
be solved exactly, as it maps onto the Jaynes-Cummings model of quantum optics.
We treat the V coupling by performing a Schrieffer-Wolff transformation. This
allows us to obtain an effective Hamiltonian to third order in the coupling
strength k_Rl of V, which can be straightforwardly diagonalized via an
additional unitary transformation. We also apply our approach to other types of
effective parabolic confinement, e.g., 2D electrons in a perpendicular magnetic
field. To demonstrate the usefulness of our approximate eigensolutions, we
obtain analytical expressions for the n^th Landau-level g_n-factors in the
presence of both Rashba and Dresselhaus couplings. For small values of the bulk
g-factors, we find that spin-orbit effects cancel out entirely for particular
values of the spin-orbit couplings. By solving simple transcendental equations
we also obtain the band minima of a Rashba-coupled quantum wire as a function
of an external magnetic field. These can be used to describe Shubnikov-de Haas
oscillations. This procedure makes it easier to extract the strength of the
spin-orbit interaction in these systems via proper fitting of the data.
