An alternative approach - nonequilibrium evolution thermodynamics, is
compared with classical Landau approach. A statistical justification of the
approach is carried out with help of probability distribution function on an
example of a solid with vacancies. Two kinds of kinetic equations are deduced
in terms of the internal energy and the modified free energy.
