We review the key features of POWHEG, a method for interfacing parton-shower
Monte Carlo generators to fixed next-to-leading order QCD computations. We
describe a recently introduced framework, the POWHEG-BOX, that allows the
automatic POWHEG implementation of any given NLO calculation. We present a few
results for Higgs boson production via vector boson fusion and Z + 1 jet
production, both processes available in the POWHEG-BOX.
