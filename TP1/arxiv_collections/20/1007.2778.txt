We develop the concept of quantum carrier and show that messages can be
uploaded and downloaded from this carrier and while in transit, these messages
are hidden from external agents. We explain in detail the working of the
quantum carrier for different communication tasks, including quantum key
distribution, classical secret and quantum state sharing among a set of $n$
players according to general threshold schemes. The security of the protocol is
discussed and it is shown that only the legitimate subsets can retrieve the
secret messages, the collaboration of all the parties is needed for the
continuous running of the protocol and maintaining the carrier.
