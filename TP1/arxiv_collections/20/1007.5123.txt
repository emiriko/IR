Software component reuse is the software engineering practice of developing
new software products from existing components. A reuse library or component
reuse repository organizes stores and manages reusable components. This paper
describes how a reusable component is created, how it reuses the function and
checking if optimized code is being used in building programs and applications.
Finally providing coding guidelines, standards and best practices used for
creating reusable components and guidelines and best practices for making
