The late stages of evolution of the primordial circumstellar disks
surrounding young stars are poorly understood, yet vital to constrain theories
of planet formation. We consider basic structural models for the disks around
two ~10 Myr-old members of the nearby RCrA association, RX J1842.9-3532 and RX
J1852.3-3700. We present new arcsecond-resolution maps of their 230 GHz
continuum emission from the Submillimeter Array and unresolved CO(3-2) spectra
from the Atacama Submillimeter Telescope Experiment. By combining these data
with broadband fluxes from the literature and infrared fluxes and spectra from
the catalog of the Formation and Evolution of Planetary Systems (FEPS) Legacy
program on the Spitzer Space Telescope, we assemble a multiwavelength data set
probing the gas and dust disks. Using the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code
RADMC to model simultaneously the SED and millimeter continuum visibilities, we
derive basic dust disk properties and identify an inner cavity of radius 16 AU
in the disk around RX J1852.3-3700. We also identify an optically thin 5 AU
cavity in the disk around RX J1842.9-3532, with a small amount of optically
thick material close to the star. The molecular line observations suggest an
intermediate disk inclination in RX J1842.9-3532, consistent with the continuum
emission. In combination with the dust models, the molecular data allow us to
derive a lower CO content than expected, suggesting that the process of gas
clearing is likely underway in both systems, perhaps simultaneously with planet
formation.
