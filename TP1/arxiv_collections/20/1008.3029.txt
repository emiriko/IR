In this paper, we demonstrate that the performance of silicon Schottky
rectifiers on SOI can be significantly improved using a Lateral Dual Sidewall
Schottky (LDSS) concept. Our results based on numerical simulation show that
the LDSS structure on SOI has low forward voltage drop and low reverse leakage
current while its breakdown voltage is significantly larger than that of a
conventional Schottky rectifier.
