We present an Asymptotic Bound-state Model which can be used to accurately
describe all Feshbach resonance positions and widths in a two-body system. With
this model we determine the coupled bound states of a particular two-body
system. The model is based on analytic properties of the two-body Hamiltonian,
and on asymptotic properties of uncoupled bound states in the interaction
potentials. In its most simple version, the only necessary parameters are the
least bound state energies and actual potentials are not used. The complexity
of the model can be stepwise increased by introducing threshold effects,
multiple vibrational levels and additional potential parameters. The model is
extensively tested on the 6Li-40K system and additional calculations on the
40K-87Rb system are presented.
