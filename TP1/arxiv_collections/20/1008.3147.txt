This volume contains the papers presented at the first International Workshop
on Applications of Membrane Computing, Concurrency and Agent-based Modelling in
Population Biology (AMCA-POP 2010) held in Jena, Germany on August 25th, 2010
as a satellite event of the 11th Conference on Membrane Computing (CMC11).
  The aim of the workshop is to investigate whether formal modelling and
analysis techniques could be applied with profit to systems of interest for
population biology and ecology. The considered modelling notations include
membrane systems, Petri nets, agent-based notations, process calculi,
automata-based notations, rewriting systems and cellular automata. Such
notations enable the application of analysis techniques such as simulation,
model checking, abstract interpretation and type systems to study systems of
interest in disciplines such as population biology, ecosystem science,
epidemiology, genetics, sustainability science, evolution and other disciplines
in which population dynamics and interactions with the environment are studied.
Papers contain results and experiences in the modelling and analysis of systems
of interest in these fields.
