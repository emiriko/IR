In this paper, we report a new 4H-SiC Lateral Dual Sidewall Schottky (LDSS)
rectifier on a highly doped drift layer consisting of a high-barrier sidewall
Schottky contact on top of the low-barrier Schottky contact. Using
two-dimensional device simulation, the performance of the proposed device has
been evaluated in detail by comparing its characteristics with those of the
compatible Lateral Conventional Schottky (LCS) and Lateral Trench Sidewall
Schottky (LTSS) rectifiers on 4H-SiC. From our simulation results, it is
observed that the proposed LDSS rectifier acts as a low-barrier LTSS rectifier
under forward bias conditions and as a high-barrier LTSS rectifier under
reverse bias conditions making it an ideal rectifier. The LDSS rectifier
exhibits an on/off current ratio (at 1 V / -500 V) of 5.5x10e7 for an epitaxial
layer doping of 1x10e17 /cm^3. Further, the proposed LDSS structure exhibits a
very sharp breakdown similar to that of a PiN diode in spite of using only
Schottky junctions in the structure. We have analyzed the reasons for the
improved performance of the LDSS.
