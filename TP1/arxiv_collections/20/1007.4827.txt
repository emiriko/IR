Two-component fermionic superfluids on a lattice with an external non-Abelian
gauge field give access to a variety of topological phases in presence of a
sufficiently large spin imbalance. We address here the important issue of
superfluidity breakdown induced by spin imbalance by a self-consistent
calculation of the pairing gap, showing which of the predicted phases will be
experimentally accessible. We present the full topological phase diagram, and
we analyze the connection between Chern numbers and the existence of
topologically protected and non-protected edge modes. The Chern numbers are
calculated via a very efficient and simple method.
