The interference quantum correction to the conductivity in the gated double
quantum well Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$As/GaAs/Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$As structures is studied
experimentally. The consistent analysis of the interference induced positive
magnetoconductivity allows us to find the interwell transition time $\tau_{12}$
and the electron dephasing time $\tau_\phi$. It has been obtained that
$\tau_{12}^{-1}$ resonantly depends on the difference between the electron
densities in the wells as predicted theoretically. The dephasing times have
been determined under the conditions when one and both quantum wells are
occupied. The surprising result is that the $\tau_\phi$ value in the one well
does not depend on the occupation of the other one.
