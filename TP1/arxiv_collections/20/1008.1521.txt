A photonic crystal fiber based source of photon pairs in symmetric factorable
state is experimentally demonstrated. The idler and signal photons, with almost
the same bandwidth, are centering at 807.5 nm and 1364.1 nm, respectively. The
property of the spectral de-correlation is confirmed by measuring the
correlation dependence of photon pairs upon the spectra of pump, signal and
idler photons.
