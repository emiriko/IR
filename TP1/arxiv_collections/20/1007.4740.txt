Based on expert opinions, informative prior elicitation for the common
Weibull lifetime distribution usually presents some difficulties since it
requires to elicit a two-dimensional joint prior. We consider here a
reliability framework where the available expert information states directly in
terms of prior predictive values (lifetimes) and not parameter values, which
are less intuitive. The novelty of our procedure is to weigh the expert
information by the size m of a virtual sample yielding a similar information,
the prior being seen as a reference posterior. Thus, the prior calibration by
the Bayesian analyst, who has to moderate the subjective information with
respect to the data information, is made simple. A main result is the full
tractability of the prior under mild conditions, despite the conjugation issues
encountered with the Weibull distribution. Besides, m is a practical focus
point for discussion between analysts and experts, and a helpful parameter for
leading sensitivity studies and reducing the potential imbalance in posterior
selection between Bayesian Weibull models, which can be due to favoring
arbitrarily a prior. The calibration of m is discussed and a real example is
treated along the paper.
