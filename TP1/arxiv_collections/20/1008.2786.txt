Electronic phase separation and related inhomogeneity is ubiquitously seen in
strongly-correlated systems. A typical example is found between ferromagnetic
metal and antiferromagnetic insulator in CMR manganese oxides. Here we
demonstrate that the geometrical frustration brings distinctive aspects into
the phase separation phenomena. From Monte Carlo simulation and a simple energy
comparison for the pyrochlore double-exchange model, we show that such phase
separation takes place between ferromagnetic and paramagnetic metals. We
discuss the relevance of our results to a spin-glassy metallic phase found in
Mo pyrochlore oxides under external pressure.
