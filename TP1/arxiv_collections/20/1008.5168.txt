We report the fabrication and characterization of an electrostatic quantum
dot in pure Germanium with an integrated charge measurement transistor. The
device uses the Al2O3/Germanium interface for the confinement of carriers in
the Germanium and an hybrid design with an electron quantum dot and hole
transistor for the charge detection. The hole transistor, using with NiGe
source and drain contacts, despite the modest low temperature carrier mobility
of 450 cm2/Vs, has shown a sensitivity to the dot electric potential sufficient
to detect single charges tunneling in and out of the quantum dot. The device is
realized with a two level gate stack, with the top level used to attract
electrons and the lower one to define the electron confinement potential and
accumulate the hole transistor. The possibility to improve the device operation
using a Al2O3/SiGe/Ge multilayer for the confinement of electrons at a smoother
interface is discussed.
