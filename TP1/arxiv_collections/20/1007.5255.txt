This paper proposes and analyzes the performance of a simple frequency-agile
CSMA MAC protocol. In this MAC, a node carrier-senses multiple frequency
channels simultaneously, and it takes the first opportunity to transmit on any
one of the channels when allowed by the CSMA backoff mechanism. We show that
the frequency-agile MAC can effectively 1) boost throughput and 2) remove
temporal starvation. Furthermore, the MAC can be implemented on the existing
multiple-frequency setup in Wi-Fi using multi-radio technology, and it can
co-exist with the legacy MAC using single radio. This paper provides exact
stationary throughput analysis for regular 1D and thin-strip 2D CSMA networks
using a "transfer-matrix" approach. In addition, accurate approximations are
given for 2D grid networks. Our closed-form formulas accurately quantify the
throughput gain of frequency-agile CSMA. To characterize temporal starvation,
we use the metric of "mean residual access time" (MRAT). Our simulations and
closed-form approximations indicate that the frequency-agile MAC can totally
eliminate temporal starvation in 2D grid networks, reducing its MRAT by orders
of magnitude. Finally, this paper presents a "coloring theorem" to justify the
use of the frequency-agile MAC in general network topologies. Our analysis and
theorem suggest that with enough frequency channels, the frequency-agile MAC
can effectively decouple the detrimental interactions between neighboring links
responsible for low throughput and starvation.
