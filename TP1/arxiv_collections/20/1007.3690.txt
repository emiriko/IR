In this article we show how to compute a matrix representation and the
implicit equation by means of the method developed in [Botbol:
arXiv:1007.3437], using the computer algebra system Macaulay2 \cite{M2}. As it
is probably the most interesting case from a practical point of view, we
restrict our computations to parametrizations of bigraded surfaces. This
implementation allows to compute small examples for the better understanding of
the theory developed in [Botbol: arXiv:1007.3437], and is a complement to the
algorithm [Botbol, Dohm: arXiv:1001.1126].
