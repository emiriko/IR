We describe the electronic properties of a double dot for which the lateral
coupling between the two vertical dots can be controlled in-situ with a center
gate voltage (Vc) and the current flows through the two dots in series. When Vc
is large and positive, the two dots merge. As Vc is made less positive, two
dots are formed whose coupling is reduced. We measure charging diagrams for
positive and negative source-drain voltages in the weak coupling regime and
observe current rectification due to the Pauli spin blockade when the hyperfine
interaction between the electrons and the nuclei is suppressed.
