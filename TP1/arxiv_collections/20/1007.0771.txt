From photoelectric $uvby\beta$ data and recent accurate synthetic and
spectroscopic values of $T_{\rm eff}$ and log~$g$ for 50 F-G supergiants, we
have calculated functional relationships that lead to initial estimates of
effective temperature and gravities for these types of stars. It is shown that
while the $T_{\rm eff}$ relationships are calculated using the data on young
massive supergiants, they are also valid for evolved stars of similar
temperatures like post-AGB and RV Tau stars. The gravity can also be predicted
from the $\Delta [c_1]$ index with an uncertainty of about 0.26 dex. Although a
clear and significant trend between $M_V$ and $\Delta [c_1]$ is seen, no
calibration is found that predicts accurate values of $M_V$.
