In order to better understand the possibility of coronal heating by MHD
waves, we analyze Fe xii 195.12{\AA} data observed with EUV Imaging
Spectrometer (EIS) onboard Hinode. We performed a Fourier analysis of EUV
intensity and Doppler velocity time series data in the active region corona.
Notable intensity and Doppler velocity oscillations were found for two moss
regions out of the five studied, while only small oscillations were found for
five apexes of loops. The amplitudes of the oscillations were 0.4 - 5.7% for
intensity and 0.2 - 1.2 kms-1 for Doppler velocity. In addition, oscillations
of only Doppler velocity were seen relatively less often in the data. We
compared the amplitudes of intensity and those of Doppler velocity in order to
identify MHD wave modes, and calculated the phase delays between Fourier
components of intensity and those of Doppler velocity. The results are
interpreted in terms of MHD waves as follows: (1) few kink modes or torsional
Alfv'en mode waves were seen in both moss regions and the apexes of loops; (2)
upwardly propagating and standing slowmode waves were found inmoss regions; and
(3) consistent with previous studies, estimated values of energy flux of the
waves were several orders of magnitude lower than that required for heating
active regions.
