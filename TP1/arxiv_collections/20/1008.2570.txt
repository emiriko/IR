We provide an introduction to the physics of a warped extra dimension and the
AdS/CFT correspondence. An AdS/CFT dictionary is given which leads to a 4D
holographic view of the 5th dimension. With a particular emphasis on beyond the
standard model physics, this provides a window into the strong dynamics
associated with either electroweak symmetry breaking or supersymmetry breaking.
In this way hierarchies associated with either the electroweak or supersymmetry
breaking scale, together with the fermion mass spectrum, can be addressed in a
consistent framework.
