Concentration spectral manifestation of the ionic and neutral dyes
encapsulated in mesoporous silicate films was studied. The mesoporous dyed SiO2
film was prepared by sol-gel technology with use as surfactant the amphiphilic
three-bloc copolymer Pluronic P123. It was discovered when dye concentration
exceeds mesoporous one the new spectral bands appear that are distinct from the
initial monomolecular predecessors. To explain the phenomena guess is
formulated and proved that origin of new spectrums is obliged to formation of
the ionic pairs, excimers and excitons with participation of dye molecules
localized in the characteristic places of mesoporous silicate film. Key terms:
mesoporous silicate film, polymer micelles, dye fluorescence, excimers, ionic
pair
