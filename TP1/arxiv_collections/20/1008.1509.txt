The single-particle spectrum of deformed shell-model states in nuclei, is
shown to exhibit a supersymmetric pattern. The latter involves deformed
pseudospin doublets and intruder levels. The underlying supersymmetry is
associated with the relativistic pseudospin symmetry of the nuclear mean-field
Dirac Hamiltonian with scalar and vector potentials.
