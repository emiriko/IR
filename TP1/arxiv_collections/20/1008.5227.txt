In this article we propose multiplication based random walk Metropolis
Hastings (MH) algorithm on the real line. We call it the random dive MH (RDMH)
algorithm. This algorithm, even if simple to apply, was not studied earlier in
Markov chain Monte Carlo literature. The associated kernel is shown to have
standard properties like irreducibility, aperiodicity and Harris recurrence
under some mild assumptions. These ensure basic convergence (ergodicity) of the
kernel. Further the kernel is shown to be geometric ergodic for a large class
of target densities on $\mathbb{R}$. This class even contains realistic target
densities for which random walk or Langevin MH are not geometrically ergodic.
Three simulation studies are given to demonstrate the mixing property and
superiority of RDMH to standard MH algorithms on real line. A share-price
return data is also analyzed and the results are compared with those available
in the literature.
