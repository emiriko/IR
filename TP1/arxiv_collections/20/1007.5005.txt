Studying the interaction of spin-polarized currents with the magnetization
configuration is of high interest due to the possible applications and the
novel physics involved. High resolution magnetic imaging is one of the key
techniques necessary for a better understanding of these effects. Here we
present an extension to a magnetic microscope that allows for in-situ current
injection into the structure investigated and furthermore for the study of
current induced magnetization changes during pulsed current injection. The
developed setup is highly flexible and can be used for a wide range of
investigations. Examples of current-induced domain wall motion and vortex core
displacements measured using this setup are presented.
