Four fundamental dimer manipulations can be used to produce a variety of
localized and extended defect structures in graphene. Two-dimensional templates
result in graphene allotropes, here viewed as extended defects, which can
exhibit either metallic or semiconducting electrical character. \emph{Embedded
allotropic ribbons}--i.e. thin swaths of the new allotropes--can also be
created within graphene. We examine these ribbons and find that they maintain
the electrical character of their parent allotrope even when only a few atoms
in width. Such extended defects may facilitate the construction of monolithic
electronic circuitry.
