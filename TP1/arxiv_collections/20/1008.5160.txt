The exchange-correlation potentials stemming from the local-density
approximation and several generalized-gradient approximations are known to have
incorrect asymptotic decay. This failure is independent of the dimensionality,
but so far the problem has been corrected -- within the mentioned
approximations -- only in three dimensions. Here we provide a cured
exchange-correlation potential in two dimensions, where the applications have a
continuously increasing range in, e.g., semiconductor physics. The given
potential is a generalized-gradient approximation, which is as easy to apply as
the local-density approximation. We demonstrate that the corrected potential
agrees very well with the analytic result of a two-electron quantum dot in the
asymptotic regime, and yields plausible exchange-correlation potentials for
larger two-dimensional systems.
