Quantum effects are mainly used for the determination of molecular shapes in
molecular biology, but quantum information theory may be a more useful tool to
understand the physics of life. Organic molecules and quantum
circuits/protocols can be considered as hardware and software of living systems
that are co-optimized during evolution. We try to model DNA replication in this
sense as a multi-body entanglement swapping with a reliable qubit
representation of the nucleotides. In our model molecular recognition of a
nucleotide triggers an intrabase entanglement corresponding to a superposition
state of different tautomer forms. Then, base pairing occurs by swapping
intrabase entanglements with interbase entanglements. We examine possible
realizations of quantum circuits to be used to obtain intrabase entanglement
and swapping protocols to be employed to obtain interbase entanglement.
Finally, we discuss possible ways for computational and experimental
verification of the model.
