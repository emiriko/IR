We report preliminary results for charmonium-nucleon potential $V_{c\bar{c}
N}(r)$ from quenched lattice QCD, which is calculated from the equal-time
Bethe-Salpeter amplitude through the effective Schr\"odinger equation. Our
simulations are performed at a lattice cutoff of $1/a$=2.0 GeV in a spatial
volume of $(3\;\text{fm})^3$ with the nonperturbatively $O(a)$ improved Wilson
action for the light quarks and a relativistic heavy quark action for the charm
quark. We have found that the potential $V_{c\bar{c} N}(r)$ is weakly
attractive at short distance and exponentially screened at long distance.
