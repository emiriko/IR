This paper discusses the potential for enhancing the LCLS hard X-ray FEL
capabilities. In the hard X-ray regime, a high longitudinal coherence will be
the key to such performance upgrade. The method considered here to obtain high
longitudinal coherence is based on a novel single-bunch self-seeding scheme
exploiting a single crystal monochromator, which is extremely compact and can
be straightforwardly installed in the LCLS baseline undulator. We present
simulation results dealing with the LCLS hard X-ray FEL, and show that this
method can produce fully-coherent X-ray pulses at 100 GW power level. With the
radiation beam monochromatized down to the Fourier transform limit, a variety
of very different techniques leading to further improvements of the LCLS
performance become feasible. In particular, we describe an efficient way for
obtaining full polarization control at the LCLS hard X-ray FEL. We also propose
to exploit crystals in the Bragg reflection geometry as movable deflectors for
the LCLS X-ray transport systems. The hard X-ray beam can be deflected of an
angle of order of a radian without perturbations. The monochromatization of the
output radiation constitutes the key for reaching such result. Finally, we
describe a new optical pump - hard X-ray probe technique which will allow
time-resolved studies at the LCLS baseline on the femtosecond time scale. The
principle of operation of the proposed scheme is essentially based on the use
of the time jitter between pump and probe pulses. This eliminates the need for
timing XFELs to high-power conventional lasers with femtosecond accuracy.
