In this paper, we study dynamics of the charged plane symmetric gravitational
collapse. For this purpose, we discuss non-adiabatic flow of a viscous fluid
and deduce the results for adiabatic case. The Einstein and Maxwell field
equations are formulated for general plane symmetric spacetime in the interior.
Junction conditions between the interior and exterior regions are derived. For
the non-adiabatic case, the exterior is taken as plane symmetric charged Vaidya
spacetime while for the adiabatic case, it is described by plane
Reissner-Nordstr$\ddot{o}$m spacetime. Using Misner and Sharp formalism, we
obtain dynamical equations to investigate the effects of different forces over
the rate of collapse. In non-adiabatic case, a dynamical equation is joined
with transport equation of heat flux. Finally, a relation between the Weyl
tensor and energy density is found.
