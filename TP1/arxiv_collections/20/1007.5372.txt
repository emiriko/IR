The kinetics of intrinsic and dopant-enhanced solid phase epitaxy (SPE) are
stud- ied in buried amorphous Si (a-Si) layers in which SPE is not retarded by
H. As, P, B and Al profiles were formed by multiple energy ion implantation
over a con- centration range of 1 - 30 x 1019 /cm3. Anneals were performed in
air over the temperature range 460-660 oC and the rate of interface motion was
monitored us- ing time resolved reflectivity. The dopant-enhanced SPE rates
were modeled with the generalized Fermi level shifting model using degenerate
semiconductor statis- tics. The effect of band bending between the crystalline
and amorphous sides of the interface is also considered.
