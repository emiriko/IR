Based on quantum mechanical approach the polarization transport of photons
which propagate in a medium with slow varying refractive index is studied. The
photon polarizations are separated in opposite directions normal to the ray
which is called "Spin Hall effect" of photons, and also the rotation of
polarization plane, a manifestation of the Berry phase, occurs. This approach
can be generalized to other spinning particles in inhomogeneous media as a
universal approach.
