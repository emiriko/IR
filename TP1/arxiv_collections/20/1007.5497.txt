Quantum state discrimination is a fundamental primitive in quantum statistics
where one has to correctly identify the state of a system that is in one of two
possible known states. A programmable discrimination machine performs this task
when the pair of possible states is not a priori known, but instead the two
possible states are provided through two respective program ports. We study
optimal programmable discrimination machines for general qubit states when
several copies of states are available in the data or program ports. Two
scenarios are considered: one in which the purity of the possible states is a
priori known, and the fully universal one where the machine operates over
generic mixed states of unknown purity. We find analytical results for both,
the unambiguous and minimum error, discrimination strategies. This allows us to
calculate the asymptotic performance of programmable discrimination machines
when a large number of copies is provided, and to recover the standard state
discrimination and state comparison values as different limiting cases.
