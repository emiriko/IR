We study the simplicial complex that arises from non-attacking rook
placements on a subclass of Ferrers boards that have $a_i$ rows of length $i$
where $a_i>0$ and $i\leq n$ for some positive integer $n$. In particular, we
will investigate enumerative properties of their facets, their homotopy type,
and homology.
