We present high resolution (R~50,000) spectroastrometry over the CO 1st
overtone bandhead of a sample of seven intermediate/massive young stellar
objects. These are primarily drawn from the red MSX source (RMS) survey, a
systematic search for young massive stars which has returned a large, well
selected sample of such objects. The mean luminosity of the sample is
approximately 5 times 10^4 L_\odot, indicating the objects typically have a
mass of ~15 solar masses. We fit the observed bandhead profiles with a model of
a circumstellar disc, and find good agreement between the models and
observations for all but one object. We compare the high angular precision
(0.2-0.8 mas) spectroastrometric data to the spatial distribution of the
emitting material in the best-fitting models. No spatial signatures of discs
are detected, which is entirely consistent with the properties of the
best-fitting models. Therefore, the observations suggest that the CO bandhead
emission of massive young stellar objects originates in small-scale disks, in
agreement with previous work. This provides further evidence that massive stars
form via disc accretion, as suggested by recent simulations.
