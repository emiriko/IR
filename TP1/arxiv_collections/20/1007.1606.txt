We report on susceptibility measurements in the strongly correlated layered
cobalt oxide [BiBa0.66K0.36O2]CoO2, which demonstrate the existence of a
magnetic quantum critical point (QCP) governing the electronic properties. The
investigated low frequency susceptibility displays a scaling behavior with both
the temperature T and the magnetic field B ranging from the high-T non-Fermi
liquid down to the low-T Fermi liquid. Whereas the inferred scaling form can be
discussed within the standard framework of the quantum critical phenomena, the
determined critical exponents suggest an unconventional magnetic QCP of a
potentially generic type. Accordingly, these quantum critical fluctuations
account for the anomalous logarithmic temperature dependence of the
thermopower. This result allows us to conjecture that quantum criticality can
be an efficient source of enhanced thermopower.
