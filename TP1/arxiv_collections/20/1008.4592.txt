We show that the two-dimensional, nonlinear Schr\"odinger lattice with a
saturable nonlinearity admits periodic and pulse-like exact solutions. We
establish the general formalism for the stability considerations of these
solutions and give examples of stability diagrams. Finally, we show that the
effective Peierls-Nabarro barrier for the pulse-like soliton solution is zero.
