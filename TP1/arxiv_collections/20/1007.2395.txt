We develop a quantum process tomography method, which variationally
reconstruct the map of a process, using noisy and incomplete information about
the dynamics. The new method encompasses the most common quantum process
tomography schemes. It is based on the variational quantum tomography method
(VQT) proposed by Maciel et al. in arXiv:1001.1793[quant-ph].
