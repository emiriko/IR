We describe a queueing model where service is allocated as a function of
queue sizes. We consider allocations policies that are insensitive to service
requirements and have a maximal stability region. We take a limit where the
queueing model become congested. We study how service is allocated under this
limit. We demonstrates that the only possible limit allocation is one that
maximizes a proportionally fair optimization problem.
