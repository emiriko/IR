In reply to the Comment by Ramasubramaniam regarding our article [Phys. Rev.
B {\bf 81}, 241412(R) (2010)] we clarify that our results are indeed valid
provided that out-of-plane atomic relaxations are inhibited, as it may occur in
the technologically relevant case of supported graphene sheets. We argue that
the Comment, while overall interesting, is addressed to the different case of a
free standing graphene monolayer and, therefore, does not invalidate our
conclusions. We also remark that the rippled configuration discussed in the
Comment is most likely affected by major size effects and that, contrary to
what suggested, our conclusions are not in contrast with the recent work by
Pereira {\it et al.} [Phys. Rev. B {\bf 80}, 045401 (2009)].
