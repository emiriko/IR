In this report, building on the deterministic multi-valued one-to-many
Byzantine agreement (broadcast) algorithm in our recent technical report [2],
we introduce a deterministic multi-valued all-to-all Byzantine agreement
algorithm (consensus), with linear complexity per bit agreed upon. The
discussion in this note is not self-contained, and relies heavily on the
material in [2] - please refer to [2] for the necessary background.
