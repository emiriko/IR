We give an overview of the integrability of the Hirota-Kimura discretization
method applied to algebraically completely integrable (a.c.i.) systems with
quadratic vector fields. Along with the description of the basic mechanism of
integrability (Hirota-Kimura bases), we provide the reader with a fairly
complete list of the currently available results for concrete a.c.i. systems.
