Many physicists limit oneself to an instrumentalist description of quantum
phenomena and ignore the problems of foundation and interpretation of quantum
mechanics. This instrumentalist approach results to "specialization barbarism"
and mass delusion concerning the problem, how a quantum computer can be made.
The idea of quantum computation can be described within the limits of quantum
formalism. But in order to understand how this idea can be put into practice
one should realize the question: "What could the quantum formalism describe?",
in spite of the absence of an universally recognized answer. Only a realization
of this question and the undecided problem of quantum foundations allows to see
in which quantum systems the superposition and EPR correlation could be
expected. Because of the "specialization barbarism" many authors are sure that
Bell proved full impossibility of any hidden-variables interpretation.
Therefore it is important to emphasize that in reality Bell has restricted to
validity limits of the no- hidden-variables proof and has shown that two-state
quantum system can be described by hidden variables. The later means that no
experimental result obtained on two-state quantum system can prove the
existence of superposition and violation of the realism. One should not assume
before unambiguous experimental evidence that any two-state quantum system is
quantum bit. No experimental evidence of superposition of macroscopically
distinct quantum states and of a quantum bit on base of superconductor
structure was obtained for the present. Moreover same experimental results can
not be described in the limits of the quantum formalism.
