The kinematics of damped Lyman alpha absorbers (DLAs) are difficult to
reproduce in hierarchical galaxy formation models, particularly the
preponderance of wide systems. We investigate DLA kinematics at z=3 using
high-resolution cosmological hydrodynamical simulations that include a
heuristic model for galactic outflows. Without outflows, our simulations fail
to yield enough wide DLAs, as in previous studies. With outflows, predicted DLA
kinematics are in much better agreement with observations. Comparing two
outflow models, we find that a model based on momentum-driven wind scalings
provides the best match to the observed DLA kinematic statistics of Prochaska &
Wolfe. In this model, DLAs typically arise a few kpc away from galaxies that
would be identified in emission. Narrow DLAs can arise from any halo and galaxy
mass, but wide ones only arise in halos with mass >10^11 Mo, from either large
central or small satellite galaxies. This implies that the success of this
outflow model originates from being most efficient at pushing gas out from
small satellite galaxies living in larger halos. This increases the
cross-section for large halos relative to smaller ones, thereby yielding wider
kinematics. Our simulations do not include radiative transfer effects or
detailed metal tracking, and outflows are modeled heuristically, but they
strongly suggest that galactic outflows are central to understanding DLA
kinematics. An interesting consequence is that DLA kinematics may place
constraints on the nature and efficiency of gas ejection from high-z galaxies.
