Maximization of the entropy rate is an important issue to design diffusion
processes aiming at a well-mixed state. We demonstrate that it is possible to
construct maximal-entropy random walks with only local information on the graph
structure. In particular, we show that an almost maximal-entropy random walk is
obtained when the step probabilities are proportional to a power of the degree
of the target node, with an exponent $\alpha$ that depends on the degree-degree
correlations, and is equal to 1 in uncorrelated graphs.
