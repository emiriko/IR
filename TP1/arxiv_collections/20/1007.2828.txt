We report results of Swift observations for the high mass Be/X-ray binary
system 1A 1118-615, during an outburst stage in January, 2009 and at a flaring
stage in March, 2009. Using the epoch-folding method, we successfully detected
a pulsed period of 407.69(2) sec in the outburst of January and of 407.26(1)
sec after the flare detection in March. We find that the spectral detection for
the source during outburst can be described by a blackbody model with a high
temperature (kT ~ 1-3 keV) and a small radius (R ~ 1 km), indicating that the
emission results from the polar cap of the neutron star. On the other hand, the
spectra obtained after the outburst can further be described by adding an
additional component with a lower temperature (kT ~ 0.1-0.2 keV) and a larger
emission radius (R ~ 10-500 km), which indicates the emission from around the
inner region of an accretion disk. We find that the thermal emission from the
hot spot of the accreting neutron star dominates the radiation in outburst; the
existence of both this X-ray contribution and the additional soft component
suggest that the polar cap and the accretion disk emission might co-exist after
the outburst. Because the two-blackbody signature at the flaring stage is a
unique feature of 1A 1118-615, our spectral results may provide a new insight
to interpret the X-ray emission for the accreting neutron star. The time
separation between the three main outbursts of this system is ~17 years and it
might be related to the orbital period. We derive and discuss the associated
physical properties by assuming the elongated orbit for this specific Be/X-ray
transient.
