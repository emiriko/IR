The event topology in relativistic heavy ion collisions is determined by
various multi-particle production mechanisms. The simultaneous model treatment
of different collective nuclear effects at high energies (such as a hard
multi-parton fragmentation in hot QCD-matter, thermal resonance production,
hydrodynamical flows, etc.) is actual but rather complicated task. We discuss
the simulation of the above effects by means of Monte-Carlo model HYDJET++.
