We present an angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy study of the
electronic structure of SnTe, and compare the experimental results to ab initio
band structure calculations as well as a simplified tight-binding model of the
p-bands. Our study reveals the conjectured complex Fermi surface structure near
the L-points showing topological changes in the bands from disconnected
pockets, to open tubes, and then to cuboids as the binding energy increases,
resolving lingering issues about the electronic structure. The chemical
potential at the crystal surface is found to be 0.5eV below the gap,
corresponding to a carrier density of p =1.14x10^{21} cm^{-3} or 7.2x10^{-2}
holes per unit cell. At a temperature below the cubic-rhombohedral structural
transition a small shift in spectral energy of the valance band is found, in
agreement with model predictions.
