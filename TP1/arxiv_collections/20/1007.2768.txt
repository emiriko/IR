Isolated horizons model equilibrium states of classical black holes. A
detailed quantization, starting from a classical phase space restricted to
spherically symmetric horizons, exists in the literature and has since been
extended to axisymmetry. This paper extends the quantum theory to horizons of
arbitrary shape. Surprisingly, the Hilbert space obtained by quantizing the
full phase space of \textit{all} generic horizons with a fixed area is
identical to that originally found in spherical symmetry. The entropy of a
large horizon remains one quarter its area, with the Barbero-Immirzi parameter
retaining its value from symmetric analyses. These results suggest a
reinterpretation of the intrinsic quantum geometry of the horizon surface.
