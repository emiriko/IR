The magnetic properties and the effects of interparticle interaction on it
have been studied in nanoparticles of half doped Pr$_{0.5}$Sr$_{0.5}$MnO$_{3}$.
Three samples consisting of nanoparticles of different average particle sizes
are synthesized to render the variation in interparticle interaction. Though
all the samples crystallize in the same structure to that of their bulk
compound, the low temperature ferromagnetic-antiferromagnetic transition, which
is present in bulk compound, is not evident in the nanoparticles. Linear as
well as nonlinear ac susceptibility coupled with dc magnetic measurements have
shown the superparamagnetic behavior of these nanoparticles where the blocking
temperature increases with the increasing particle size. Presence of
interparticle interaction is confirmed from the temperature variation of
coercive field and the analysis of frequency dependent ac susceptibility. We
have identified the nature of this interaction to be of dipolar type, and show
that its strength decreases with the increasing particle size. The effect of
this dipolar interaction on magnetic properties is intriguing as the compounds
exhibit crossover from de Almeida-Thouless to Gabay-Toulouse like critical
lines on field-temperature plane above their respective interaction field. In
agreement with theoretical prediction, we infer that this crossover is induced
by the unidirectional anisotropy arising from interparticle interaction, and
this is confirmed from the presence of exchange bias phenomenon.
