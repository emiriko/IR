We investigate powers of supertropical matrices, with special attention to
the role of the coefficients of the supertropical characteristic polynomial
(especially the supertropical trace) in controlling the rank of a power of a
matrix. This leads to a Jordan-type decomposition of supertropical matrices,
together with a generalized eigenspace decomposition of a power of an arbitrary
supertropical matrix.
