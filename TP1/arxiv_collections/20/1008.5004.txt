Research of influence of collisions on Friedel oscillations in quantum
degenerate collisional plasma (T=0) is carried out for the first time. It is
shown that presence of collisions in plasma leads to exponential decreasing of
amplitude and phase shift of the Friedel oscillations. In linear approximation
the phase shift is equal to the half of quantity inverse to product of Fermi's
wave number by free length path of electrons. The correct expression for
longitudinal dielectric permeability of the quantum collisional plasma found by
the authors (see arxiv:1001.3937 [math-ph] 22 Jan 2010) is used.
