Recent research efforts have shown that the popular BitTorrent protocol does
not provide fair resource reciprocation and may allow free-riding. In this
paper, we propose a BitTorrent-like protocol that replaces the peer selection
mechanisms in the regular BitTorrent protocol with a novel reinforcement
learning (RL) based mechanism. Due to the inherent opration of P2P systems,
which involves repeated interactions among peers over a long period of time,
the peers can efficiently identify free-riders as well as desirable
collaborators by learning the behavior of their associated peers. Thus, it can
help peers improve their download rates and discourage free-riding, while
improving fairness in the system. We model the peers' interactions in the
BitTorrent-like network as a repeated interaction game, where we explicitly
consider the strategic behavior of the peers. A peer, which applies the
RL-based mechanism, uses a partial history of the observations on associated
peers' statistical reciprocal behaviors to determine its best responses and
estimate the corresponding impact on its expected utility. The policy
determines the peer's resource reciprocations with other peers, which would
maximize the peer's long-term performance, thereby making foresighted
decisions. We have implemented the proposed reinforcement-learning based
mechanism and incorporated it into an existing BitTorrent client. We have
performed extensive experiments on a controlled Planetlab test bed. Our results
confirm that our proposed protocol (1) promotes fairness in terms of incentives
to each peer's contribution e.g. high capacity peers improve their download
completion time by up to 33\%, (2) improves the system stability and robustness
e.g. reducing the peer selection luctuations by 57\%, and (3) discourages
free-riding e.g. peers reduce by 64\% their upload to \FR, in comparison to the
regular \BT~protocol.
