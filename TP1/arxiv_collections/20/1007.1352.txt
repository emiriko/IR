The normal modes of a three-dimensional Yukawa plasma in an isotropic,
harmonic confinement are investigated by solving the linearized cold fluid
equations. The eigenmodes are found analytically and expressed in terms of
hypergeometric functions. It is found that the mode frequencies solely depend
on the dimensionless plasma parameter $\xi=\kappa R$, where $R$ is the plasma
radius and $\kappa$ the inverse screening length. The eigenfrequencies increase
monotonically with $\xi$ and saturate in the limit $\xi\to\infty$. Compared
with the results in the Coulomb limit~[D. H. E. Dubin, Phys. Rev. Lett.
\textbf{66}, 2076 (1991)], we find a new class of modes characterized by the
number $n$ which determines the number of radial nodes in the perturbed
potential. These modes originate from the degenerate bulk modes of the Coulomb
system. Analytical formulas for the eigenfrequencies are derived for limiting
cases.
