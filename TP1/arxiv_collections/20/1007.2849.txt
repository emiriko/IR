An introduction to the transport properties of graphene combining
experimental results and theoretical analysis is presented. In the theoretical
description simple intuitive models are used to illustrate important points on
the transport properties of graphene. The concept of chirality, stemming from
the massless Dirac nature of the low energy physics of the material, is shown
to be instrumental in understanding its transport properties: the conductivity
minimum, the electronic mobility, the effect of strain, the weak
(anti-)localization, and the optical conductivity.
