A novel time delayed chaotic oscillator exhibiting mono- and double scroll
complex chaotic attractors is designed. This circuit consists of only a few
operational amplifiers and diodes and employs a threshold controller for
flexibility. It efficiently implements a piecewise linear function. The control
of piecewise linear function facilitates controlling the shape of the
attractors. This is demonstrated by constructing the phase portraits of the
attractors through numerical simulations and hardware experiments. Based on
these studies, we find that this circuit can produce multi-scroll chaotic
attractors by just introducing more number of threshold values.
