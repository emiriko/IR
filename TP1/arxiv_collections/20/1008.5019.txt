In this paper, incorporating the property of the vacuum negative pressure,
namely, the bag constant, we presented a new model of the equation of state
(EOS) of quark matter at finite chemical potential and zero temperature. By
comparing our EOS with Fraga {\it et~al.}'s EOS and SQM1 model, one find that
our EOS is softer than Fraga {\it et~al.}'s EOS and SQM1 model. The reason for
this difference is analyzed. With these results we investigate the structure of
quark star. A comparison between our model of quark star and other models is
made. The obtained mass of quark star is $ 1.3 \sim 1.66 M_\odot$ and the
radius is $9.5 \sim 14 Km$. One can see that our star's compactness is smaller
than that of other two models.
