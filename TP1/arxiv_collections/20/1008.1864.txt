We study the quantum dynamics of small polaron formation and polaron
transport through finite quantum structures in the framework of the
one-dimensional Holstein model with site-dependent potentials and interactions.
Combining Lanczos diagonalization with Chebyshev moment expansion of the time
evolution operator, we determine how different initial states, representing
stationary ground states or injected wave packets, after an electron-phonon
interaction quench, develop in real space and time. Thereby, the full quantum
nature and dynamics of electrons and phonons is preserved. We find that the
decay out of the initial state sensitively depends on the energy and momentum
of the incoming particle, the electron-phonon coupling strength, and the phonon
frequency, whereupon bound polaron-phonon excited states may emerge in the
strong-coupling regime. The tunneling of a Holstein polaron through a quantum
wall/dot is generally accompanied by strong phonon number fluctuations due to
phonon emission and re-absorption processes.
