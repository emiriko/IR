Recent research highlighted the scaling property of human and animal
mobility. An interesting issue is that the exponents of scaling law for animals
and humans in different situations are quite different. This paper proposes a
general optimization model, a random walker following scaling laws (whose
traveling distances in each step obey a power law distribution with exponent
{\alpha}) tries to diversify its visiting places under a given total traveling
distance with a home-return probability. The results show that different
optimal exponents in between 1 and 2 can emerge naturally. Therefore, the
scaling property of human and animal mobility can be understood in our
framework where the discrepancy of the scaling law exponents is due to the
home-return constraint under the maximization of the visiting places diversity.
