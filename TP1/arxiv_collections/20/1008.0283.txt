Multiple observers who interact with environmental encodings of the states of
a macroscopic quantum system S as required by quantum Darwinism cannot
demonstrate that they are jointly observing S without a joint a priori
assumption of a classical boundary separating S from its environment E. Quantum
Darwinism cannot, therefore, be regarded as providing a purely
quantum-mechanical explanation of the "emergence" of classicality.
