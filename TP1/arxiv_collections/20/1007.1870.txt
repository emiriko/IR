The rigorous approach aimed at providing exact analytical results for hybrid
classical-quantum models is elaborated on the grounds of generalized algebraic
mapping transformations. This conceptually simple method allows one to obtain
novel interesting exact results for the hybrid classical-quantum models, which
may for instance describe interacting many-particle systems composed of the
classical Ising spins and quantum Heisenberg spins, the localized Ising spins
and delocalized electrons, or many other hybrid systems of a mixed
classical-quantum nature.
