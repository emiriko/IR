Within the previously developed Dubna-Mainz-Taipei meson-exchange model, the
singularity structure of the pi N scattering amplitudes has been investigated.
For all partial waves up to F waves and c.m. energies up to W = 2 GeV, the
T-matrix poles have been calculated by three different techniques: analytic
continuation into the complex energy plane, speed-plot and the regularization
method. For all 4-star resonances, we find a perfect agreement between the
analytic continuation and the regularization method. We also find resonance
poles for resonances that are not so well established, but in these cases the
pole positions and residues obtained by analytic continuation can substantially
differ from the results predicted by the speed-plot and regularization methods.
