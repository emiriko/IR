In this paper we study three different functional approaches to classical
thermal field theory, which turn out to be the classical counterparts of three
well-known different formulations of quantum thermal field theory: the
Closed-Time Path (CTP) formalism, the Thermofield Dynamics (TFD) and the
Matsubara approach.
