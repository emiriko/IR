We have identified two useful exact properties of the perturbative expansion
for the case of a two-dimensional electron liquid with Rashba or Dresselhaus
spin-orbit interaction and in the absence of magnetic field. The results allow
us to draw interesting conclusions regarding the dependence of the exchange and
correlation energy and of the quasiparticle properties on the strength of the
spin-orbit coupling which are valid to all orders in the electron-electron
interaction.
