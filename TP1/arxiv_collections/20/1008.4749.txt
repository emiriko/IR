The chromatic polynomial of a graph G counts the number of proper colorings
of G. We give an affirmative answer to the conjecture of Read and
Rota-Heron-Welsh that the absolute values of the coefficients of the chromatic
polynomial form a log-concave sequence. We define a sequence of numerical
invariants of projective hypersurfaces analogous to the Milnor number of local
analytic hypersurfaces. Then we give a characterization of correspondences
between projective spaces up to a positive integer multiple which includes the
conjecture on the chromatic polynomial as a special case. As a byproduct of our
approach, we obtain an analogue of Kouchnirenko's theorem relating the Milnor
number with the Newton polytope.
