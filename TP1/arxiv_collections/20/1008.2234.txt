Graphene/TiO2 nanocrystals hybrid is successfully prepared by directly
growing TiO2 nanocrystals on graphene oxide (GO) sheets. The direct growth of
nanocrystals on GO sheets was achieved by a two-step method, in which TiO2 was
coated on GO sheets by hydrolysis first and crystallized into anatase
nanocrystals by hydrothermal treatment in second step. Slow hydrolysis reaction
through the use of EtOH/H2O mixed solvents and addition of H2SO4 allows the
selectively growing TiO2 on GO and suppressing free growth in solution. The
method offers easy access to the GO/TiO2 nanocrystals hybrid with well
controlled coating and strong interactions between TiO2 and the underlying GO
sheets. The strong coupling could lead to advanced hybrid materials for various
applications including photocatalysis. The prepared graphene/TiO2 nanocrystals
hybrid has demonstrated superior photocatalytic activity in degradation of
rhodamine B over other TiO2 materials, showing an impressive 3-fold
photocatalytic enhancement over P25. It is expected that the hybrid material
could also be promising for various other applications including lithium ion
battery where strong electrical coupling to TiO2 nanoparticles is essential.
