Recent data on eta-meson photoproduction off a proton target in the energy
range 2 < sqrt{s} < 3 GeV are analyzed with regard to their overall
consistency. Results from the ELSA and CLAS measurements are compared with
predictions of a Regge model whose reaction amplitude was fixed via a global
fit to pre-2000 measurements of differential cross sections and polarization
observables for gamma p -> eta p at higher energies. We find that all recent
experimental results on differential cross sections for eta-meson
photoproduction are in good agreement with each other, except for the CLAS data
from 2009. However, the latter can be made consistent with the other data at
the expense of introducing an energy-dependent renormalization factor. We point
out that there indications in the data for a possible excitation of baryon
resonances with masses around 2.1 and 2.4 GeV.
