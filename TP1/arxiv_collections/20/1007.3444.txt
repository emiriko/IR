Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MoND) is an empirically modification of
Newtonian gravity at largest scales in order to explain rotation curves of
galaxies, as an alternative to nonbaryonic dark matter. But MoND theories can
hardly connect themselves to the formalism of relativistic cosmology type
Friedmann-Robertson-Walker. The present work posits the possibility of building
this connection by postulating a Yukawa-like scalar potential, with non
gravitational origin. This potential comes from a simple reflection speculate
of the well-know potential of Yukawa and it is intended to describe the
following physics scenarios: null in very near solar system, slightly
attractive in ranges of interstellar distances, very attractive in distance
ranges comparable to galaxies cluster, and repulsive to cosmic scales. As a
result of introducing this potential into the typical Friedman equations we
found that the critical density of matter is consistent with the observed
density (without a dark matter assumption), besides this, MoND theory is
obtained for interstellar scales and consequently would explain rotation
curves. Also it is shown that Yukawa type inverse does not alter the
predictions of the Cosmic Microwave Background neither the primordial
nucleosinthesys in early universe; and can be useful to explain the large-scale
structure formation.
