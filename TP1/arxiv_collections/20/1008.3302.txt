Using a semi-classical model to describe the interaction between coherent
electromagnetic radiation and a Bose-Einstein condensate in the limit of zero
temperature, including the back action of the atoms on the radiation, we have
analyzed the phenomenon of emission of solitary-like wave packets which can
accompany the formation of mutually localized atom-laser structures.
