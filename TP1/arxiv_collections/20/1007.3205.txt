Instructors of statistics who teach non-statistics majors possess varied
academic backgrounds, and hence it is reasonable to expect variability in their
content knowledge, and pedagogical approach. The aim of this study was to
determine the specific course(s) that contributed mostly to instructors'
understanding of statistics. Courses reported were described as advanced or
graduate level, and classified as application-based, math, multivariate,
probability, and research. The majority, 9 (56%) attributed their understanding
of statistics to either an application-based or research course, and of those,
7 (44%) reported negative feelings about their introductory courses. These
findings underscore the importance of authentic activities, and constructivist
pedagogy toward facilitating statistical literacy. Research is needed to
determine the effect of instructors' academic preparation on their knowledge,
attitudes, and practices.
