We estimate the minimal mass of selfgravitating polytropic disks using the
famous Sobolev inequality. This bound resembles the well known mass formula for
Lane-Emden stars. For ideal gas with the polytropic index n = 3 the minimal
mass is not smaller than the Jeans mass. The accuracy of the estimate is
verified in a number of numerical examples. The bound works well for heavy
selfgravitating disks and is less useful for light disks.
