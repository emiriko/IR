The Kuramoto model has been introduced to describe synchronization phenomena
observed in groups of cells, individuals, circuits, etc. The model consists of
$N$ interacting oscillators on the one dimensional sphere $\mathbf{S}^{1}$,
driven by independent Brownian Motions with constant drift chosen at random.
This quenched disorder is chosen independently for each oscillator according to
the same law $\mu$. The behaviour of the system for large $N$ can be understood
via its empirical measure: we prove here the convergence as $N\to\infty$ of the
quenched empirical measure to the unique solution of coupled McKean-Vlasov
equations, under weak assumptions on the disorder $\mu$ and general hypotheses
on the interaction. The main purpose of this work is to address the issue of
quenched fluctuations around this limit, motivated by the dynamical properties
of the disordered system for large but fixed $N$. Whereas we observe a
self-averaging for the law of large numbers, this no longer holds for the
corresponding central limit theorem: the trajectories of the fluctuations
process are sample-dependent.
