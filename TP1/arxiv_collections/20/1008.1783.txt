We show that colliders can impose strong constraints on models of dark
matter, in particular when the dark matter is light. We analyze models where
the dark matter is a fermion or scalar interacting with quarks and/or gluons
through an effective theory containing higher dimensional operators which
represent heavier states that have been integrated out of the effective field
theory. We determine bounds from existing Tevatron searches for monojets as
well as expected LHC reaches for a discovery. We find that colliders can
provide information which is complementary or in some cases even superior to
experiments searching for direct detection of dark matter through its
scattering with nuclei. In particular, both the Tevatron and the LHC can
outperform spin dependent searches by an order of magnitude or better over much
of parameter space, and if the dark matter couples mainly to gluons, the LHC
can place bounds superior to any spin independent search.
