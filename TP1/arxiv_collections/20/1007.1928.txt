The intrinsic stochasticity of gene expression can lead to large variations
in protein levels across a population of cells. To explain this variability,
different sources of mRNA fluctuations ('Poisson' and 'Telegraph' processes)
have been proposed in stochastic models of gene expression. Both Poisson and
Telegraph scenario models explain experimental observations of noise in protein
levels in terms of 'bursts' of protein expression. Correspondingly, there is
considerable interest in establishing relations between burst and steady-state
protein distributions for general stochastic models of gene expression. In this
work, we address this issue by considering a mapping between stochastic models
of gene expression and problems of interest in queueing theory. By applying a
general theorem from queueing theory, Little's Law, we derive exact relations
which connect burst and steady-state distribution means for models with
arbitrary waiting-time distributions for arrival and degradation of mRNAs and
proteins. The derived relations have implications for approaches to quantify
the degree of transcriptional bursting and hence to discriminate between
different sources of intrinsic noise in gene expression. To illustrate this, we
consider a model for regulation of protein expression bursts by small RNAs. For
a broad range of parameters, we derive analytical expressions (validated by
stochastic simulations) for the mean protein levels as the levels of regulatory
small RNAs are varied. The results obtained show that the degree of
transcriptional bursting can, in principle, be determined from changes in mean
steady-state protein levels for general stochastic models of gene expression.
