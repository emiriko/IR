The Johnson graph J(n,N) is defined as the graph whose vertices are the
n-subsets of the set {1,2,...,N}, where two vertices are adjacent if they share
exactly n - 1 elements. Unlike Johnson graphs, induced subgraphs of Johnson
graphs (JIS for short) do not seem to have been studied before. We give some
necessary conditions and some sufficient conditions for a graph to be JIS,
including: in a JIS graph, any two maximal cliques share at most two vertices;
all trees, cycles, and complete graphs are JIS; disjoint unions and Cartesian
products of JIS graphs are JIS; every JIS graph of order n is an induced
subgraph of J(m,2n) for some m <= n. This last result gives an algorithm for
deciding if a graph is JIS. We also show that all JIS graphs are edge move
distance graphs, but not vice versa.
