We investigate single-particle excitations and strong-coupling effects in the
BCS-BEC crossover regime of a superfluid Fermi gas. Including phase and
amplitude fluctuations of the superfluid order parameter within a $T$-matrix
theory, we calculate the superfluid density of states (DOS), as well as
single-particle spectral weight, over the entire BCS-BEC crossover region below
the superfluid transition temperature $T_{\rm c}$. We clarify how the pseudogap
in the normal state evolves into the superfluid gap, as one passes through
$T_{\rm c}$. While the pseudogap in DOS continuously evolves into the
superfluid gap in the weak-coupling BCS regime, the superfluid gap in the
crossover region is shown to appear in DOS after the pseudogap disappears below
$T_{\rm c}$. In the phase diagram with respect to the temperature and
interaction strength, we determine the region where strong pairing fluctuations
dominate over single-particle properties of the system. Our results would be
useful for the study of strong-coupling phenomena in the BCS-BEC crossover
regime of a superfluid Fermi gas.
