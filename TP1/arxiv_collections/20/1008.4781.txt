We give a parametrization of the ideal classes of rings associated to
integral binary forms by classes of tensors in $\mathbb Z^2\tensor \mathbb
Z^n\tensor \mathbb Z^n$. This generalizes Bhargava's work on Higher Composition
Laws, which gives such parametrizations in the cases $n=2,3$. We also obtain
parametrizations of 2-torsion ideal classes by symmetric tensors. Further, we
give versions of these theorems when $\mathbb Z$ is replaced by an arbitrary
base scheme $S$, and geometric constructions of the modules from the tensors in
the parametrization.
