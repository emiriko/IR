We discuss the universal constants c, epsilon, and h in relation to the CPT
symmetry. Because MKSA units (S.I. units) have no essential meaning, we should
use the units where c^2=epsilon^2=h^2=1. When volume is negative in the
left-handed coordinates as written in the Maxwell's text book, epsilon is also
negative in the left-handed coordinates. Thus, we need to have negative values
of the universal constants. If their absolute value is unity, the light
velocity is a time-reversal operator, permitivity is a space-reversal operator,
and the Plank constant is an operator for wave-particle transformation. This
paper shows new concepts in fundamental physics although it was written for
nonspecialists.
