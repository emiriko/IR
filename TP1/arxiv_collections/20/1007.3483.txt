Recent experiments on iron pnictides have uncovered a large in-plane
resistivity anisotropy with a surprising result: the system conducts better in
the antiferromagnetic x direction than in the ferromagnetic y direction. We
address this problem by calculating the ratio of the Drude weight along the x
and y directions, Dx/Dy, for the mean-field Q=(\pi,0) magnetic phase diagram of
a five-band model for the undoped pnictides. We find that Dx/Dy ranges between
0.3 < D_x/D_y < 1.4 for different interaction parameters. Large values of
orbital ordering favor an anisotropy opposite to the one found experimentally.
On the other hand D_x/D_y is strongly dependent on the topology and morfology
of the reconstructed Fermi surface. Our results points against orbital ordering
as the origin of the observed conductivity anisotropy, which may be ascribed to
the anisotropy of the Fermi velocity.
