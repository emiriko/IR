It is shown that in some special cases the Cherenkov radiation from a charged
particle moving along the axis of cylindrical waveguide filled with a
semi-infinite material consisting of dielectric plates alternated with vacuum
gaps is many times stronger than that in the waveguide filled with
semi-infinite solid dielectric without vacuum gaps.
