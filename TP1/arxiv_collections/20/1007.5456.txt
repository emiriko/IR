The one-shot classical capacity of a quantum channel quantifies the amount of
classical information that can be transmitted through a single use of the
channel such that the error probability is below a certain threshold. In this
work, we show that this capacity is well approximated by a
relative-entropy-type measure defined via hypothesis testing. Combined with a
quantum version of Stein's lemma, our results give a conceptually simple proof
of the well-known Holevo-Schumacher-Westmoreland theorem for the capacity of
memoryless channels. More generally, we obtain tight capacity formulas for
arbitrary (not necessarily memoryless) channels.
