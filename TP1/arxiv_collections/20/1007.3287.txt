We propose a phenomenological Ginzburg-Landau-like theory of cuprate
superconductivity. The free energy is expressed as a functional F of the
spin-singlet pair amplitude psi_ij=psi_m=Delta_m exp(i phi_m); i and j are
nearest-neighbor sites of the Cu lattice in which the superconductivity is
believed to primarily reside and m labels the site at the center of the bond
between i and j. The system is modeled as a weakly coupled stack of such
planes. We hypothesize a simple form, F[Delta,phi]=sum_m (A Delta_m^2+ B
Delta_m^4/2)+C sum_<mn> Delta_m Delta_n cos(phi_m-phi_n), for the functional.
The coefficients A, B and C are determined from comparison with experiments. We
work out a number of consequences of the proposed functional for specific
choices of A, B and C as functions of hole density x and temperature T. There
can be a rapid crossover of <Delta_m> from small to large values as A changes
sign on lowering T and the crossover temperatures is identified with the
observed pseudogap temperature. The superconducting phase-coherence transition
occurs at a different temperature T_c, and describes superconductivity with
d-wave symmetry for C>0. We calculate T_c(x) which has the observed parabolic
shape, being strongly influenced by the coupling between Delta_m and phi_m
present in F. The superfluid density, the local gap magnitude, the specific
heat (with and without a magnetic field) and vortex properties are obtained
using F. We compare our results successfully with experiments. We also obtain
the electron spectral density as influenced by the coupling between the
electrons and the pair correlation function calculated from F. Features such as
temperature dependent Fermi arcs, antinodal pseudogap filling temperature,
pseudogapped density of states in different momentum regions of the Fermi
surface and `bending' of the energy gap versus momentum on the Fermi surface
emerge from the theory.
