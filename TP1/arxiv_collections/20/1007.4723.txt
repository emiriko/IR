The first cluster-based public computing for Monte Carlo simulation in
Indonesia is introduced. The system has been developed to enable public to
perform Monte Carlo simulation on a parallel computer through an integrated and
user friendly dynamic web interface. The beta version, so called
publicMC@BATAN, has been released and implemented for internal users at the
National Nuclear Energy Agency (BATAN). In this paper the concept and
architecture of publicMC@BATAN are presented.
