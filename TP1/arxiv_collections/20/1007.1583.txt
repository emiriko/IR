We evaluate how the curvature dependence of surface tension affects the shape
of electrically charged interfaces between a perfectly conducting fluid and its
vapour. We consider two cases: i) spherical droplets in equilibrium with their
vapour; ii) menisci pending in a capillary tube in presence of a conducting
plate at given electric potential drop. Tolman-like dependence of surface
tension on curvature becomes important when the "nucleation radius" is
comparable with the interface curvature radius. In case i) we prove existence
of the equilibrium minimal radius and estimate its dependence on the electric
field and Tolmanlike curvature effects. In case ii) the menisci are subject to
the gravitational force, surface tension and electrostatic fields We determine
the unknown surface of the menisci to which the potential is assigned using an
iterative numerical method and show that Tolman-like corrections imply: 1) a
variation of the height (up to 10% in some cases) of the tip of the menisci; 2)
a decrease of the maximum electrical potential applicable to the menisci before
their breakdown amounting to 40V over 800V in the considered cases. We
conjecture that these effects could be used in new experiments based on
electric measurements to determine the dependence of the equilibrium surface
tension on curvature
