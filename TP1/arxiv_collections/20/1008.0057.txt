Using first-principles calculations within density functional theory, we
explore the feasibility of converting ternary half-Heusler compounds into a new
class of three-dimensional topological insulators (3DTI). We demonstrate that
the electronic structure of unstrained LaPtBi as a prototype system exhibits
distinct band-inversion feature. The 3DTI phase is realized by applying a
uniaxial strain along the [001] direction, which opens a bandgap while
preserving the inverted band order. A definitive proof of the strained LaPtBi
as a 3DTI is provided by directly calculating the topological Z2 invariants in
systems without inversion symmetry. We discuss the implications of the present
study to other half-Heusler compounds as 3DTI, which, together with the
magnetic and superconducting properties of these materials, may provide a rich
platform for novel quantum phenomena.
