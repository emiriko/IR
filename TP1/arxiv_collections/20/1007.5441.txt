We investigate the extended Hubbard model as an approximation to the local
and spatial entanglement of a one-dimensional chain of nanostructures where the
particles interact via a long range interaction represented by a `soft' Coulomb
potential. In the process we design a protocol to calculate the
particle-particle spatial entanglement for the Hubbard model and show that, in
striking contrast with the loss of spatial degrees of freedom, the predictions
are reasonably accurate. We also compare results for the local entanglement
with previous results found using a contact interaction (PRA, 81 (2010) 052321)
and show that while the extended Hubbard model recovers a better agreement with
the entanglement of a long-range interacting system, there remain realistic
parameter regions where it fails to predict the quantitative and qualitative
behaviour of the entanglement in the nanostructure system.
