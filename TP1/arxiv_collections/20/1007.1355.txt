We investigate the form factors of the chiral-odd nucleon matrix element of
the tensor current. In particular, we aim at the anomalous tensor magnetic form
factors of the nucleon within the framework of the SU(3) and SU(2) chiral
quark-soliton model. We consider $1/N_c$ rotational corrections and linear
effects of SU(3) symmetry breaking with the symmetry-conserving quantization
employed. We first obtain the results of the anomalous tensor magnetic moments
for the up and down quarks: $\kappa_{T}^{u}=3.56$ and $\kappa_{T}^{d}=1.83$,
respectively. The strange anomalous tensor magnetic moment is yielded to be
$\kappa_{T}^{s}=0.2\sim -0.2$, that is compatible with zero. We also calculate
the corresponding form factors $\kappa_{T}^{q}(Q^{2})$ up to a momentum
transfer $Q^{2}\leq 1\,\mathrm{GeV}^{2}$ at a renormalization scale of
$0.36\,\mathrm{GeV}^{2}$.
