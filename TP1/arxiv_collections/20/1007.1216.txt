Theoretical modeling of electroosmosis through conducting (ideally
polarizable) nanochannels is reported. Based on the theory of induced charge
electrokinetics, a novel nanofluidic system which possesses both adjustable ion
selective characteristics and flexible flow control is proposed. Such
nanofluidic devices operate only with very low gate control voltage applied on
the conductive walls of nanochannels, and thus even can be energized by normal
batteries. We believe that it is possible to use such metal-electrolyte
configurations to overcome the difficulties met with conventional
metal-isolator-electrolyte systems for nanofluidic applications.
