In a recent study [C Arita, Phys. Rev. E 80, 051119 (2009)], an extension of
the M/M/1 queueing process with the excluded-volume effect as in the totally
asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) was introduced. In this paper, we
consider its discrete-time version. The update scheme we take is the parallel
one. A stationary-state solution is obtained in a slightly arranged matrix
product form of the discrete-time open TASEP with the parallel update. We find
the phase diagram for the existence of the stationary state. The critical line
which separates the parameter space into the regions with and without the
stationary state can be written in terms of the stationary current of the open
TASEP. We calculate the average length of the system and the average number of
particles.
