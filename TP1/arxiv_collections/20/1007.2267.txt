We report on the high resolution studies of the temperature (T) dependence of
the q=0 phonon spectrum in the quasi one-dimensional charge density wave (CDW)
compound K0.3MoO3 utilizing time-resolved optical spectroscopy. Numerous modes
that appear below Tc show pronounced T-dependences of their amplitudes,
frequencies and dampings. Utilizing the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau theory
we show that these modes result from linear coupling of the electronic part of
the order parameter to the 2kF phonons, while the (electronic) CDW amplitude
mode is overdamped.
