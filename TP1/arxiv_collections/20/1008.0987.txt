We propose a novel dipole trapping scheme using spatial light modulators
(SLM) for the manipulation of individual atoms. The scheme uses a high
numerical aperture microscope to map the intensity distribution of a SLM onto a
cloud of cold atoms. The regions of high intensity act as optical dipole force
traps. With a SLM fast enough to modify the trapping potential in real time,
this technique is well suited for the controlled addressing and manipulation of
arbitrarily selected atoms.
