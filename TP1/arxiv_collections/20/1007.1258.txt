A set of algorithms is presented for efficient numerical calculation of the
time evolution of classical dynamical systems. Starting with a first
approximation for solving the differential equations that has a "reversible"
character, we show how to bootstrap easily to higher order accuracy.The method,
first shown for a single particle in one dimension, is then neatly extended to
many dimensions and many particles.
