We examine the question as to whether the f(R) gravity theories, in both
metric and in Palatini formalisms, permit space-times in which the causality is
violated. We show that the field equations of these f(R) gravity theories admit
solutions with violation of causality for a physically well-motivated
perfect-fluid matter content.
