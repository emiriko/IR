Nonlinear dissipative systems in the state of self-organized criticality
release energy sporadically in avalanches of all sizes, such as in earthquakes,
auroral substorms, solar and stellar flares, soft gamma-ray repeaters, and
pulsar glitches. The statistical occurrence frequency distributions of event
energies $E$ generally exhibit a powerlaw-like function $N(E)\propto
E^{-\alpha_E}$ with a powerlaw slope of $\alpha_E \approx 1.5$. The powerlaw
slope $\alpha_E$ of energies can be related to the fractal dimension $D$ of the
spatial energy dissipation domain by $D=3/\alpha_E$, which predicts a powerlaw
slope $\alpha_E=1.5$ for area-rupturing or area-spreading processes with $D=2$.
For solar and stellar flares, 2-D area-spreading dissipation domains are
naturally provided in current sheets or separatrix surfaces in a magnetic
reconnection region. Thus, this universal scaling law provides a useful new
diagnostic on the topology of the spatial energy dissipation domain in
geophysical and astrophysical observations.
