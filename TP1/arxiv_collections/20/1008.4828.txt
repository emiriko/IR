Three out of four complex components of the Dirac spinor can be algebraically
eliminated from the Dirac equation (if some linear combination of
electromagnetic fields does not vanish), yielding a partial differential
equation of the fourth order for the remaining complex component. This equation
is generally equivalent to the Dirac equation. Furthermore, following
Schr\"{o}dinger (Nature, \textbf{169}, 538 (1952)), the remaining component can
be made real by a gauge transform, thus extending to the Dirac field the
Schr\"{o}dinger's conclusion that charged fields do not necessarily require
complex representation. One of the two resulting real equations for the real
function describes current conservation and can be obtained from the Maxwell
equations in spinor electrodynamics (the Dirac-Maxwell electrodynamics). As the
Dirac equation is one of the most fundamental, these results both belong in
textbooks and can be used for development of new efficient methods and
algorithms of quantum chemistry.
