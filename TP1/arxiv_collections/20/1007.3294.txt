Adiabaticity of quantum evolution is important in many settings. One example
is the adiabatic quantum computation. Nevertheless, up to now, there is no
effective method to test the adiabaticity of the evolution when the
eigenenergies of the driven Hamiltonian are not known. We propose a simple
method to check adiabaticity of a quantum process for an arbitrary quantum
system. We further propose a operational method for finding a uniformly
adiabatic quench scheme based on Kibble-Zurek mechanism for the case when the
initial and the final Hamiltonians are given. This method should help in
implementing adiabatic quantum computation.
