This thesis consists of two parts. The first part deals with gauge/gravity
duality in the context of anti de Sitter (AdS) spacetimes with de Sitter (dS)
boundary, which can be used to study issues concerning strongly coupled field
theory on de Sitter space, such as the issue of vacuum ambiguity. By
calculating the symmetric two point function of the strongly coupled ${\cal N}
= 4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory on de Sitter space, we show that the
vacuum ambiguity persists at strong coupling. Furthermore, the extra ambiguity
in the strong coupling correlator seems to suggest that transition between two
different vacua is allowed. The second part of this thesis deals with the
duality between the rolling tachyon backgrounds in superstring theory and the
Dyson gas systems. This duality can be interpreted as a reformulation of
non-BPS D-branes in superstring theory in terms of statistical systems in
thermal equilibrium, whose description does not include time. We argue that
even though the concept of time is absent in the statistical dual sitting at
equilibrium, the notion of time can emerge at the large number of particles $N
\rightarrow \infty$ limit.
