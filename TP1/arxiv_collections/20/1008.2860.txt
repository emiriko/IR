Communication between cells is realized by exchange of biochemical
substances. Due to internal organization of living systems and variability of
external parameters, the exchange is heavily influenced by perturbations of
various parameters at almost all stages of the process. Since communication is
one of essential processes for functioning of living systems it is of interest
to investigate conditions for its stability. Using previously developed
simplified model of bacterial communication in a form of coupled difference
logistic equations we investigate stability of exchange of signaling molecules
under variability of internal and external parameters.
