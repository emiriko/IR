Special polynomials play a role in several aspects of soliton dynamics. These
are differential polynomials in u, the solution of a nonlinear evolution
equation, which vanish identically when u represents a single soliton. Local
special polynomials contain only powers of u and its spatial derivatives.
Non-local special polynomials contain, in addition, non-local entities (e.g.,
\delta x-1u). When u is a multiple-solitons solution, local special polynomials
are localized in the vicinity of the soliton-collision region and fall off
exponentially in all directions away from this region. Non-local ones are
localized along soliton trajectories.
  Examples are presented of how, with the aid of local special polynomials, one
can modify equations that have only a single-soliton solution into ones, which
have that solution as well as, at least, a two-solitons solutions.
  Given an integrable equation, with the aid of local special polynomials, it
is possible to find all evolution equations in higher scaling weights, which
share the same single-soliton solution and are either integrable, or, at least,
have a two-solitons solution. This is demonstrated for one or two consecutive
scaling weights for a number of known equations.
  In the study of perturbed integrable equations, local special polynomials are
responsible for inelastic soliton interactions generated by the perturbation in
the multiple-soliton case, and for the (possible) loss of asymptotic
integrability. Non-local special polynomials describe higher-order corrections
to the solution, which are of an inelastic nature.
