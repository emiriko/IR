Using the pseudopotential density functional method as well as equilibrium
thermodynamic functions, we explore the process of releasing H2 molecules
adsorbed on a transition metal atom caused by the hydrogen-ammonia partial
pressure difference. The H2 molecules bind to a transition metal atom at H2
pressure-NH3 pressure-temperature 50 atm-10-9 atm-25 {\deg}C, and they are
released at 3 atm-10-6 atm-25 {\deg}C. This process involves the same mechanism
responsible for carbon monoxide poisoning of hemoglobin with the O2-CO partial
pressure difference. We show that our findings can be applicable to an approach
to induce hydrogen desorption on nanostructured hydrogen storage materials
without the need for increasing temperature.
