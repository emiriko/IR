We study the Laplacian-infinity path as an extreme case of the
Laplacian-alpha random walk. Although, in the finite alpha case, there is
reason to believe that the process converges to SLE, we show that this is not
the case when alpha is infinite. In fact, the scaling limit depends heavily on
the lattice structure, and is not conformal (or even rotational) invariant.
