We have studied the electronic structure of EuFe2As2-xPx using high
resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. Upon substituting As with
the isovalent P, which leads to a chemical pressure and to superconductivity,
we observe a non-rigid-band like change of the electronic structure along the
center of the Brillouin zone (BZ): an orbital and kz dependent increase or
decrease in the size of the hole pockets near the Gamma - Z line. On the other
hand, the diameter of the Fermi surface cylinders at the BZ corner forming
electron pockets, hardly changes. This is in stark contrast to p and n-type
doped iron pnictides where, on the basis of ARPES experiments, a more
rigid-band like behavior has been proposed. These findings indicate that there
are different ways in which the nesting conditions can be reduced causing the
destabilization of the antiferromagnetic order and the appearance of the
superconducting dome.
