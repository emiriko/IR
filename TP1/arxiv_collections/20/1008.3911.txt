We extend a model of community isolation in the d-dimensional lattice onto
the case with an imposed imbalance between birth rates of competing
communities. We give analytical and numerical evidences that in the asymmetric
two-specie model there exists a well defined value of the asymmetry parameter
when the emergence of the isolated (blocked) subgroups is the fastest, i.e. the
characteristic time tc is minimal. This critical value of the parameter depends
only on the lattice dimensionality and is independent from the system size.
Similar phenomenon was observed in the multi-specie case with a geometric
distribution of the birth rates. We also show that blocked subgroups in the
multi-specie case are absent or very rare when either there is a strictly
dominant specie that outnumbers the others or when there is a large diversity
of species. The number of blocked species of different kinds decreases with the
dimension of the multi-specie system.
