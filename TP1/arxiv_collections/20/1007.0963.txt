We present a statistical-model description of fission, in the framework of
compound-nucleus decay, which is found to simultaneously reproduce data from
both heavy-ion-induced fusion reactions and proton-induced spallation reactions
at around 1 GeV. For the spallation reactions, the initial compound-nucleus
population is predicted by the Li\`{e}ge Intranuclear Cascade Model. We are
able to reproduce experimental fission probabilities and fission-fragment mass
distributions in both reactions types with the same parameter sets. However, no
unique parameter set was obtained for the fission probability. The introduction
of fission transients can be offset by an increase of the ratio of
level-density parameters for the saddle-point and ground-state configurations.
Changes to the finite-range fission barriers could be offset by a scaling of
the Bohr-Wheeler decay width as predicted by Kramers. The parameter sets
presented allow accurate prediction of fission probabilities for excitation
energies up to 300 MeV and spins up to 60 \hbar.
