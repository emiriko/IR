Phase resetting curves characterize the way a system with a collective
periodic behavior responds to perturbations. We consider globally coupled
ensembles of Sakaguchi-Kuramoto oscillators, and use the Ott-Antonsen theory of
ensemble evolution to derive the analytical phase resetting equations. We show
the final phase reset value to be composed of two parts: an immediate phase
reset directly caused by the perturbation, and the dynamical phase reset
resulting from the relaxation of the perturbed system back to its dynamical
equilibrium. Analytical, semi-analytical and numerical approximations of the
final phase resetting curve are constructed. We support our findings with
extensive numerical evidence involving identical and non-identical oscillators.
The validity of our theory is discussed in the context of large ensembles
approximating the thermodynamic limit.
