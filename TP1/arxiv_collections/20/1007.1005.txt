In this paper, we study the recent excess of low energy events observed by
the CoGeNT collaboration and the annual modulation reported by the DAMA/LIBRA
collaboration, and discuss whether these signals could both be the result of
the same elastically scattering dark matter particle. We find that, without
channeling but when taking into account uncertainties in the relevant quenching
factors, a dark matter candidate with a mass of approximately ~7.0 GeV and a
cross section with nucleons of sigma_{DM-N} ~2x10^-4 pb (2x10^-40 cm^2) could
account for both of these observations. We also comment on the events recently
observed in the oxygen band of the CRESST experiment and point out that these
could potentially be explained by such a particle. Lastly, we compare the
region of parameter space favored by DAMA/LIBRA and CoGeNT to the constraints
from XENON 10, XENON 100, and CDMS (Si) and find that these experiments cannot
at this time rule out a dark matter interpretation of these signals.
