Trapped diatomic molecular ions could prove to be a sensitive probe for a
permanent electron electric dipole moment (eEDM). We propose to use a ground or
metastable $^3\Delta_1$ level, due to its high polarizability and large EDM
enhancement factor. Ions allow for simple trapping and long interrogation
times, but require a time-varying electric bias field in order to probe the
eEDM. We discuss experimental design as well as challenges in performing a
precision spectroscopic measurement in rapidly time-varying electric fields.
