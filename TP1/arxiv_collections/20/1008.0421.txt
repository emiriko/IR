When point vortex equilibria of the 2D Euler equations are used as initial
conditions for the corre- sponding Navier-Stokes equations (viscous), typically
an interesting dynamical process unfolds at short and intermediate time scales,
before the long time single peaked, self-similar Oseen vortex state dom-
inates. In this paper, we describe the viscous evolution of a collinear three
vortex structure that cor- responds to an inviscid point vortex fixed
equilibrium. Using a multi-Gaussian 'core-growth' type of model, we show that
the system immediately begins to rotate unsteadily, a mechanism we attribute to
a 'viscously induced' instability. We then examine in detail the qualitative
and quantitative evolution of the system as it evolves toward the long-time
asymptotic Lamb-Oseen state, showing the sequence of topological bifurcations
that occur both in a fixed reference frame, and in an appropriately chosen
rotating reference frame. The evolution of passive particles in this viscously
evolving flow is shown and interpreted in relation to these evolving streamline
patterns.
