For stochastic processes $\{X_t:t\in E\}$, we establish sufficient conditions
for the empirical process based on $\{I_{X_t\le y}-\operatorname{Pr}(X_t\le
y):t\in E,y\in\mathbb{R}\}$ to satisfy the CLT uniformly in $t\in
E,y\in\mathbb{R}$. Corollaries of our main result include examples of classical
processes where the CLT holds, and we also show that it fails for Brownian
motion tied down at zero and $E=[0,1]$.
