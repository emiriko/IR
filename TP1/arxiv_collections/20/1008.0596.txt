We construct an Enriques surface X over Q with empty \'etale-Brauer set (and
hence no rational points) for which there is no algebraic Brauer-Manin
obstruction to the Hasse principle. In addition, if there is a transcendental
obstruction on X, then we obtain a K3 surface that has a transcendental
obstruction to the Hasse principle.
