139La NMR study was performed in grain aligned (c|| H0) sample of LaCoPO and
polycrystalline LaFePO. Knight shift is isotropic and temperature independent
in LaFePO. It is strongly temperature dependent and anisotropic in LaCoPO. The
spin-lattice relaxation rate in LaCoPO clearly reveals the existence of 3D spin
fluctuations both in the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic state over and above
the dominant 2D spin fluctuations in the paramagnetic state, observed earlier
from 31P NMR measurements in the same oriented sample. The spin fluctuation
parameters in LaCoPO determined from 139La NMR relaxation and magnetization
data, using the self consistent renormalization (SCR) theory, are in close
agreement and follow the universal Rhodes-Wohlfarth curve.
