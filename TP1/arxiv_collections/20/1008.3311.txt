Irreversible logic circuits dissipate heat for every bit of information that
is lost. Information is lost when the input vector cannot be recovered from its
corresponding output vector. Reversible logic circuit naturally takes care of
heating because it implements only the functions that have one-to-one mapping
between its input and output vectors. Therefore reversible logic design becomes
one of the promising research directions in low power dissipating circuit
design in the past few years and has found its application in low power CMOS
design, digital signal processing and nanotechnology. This paper presents the
efficient approaches for designing reversible fast adders that implement carry
look-ahead and carry-skip logic. The proposed 16-bit high speed reversible
adder will include IG gates for the realization of its basic building block.
The IG gate is universal in the sense that it can be used to synthesize any
arbitrary Boolean-functions. The IG gate is parity preserving, that is, the
parity of the inputs matches the parity of the outputs. It allows any fault
that affects no more than a single signal readily detectable at the circuit's
primary outputs. Therefore, the proposed high speed adders will have the
inherent opportunity of detecting errors in its output side. It has also been
demonstrated that the proposed design offers less hardware complexity and is
efficient in terms of gate count, garbage outputs and constant inputs than the
existing counterparts.
