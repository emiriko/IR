We analyze a scalar potential of the minimal supersymmetric standard model
(MSSM) with neutrino mass operators along Unbounded-From-Below (UFB) and Color
and/or Charged Breaking (CCB) directions. We show necessary conditions to avoid
the potential minima which can be deeper than the realistic vacuum. These
conditions would constrain more strongly than conditions in the MSSM without
taking into account neutrino mass operators, and can improve the predictive
power of supersymmetric models with neutrino mass operators.
