The dispersion of phonons and the electronic structure of graphene systems
can be obtained experimentally from the double-resonance (DR) Raman features by
varying the excitation laser energy. In a previous resonance Raman
investigation of graphene, the electronic structure was analyzed in the
framework of the Slonczewski-Weiss-McClure (SWM) model, considering the outer
DR process. In this work we analyze the data considering the inner DR process,
and obtain SWM parameters that are in better agreement with those obtained from
other experimental techniques. This result possibly shows that there is still a
fundamental open question concerning the double resonance process in graphene
systems.
