Cyanation C60 to C60(CN)18 and aziridination from C60 to C60(NH)9 have been
studied by unrestricted broken spin symmetry Hartree-Fock approach implemented
in semiempirical codes based on AM1 technique. The calculations were focused on
successive addition of CN and NH moieties to the fullerene cage following the
indication of the cage target atoms by the highest atomic chemical
susceptibility calculated at each step. The obtained results are analyzed from
the viewpoint of criteria on parallelism between these derivatives as well as
C60 fluorides and hydrides. The difference of the first stage C60 chlorination
from other sterically free processes is discussed.
