In this talk it is reported on an analysis of hard exclusive pion
electroproduction within the handbag approach. Particular emphasis is laid on
single-spin asymmetries. It is argued that a recent HERMES measurement of
asymmetries measured with a transversely polarized target clearly indicate the
occurrence of strong contributions from transversely polarized photons. Within
the handbag approach such gamma_T --> pion transitions are described by the
transversity GPDs accompanied by a twist-3 pion wave function. It is shown that
this approach leads to results on cross sections and single-spin asymmetries in
fair agreement with experiment.
