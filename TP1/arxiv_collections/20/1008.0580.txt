In supersymmetric models with Dirac neutrino masses, a left-right mixed
sneutrino can be a viable dark matter candidate. We examine the
MSSM+$\tilde\nu_R$ parameter space where this is the case with particular
emphasis on light sneutrinos with masses below 10 GeV. We discuss implications
for direct and indirect dark matter searches, including the relevant
uncertainties, as well as consequences for collider phenomenology.
