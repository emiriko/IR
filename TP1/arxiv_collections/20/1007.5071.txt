We analyze the formation of localized surface modes on a nonlinear cubic
waveguide array in the presence of exponentially-decreasing long-range
interactions. We find that the long-range coupling induces a strong asymmetry
between the focusing and defocusing cases for the topology of the surface modes
and also for the minimum power needed to generate them. In particular, for the
defocusing case, there is an upper power threshold for exciting staggered
modes, which depends strongly on the long-range coupling strength. The power
threshold for dynamical excitation of surface modes increase (decrease) with
the strength of long-range coupling for the focusing (defocusing) cases. These
effects seem to be generic for discrete lattices with long-range interactions.
