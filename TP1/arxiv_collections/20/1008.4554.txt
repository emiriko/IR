The BOUT++ code is used to simulate ELMs in a shifted circle equilibrium.
Reduced ideal MHD simulations are first benchmarked against the linear ideal
MHD code ELITE, showing good agreement. Diamagnetic drift effects are included
finding the expected suppression of high toroidal mode number modes. Nonlinear
simulations are performed, making the assumption that the anomalous kinematic
electron viscosity is comparable to the anomalous electron thermal diffusivity.
This allows simulations with realistically high Lundquist numbers S = 1e8,
finding ELM sizes of 5-10% of the pedestal stored thermal energy. Scans show a
strong dependence of the ELM size resistivity at low Lundquist numbers, with
higher resistivity leading to more violent eruptions. At high Lundquist numbers
relevant to high-performance discharges, ELM size is independent of resistivity
as hyper-resistivity becomes the dominant dissipative effect.
