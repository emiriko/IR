Product Data Management (PDM) aims to provide 'Systems' contributing in
industries by electronically maintaining organizational data, improving data
repository system, facilitating with easy access to CAD and providing
additional information engineering and management modules to access, store,
integrate, secure, recover and manage information. Targeting one of the
unresolved issues i.e., provision of natural language based processor for the
implementation of an intelligent record search mechanism, an approach is
proposed and discussed in detail in this manuscript. Designing an intelligent
application capable of reading and analyzing user's structured and unstructured
natural language based text requests and then extracting desired concrete and
optimized results from knowledge base is still a challenging task for the
designers because it is still very difficult to completely extract Meta data
out of raw data. Residing within the limited scope of current research and
development; we present an approach capable of reading user's natural language
based input text, understanding the semantic and extracting results from
repositories. To evaluate the effectiveness of implemented prototyped version
of proposed approach, it is compared with some existing PDM Systems, in the end
the discussion is concluded with an abstract presentation of resultant
comparison amongst implemented prototype and some existing PDM Systems.
