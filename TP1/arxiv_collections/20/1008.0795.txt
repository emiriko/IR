We report on the first experimental demonstration of higher-order
Laguerre-Gauss (LGpl) mode generation and interferometry using a method
scalable to the requirements of gravitational wave (GW) detection. GW detectors
which use higher-order LGpl modes will be less susceptible to mirror thermal
noise, which is expected to limit the sensitivity of all currently planned
terrestrial detectors. We used a diffractive optic and a mode-cleaner cavity to
convert a fundamental LG00 Gaussian beam into an LG33 mode with a purity of
98%. The ratio between the power of the LG00 mode of our laser and the power of
the LG33 transmitted by the cavity was 36%. By measuring the transmission of
our setup using the LG00, we inferred that the conversion efficiency specific
to the LG33 mode was 49%. We illuminated a Michelson interferometer with the
LG33 beam and achieved a visibility of 97%.
