Maya Blue is actually one of the best known examples of an organic-inorganic
hybrid material. Yet despite 50 years of sustained interest, its microscopic
structure and its relation to durability remain open questions. We address the
issue by archaeomimetism: engineering an archaeoinspired pigment,
satisfactorily reproducing the colour and chemical stability of Maya Blue. By
comparing and contrasting ancient pigment and the new analogue, we deduce a new
explanation for this durability.
