Supersymmetry is an attractive extension of the standard model of particle
physics. It associates to every bosonic degree of freedom a fermionic one and
vice versa. Supersymmetry unifies the coupling constants of the
electromagnetic, weak and strong forces at a high scale and provides a
candidate for the elusive dark matter. Supersymmetry could be discovered at the
LHC, the proton--proton collider at CERN which has started operations in 2008.
The LHC is foreseen to have a center--of--mass energy of 14~TeV, opening up a
new mass range to be explored to search for supersymmetric particles with the
ATLAS and CMS experiments. The development and production of electronics for
these detectors has been a challenge, e.g. for the readout board for the
electromagnetic calorimeter. Reconstructing the physics events with the best
precision, in particular the reconstruction and identification of electrons and
photons in the large QCD background has been prepared in extensive test beam
studies and Monte Carlo simulations. If the Higgs boson and supersymmetry are
discovered, the properties of the (s)particles such as the masses, branching
ratios must be measured precisely, either at the LHC or at a future e+e- linear
collider. The SFitter project aims to determine the underlying theoretical
model parameters from the correlated experimental measurements including
theoretical errors. The methods are applied to the extraction of the
fundamental parameters of supersymmetry as well the measurement of the Higgs
boson couplings at the LHC. The extrapolation of the supersymmetric parameters
from the weak scale to the Grand Unification Scale could provide the basis
towards the inclusion of gravity.
