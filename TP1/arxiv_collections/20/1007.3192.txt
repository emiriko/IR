The lowest excitation energies of the given multipole J^pi state (the J^pi
yrast energies) are given for even-even nuclei throughout the entire periodic
table. The yrast energies were calculated using the recently proposed empirical
formula that depends only on the mass number A, and the valence nucleon numbers
Np and Nn. We provide a complete tabulation and plots of the yrast energies
calculated using the empirical formula together with the ones measured for the
natural parity states up to 10+ and for the unnatural parity states up to 10^+
with the hope of encouraging active study on the possible origin of the
relationship between the yrast energies, as revealed by the empirical formula.
