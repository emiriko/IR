We consider the thermodynamic potential describing the macroscopic
fluctuation of the current and local energy of a general class of Hamiltonian
models including aerogels. We argue that this potential is neither analytic nor
strictly convex, a property that should be expected in general but missing from
models studied in the literature. This opens the possibility of describing in
terms of a thermodynamic potential non-equilibrium phase transitions in a
concrete physical context. This special behaviour of the thermodynamic
potential is caused by the fact that the energy current is carried by particles
which may have arbitrary low speed with sufficiently large probability.
