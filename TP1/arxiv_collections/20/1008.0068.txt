We employ Hamiltonian light-front quantum field theory in a basis function
approach to solve the non-perturbative problem of an electron in a strong
scalar transverse confining potential. We evaluate both the invariant mass
spectra and the anomalous magnetic moment of the lowest state for this
two-scale system. The weak external field limit of the anomalous magnetic
moment agrees with the result of QED perturbation theory within the anticipated
accuracy.
