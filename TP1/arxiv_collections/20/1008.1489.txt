These are the lecture notes based on earlier papers with some additional new
results. New and simple proofs are given for local freeness theorem and the
semipositivity theorem. A decomposition theorem for higher direct images of
dualizing sheaves of Koll\'ar is extended to the sheaves of differential forms
of arbitrary degrees in the case of a well prepared birational model. We will
also prove the log versions of some of the results, i.e., the case where we
allow horizontal boundary components.
