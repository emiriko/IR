The measurement of the coherent-population-trapping (CPT) resonances in
uncoated Rb vacuum cells has shown that the shape of the resonances is
different in different cells. In some cells the resonance has a complex shape -
a narrow Lorentzian structure, which is not power broadened, superimposed on
the power broadened CPT resonance. The results of the performed investigations
on the fluorescence angular distribution are in agreement with the assumption
that the narrow structure is a result of atom interaction with Rayleigh
scattering light. The results are interesting for indication of the vacuum
cleanness of the cells and building of magnetooptical sensors.
