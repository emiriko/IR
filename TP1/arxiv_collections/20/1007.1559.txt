Concern for the human security inside mines is as old as the mining itself.
However, ICT (Information and communication technologies), which has impacted
human life in so many ways has not been much used for making mines safer. We
propose a method that has been practically implemented which can enhance mine
safety enormously. It is based on integration of wireless sensor network with
an external network through a gateway.
