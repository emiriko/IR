LINC-NIRVANA will realize the interferometric imaging focal station of the
Large Binocular Telescope. A double Layer Oriented multi-conjugate adaptive
optics system assists the two arms of the interferometer, supplying high order
wave-front correction. In order to counterbalance the field rotation,
mechanical derotation for the two ground wave-front sensors, and optical
derotators for the mid-high layers sensors fix the positions of the focal
planes with respect to the pyramids aboard the wave-front sensors. The
derotation introduces pupil images rotation on the wavefront sensors: the
projection of the deformable mirrors on the sensor consequently change. The
proper adjustment of the control matrix will be applied in real-time through
numerical computation of the new matrix. In this paper we investigate the
temporal and computational aspects related to the pupils rotation, explicitly
computing the wave-front errors that may be generated.
