The statistical mechanics of a linear non-interacting polymer chain with a
large number of monomers is considered with fixed angular momentum. The radius
of gyration for a linear polymer is derived exactly by functional integration.
This result is then compared to simulations done with a large number of
non-interacting rigid links at fixed angular momentum. The simulation agrees
with the theory up to finite size corrections. The simulations are also used to
investigate the anisotropic nature of a spinning polymer. We find universal
scaling of the polymer size along the direction of the angular momentum, as a
function of rescaled angular momentum.
