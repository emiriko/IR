The dynamical behaviours of a kinetically constrained spin model
(Fredrickson-Andersen model) on a Bethe lattice are investigated by a
perturbation analysis that provides exact final states above the nonergodic
transition point. It is observed that the time-dependent solutions of the
derived dynamical systems obtained by the perturbation analysis become
systematically closer to the results obtained by Monte Carlo simulations as the
order of a perturbation series is increased. This systematic perturbation
analysis also clarifies the existence of a dynamical scaling law, which
provides a implication for a universal relation between a size scale and a time
scale near the nonergodic transition.
