Accurate spectroscopic constants and electrical properties of small molecules
are determined by means of W4 and post-W4 theories. For a set of 28 first- and
second-row diatomic molecules for which very accurate experimental
spectroscopic constants are available, W4 theory affords near-spectroscopic or
better predictions. Specifically, the root-mean-square deviations (RMSD) from
experiment are 0.04 pm for the equilibrium bond distances (r_e), 1.03 cm^{-1}
for the harmonic frequencies (\omega_e), 0.20 cm^{-1} for the first
anharmonicity constants (\omega_e x_e), 0.10 cm^{-1} for the second
anharmonicity constants (\omega_e y_e), and 0.001 cm^{-1} for the
vibration-rotation coupling constants (\alpha_e). Higher-order connected
triples, \hat{T}_3-(T), improve agreement with experiment for the hydride
systems, but their inclusion (in the absence of \hat{T}_4) tends to worsen
agreement with experiment for the nonhydride systems. Connected quadruple
excitations, \hat{T}_4, have significant and systematic effects on r_e,
\omega_e, and \omega_e x_e, in particular they universally increase r_e (by up
to 0.5 pm), universally reduce \omega_e (by up to 32 cm^{-1}), and universally
increase \omega_e x_e (by up to 1 cm^{-1}). Connected quintuple excitations,
\hat{T}_5, are spectroscopically significant for \omega_e of the nonhydride
systems, affecting \omega_e by up to 4 cm^{-1}. The triatomic molecules H_2O,
CO_2, and O_3, as well as the pathologically multireference BN and BeO
diatomics, are also considered. The asymmetric stretch of ozone represents a
severe challenge to W4 theory, in particular the connected quadruple
contribution converges very slowly with the basis set size. Finally, the
importance of post-CCSD(T) correlation effects for electrical properties,
namely dipole moments (\mu), polarizabilities (\alpha), and first
hyperpolarizabilities (\beta) is evaluated.
