A symmetric quiver $(Q,\sigma)$ is a finite quiver without oriented cycles
$Q=(Q_0,Q_1)$ equipped with a contravariant involution $\sigma$ on $Q_0\sqcup
Q_1$. The involution allows us to define a nondegenerate bilinear form $<,>$ on
a representation $V$ of $Q$. We shall say that $V$ is orthogonal if $<,>$ is
symmetric and symplectic if $<,>$ is skew-symmetric. Moreover, we define an
action of products of classical groups on the space of orthogonal
representations and on the space of symplectic representations. So we prove
that if $(Q,\sigma)$ is a symmetric quiver of tame type then the rings of
semi-invariants for this action are spanned by the semi-invariants of
determinantal type $c^V$ and, when matrix defining $c^V$ is skew-symmetric, by
the Pfaffians $pf^V$. To prove it, moreover, we describe the symplectic and
orthogonal generic decomposition of a symmetric dimension vector.
