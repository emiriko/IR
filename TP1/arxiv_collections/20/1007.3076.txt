Using formal definitions for measurement precision {\epsilon} and disturbance
(measurement backaction) {\eta}, Ozawa [Phys. Rev. A 67, 042105 (2003)] has
shown that Heisenberg's claimed relation between these quantities is false in
general. Here we show that the quantities introduced by Ozawa can be determined
experimentally, using no prior knowledge of the measurement under investigation
--- both quantities correspond to the root-mean-squared difference given by a
weak-valued probability distribution. We propose a simple three-qubit
experiment which would illustrate the failure of Heisenberg's
measurement--disturbance relation, and the validity of an alternative relation
proposed by Ozawa.
