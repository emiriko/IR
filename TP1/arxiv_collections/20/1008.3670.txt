An experimental test of the Newtonian inverse square law at short range has
been used to set limits on Lorentz violation in the pure gravity sector of the
Standard-Model Extension. On account of the planar test mass geometry,
nominally null with respect to inverse square forces, the limits derived for
the SME coefficients of Lorentz violation are on the order s ~ 10000.
