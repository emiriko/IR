The long-standing identification problem for causal effects in graphical
models has many partial results but lacks a systematic study. We show how
computer algebra can be used to either prove that a causal effect can be
identified, generically identified, or show that the effect is not generically
identifiable. We report on the results of our computations for linear
structural equation models, where we determine precisely which causal effects
are generically identifiable for all graphs on three and four vertices.
