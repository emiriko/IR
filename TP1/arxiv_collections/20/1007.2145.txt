A highly asymmetric dynamic nuclear spin pumping is observed in a single self
assembled InGaAs quantum dot subject to resonant optical pumping of the neutral
exciton transition leading to a large maximum polarization of 54%. This dynamic
nuclear polarization is found to be much stronger following pumping of the
higher energy Zeeman state. Time-resolved measurements allow us to directly
monitor the buildup of the nuclear spin polarization in real time and to
quantitatively study the dynamics of the process. A strong dependence of the
observed dynamic nuclear polarization on the applied magnetic field is found,
with resonances in the pumping efficiency being observed for particular
magnetic fields. We develop a model that fully accounts for the observed
behaviour, where the pumping of the nuclear spin system is due to
hyperfine-mediated spin flip transitions between the states of the neutral
exciton manifold.
