The atomic deposited BN films with the thickness of nanometers (ABN) were
prepared by radio frequency magnetron sputtering method and the nanostructured
BN films (CBN) were prepared by Low Energy Cluster Beam Deposition. UV-Vis
Absorption measurement proves the band gap of 4.27eV and field emission of the
BN films were carried out. F-N plots of all the samples give a good fitting and
demonstrate the F-N tunneling of the emission process. The emission of ABN
begins at the electric field of 14.6 V/{\mu}m while that of CBN starts at
5.10V/{\mu}m. Emission current density of 1mA/cm2 for ABN needs the field of
20V/{\mu}m while that of CBN needs only 12.1V/{\mu}m. The cluster-deposited BN
on n-type Silicon substrate proves a good performance in terms of the lower
gauge voltage, more emission sites and higher electron intensity and seems a
promising substitute for the cascade of Field Emission.
