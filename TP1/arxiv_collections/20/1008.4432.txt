We study the initial and final state interaction effects in the transverse
momentum dependent parton distributions in the small-$x$ saturation region. In
particular, we discuss the quark distributions in the semi-inclusive deep
inelastic scattering, Drell-Yan lepton pair production and dijet-correlation
processes in $pA$ collisions. We calculate the quark distributions in the
scalar-QED model and then extend to the color glass condensate formalism in
QCD. The quark distributions are found universal between the DIS and Drell-Yan
processes. On the other hand, the quark distribution from the $qq'\to qq'$
channel contribution to the dijet-correlation process is not universal.
However, we find that it can be related to the quark distribution in DIS
process by a convolution with the normalized unintegrated gluon distribution in
the color glass condensate formalism in the large $N_c$ limit.
