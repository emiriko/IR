Debris disc analysis and modelling provide crucial information about the
structure and the processes at play in extrasolar planetary systems. In binary
systems, this issue is more complex because the disc should in addition respond
to the companion star's perturbations. We explore the dynamical evolution of a
collisionally active debris disc for different initial parent body populations,
diverse binary configurations and optical depths. We focus on the radial extent
and size distribution of the disc at a stationary state. We numerically follow
the evolution of $10^{5}$ massless small grains, initially produced from a
circumprimary disc of parent bodies following a size distribution in $dN
\propto s^{-3.5}$ds . Grains are submitted to both stars' gravity as well as
radiation pressure. In addition, particles are assigned an empirically derived
collisional lifetime. For all the binary configurations the disc extends far
beyond the critical semimajor axis $a_crit$ for orbital stability. This is due
to the steady production of small grains, placed on eccentric orbits reaching
beyond $a_crit$ by radiation pressure. The amount of matter beyond acrit
depends on the balance between collisional production and dynamical removal
rates: it increases for more massive discs as well as for eccentric binaries.
Another important effect is that, in the dynamically stable region, the disc is
depleted from its smallest grains. Both results could lead to observable
signatures. We have shown that a companion star can never fully truncate a
collisionally active disc. For eccentric companions, grains in the unstable
regions can significantly contribute to the thermal emission in the mid-IR.
Discs with sharp outer edges, especially bright ones such as HR4796A, are
probably shaped by other mechanisms.
