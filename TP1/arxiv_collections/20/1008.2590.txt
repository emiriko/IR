Streams are infinite sequences over a given data type. A stream specification
is a set of equations intended to define a stream. We propose a transformation
from such a stream specification to a term rewriting system (TRS) in such a way
that termination of the resulting TRS implies that the stream specification is
well-defined, that is, admits a unique solution. As a consequence, proving
well-definedness of several interesting stream specifications can be done fully
automatically using present powerful tools for proving TRS termination. In
order to increase the power of this approach, we investigate transformations
that preserve semantics and well-definedness. We give examples for which the
above mentioned technique applies for the ransformed specification while it
fails for the original one.
