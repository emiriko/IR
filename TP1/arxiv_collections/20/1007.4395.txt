In high-energy processes near the endpoint, there emerge new contributions
associated with spectator interactions. Away from the endpoint region, these
new contributions are suppressed compared to the leading contribution, but the
leading contribution becomes suppressed as we approach the endpoint and the new
contributions become comparable. We present how the new contributions scale as
we reach the endpoint and show that they are comparable to the suppressed
leading contributions in deep-inelastic scattering by employing a power
counting analysis. The hadronic tensor in deep-inelastic scattering is shown to
factorize including the spectator interactions, and it can be expressed in
terms of the lightcone distribution amplitudes of initial hadrons. We also
consider the contribution of the spectator contributions in Drell-Yan
processes. Here the spectator interactions are suppressed compared to double
parton annihilation according to the power counting.
