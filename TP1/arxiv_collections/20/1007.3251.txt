The number of bound states due to inhomogeneities in a BCS superconductor is
usually established either by variational means or via exact solutions of
particularly simple, symmetric perturbations. Here we propose estimating the
number of sub-gap states using the Birman-Schwinger principle. We show how to
obtain upper bounds on the number of sub-gap states for small normal regions
and derive a suitable Cwikel-Lieb-Rozenblum inequality. We also estimate the
number of such states for large normal regions using high dimensional
generalizations of the Szego theorem. The method works equally well for local
inhomogeneities of the order parameter and for external potentials.
