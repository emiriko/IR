Web Services and mobile data services are the newest trends in information
systems engineering in wired and wireless domains, respectively. Web Services
have a broad range of service distributions while mobile phones have large and
expanding user base. To address the confluence of Web Services and pervasive
mobile devices and communication environments, a basic mobile Web Service
provider was developed for smart phones. The performance of this Mobile Host
was also analyzed in detail. Further analysis of the Mobile Host to provide
proper QoS and to check Mobile Host's feasibility in the P2P networks,
identified the necessity of a mediation framework. The paper describes the
research conducted with the Mobile Host, identifies the tasks of the mediation
framework and then discusses the feasible realization details of such a mobile
Web Services mediation framework.
