Magnetic confinement in graphene has been of recent and growing interest
because its potential applications in nanotechnology. In particular, the
observation of the so called magnetic edge states in graphene has opened the
possibility to deepen into the generation of spin currents and its applications
in spintronics. We study the magnetic edge states of quasi-particles arising in
graphene monolayers due to an inhomogeneous magnetic field of a magnetic
barrier in the formalism of the two-dimensional massless Dirac equation. We
also show how the solutions of such states in each of both triangular
sublattices of the graphene are related through a supersymmetric transformation
in the quantum mechanical sense.
