The chiral edge channels in the quantum Hall regime are considered ideal
ballistic quantum channels, and have quantum information processing
potentialities. Here, we demonstrate experimentally, at filling factor 2, the
efficient tuning of the energy relaxation that limits quantum coherence and
permits the return toward equilibrium. Energy relaxation along an edge channel
is controllably enhanced by increasing its transmission toward a floating ohmic
contact, in quantitative agreement with predictions. Moreover, by forming a
closed inner edge channel loop, we freeze energy exchanges in the outer
channel. This result also elucidates the inelastic mechanisms at work at
filling factor 2, informing us in particular that those within the outer edge
channel are negligible.
