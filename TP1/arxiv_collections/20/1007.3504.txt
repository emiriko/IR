We obtain the output characteristics of graphene field-effect transistors by
using the charge-control model for the current, based on the solution of the
Boltzmann equation in the field-dependent relaxation time approximation. Closed
expressions for the conductance, transconductance and saturation voltage are
derived. We found good agreement with the experimental data of Meric et al.
[1], without assuming a carrier density-dependent velocity saturation.
