Nonlinear real-time response of interacting particles is studied on the
example of a one-dimensional tight-binding model of spinless fermions driven by
electric field. Using equations of motion and numerical methods we show that
for a non-integrable case at finite temperatures the major effect of
nonlinearity can be taken into account within the linear response formalism
extended by a renormalization of the kinetic energy due to the Joule heating.
On the other hand, integrable systems show on constant driving a different
universality with a damped oscillating current whereby the frequency is related
but not equal to the Bloch oscillations.
