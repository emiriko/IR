A continuum electromechanical model is proposed to describe the membrane
curvature induced by electrostatic interactions in a solvated protein-membrane
system. The model couples the macroscopic strain energy of membrane and the
electrostatic solvation energy of the system, and equilibrium membrane
deformation is obtained by minimizing the electro-elastic energy functional
with respect to the dielectric interface. The model is illustrated with the
systems with increasing geometry complexity and captures the sensitivity of
membrane curvature to the permanent and mobile charge distributions.
