The established concept of black hole emerged from several results founded on
Einstein's General Theory of Relativity. In this article, the relationship
between these results is analyzed, and it is pointed out how, in spite of being
individually correct, the sum of all them do not actually determine the
existence of black holes. Some logical incompatibilities in the standard Black
Hole model are put into evidence, and the alternative scheme of the
Never-Stationary Gravitational Collapse is defended. To illustrate the essence
of the new paradigm, a simple but conceptually complete toy model is worked out
and a qualitatively suitable metric for Never-Stationary Gravitational Collapse
is presented.
