We report the first terahertz Kerr measurements on bulk crystals of the
topological insulator Bi2Se3. At T=10K and fields up to 8T, the real and
imaginary Kerr angle and reflectance measurements utilizing both linearly and
circularly polarized incident radiation were measured at a frequency of
5.24meV. A single fluid free carrier bulk response can not describe the
line-shape. Surface states with a small mass and surprisingly large associated
spectral weight quantitatively fit all data. However, carrier concentration
inhomogeneity has not been ruled out. A method employing a gate is shown to be
promising for separating surface from bulk effects.
