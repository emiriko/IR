Optomechanical coupling between a mechanical oscillator and light trapped in
a cavity increases when the coupling takes place in a reduced volume. Here we
demonstrate a GaAs semiconductor optomechanical disk system where both optical
and mechanical energy can be confined in a sub-micron scale interaction volume.
We observe giant optomechanical coupling rate up to 100 GHz/nm involving
picogram mass mechanical modes with frequency between 100 MHz and 1 GHz. The
mechanical modes are singled-out measuring their dispersion as a function of
disk geometry. Their Brownian motion is optically resolved with a sensitivity
of 10^(-17)m/sqrt(Hz) at room temperature and pressure, approaching the quantum
limit imprecision.
