We predict that in a bulk type-1.5 superconductor the competing magnetic
responses of the two components of the order parameter can result in a vortex
interaction that generates group-stabilized giant vortices and unusual vortex
rings in the absence of any extrinsic pinning or confinement mechanism. We also
find within the Ginzburg-Landau theory a rich phase diagram with successions of
behaviors like type-1 -> type-1.5 -> type-2 -> type-1.5 as temperature
decreases.
