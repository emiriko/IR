In this paper we prove dispersive estimates for the system formed by two
coupled discrete Schr\"odinger equations. We obtain estimates for the resolvent
of the discrete operator and prove that it satisfies the limiting absorption
principle. The decay of the solutions is proved by using classical and some new
results on oscillatory integrals.
