(Aims.) SNR RX J1713.7-3946 is perhaps one of the best observed shell-type
supernova remnants with emissions dominated by energetic particles accelerated
near the shock front. The nature of the TeV emission, however, is an issue
still open to investigation. (Methods.) We carry out a systematic study of four
lepton models for the TeV emission with the Markov chain Monte Carlo method.
(Results.) It is shown that current data already give good constraints on the
model parameters. Two commonly used parametric models do not appear to fit the
observed radio, X-ray, and gamma-ray spectra. Models motivated by diffusive
shock acceleration and by stochastic acceleration by compressive waves in the
shock downstream give comparably good fits. The former has a sharper spectral
cutoff in the hard X-ray band than the latter. Future observations with the
HXMT and NuSTAR may distinguish these two models.
