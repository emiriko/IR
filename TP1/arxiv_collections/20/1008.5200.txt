We develop an iterative, numerically exact approach for the treatment of
nonequilibrium quantum transport and dissipation problems that avoids the
real-time sign problem associated with standard Monte Carlo techniques. The
method requires a well-defined decorrelation time of the non-local influence
functional for proper convergence to the exact limit. Since finite
decorrelation times may arise either from temperature or from a voltage drop at
zero temperature, the approach is well suited for the description of the
real-time dynamics of single-molecule devices and quantum dots driven to a
steady-state via interaction with two or more electron leads. We numerically
investigate two non-trivial models: the evolution of the nonequilibrium
population of a two-level system coupled to two electronic reservoirs, and
quantum transport in the nonequilibrium Anderson model. For the latter case,
two distinct formulations are described. Results are compared to those obtained
by other techniques.
