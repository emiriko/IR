With the advancement of technology and reduced storage costs, individuals and
organizations are tending towards the usage of electronic media for storing
textual information and documents. It is time consuming for readers to retrieve
relevant information from unstructured document collection. It is easier and
less time consuming to find documents from a large collection when the
collection is ordered or classified by group or category. The problem of
finding best such grouping is still there. This paper discusses the
implementation of k-Means clustering algorithm for clustering unstructured text
documents that we implemented, beginning with the representation of
unstructured text and reaching the resulting set of clusters. Based on the
analysis of resulting clusters for a sample set of documents, we have also
proposed a technique to represent documents that can further improve the
clustering result.
