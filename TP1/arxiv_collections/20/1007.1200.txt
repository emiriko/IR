The contribution of $B$ meson decays to non-photonic electrons, which are
mainly produced by the semi-leptonic decays of heavy flavor mesons, in $p+p$
collisions at $\sqrt{s} =$ 200 GeV has been measured using azimuthal
correlations between non-photonic electrons and hadrons. The extracted $B$
decay contribution is approximately 50% at a transverse momentum of $p_{T} \geq
5$ GeV/$c$. These measurements constrain the nuclear modification factor for
electrons from $B$ and $D$ meson decays. The result indicates that $B$ meson
production in heavy ion collisions is also suppressed at high $p_{T}$.
