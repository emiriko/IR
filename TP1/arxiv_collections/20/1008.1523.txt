A system of three spin-1/2 atoms allows the construction of a
reference-frame-free (RFF) qubit in the subspace with total angular momentum
$j=1/2$. The RFF qubit stays coherent perfectly as long as the spins of the
three atoms are affected homogeneously. The inhomogeneous evolution of the
atoms causes decoherence, but this decoherence can be suppressed efficiently by
applying a bias magnetic field of modest strength perpendicular to the plane of
the atoms. The resulting lifetime of the RFF qubit can be many days, making RFF
qubits of this kind promising candidates for quantum information storage units.
Specifically, we examine the situation of three $^6\textrm{Li}$ atoms trapped
in a $\textrm{CO}_2$-laser-generated optical lattice and find that, with
conservatively estimated parameters, a stored qubit maintains a fidelity of
0.9999 for two hours.
