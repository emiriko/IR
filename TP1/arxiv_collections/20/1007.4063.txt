The knapsack problem (KP) and its multidimensional version (MKP) are basic
problems in combinatorial optimization. In this paper we consider their
multiobjective extension (MOKP and MOMKP), for which the aim is to obtain or to
approximate the set of efficient solutions. In a first step, we classify and
describe briefly the existing works, that are essentially based on the use of
metaheuristics. In a second step, we propose the adaptation of the two-phase
Pareto local search (2PPLS) to the resolution of the MOMKP. With this aim, we
use a very-large scale neighborhood (VLSN) in the second phase of the method,
that is the Pareto local search. We compare our results to state-of-the-art
results and we show that we obtain results never reached before by heuristics,
for the biobjective instances. Finally we consider the extension to
three-objective instances.
