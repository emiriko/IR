We carry out a direct numerical simulation (DNS) study that reveals the
effects of polymers on statistically steady, forced, homogeneous, isotropic
fluid turbulence. We find clear manifestations of dissipation-reduction
phenomena: On the addition of polymers to the turbulent fluid, we obtain a
reduction in the energy dissipation rate, a significant modification of the
fluid energy spectrum, especially in the deep-dissipation range, a suppression
of small-scale intermittency, and a decrease in small-scale vorticity
filaments. We also compare our results with recent experiments and earlier DNS
studies of decaying fluid turbulence with polymer additives.
