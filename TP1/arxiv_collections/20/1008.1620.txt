This paper introduces GODDeS: a fully distributed self-organizing
decision-theoretic routing algorithm designed to effectively exploit high
quality paths in lossy ad-hoc wireless environments, typically with a large
number of nodes. The routing problem is modeled as an optimal control problem
for a decentralized Markov Decision Process, with links characterized by
locally known packet drop probabilities that either remain constant on average
or change slowly. The equivalence of this optimization problem to that of
performance maximization of an explicitly constructed probabilistic automata
allows us to effectively apply the theory of quantitative measures of
probabilistic regular languages, and design a distributed highly efficient
solution approach that attempts to minimize source-to-sink drop probabilities
across the network. Theoretical results provide rigorous guarantees on global
performance, showing that the algorithm achieves near-global optimality, in
polynomial time. It is also argued that GODDeS is significantly
congestion-aware, and exploits multi-path routes optimally. Theoretical
development is supported by high-fidelity network simulations.
