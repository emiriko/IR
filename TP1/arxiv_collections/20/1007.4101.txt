The MeerKAT UltraDeep HI Survey aims to observe the 21 cm emission line of
neutral hydrogen gas out to a redshift of z=1 and beyond. From both direct
detections and stacked signal, we will address the HI mass function, the cosmic
neutral gas density of the Universe (Omega_HI) and their evolution over cosmic
times, as well as galaxy evolution via e.g., the Tully-Fisher relation, the
relation between HI mass and Hubble Type or stellar mass, and the
Schmidt-Kennicutt star-formation law. We propose to observe two fields, the
COSMOS and Chandra Deep Field South (CDF-S) for 1000 hours each, adding an
additional 4000 hours to one of these fields in 2015 when the full
instantaneous bandwidth of MeerKAT (0.58-2.5 GHz) will be realised.
