Giant double-lobed radio source 4C34.47 displays a straight one-sided jet,
measuring a record length of 380kpc, in its double-lobed radio structure.
Assuming an intrinsically symmetric two-sided jet structure the radio source
jet axis must be at least 33 degrees away from the sky plane, that is within 57
degrees from the line of sight. The radio polarization properties indicate that
this giant source has largely outgrown the depolarizing halo generally
associated with the host galaxies of powerful radio sources. The measured small
depolarization asymmetry is nevertheless in accordance with its inferred
orientation. All data for this giant radio source are in agreement with its
preferred orientation as predicted within the unification scheme for powerful
radio sources. Seen under a small aspect angle the radio source is large but
not excessively large. The global properties of 4C34.47 do not differ from
other giant (old) FR2 radio sources: it is a slowly expanding low-luminosity
radio source.
