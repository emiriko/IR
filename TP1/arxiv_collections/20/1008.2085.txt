We show that recent experiments based on Josephson junctions, SQUIDS, and
coupled Josephson qubits have a cosmological interpretation in terms of axionic
dark matter physics, in the sense that they allow for analogue simulation of
early-universe axion physics. We propose new experimental setups in which
SQUID-like axionic interactions in a resonant Josephson junction environment
can be tested, similar in nature to recent experiments that test for quantum
entanglement of two coupled Josephson qubits. We point out that the parameter
values relevant for early-universe axion cosmology are accessible with present
day's achievements in nanotechnology.
