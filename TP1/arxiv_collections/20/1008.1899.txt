The 3d electron spinel compound LiV2O4 exhibits heavy fermion behaviour below
30K which is related to antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations strongly enhanced
in an extended region of momentum space. This mechanism explains enhanced
thermodynamic quantities and nearly critical NMR relaxation in the framework of
the selfconsistent renormalization (SCR) theory. Here we show that the low-T
Fermi liquid behaviour of the resistivity and a deviation from this behavior
for higher T may also be understood within that context. We calculate the
temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity \rho(T) assuming that two
basic mechanisms of the quasiparticle scattering, resulting from impurities and
spin-fluctuations, operate simultaneously at low temperature. The calculation
is based on the variational principle in the form of a perturbative series
expansion for \rho(T). A peculiar behavior of \rho(T) in LiV2O4 is related to
properties of low-energy spin fluctuations whose T-dependence is obtained from
SCR theory.
