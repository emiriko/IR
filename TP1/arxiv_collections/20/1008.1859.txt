Radiative corrections to the single top s and t channel production processes
are revisited. Complete one-loop electroweak corrections are calculated within
the SANC system. New is a study of the regularisation of the top-legs
associated infrared divergences with aid of the complex mass of the top quark.
A comparison of these electroweak corrections with those computed by the
conventional method is presented both for top production and decays. Standard
FORM and FORTRAN SANC modules are created. These modules are compiled into a
package sanc_cc_v1.40, which may be downloaded from SANC project homepages.
Many numerical results are presented at the partonic level with the aim to
demonstrate the correct working of modules. These modules are intended to be
used in Monte Carlo generators for single top production at the LHC. Where
possible, we compare our results with those existing in the literature; in
particular, a comprehensive comparison with results of the CompHEP system is
given.
