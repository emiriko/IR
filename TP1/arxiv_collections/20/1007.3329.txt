A constant antisymmetric 2-tensor can arise in general relativity with
spontaneous symmetry breaking or in field theories formulated in a
noncommutative space-time. In this work, the one-loop contribution of a
nonstandard $WW\gamma$ vertex on the flavor violating quark transition $q_i\to
q_j\gamma$ is studied in the context of the electroweak Yang-Mills sector
extended with a Lorentz-violating constant 2-tensor. An exact analytical
expression for the on shell case is presented. It is found that the loop
amplitude is gauge independent, electromagnetic gauge invariant, and free of
ultraviolet divergences. The dipolar contribution to the $b\to s\gamma$
transition together with the experimental data on the $B\to X_s\gamma$ decay is
used to derive the constraint $\Lambda_{LV}>1.96$ TeV on the Lorentz-violating
scale.
