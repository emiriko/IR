A cavity-polariton, formed due to the strong coupling between exciton and
cavity mode, is one of the most promising composite bosons for realizing
macroscopic spontaneous coherence at high temperature. Up to date, most of
polariton quantum degeneracy experiments were conducted in the complicated
two-dimensional (2D) planar microcavities. The role of dimensionality in
coherent quantum degeneracy of a composite bosonic system of exciton polaritons
remains mysterious. Here we report the first experimental observation of a
one-dimensional (1D) polariton condensate in a ZnO microwire at room
temperature. The massive occupation of the polariton ground state above a
distinct pump power threshold is clearly demonstrated by using the angular
resolved spectroscopy under non-resonant excitation. The power threshold is one
order of magnitude lower than that of Mott transition. Furthermore, a
well-defined far field emission pattern from the polariton condensate mode is
observed, manifesting the coherence build-up in the condensed polariton system.
