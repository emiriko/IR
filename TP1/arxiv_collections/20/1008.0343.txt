A global approach leading to a self-consistent solution to the
Navier-Stokes-Prandtl equations for zero-pressure-gradient boundary layers is
presented. It is shown that as $Re_{\delta}\rightarrow \infty$, the dynamically
defined boundary layer thickness $\delta(x)\propto x/\ln^{2}Re_{x}$ and the
skin friction $\lambda=\frac{2\tau_{w}}{\rho U_{0}^{2}}\propto
1/\ln^{2}\delta(x)$. Here $\tau_{w}$ and $U_{0}$ are the wall shear stress and
free stream velocity, respectively. The theory is formulated as an expansion in
powers of a small dimensionless parameter $\frac{d\delta(x)}{dx}\rightarrow 0$
in the limit $x\rightarrow \infty$.
