Radio synchrotron emission, its polarization and its Faraday rotation are
powerful tools to study the strength and structure of interstellar magnetic
fields. In the Milky Way, Faraday rotation of the polarized emission from
pulsars and background sources indicate that the regular field follows the
spiral arms and has one reversal inside the solar radius, but the overall field
structure in our Galaxy is still unclear. In nearby galaxies, ordered fields
with spiral structure exist in grand-design, barred and flocculent galaxies.
The strongest ordered fields (10-15 \muG) are found in interarm regions.
Faraday rotation of the diffuse polarized radio emission from the disks of
spiral galaxies sometimes reveals large-scale patterns, which are signatures of
regular fields generated by a mean-field dynamo. - The SKA and its precursor
telescopes will open a new era in the observation of cosmic magnetic fields and
help to understand their origin. All-sky surveys of Faraday rotation measures
(RM) towards a dense grid of polarized background sources with the ASKAP
(POSSUM), MeerKAT and the SKA are dedicated to measure fields in intervening
galaxies and will be used to model the overall structure and strength of the
magnetic fields in the Milky Way and beyond. Examples for joint polarimetric
observations between the SKA and the E-ELT are given.
