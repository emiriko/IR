A theoretical description of scanning tunneling potentoimetry (STP)
measurement is presented to address the increasing need for a basis to
interpret experiments on macrscopic samples. Based on a heuristic understanding
of STP provided to facilitate theoretical understanding, the total tunneling
current related to the density matrix of the sample is derived within the
general framework of quantum transport. The measured potentiometric voltage is
determined implicitly as the voltage necessary to null the tunneling current.
Explicit expressions of measured voltages are presented under certain
assumptions, and limiting cases are discussed to connect to previous results.
The need to go forward and formulate the theory in terms of a local density
matrix is also discussed.
