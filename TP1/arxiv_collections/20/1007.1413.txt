Circumstellar envelopes (CSEs) of a variety of evolved stars have been found
to contain ammonia (NH3) in amounts that exceed predictions from conventional
chemical models by many orders of magnitude. The observations reported here
were performed in order to better constrain the NH3 abundance in the CSEs of
four, quite diverse, oxygen-rich stars using the NH3 ortho J_K = 1_0 - 0_0
ground-state line. We used the Heterodyne Instrument for the Far Infrared
aboard Herschel to observe the NH3 J_K = 1_0 - 0_0 transition near 572.5 GHz,
simultaneously with the ortho-H2O J_Ka,Kc = 1_1,0 -1_0,1 transition, toward VY
CMa, OH 26.5+0.6, IRC+10420, and IK Tau. We conducted non-LTE radiative
transfer modeling with the goal to derive the NH3 abundance in these objects'
CSEs. For the latter two stars, Very Large Array imaging of NH3
radio-wavelength inversion lines were used to provide further constraints,
particularly on the spatial extent of the NH3-emitting regions. Results. We
find remarkably strong NH3 emission in all of our objects with the NH3 line
intensities rivaling those obtained for the ground state H2O line. The NH3
abundances relative to H2 are very high and range from 2 x 10-7 to 3 x 10-6 for
the objects we have studied. Our observations confirm and even deepen the
circumstellar NH3 enigma. While our radiative transfer modeling does not yield
satisfactory fits to the observed line profiles, it leads to abundance
estimates that confirm the very high values found in earlier studies. New ways
to tackle this mystery will include further Herschel observations of more NH3
lines and imaging with the Expanded Very Large Array.
