We present a conceptual design for a low-mass, all pixel vertex detector
using the CMOS quadruple well INMAPS process, capable of working in the very
high luminosities exceeding 10^36 /cm^2 /sec that can be expected at the next
generation e+e- B factories. We concentrate on the vertexing requirements
necessary for time-dependent measurements that are also relevant to searches
for new physics beyond the Standard Model. We investigate different
configurations and compare with the baseline designs for the SuperB and BaBar
experiments.
