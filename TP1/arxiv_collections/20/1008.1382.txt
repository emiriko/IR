We present a new theoretical approach to the kinetics of micelle formation in
surfactant solutions, in which the various stages of aggregation are treated as
constrained paths on a single free-energy landscape. Three stages of
well-separated time scales are distinguished. The first and longest stage
involves homogeneous nucleation of micelles, for which we derive the size of
the critical nuclei, their concentration, and the nucleation rate.
Subsequently, a much faster growth stage takes place, which is found to be
diffusion-limited for surfactant concentrations slightly above the critical
micellar concentration ({\it cmc}), and either diffusion-limited or kinetically
limited for higher concentrations. The time evolution of the growth is derived
for both cases. At the end of the growth stage the micelle size may be either
larger or smaller than its equilibrium value, depending on concentration. A
final stage of equilibration follows, during which the micelles relax to their
equilibrium size through fission or fusion. Both cases of fixed surfactant
concentration (closed system) and contact with a reservoir of surfactant
monomers (open system) are addressed and found to exhibit very different
kinetics. In particular, we find that micelle formation in an open system
should be kinetically suppressed over macroscopic times and involve two stages
of micelle nucleation rather than one.
