We consider a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator with a random frequency,
focusing on both the standard and the generalized Lyapunov exponents, $\lambda$
and $\lambda^\star$ respectively. We discuss the numerical difficulties that
arise in the numerical calculation of $\lambda^\star$ in the case of strong
intermittency. When the frequency corresponds to a Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process,
we compute analytically $\lambda^\star$ by using a cumulant expansion including
up to the fourth order. Connections with the problem of finding an analytical
estimate for the largest Lyapunov exponent of a many-body system with smooth
interactions are discussed.
