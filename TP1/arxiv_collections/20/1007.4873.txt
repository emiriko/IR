We report duration dependence of superconductivity in a 43 \% humidity
atmosphere and $^{59}$Co nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) of polycrystalline
samples of $bi$layer hydrated Na$_x$CoO$_2 \cdot y$H$_2$O. We found a reentrant
behavior of superconductivity with respect to the time duration. We obtained
the universal phase diagram where two superconducting phases and an in-between
magnetic phase are classified by $^{59}$Co NQR frequency. Zero field $^{59}$Co
nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rates $1/T_1$ indicated a magnetic critical
slowing down at 5 K in the magnetic phase, excluding a charge density wave
ordering, and an enhancement at and just above $T_\mathrm{c}$ in a new
superconducting phase, suggesting a coexistence of magnetic ordering.
