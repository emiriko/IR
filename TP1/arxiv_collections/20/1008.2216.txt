We address correlated few-photon transport in one-dimensional waveguides
coupled to a two-level system (TLS), such as an atom or a quantum dot. We
derive exactly the single-photon and two-photon current (transmission) for
linear and nonlinear (tight-binding sinusoidal) energy-momentum dispersion
relations of photons in the waveguides and compare the results for the
different dispersions. A large enhancement of the two-photon current for the
sinusoidal dispersion has been seen at a certain transition energy of the TLS
away from the single-photon resonances.
