The current controlled modulation of nano-contact based spin torque
oscillator (STO) pairs is studied in both the synchronized and non-synchronized
states. The synchronized state shows a well behaved modulation and demonstrates
robust mutual locking even under strong modulation. The power distribution of
the modulation sidebands can be quantitatively described by assuming a single
oscillator model. However, in the non-synchronized state, the modulation
sidebands are not well described by the model, indicating interactions between
the two individual nano-contact STOs. These findings are promising for
potential applications requiring the modulation of large synchronized STO
arrays.
