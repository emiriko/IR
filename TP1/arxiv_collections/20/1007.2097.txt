The stability is analyzed of the equilibrium configurations of a magnetic
junction with a free layer that has cubic symmetry and two anisotropy axes in
the layer plane. Different variants of the switching between various
configurations are considered. A possibility is shown of the substantial
lowering of the threshold current density needed for the switching. Numerical
simulation is made of the switching dynamics for various configurations.
