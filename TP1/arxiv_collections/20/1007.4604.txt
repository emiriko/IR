We consider a finite-state memoryless channel with i.i.d. channel state and
the input Markov process supported on a mixing finite-type constraint. We
discuss the asymptotic behavior of entropy rate of the output hidden Markov
chain and deduce that the mutual information rate of such a channel is concave
with respect to the parameters of the input Markov processes at high
signal-to-noise ratio. In principle, the concavity result enables good
numerical approximation of the maximum mutual information rate and capacity of
such a channel.
