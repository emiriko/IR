We consider exclusive double diffractive production of polarised axial-vector
$\chi_c(1^+)$ and tensor $\chi_c(2^+)$ charmonia in proton-(anti)proton
collisions at Tevatron energy. The corresponding amplitudes for these processes
are derived within the $k_t$-factorisation approach. Contributions from
different polarisation states of axial-vector and tensor charmonia are
quantified. Corresponding experimental consequences are discussed.
