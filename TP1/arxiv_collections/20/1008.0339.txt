We discuss the $\frac{K}{\pi}$ fluctuations in relativistic heavy ion
collisions reported by the STAR collaboration, PRL${\bf 103}$,092301(2009),
also discussed by the NA49 collaboration at SPS-CERN. We show that these
fluctuations could be explained simply by imposing strangeness and charge
conservations.
