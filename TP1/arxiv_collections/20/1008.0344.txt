We investigate the impact of theoretical uncertainties on the accuracy of
measurements involving hadronic jets. The analysis is performed using events
with a Z boson and a single jet observed in $p\bar{p}$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}$
= 1.96 TeV in 4.6 $\mathrm{fb^{-1}}$ of data from the Collider Detector at
Fermilab (CDF). The transverse momenta (\pt) of the jet and the boson should
balance each other due to momentum conservation in the plane transverse to the
direction of the $p$ and $\bar{p}$ beams. We evaluate the dependence of the
measured \pt-balance on theoretical uncertainties associated with initial and
final state radiation, choice of renormalization and factorization scales,
parton distribution functions, jet-parton matching, calculations of matrix
elements, and parton showering. We find that the uncertainty caused by parton
showering at large angles is the largest amongst the listed uncertainties. The
proposed method can be re-applied at the LHC experiments to investigate and
evaluate the uncertainties on the predicted jet energies. The distributions
produced at the CDF environment are intended for comparison to those from
modern event generators and new tunes of parton showering.
