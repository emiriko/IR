Recent mathematical fluid dynamics models have shed light into an outstanding
problem in reproductive biology: why do spermatozoa cells show a 'preference'
for swimming near to surfaces? In this paper we review quantitative approaches
to the problem, originating with the classic paper of Lord Rothschild in 1963.
A recent 'boundary integral/slender body theory' mathematical model for the
fluid dynamics is described, and we discuss how it gives insight into the
mechanisms that may be responsible for the surface accumulation behaviour. We
use the simulation model to explore these mechanisms in more detail, and
discuss whether simplified models can capture the behaviour of sperm cells. The
far-field decay of the fluid flow around the cell is calculated, and compared
with a stresslet model. Finally we present some new findings showing how,
despite having a relatively small hydrodynamic drag, the sperm cell 'head' has
very significant effects on surface accumulation and trajectory.
