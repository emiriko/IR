In this paper we present a mathematical formulation for the omega invariant
of a numerical semigroup for each of its minimal generators. The model consists
of solving a problem of optimizing a linear function over the efficient set of
a multiobjective linear integer program. We offer a methodology to solve this
problem and we provide some computational experiments to show the applicability
of the proposed algorithm.
