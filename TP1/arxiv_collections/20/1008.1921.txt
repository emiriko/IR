It is known how to access information on quark orbital angular momentum from
generalized parton distribution functions, in a certain specified framework. It
is intuitively expected, that such information can be accessed also through
transverse momentum dependent distribution functions, but not known how. Now
quark models provide promising hints. Recent results are reviewed.
