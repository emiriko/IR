Based on IMaX/Sunrise data, we report on a previously undetected phenomenon
in solar granulation. We show that in a very narrow region separating granules
and intergranular lanes the spectral line width of the Fe I 5250.2 A line
becomes extremely small. We offer an explanation of this observation with the
help of magneto-convection simulations. These regions with extremely small line
widths correspond to the places where the granular flows bend from mainly
upflow in granules to downflow in intergranular lanes. We show that the
resolution and image stability achieved by IMaX/Sunrise are important
requisites to detect this interesting phenomenon.
