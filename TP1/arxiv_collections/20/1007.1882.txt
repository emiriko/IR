We consider Hamilton Jacobi Bellman equations in an inifinite dimensional
Hilbert space, with quadratic (respectively superquadratic) hamiltonian and
with continuous (respectively lipschitz continuous) final conditions. This
allows to study stochastic optimal control problems for suitable controlled
Ornstein Uhlenbeck process with unbounded control processes.
