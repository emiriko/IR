Compound semiconductor alloys of the type ABC find widespread applications as
their electronic bulk band gap varies continuously with x, and therefore a
tayloring of the energy gap is possible by variation of the concentration. We
model the electronic properties of such semiconductor alloys by a multiband
tight-binding model on a finite ensemble of supercells and determine the band
gap of the alloy. This treatment allows for an intrinsic reproduction of band
bowing effects as a function of the concentration x and is exact in the
alloy-induced disorder. In the present paper, we concentrate on bulk CdZnSe as
a well-defined model system and give a careful analysis on the proper choice of
the basis set and supercell size, as well as on the necessary number of
realizations. The results are compared to experimental results obtained from
ellipsometric measurements of CdZnSe layers prepared by molecular beam epitaxy
(MBE) and photoluminescence (PL) measurements on catalytically grown CdZnSe
nanowires reported in the literature.
