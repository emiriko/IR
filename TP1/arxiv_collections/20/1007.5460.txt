We report on the coexistence of magnetic and superconducting states in
CeFeAsO1-xFx for x=0.06(2), characterized by transition temperatures T_m=30 K
and T_c=18 K, respectively. Zero and transverse field muon-spin relaxation
measurements show that below 10 K the two phases coexist within a nanoscopic
scale over a large volume fraction. This result clarifies the nature of the
magnetic-to-superconducting transition in the CeFeAsO1-xFx phase diagram, by
ruling out the presence of a quantum critical point which was suggested by
earlier studies.
