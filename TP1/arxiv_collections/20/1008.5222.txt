We discuss the scattering equivalence of the generalized Bakamjian-Thomas
construction of dynamical representations of the Poincar\'e group in all of
Dirac's forms of dynamics. The equivalence was established by Sokolov in the
context of proving that the equivalence holds for models that satisfy cluster
separability. The generalized Bakamjian Thomas construction is used in most
applications, even though it only satisfies cluster properties for systems of
less than four particles. Different forms of dynamics are related by unitary
transformations that remove interactions from some infinitesimal generators and
introduce them to other generators. These unitary transformation must be
interaction dependent, because they can be applied to a non-interacting
generator and produce an interacting generator. This suggests that these
transformations can generate complex many-body forces when used in many-body
problems. It turns out that this is not the case. In all cases of interest the
result of applying the unitary scattering equivalence results in
representations that have simple relations, even though the unitary
transformations are dynamical. This applies to many-body models as well as
models with particle production. In all cases no new many-body operators are
generated by the unitary scattering equivalences relating the different forms
of dynamics. This makes it clear that the various calculations used in
applications that emphasize one form of the dynamics over another are
equivalent. Furthermore, explicit representations of the equivalent dynamical
models in any form of dynamics are easily constructed. Where differences do
appear is when electromagnetic probes are treated in the one-photon exchange
approximation. This approximation is different in each of Dirac's forms of
dynamics.
