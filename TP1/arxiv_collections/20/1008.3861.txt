Pohl et al. have reported a very precise measurement of the Lamb-shift in
muonic Hydrogen, from which they infer the radius characterizing the proton's
charge distribution. The result is 5 standard deviations away from the one of
the CODATA compilation of physical constants. This has been interpreted as
possibly requiring a 4.9 standard-deviation modification of the Rydberg
constant, to a new value that would be precise to 3.3 parts in $10^{13}$, as
well as putative evidence for physics beyond the standard model. I demonstrate
that these options are unsubstantiated.
