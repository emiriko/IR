Directional detection of non-baryonic Dark Matter is a promising search
strategy for discriminating genuine WIMP events from background ones. However,
carrying out such a strategy requires both a precise measurement of the energy
down to a few keV and 3D reconstruction of tracks down to a few mm. To achieve
this goal, the MIMAC project has been developed: it is based on a gaseous
micro-TPC matrix, filled with 3He, CF4 and/or C4H10. Firsts results of low
energy nuclei recoils obtained with a low energy neutron field are presented.
