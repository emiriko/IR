Electronic transport through a triple-quantum-dot ring with three terminals
is theoretically studied. By introducing local Rashba spin-orbit interaction on
an individual quantum dot, we find that the spin bias in one terminal drives
apparent charge currents in the other terminals, accompanied by the similar
amplitude and opposite directions of them. Meanwhile, it shows that the
characteristics of the spin currents induced by the spin bias are notable. When
a magnetic flux is applied through this ring, we see its nontrivial role in the
manipulation of the charge and spin currents. With the obtained results, we
propose this structure to be a prototype of a charge and spin current
rectifier.
