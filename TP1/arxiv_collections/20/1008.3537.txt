We investigate a system composed of $N$ coupled cavities and two-level atoms
interacting one at a time. Adjusting appropriately the atom-field detuning, and
make the hopping rate of photons between neighboring cavities, $A$, greater
than the atom-field coupling $g$ (i.e. $A>>g$), we can eliminate the
interaction of the atom with the nonresonant normal modes reducing the dynamics
to the interaction of the atom with only a single-mode. As an application of
this interaction, we analyze the transmission of an arbitrary atomic quantum
state between distant coupled cavities. In the ideal case, we obtain a flexible
and perfect quantum communication. Considering the influence of dissipation an
interesting parity effect emerge and we obtain $N$ maximum in which it is still
possible to achieve a quantum communication more efficient than a purely
classical channel between the ends. We also studied important sources of
imperfections in procedure execution.
