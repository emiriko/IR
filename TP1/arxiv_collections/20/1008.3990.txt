Models for pedestrian dynamics are often based on microscopic approaches
allowing for individual agent navigation. To reach a given destination, the
agent has to consider environmental obstacles. We propose a direction field
calculated on a regular grid with a Moore neighborhood, where obstacles are
represented by occupied cells. Our developed algorithm exactly reproduces the
shortest path with regard to the Euclidean metric.
