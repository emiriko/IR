We discuss the predictivity of family symmetries for the soft supersymmetry
breaking parameters in the framework of supergravity. We show that unknown
details of the messenger sector and the supersymmetry breaking hidden sector
enter into the soft parameters, making it difficult to obtain robust
predictions. We find that there are specific choices of messenger fields which
can improve the predictivity for the soft parameters.
