This study examined the teaching practices of 227 college instructors of
introductory statistics (from the health and behavioral sciences). Using
primarily multidimensional scaling (MDS) techniques, a two-dimensional, 10-item
teaching practice scale, TISS (Teaching of Introductory Statistics Scale), was
developed and validated. The two dimensions (subscales) were characterized as
constructivist, and behaviorist, and are orthogonal to each other. Criterion
validity of this scale was established in relation to instructors' attitude
toward teaching, and acceptable levels of reliability were obtained. A
significantly higher level of behaviorist practice (less reform-oriented) was
reported by instructors from the USA, and instructors with academic degrees in
mathematics and engineering. This new scale (TISS) will allow us to empirically
assess and describe the pedagogical approach (teaching practice) of instructors
of introductory statistics. Further research is required in order to be
conclusive about the structural and psychometric properties of this scale.
