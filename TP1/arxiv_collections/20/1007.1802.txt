A self-stabilizing simulation of a single-writer multi-reader atomic register
is presented. The simulation works in asynchronous message-passing systems, and
allows processes to crash, as long as at least a majority of them remain
working. A key element in the simulation is a new combinatorial construction of
a bounded labeling scheme that can accommodate arbitrary labels, i.e.,
including those not generated by the scheme itself.
