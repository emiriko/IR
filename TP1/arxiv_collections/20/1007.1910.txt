Recently, fractional differential equations have been investigated via the
famous variational iteration method. However, all the previous works avoid the
term of fractional derivative and handle them as a restricted variation. In
order to overcome such shortcomings, a fractional variational iteration method
is proposed. The Lagrange multipliers can be identified explicitly based on
fractional variational theory.
