Founding our analysis on the Geneva-Brussels approach to quantum mechanics,
we use conventional macroscopic objects as guiding examples to clarify the
content of two important results of the beginning of twentieth century:
Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen's reality criterion and Heisenberg's uncertainty
principle. We then use them in combination to show that our widespread belief
in the existence of microscopic particles is only the result of a cognitive
illusion, as microscopic particles are not particles, but are instead the
ephemeral spatial and local manifestations of non-spatial and non-local
entities.
