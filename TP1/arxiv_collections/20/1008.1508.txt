We have demonstrated a metropolitan all-pass quantum communication network in
field fiber for four nodes. Any two nodes of them can be connected in the
network to perform quantum key distribution (QKD). An optical switching module
is presented that enables arbitrary 2-connectivity among output ports.
Integrated QKD terminals are worked out, which can operate either as a
transmitter, a receiver, or even both at the same time. Furthermore, an
additional link in another city of 60 km fiber (up to 130 km) is seamless
integrated into this network based on a trusted relay architecture. On all the
links, we have implemented protocol of decoy state scheme. All of necessary
electrical hardware, synchronization, feedback control, network software,
execution of QKD protocols are made by tailored designing, which allow a
completely automatical and stable running. Our system has been put into
operation in Hefei in August 2009, and publicly demonstrated during an
evaluation conference on quantum network organized by the Chinese Academy of
Sciences on August 29, 2009. Real-time voice telephone with one-time pad
encoding between any two of the five nodes (four all-pass nodes plus one
additional node through relay) is successfully established in the network
within 60km.
