We present a theoretical analysis of a coupled, two-state Bose-Einstein
condensate with non-equal scattering lengths, and show that dynamical
instabilities can be excited. We demonstrate that these instabilities are
exponentially amplified resulting in highly-directional,
oppositely-propagating, coherent matter beams at specific momenta. To
accomplish this we prove that the mean field of our system is periodic, and
extend the standard Bogoliubov approach to consider a time-dependent, but
cyclic, background. This allows us to use Floquet's theorem to gain analytic
insight into such systems, rather than employing the usual Bogoliubov-de Gennes
approach, which is usually limited to numerical solutions. We apply our theory
to the metastable Helium atom laser experiment of Dall et al. [Phys. Rev. A 79,
011601(R) (2009)] and show it explains the anomalous beam profiles they
observed. Finally we demonstrate the paired particle beams will be
EPR-entangled on formation.
