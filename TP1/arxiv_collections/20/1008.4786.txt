The drag effects in the system of spatially separated electrons and excitons
in coupled quantum wells (CQWs) embedded in an optical microcavity are
predicted. It is shown that at low temperature an electron current induces the
polariton flow, therefore, a transport of photons along the cavity. However,
the superfluid polariton component does not contribute to the electron drag.
The polariton-electron at the low temperatures and exciton-electron at the high
temperatures drag coefficients are presented. It is shown that the drag
coefficients increase when temperature increases. We discuss possible
experiments for the observation of the electron-polariton drag effect.
