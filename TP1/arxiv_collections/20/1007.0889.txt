In this paper we present a method to improve the description of 0+1
dimensional boost invariant dissipative dynamics in the presence of large
momentum-space anisotropies. We do this by reorganizing the canonical
hydrodynamic expansion of the distribution function around a momentum-space
anisotropic ansatz rather than an isotropic equilibrium one. At leading order
the result obtained is two coupled ordinary differential equations for the
momentum-space anisotropy and typical momentum of the degrees of freedom. We
show that this framework can reproduce both the ideal hydrodynamic and free
streaming limits. Additionally, we demonstrate that when linearized the
differential equations reduce to 2nd order Israel-Stewart viscous
hydrodynamics. Finally, we make quantitative comparisons of the evolution of
the pressure anisotropy within our approach and 2nd order viscous hydrodynamics
in both the strong and weak coupling limits.
