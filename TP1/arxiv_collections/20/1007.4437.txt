Recently research on bubble and its burst attract much interest of
researchers in various field such as economics and physics. Economists have
been regarding bubble as a disorder in prices. However, this research strategy
has overlooked an importance of the volume of transactions. In this paper, we
have proposed a bubble burst model by focusing the transactions incorporating a
traffic model that represents spontaneous traffic jam. We find that the
phenomenon of bubble burst shares many similar properties with traffic jam
formation by comparing data taken from US housing market. Our result suggests
that the transaction could be a driving force of bursting phenomenon.
