In the present paper we introduce and study the notion of an equivariant
pretheory: basic examples include equivariant Chow groups, equivariant K-theory
and equivariant algebraic cobordism. To extend this set of examples we define
an equivariant (co)homology theory with coefficients in a Rost cycle module and
provide a version of Merkurjev's (equivariant K-theory) spectral sequence for
such a theory. As an application we generalize the theorem of
Karpenko-Merkurjev on G-torsors and rational cycles; to every G-torsor E and a
G-equivariant pretheory we associate a graded ring which serves as an invariant
of E. In the case of Chow groups this ring encodes the information concerning
the motivic J-invariant of E and in the case of Grothendieck's K_0 -- indexes
of the respective Tits algebras.
