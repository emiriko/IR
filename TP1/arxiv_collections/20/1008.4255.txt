We introduce a modification in the relativistic hamiltonian in such a way
that (1) the relativistic Schr\"odinger equations can always be based on an
underlying L\'evy process, (2) several families of particles with different
rest masses can be selected, and finally (3) the corresponding Feynman diagrams
are convergent when we have at least three different masses.
