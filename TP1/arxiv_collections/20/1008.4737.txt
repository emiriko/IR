A new iterative algorithm for solving initial data inverse problems from
partial observations has been recently proposed in Ramdani, Tucsnak and Weiss
[15]. Based on the concept of observers (also called Luenberger observers),
this algorithm covers a large class of abstract evolution PDE's. In this paper,
we are concerned with the convergence analysis of this algorithm. More
precisely, we provide a complete numerical analysis for semi-discrete (in
space) and fully discrete approximations derived using finite elements in space
and finite differences in time. The analysis is carried out for abstract
Schr\"odinger and wave conservative systems with bounded observation (locally
distributed).
