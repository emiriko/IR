A phenomenological formula based on liquid drop model has been proposed for
ground state binding energies of nuclei. The effect due to bunching of single
particle levels has been incorporated through a term resembling the one-body
Hamiltonian. The effect of n-p interaction has been included through a function
of valence nucleons. A total of 50 parameters has been used in the present
calculation. The r.m.s. deviation for the binding energy values for 2140 nuclei
comes out to be 0.376 MeV, and that for 1091 alpha decay energies is 0.284 MeV.
The correspondence with the conventional liquid drop model is discussed.
