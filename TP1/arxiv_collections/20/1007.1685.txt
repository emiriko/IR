We propose to address in a natural manner, the modular variable concept
explicitly in a Schr\"odinger picture. The idea of Modular Variables was
introduced in 1969 by Aharonov, Pendleton and Petersen to explain certain
non-local properties of quantum mechanics. Our approach to this subject is
based on Schwinger's finite quantum kinematics and it's continuous limit.
