The two-component model of high temperature superconductors in its real space
version has been solved using Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations. The disorder in
the electron and boson subsystem has been taken into account. It strongly
modifies the superconducting properties and leads to local variations of the
gap parameter and density of states. The assumption that the impurities mainly
modify boson energies offers natural explanation of the puzzling positive
correlation between the positions of impurities and the values of the order
parameter found in the scanning tunnelling microscopy experiments.
