Of concern in this paper is an investigation of heat and mass transfer over a
stretching sheet under the influence of an applied uniform magnetic field and
the effects of Hall current are taken into account. The non-linear boundary
layer equations together with the boundary conditions are reduced to a system
of non-linear ordinary differential equations by using the similarity
transformation. The system of non-linear ordinary differential equations are
solved by developing a suitable numerical techniques such as finite difference
scheme and Newton's method of linearization. The numerical results concerned
with the velocity, temperature and concentration profiles as well as the
skin-friction coefficient, local Nusselt number Nu and the local sherhood
number Sh for various values of the nondimensional parameters presented
graphically.
