Our understanding of the physics of biological molecules, such as proteins
and DNA, is limited because the approximations we usually apply to model inert
materials are not in general applicable to soft, chemically inhomogeneous
systems. The configurational complexity of biomolecules means the entropic
contribution to the free energy is a significant factor in their behaviour,
requiring detailed dynamical calculations to fully evaluate. Computer
simulations capable of taking all interatomic interactions into account are
therefore vital. However, even with the best current supercomputing facilities,
we are unable to capture enough of the most interesting aspects of their
behaviour to properly understand how they work. This limits our ability to
design new molecules, to treat diseases, for example. Progress in biomolecular
simulation depends crucially on increasing the computing power available.
Faster classical computers are in the pipeline, but these provide only
incremental improvements. Quantum computing offers the possibility of
performing huge numbers of calculations in parallel, when it becomes available.
We discuss the current open questions in biomolecular simulation, how these
might be addressed using quantum computation and speculate on the future
importance of quantum-assisted biomolecular modelling.
