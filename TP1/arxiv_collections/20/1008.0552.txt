The present work intends to identify the nature of the propulsive force that
occurs during a positive corona discharge in nitrogen gas using an asymmetric
capacitor geometry. We are going to apply the known theory of
electrohydrodynamics (EHD) and electrostatics in order to compute all
hydrodynamic and electrostatic forces that act on the considered geometry in an
attempt to provide a physical insight on the force mechanism that acts on an
asymmetrical capacitor.
