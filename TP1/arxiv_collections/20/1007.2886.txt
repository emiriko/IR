The decays of psi(2S) into gamma p bar{p}, pi^0 p bar{p} and eta p bar{p}
have been studied with the CLEO-c detector using a sample of 24.5 million
psi(2S) events obtained from e^+e^- annihilations at sqrt{s} = 3686 MeV. The
data show evidence for the excitation of several N^* resonances in p pi^0 and p
eta channels in pi^0 p bar{p} and eta p bar{p} decays, and f_2 states in gamma
p bar{p} decay. Branching fractions for decays of psi(2S) to gamma p bar{p},
pi^0 p bar{p} and eta p bar{p} have been determined. No evidence for p bar{p}
threshold enhancements was found in the reactions psi(2S)-> X p bar{p}, where X
= gamma, pi^0, eta. We do, however, find confirming evidence for a p bar{p}
threshold enhancement in J/psi-> gamma p bar{p} as previously reported by BES.
