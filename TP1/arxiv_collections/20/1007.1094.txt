This paper is motivated by the analysis of gene expression sets, especially
by finding differentially expressed gene sets between two phenotypes. Gene
$\log_2$ expression levels are highly correlated and, very likely, have
approximately normal distribution. Therefore, it seems reasonable to use
two-sample Hotelling's test for such data. We discover some unexpected
properties of the test making it different from the majority of tests
previously used for such data. It appears that the Hotelling's test does not
always reach maximal power when all marginal distributions are differentially
expressed. For highly correlated data its maximal power is attained when about
a half of marginal distributions are essentially different. For the case when
the correlation coefficient is greater than 0.5 this test is more powerful if
only one marginal distribution is shifted, omparing to the case when all
marginal distributions are equally shifted. Moreover, when the correlation
coefficient increases the power of Hotelling's test increases as well.
