WRF-Fire consists of the WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting Model) coupled
with a fire spread model, based on the level-set method. We describe a
preliminary application of WRF-Fire to a forest fire in Bulgaria, oportunities
for research of forest fire models for Bulgaria, and plans for the development
of an Environmental Decision Support Systems which includes computational
modeling of fire behavior.
