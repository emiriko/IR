We introduce a new approach to assess the error of control problems we aim to
optimize. The method offers a strategy to define new control pulses that are
not necessarily optimal but still able to yield an error not larger than some
fixed a priori threshold, and therefore provide control pulses that might be
more amenable for an experimental implementation. The formalism is applied to
an exactly solvable model and to the Landau-Zener model, whose optimal control
problem is solvable only numerically. The presented method is of importance for
applications where a high degree of controllability of the dynamics of quantum
systems is required.
