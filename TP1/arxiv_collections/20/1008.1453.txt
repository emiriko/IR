We resume our discussion of the new orbifold-string theories of
permutation-type, focusing in the present series on the algebraic formulation
of the general bosonic prototype and especially the target space-times of the
theories. In this first paper of the series, we construct one twisted BRST
system for each cycle $j$ in each twisted sector $\sigma$ of the general case,
verifying in particular the previously-conjectured algebra
$[Q_{i}(\sigma),Q_{j}(\sigma)]_{+} =0$ of the BRST charges. The BRST systems
then imply a set of extended physical-state conditions for the matter of each
cycle at cycle central charge $\hat{c}_{j}(\sigma)=26f_{j}(\sigma)$ where
$f_{j}(\sigma)$ is the length of cycle $j$.
