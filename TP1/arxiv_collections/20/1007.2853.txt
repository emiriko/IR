We present gas constraints from Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect measurements
in a sample of eleven X-ray and infrared (IR) selected galaxy clusters at z
>=1, using data from the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Array (SZA). The cylindrically
integrated Compton-y parameter, Y , is calculated by fitting the data to a
two-parameter gas pressure profile. Where possible, we also determine the
temperature of the hot intra-cluster plasma from Chandra and XMM-Newton data,
and constrain the gas mass within the same aperture (r_2500 ) as Y . The SZ
effect is detected in the clusters for which the X-ray data indicate gas masses
above ~ 10^13 Msun, including XMMU J2235-2557 at redshift z = 1.39, which to
date is one of the most distant clusters detected using the SZ effect. None of
the IR-selected targets are detected by the SZA measurements, indicating low
gas masses for these objects. For these and the four other undetected clusters,
we quote upper limits on Y and Mgas_SZ , with the latter derived from scaling
relations calibrated with lower redshift clusters. We compare the constraints
on Y and X-ray derived gas mass Mgas_X-ray to self-similar scaling relations
between these observables determined from observations of lower redshift
clusters, finding consistency given the measurement error.
