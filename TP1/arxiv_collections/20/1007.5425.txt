This paper proposes a distributed framework for demand response and user
adaptation in smart grid networks. In particular, we borrow the concept of
congestion pricing in Internet traffic control and show that pricing
information is very useful to regulate user demand and hence balance network
load. User preference is modeled as a willingness to pay parameter which can be
seen as an indicator of differential quality of service. Both analysis and
simulation results are presented to demonstrate the dynamics and convergence
behavior of the algorithm.
