We show how two qubits encoded in the orbital states of two quantum dots can
be entangled or disentangled in a controlled way through their interaction with
a weak electron current. The transmission/reflection spectrum of each scattered
electron, acting as an entanglement mediator between the dots, shows a
signature of the dot-dot entangled state. Strikingly, while few scattered
carriers produce decoherence of the whole two-dots system, a larger number of
electrons injected from one lead with proper energy is able to recover its
quantum coherence. Our numerical simulations are based on a real-space solution
of the three-particle Schroedinger equation with open boundaries. The computed
transmission amplitudes are inserted in the analytical expression of the system
density matrix in order to evaluate the entanglement.
