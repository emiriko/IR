I provide a pedagogic review of adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) radiation
hydrodynamics (RHD) methods and codes used in simulations of star formation, at
a level suitable for researchers who are not computational experts. I begin
with a brief overview of the types of RHD processes that are most important to
star formation, and then I formally introduce the equations of RHD and the
approximations one uses to render them computationally tractable. I discuss
strategies for solving these approximate equations on adaptive grids, with
particular emphasis on identifying the main advantages and disadvantages of
various approximations and numerical approaches. Finally, I conclude by
discussing areas ripe for improvement.
