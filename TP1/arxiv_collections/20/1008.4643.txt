We present a systematic construction of quantum circuits implementing
Grover's database search algorithm for arbitrary number of targets. We
introduce a new operator which flips the sign of the targets and evaluate its
circuit complexity. We find the condition under which the circuit complexity of
the database search algorithm based on this operator is less than that of the
conventional one.
