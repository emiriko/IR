A system of equations, describing the evolution of electromagnetic fields, is
introduced and discussed. The model is strictly related to Maxwell's equations.
As a matter of fact, the Lagrangian is the same, but the variations are
subjected to a suitable constraint. This allows to enlarge the space of
solutions, including for example solitary waves with compact support. In this
way, without altering the physics, one is able to deal with vector waves as
they were massless particles. The main properties of the model, together with
numerous exact explicit solutions are presented.
