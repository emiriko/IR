BitTorrent is the most popular P2P content delivery application where
individual users share various type of content with tens of thousands of other
users. The growing popularity of BitTorrent is primarily due to the
availability of valuable content without any cost for the consumers. However,
apart from required resources, publishing (sharing) valuable (and often
copyrighted) content has serious legal implications for user who publish the
material (or publishers). This raises a question that whether (at least major)
content publishers behave in an altruistic fashion or have other incentives
such as financial. In this study, we identify the content publishers of more
than 55k torrents in 2 major BitTorrent portals and examine their behavior. We
demonstrate that a small fraction of publishers are responsible for 66% of
published content and 75% of the downloads. Our investigations reveal that
these major publishers respond to two different profiles. On one hand,
antipiracy agencies and malicious publishers publish a large amount of fake
files to protect copyrighted content and spread malware respectively. On the
other hand, content publishing in BitTorrent is largely driven by companies
with financial incentive. Therefore, if these companies lose their interest or
are unable to publish content, BitTorrent traffic/portals may disappear or at
least their associated traffic will significantly reduce.
