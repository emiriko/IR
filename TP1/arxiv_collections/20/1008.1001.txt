A previously-described code for constructing moving reversing layers (MRL) is
improved by replacing a two-parameter model for the radiative acceleration due
to lines with a flexible non-parametric description, thus allowing a greater
degree of dynamical consistency to be achieved in modelling turbulent transonic
flow in the outer atmospheric layers of O stars. With this new code, mass
fluxes J are computed at fifty-seven points in (T_eff, g)-space. Specifically,
J's are computed for all Lanz-Hubeny (2003) NLTE atmospheres with T_eff (kK)
\in (27.5, 55) and log g \leq 4.5. Differences with widely-used mass-loss
formulae are emphasized, and opportunities for differential spectroscopic tests
identified.
