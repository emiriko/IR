In this paper, we describe direct-sequence code-division multiple-access
(DS-CDMA) systems with quadriphase-shift keying in which channel estimation,
coherent demodulation, and decoding are iteratively performed without the use
of any training or pilot symbols. An expectation-maximization
channel-estimation algorithm for the fading amplitude, phase, and the
interference power spectral density (PSD) due to the combined interference and
thermal noise is proposed for DS-CDMA systems with irregular repeat-accumulate
codes. After initial estimates of the fading amplitude, phase, and interference
PSD are obtained from the received symbols, subsequent values of these
parameters are iteratively updated by using the soft feedback from the channel
decoder. The updated estimates are combined with the received symbols and
iteratively passed to the decoder. The elimination of pilot symbols simplifies
the system design and allows either an enhanced information throughput, an
improved bit error rate, or greater spectral efficiency. The interference-PSD
estimation enables DS-CDMA systems to significantly suppress interference.
