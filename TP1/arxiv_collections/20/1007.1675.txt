We study excitonic polariton relaxation and propagation in bulk CdZnTe using
time- resolved photoluminescence and time-of-flight techniques. Propagation of
picosecond optical pulses through 0.745 mm thick crystal results in time delays
up to 350 ps, depending on the photon energy. Optical pulses with 150 fs
duration become strongly stretched. The spectral dependence of group velocity
is consistent with the dispersion of the lower excitonic polariton branch. The
lifetimes of excitonic polariton in the upper and lower branches are 1.5 and 3
ns, respectively.
