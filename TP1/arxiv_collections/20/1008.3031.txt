We report a novel method to reduce the collector-emitter offset-voltage of
the wide bandgap SiC-P-emitter lateral HBTs using a dual-bandgap emitter. In
our approach, the collector-emitter offset-voltage VCE(offset) is reduced
drastically by eliminating the built-in potential difference between the
emitter-base (EB) junction and collector-base (CB) junction by using a
SiC-on-Si P-emitter. We demonstrate that the proposed dualbandgap P-emitter HBT
together with the SiGe base and Schottky collector, not only has a very low
VCE(offset) but also exhibits high current gain, reduced Kirk effect, excellent
transient response and high cutoff frequency. We evaluated the performance of
the proposed device in detail using two dimensional device simulation and a
possible BiCMOS compatible fabrication procedure is also suggested.
