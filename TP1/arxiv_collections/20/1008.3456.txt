We propose a new method to compute the free energy or enthalpy of fluids or
disordered solids by computer simulation . The main idea is to construct a
reference system by freezing one representative configuration, and then carry
out a thermodynamic integration. We present a strategy and an algorithm which
allows to sample the thermodynamic integration path even in the case of
liquids, despite the fact that the particles can diffuse freely through the
system. The method is described in detail and illustrated with applications to
hard sphere fluids and solids with mobile defects.
