Black-hole-binary coalescence is often divided into three stages: inspiral,
merger and ringdown. The post-Newtonian (PN) approximation treats the inspiral
phase, black-hole perturbation (BHP) theory describes the ringdown, and the
nonlinear dynamics of spacetime characterize the merger. In this paper, we
introduce a hybrid method that incorporates elements of PN and BHP theories,
and we apply it to the head-on collision of black holes with transverse,
anti-parallel spins. We compare our approximation technique with a full
numerical-relativity simulation, and we find good agreement between the
gravitational waveforms and the radiated energy and momentum. Our results
suggest that PN and BHP theories may suffice to explain the main features of
outgoing gravitational radiation for head-on mergers. This would further imply
that linear perturbations to exact black-hole solutions can capture the
nonlinear aspects of head-on binary-black-hole mergers accessible to observers
far from the collision.
