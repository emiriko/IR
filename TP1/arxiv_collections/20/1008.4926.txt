Separate regions in space are generally entangled, even in the vacuum state.
It is known that this entanglement can be swapped to separated Unruh-DeWitt
detectors, i.e., that the vacuum can serve as a source of entanglement. Here,
we demonstrate that, in the presence of curvature, the amount of entanglement
that Unruh-DeWitt detectors can extract from the vacuum can be increased.
