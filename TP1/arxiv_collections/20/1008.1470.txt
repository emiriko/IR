Crystals of solid solutions Bi(1-x)R(x)FeO(3),here R= La, Dy, Gd, were
obtained with x <=0.7. Solid solutions of the stated rare earths, as x is
increased from 0 to 0.7, have one and the same sequence of five crystal
structures (rhombohedral C3v 6, triclinic C1 1,orthorhombic D2 6,orthorhombic
D2 5, orthorhombic C2v 9). The ferroelectric-paraelectric transition occurs in
rhombohedral and triclinic crystals at T=810-560{\deg}C.The high temperature
modifications are orthorhombic and cubic. The orthorhombic structure C2v 9
holds up to 1180{\deg}C.The ferroelectric domain structure was distinguished in
all types of crystals. No magnetoelectric effect (MEE) was detected in the
orthorhombic crystals with the D2 (222) symmetry class. But the mm2 crystals
were found to have both quadratic and linear MEE.The value of the quadratic
effect is considerably smaller than that ofthe linear one. Magnetoelectric
hysteresis takes place in the crystals. The tensorial properties of the
obtained crystals are analyzed from the viewpoint of crystal symmetry.
