We have developed an efficient order-N real-space Kubo approach for the
calculation of the phonon conductivity which outperforms state-of-the-art
alternative implementations based on the Green's function formalism. The method
treats efficiently the time-dependent propagation of phonon wave packets in
real space, and this dynamics is related to the calculation of the thermal
conductance. Without loss of generality, we validate the accuracy of the method
by comparing the calculated phonon mean free paths in disordered carbon
nanotubes (isotope impurities) with other approaches, and further illustrate
its upscalability by exploring the thermal conductance features in large width
edge-disordered graphene nanoribbons (up to ~20 nm), which is out of the reach
of more conventional techniques. We show that edge-disorder is the most
important scattering mechanism for phonons in graphene nanoribbons with
realistic sizes and thermal conductance can be reduced by a factor of ~10.
