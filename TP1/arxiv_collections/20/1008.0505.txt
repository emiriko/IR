We investigate the properties of the zeros of the eigenfunctions on quantum
graphs (metric graphs with a Schr\"odinger-type differential operator). Using
tools such as scattering approach and eigenvalue interlacing inequalities we
derive several formulas relating the number of the zeros of the n-th
eigenfunction to the spectrum of the graph and of some of its subgraphs. In a
special case of the so-called dihedral graph we prove an explicit formula that
only uses the lengths of the edges, entirely bypassing the information about
the graph's eigenvalues. The results are explained from the point of view of
the dynamics of zeros of the solutions to the scattering problem.
