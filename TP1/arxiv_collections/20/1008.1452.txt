An inexpensive green laser pointer was found to emit 20 mW of infrared
radiation during normal use. This is potentially a serious hazard that would
not be noticed by most users of such pointers. We find that this infrared
emission derives from the design of the pointer, and describe a simple method
of testing for infrared emissions using common household items.
