We investigate spin transport in InSb/InAlSb heterostructure using the Monte
Carlo approach, generalized by including density matrix description of spin for
taking spin dynamics into account. In addition to the dominant Dyakonov-Perel
(DP) mechanism for spin control and relaxation, we consider magnetic
interaction between electrons which assumes importance due to high electronic
Lande g-factor in the material. It is found that while the effect of magnetic
interaction is not important at low densities, it reduces the spin relaxation
length by as much as 50% at higher densities. We also present a calculation
which elucidates the suppression of decoherence attributed to wave vector
dependent magnetic field in the DP relaxation mechanism. We note that magnetic
interaction is a general relaxation mechanism which may assume importance in
materials with high electronic Lande g-factor.
