The Shannon cipher system is studied in the context of general sources using
a notion of computational secrecy introduced by Merhav & Arikan. Bounds are
derived on limiting exponents of guessing moments for general sources. The
bounds are shown to be tight for iid, Markov, and unifilar sources, thus
recovering some known results. A close relationship between error exponents and
correct decoding exponents for fixed rate source compression on the one hand
and exponents for guessing moments on the other hand is established.
