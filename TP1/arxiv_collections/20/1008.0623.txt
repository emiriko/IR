We analyze the fundamental security significance of the quantitative criteria
on the final generated key K in quantum key generation including the quantum
criterion d, the attacker's mutual information on K, and the statistical
distance between her distribution on K and the uniform distribution. For
operational significance a criterion has to produce guarantee on the attacker's
probability of correctly estimating some portion of K from her measurement, in
particular her maximum probability of identifying the whole K. We distinguish
between the raw security of K when the attacker just gets at K before it is
used in a cryptographic context and its composition security when the attacker
may gain further information during its actual use to help getting at K. We
compare both of these securities of K to those obtainable from conventional key
expansion with a symmetric key cipher. It is pointed out that a common belief
in the superior security of a quantum generated K is based on an incorrect
interpretation of d which cannot be true, and the security significance of d is
uncertain. Generally, the QKD key K has no composition security guarantee and
its raw security guarantee from concrete protocols is worse than that of
conventional ciphers. Furthermore, for both raw and composition security there
is an exponential catch up problem that would make it difficult to
quantitatively improve the security of K in a realistic protocol. Some possible
ways to deal with the situation are suggested.
