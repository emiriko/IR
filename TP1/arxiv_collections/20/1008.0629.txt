We study multiband semiconducting nanowires proximity-coupled with an s-wave
superconductor. We show that when odd number of subbands are occupied the
system realizes non-trivial topological state supporting Majorana modes
localized at the ends. We study the topological quantum phase transition in
this system and analytically calculate the phase diagram as a function of the
chemical potential and magnetic field. Our key finding is that multiband
occupancy not only lifts the stringent constraint of one-dimensionality but
also allows to have higher carrier density in the nanowire and as such
multisubband nanowires are better-suited for observing the Majorana particle.
We study the robustness of the topological phase by including the effects of
the short- and long-range disorder. We show that in the limit of strong
interband mixing there is an optimal regime in the phase diagram ("sweet spot")
where the topological state is to a large extent insensitive to the presence of
disorder.
