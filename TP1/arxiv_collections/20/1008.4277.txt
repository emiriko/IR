We report the results of the Knight shift by 63,65Cu-nuclear-magnetic
resonance (NMR) measurements on single-layered copper-oxide
Bi2Sr2-xLaxCuO6+delta conducted under very high magnetic fields up to 44 T. The
magnetic field suppresses superconductivity completely and the pseudogap ground
state is revealed. The 63Cu-NMR Knight shift shows that there remains a finite
density of states (DOS) at the Fermi level in the zero-temperature limit, which
indicates that the pseudogap ground state is a metallic state with a finite
volume of Fermi surface. The residual DOS in the pseudogap ground state
decreases with decreasing doping (increasing x) but remains quite large even at
the vicinity of the magnetically ordered phase of x > 0.8, which suggests that
the DOS plunges to zero upon approaching the Mott insulating phase.
