We would like to formulate relativistic dissipative hydrodynamics for
multi-component systems with multiple conserved currents. This is important for
analyses of the hot matter created in relativistic heavy ion collisions because
particle creations and annihilations of various particle species are frequently
taking place there. We show that consistent formulation in such systems
involves many non-trivialities, and derive constitutive equations that satisfy
Onsager reciprocal relations and describe the systems without ambiguity.
