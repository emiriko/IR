The Dirac equation with Lorentz violation involves additional coefficients
and yields a fourth-order polynomial that must be solved to yield the
dispersion relation. The conventional method of taking the determinant of
$4\times 4$ matrices of complex numbers often yields unwieldy dispersion
relations. By using quaternions, the Dirac equation may be reduced to $2 \times
2$ form in which the structure of the dispersion relations become more
transparent. In particular, it is found that there are two subsets of
Lorentz-violating parameter sets for which the dispersion relation is easily
solvable. Each subset contains half of the parameter space so that all
parameters are included.
