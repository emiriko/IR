The linear response of a superfluid neutron liquid onto external vector field
is studied for the case of $^{3}P_{2}-\,^{3}F_{2}$ pairing. The consideration
is limited to the case when the wave-length of the perturbation is large as
compared to the coherence length in the superfluid matter and the transferred
energy is small in comparison with the gap amplitude. The obtained results are
used to analyse the collisionless phonon-like excitations of the condensate of
superfluid neutrons. In particular, we analyze the case of neutron condensation
into the state with $m_{j}=0$ which is conventionally considered as the
preferable one in the bulk matter of neutron stars. Zero sound (if it exists)
is found to be anisotropic and undergoes strong decrement below some
temperature threshold depending substantially on the intensity of Fermi-liquid
interactions.
