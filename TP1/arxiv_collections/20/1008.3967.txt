The art of making structural, polymeric and metallic glasses is rapidly
developing with many applications. A limitation to their use is their
mechanical stability: under increasing external strain all amorphous solids
respond elastically to small strains but have a finite yield stress which
cannot be exceeded without effecting a plastic response which typically leads
to mechanical failure. Understanding this is crucial for assessing the risk of
failure of glassy materials under mechanical loads. Here we show that the
statistics of the energy barriers \Delta E that need to be surmounted changes
from a probability distribution function (pdf) that goes smoothly to zero to a
pdf which is finite at \Delta E=0. This fundamental change implies a dramatic
transition in the mechanical stability properties with respect to external
strain. We derive exact results for the scaling exponents that characterize the
magnitudes of average energy and stress drops in plastic events as a function
of system size.
