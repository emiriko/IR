We study analytically the quantum thermalization of two coupled two-level
systems (TLSs), which are connected with either two independent heat baths
(IHBs) or a common heat bath (CHB). We understand the quantum thermalization in
eigenstate and bare-state representations when the coupling between the two
TLSs is stronger and weaker than the TLS-bath couplings, respectively. In the
IHB case, we find that when the two IHBs have the same temperatures, the two
coupled TLSs in eigenstate representation can be thermalized with the same
temperature as those of the IHBs. However, in the case of two IHBs at different
temperatures, just when the energy detuning between the two TLSs satisfies a
special condition, the two coupled TLSs in eigenstate representation can be
thermalized with an immediate temperature between those of the two IHBs. In
bare-state representation, we find a counterintuitive phenomenon that, under
some conditions, the temperature of the TLS connected with the high-temperature
bath is lower than that of the other TLS, which is connected with the
low-temperature bath. In the CHB case, the coupled TLSs in eigenstate
representation can be thermalized with the same temperature as that of the CHB
in nonresonant cases. In bare-state representation, the TLS with a larger
energy separation can be thermalized to a thermal equilibrium with a lower
temperature. In the resonant case, we find a phenomenon of anti-thermalization.
We also study the steady-state entanglement between the two TLSs in both the
IHB and CHB cases.
