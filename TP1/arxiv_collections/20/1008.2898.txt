We develop a kinetic theory of Brownian particles with long and short range
interactions. We consider both overdamped and inertial models. In the
overdamped limit, the evolution of the spatial density is governed by the
generalized mean field Smoluchowski equation including a mean field potential
due to long-range interactions and a generically nonlinear barotropic pressure
due to short-range interactions. This equation describes various physical
systems such as self-gravitating Brownian particles (Smoluchowski-Poisson
system), bacterial populations experiencing chemotaxis (Keller-Segel model) and
colloidal particles with capillary interactions. We also take into account the
inertia of the particles and derive corresponding kinetic and hydrodynamic
equations generalizing the usual Kramers, Jeans, Euler and Cattaneo equations.
For each model, we provide the corresponding form of free energy and establish
the H-theorem and the virial theorem. Finally, we show that the same
hydrodynamic equations are obtained in the context of nonlinear mean field
Fokker-Planck equations associated with generalized thermodynamics. However, in
that case, the nonlinear pressure is due to the bias in the transition
probabilities from one state to the other leading to non-Boltzmannian
distributions while in the former case the distribution is Boltzmannian but the
nonlinear pressure arises from the two-body correlation function induced by the
short-range potential of interaction. As a whole, our paper develops
connections between the topics of long-range interactions, short-range
interactions, nonlinear mean field Fokker-Planck equations and generalized
thermodynamics. It also justifies from a kinetic theory based on microscopic
processes, the basic equations that were introduced phenomenologically in
gravitational Brownian dynamics, chemotaxis and colloidal suspensions with
attractive interactions.
