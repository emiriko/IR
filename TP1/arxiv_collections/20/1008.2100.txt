We develop a rigorous formalism for the description of the evolution of
states of quantum many-particle systems in terms of a one-particle density
operator. For initial states which are specified in terms of a one-particle
density operator the equivalence of the description of the evolution of quantum
many-particle states by the Cauchy problem of the quantum BBGKY hierarchy and
by the Cauchy problem of the generalized quantum kinetic equation together with
a sequence of explicitly defined functionals of a solution of stated kinetic
equation is established in the space of trace class operators. The links of the
specific quantum kinetic equations with the generalized quantum kinetic
equation are discussed.
