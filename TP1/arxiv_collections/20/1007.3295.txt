In this paper we present an $L^p$-theory for the stochastic partial
differential equations (SPDEs in abbreciation) driven by L\'e{}vy processes.
Existence and uniqueness of solutions in Sobolev spaces are obtained. The
coefficients of SPDEs under consideration are random functions depending on
time and space variables.
