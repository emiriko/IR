The interaction between two quantum bits enables entanglement, the
two-particle correlations that are at the heart of quantum information science.
In semiconductor quantum dots much work has focused on demonstrating single
spin qubit control using optical techniques. However, optical control of
entanglement of two spin qubits remains a major challenge for scaling from a
single qubit to a full-fledged quantum information platform. Here, we combine
advances in vertically-stacked quantum dots with ultrafast laser techniques to
achieve optical control of the entangled state of two electron spins. Each
electron is in a separate InAs quantum dot, and the spins interact through
tunneling, where the tunneling rate determines how rapidly entangling
operations can be performed. The two-qubit gate speeds achieved here are over
an order of magnitude faster than in other systems. These results demonstrate
the viability and advantages of optically controlled quantum dot spins for
multi-qubit systems.
