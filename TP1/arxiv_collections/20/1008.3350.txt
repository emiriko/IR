The quantum channel capacity gives the ultimate limit for the rate at which
quantum data can be reliably transmitted through a noisy quantum channel.
Degradable quantum channels are among the few channels whose quantum capacities
are known. Given the quantum capacity of a degradable channel, it remains
challenging to find a practical coding scheme which approaches capacity. Here
we discuss code designs for the detected-jump channel, a degradable channel
with practical relevance describing the physics of spontaneous decay of atoms
with detected photon emission. We show that this channel can be used to
simulate a binary classical channel with both erasures and bit-flips. The
capacity of the simulated classical channel gives a lower bound on the quantum
capacity of the detected-jump channel. When the jump probability is small, it
almost equals the quantum capacity. Hence using a classical capacity
approaching code for the simulated classical channel yields a quantum code
which approaches the quantum capacity of the detected-jump channel.
