We consider higher derivative gravity lagrangians in 3 and 4 dimensions,
which admit simple c-theorems, including upto six derivative curvature
invariants. Following a suggestion by Myers, these lagrangians are restricted
such that the fluctuations around (anti) de Sitter spaces have second order
linearized equations of motion. We study c-theorems both in the context of
AdS/CFT and cosmology. In the context of cosmology, the monotonic function is
the entropy defined on the apparent horizon through Wald's formula. Exact black
hole solutions which are asymptotically (anti) de Sitter are presented. An
interesting lower bound for entropy is found in de Sitter space. Some aspects
of cosmology in both D=3 and D=4 are discussed.
