The influences of intense coherent laser fields on the transport properties
of a single layer graphene are investigated by using the finite-difference
time-domain method. Under an intense laser field, the valence band and
conduction band states mix via the optical Stark effect. The chiral symmetry of
Dirac electrons is broken and the perfect chiral tunneling is strongly
suppressed.
