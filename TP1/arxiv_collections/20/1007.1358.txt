Coalescing binary systems (eg pulsars, neutron stars and black holes) are the
most likely sources of gravitational radiation, yet to be detected on or near
Earth, where the local gravitational field is negligible and the Poincar\'e
symmetry rules. On the other hand, the general theory of gravitational waves
emitted by axially symmetric rotating sources predicts the existence of a
non-vanishing news function. The existence of such function implies that, for a
distant observer, the asymptotic group of isometries, the BMS group, has a
translational symmetry that depends on the orbit periodicity of the source,
thus breaking the isotropy o the Poincar\'e translations. These results suggest
the application of the asymptotic BMS-covariant wave equation to obtain a
proper theoretical basis for the gravitational waves observations.
