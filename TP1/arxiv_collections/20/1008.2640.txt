A coherent description of the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) is presented that
is applicable to pure as well as disordered alloy systems by treating all
sources of the AHE on equal footing. This is achieved by an implementation of
the Kubo-St\v{r}eda equation using the fully relativistic
Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker (KKR) Green's function method in combination with the
Coherent Potential Approximation (CPA) alloy theory. Applications to the pure
elemental ferromagnets bcc-Fe and fcc-Ni led to results in full accordance with
previous work. For the alloy systems fcc-Fe$_x$Pd$_{1-x}$ and
fcc-Ni$_x$Pd$_{1-x}$ very satisfying agreement with experiment could be
achieved for the anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) over the whole range of
concentration. To interpret these results an extension of the definition for
the intrinsic AHC is suggested. Plotting the corresponding extrinsic AHC versus
the longitudinal conductivity a linear relation is found in the dilute regimes,
that allows a detailed discussion of the role of the skew and side-jump
scattering processes.
