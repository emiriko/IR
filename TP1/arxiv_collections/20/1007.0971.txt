This report describes some transport and magnetic properties of doped Bi2212
and Bi2223 superconducting whiskers. These materials have advantages over
polycrystalline sample as well as large bulk crystals in that they provide
narrow transitions in resistance versus temperature as well as in magnetization
versus temperature curves. In addition they are easy to grow and and have short
oxygen annealing times. Here Data on transport and magnetic properties of these
superconducting whiskers are presented.
