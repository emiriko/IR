A new modified string-inspired modular invariant supergravity model is
proposed and is applied to realize the slow roll inflation in Einstein frame.
Because inflation deals with Planck scale physics, the dilaton can be a strong
candidate for identification with the inflaton. The model we used, cleared the
$\eta$-problem and negative energy problem of potential at stable point, and
appeared to predict successfully the values of observations at the inflation
era.
  We proved that the model explains WMAP observations appropriately. Moreover,
a mechanism of SSB and Gravitino production just after the end of inflation is
investigated. We have obtained power spectrum of the density perturbation as
$\mathcal{P_R}_* \sim 2.438 \times 10^{-9}$ and the scalar spectral index as
$n_{s*}\sim 0.9746$ and its tilt as $\alpha_{s*}\sim -4.3 \times 10^{-4}$. The
ratio between scalar power spectrum and tensor is predicted as $r\sim 6.8
\times 10^{-2}$, a prediction which seems in the range possibly observed by the
Planck satellite soon. The gravitino mass and their production rate from scalar
fields are estimated at certain values of parameters in the model. The
reheating temperature is estimated by the stability condition of Boltzmann
equation by using the decay rate of the dilaton S into gauginos as $T_R({\rm
gaugino}) = 3.88 \times 10^{7} \,\, {\rm GeV}$. Though only one example of
parameter choices has been discussed here, the other seven candidates of
parameter choices that are compatible with WMAP data have already been found by
the authors. Some of the examples show that the gauginos can be observed by LHC
experiments. The plausible supergravity model of inflation which here we
described will open the hope to construct a realistic theory of particle theory
and cosmology in this framework.
