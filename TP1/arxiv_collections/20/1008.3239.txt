We consider the various perturbations of self-dual warped AdS$_3$ black hole
and obtain the exact expressions of quasinormal modes by imposing the vanishing
Dirichlet boundary condition at asymptotic infinity. It is expected that the
quasinormal modes agree with the poles of retarded Green's functions of the
dual CFT. Our results provide a quantitative test of the warped AdS/CFT
correspondence.
