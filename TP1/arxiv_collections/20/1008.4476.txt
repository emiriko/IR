Self-defect clusters in bulk matrix might affect the thermodynamic behavior
of fission gases in nuclear fuel such as uranium dioxide. With first-principles
LSDA+U calculations and taking xenon as a prototype, we find that the influence
of oxygen defect clusters on the thermodynamics of gas atoms is prominent,
which increases the solution energy of xenon by a magnitude of 0.5 eV, about
43% of the energy difference between the two lowest lying states at 700 K.
Calculation also reveals a thermodynamic competition between the uranium
vacancy and tri-vacancy sites to incorporate xenon in hyper-stoichiometric
regime at high temperatures. The results show that in hypo-stoichiometric
regime neutral tri-vacancy sites are the most favored position for diluted
xenon gas, whereas in hyper-stoichiometric condition they prefer to uranium
vacancies even after taking oxygen self-defect clusters into account at low
temperatures, which not only confirms previous studies but also extends the
conclusion to more realistic fuel operating conditions. The observation that
gas atoms are ionized to a charge state of Xe+ when at a uranium vacancy site
due to strong Madelung potential implies that one can control temperature to
tune the preferred site of gas atoms and then the bubble growth rate. A
solution to the notorious meta-stable states difficulty that frequently
encountered in DFT+U applications, namely, the quasi-annealing procedure, is
also discussed.
