We consider the vacuum response of a particle detector in Anti-de Sitter
spacetime, and in particular analyze how spacetime features such as curvature
and dimensionality affect the response spectrum of an accelerated detector. We
calculate useful limits on Wightman functions, analyze the dynamics of the
detector in terms of vacuum fluctuations and radiation reactions, and discuss
the thermalization process for the detector. We also present a generalization
of the GEMS approach and obtain the Gibbons-Hawking temperature of de Sitter
spacetime as an embedded Unruh temperature in a curved Anti-de Sitter
spacetime.
