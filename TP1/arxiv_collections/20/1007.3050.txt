We present the second portion of an unbiased survey of the Galactic plane for
6668-MHz methanol masers. This section of the survey spans the longitude range
6 degrees to 20 degrees. We report the detection of 119 maser sources, of which
42 are new discoveries. The masers are tightly constrained to the Galactic
plane, with only four outside a latitude range of +/- 1 degree. This longitude
region includes the brightest known 6668-MHz methanol maser, 9.621+0.196, as
well as the two brightest newly discovered sources in the southern survey as a
whole. We list all the sources associated with the 3-kpc arms within +/- 15
degrees longitude and consider further candidates beyond 15 degrees longitude.
We identify three new sources associated with the Galactic bar and comment on
the density of masers in relation to the bar orientation.
