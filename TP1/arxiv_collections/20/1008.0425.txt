In the current thesis we first talk about the six-qubit quantum
error-correcting code and show its connections to entanglement-assisted
error-correcting coding theory and then to subsystem codes. This code bridges
the gap between the five-qubit (perfect) and Steane codes. We discuss two
methods to encode one qubit into six physical qubits. Each of the two examples
corrects an arbitrary single-qubit error. The first example is a degenerate
six-qubit quantum error-correcting code. We prove that a six-qubit code without
entanglement assistance cannot simultaneously possess a Calderbank-Shor-Steane
(CSS) stabilizer and correct an arbitrary single-qubit error. A corollary of
this result is that the Steane seven-qubit code is the smallest single-error
correcting CSS code. Our second example is the construction of a non-degenerate
six-qubit CSS entanglement-assisted code. This code uses one bit of
entanglement (an ebit) shared between the sender (Alice) and the receiver (Bob)
and corrects an arbitrary single-qubit error. In the second half of this thesis
we explore the yet uncharted and relatively undiscovered area of quantum
steganography. Steganography is the process of hiding secret information by
embedding it in an innocent message. We present protocols for hiding quantum
information in a codeword of a quantum error-correcting code passing through a
channel. Using either a shared classical secret key or shared entanglement
Alice disguises her information as errors in the channel. Bob can retrieve the
hidden information, but an eavesdropper (Eve) with the power to monitor the
channel, but without the secret key, cannot distinguish the message from
channel noise. We analyze how difficult it is for Eve to detect the presence of
secret messages, and estimate rates of steganographic communication and secret
key consumption for certain protocols.
