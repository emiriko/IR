We predict the effect of the nuclear spin density fluctuations on NMR spectra
of critical solutions of spin-carrying atoms in closed carbon nanotubes (CNTs).
The total effective dipolar coupling of nuclear spin-carrying of 129^Xe atoms
is the sum of 2 terms i.e. g_0 of non-correlated 129^Xe atoms and g_1 depending
on density fluctuations of Xe atoms. The coupling g_0 falls off to 0 as 1/V
with increasing the volume V of CNTs, while the g_1 remains finite for long
CNTs containing critical solution of Xe atoms. The g_1 is derived within the
Landau-Ginzburg framework. When temperature T goes to critical temperature T_c,
the g_1 is about 10 Hz for 129^Xe fluid in closed long tubes. To achieve the
g_1>> g_0, 3 conditions should be met: (1) the large mobility of 129^Xe atoms,
(2) the maximal isothermal compressibility of Xe nanofluid within CNTs that
have to be (3) long and closed. We discuss 3 applications of such a behavior.
First, when T goes to T_c, the FID from N magnetically equivalent 129^Xe atoms
is broadened so wide that the FID splits into lattice of N equidistant
resonances with finite spacing G=3g_1. Second, the absorption line shape of
129^Xe atoms in spin state I=N/2, m=N/2 has a single delta peak at frequency
with the large shift N*G/2 from Larmor frequency W for N>>1. The dipolar field
of nanofluid in the spin state I=N/2, m=-N/2 inverts the total magnetic field
if N>1+2W/G. Third, we discuss the spontaneous superradiation of the nanofluid
in course of depolarization I_x(t) in low-field resonator. At CP of the
nanofluid, the I_x(t) causes the bursts of dissipated power ~(g_1)^2*N^3. In
the opposite limiting case of the strong field resonator, the depolarization
I_x(t) has the Dicke's power ~(W*N)^2. Far from the CP of Xe nanofluid, the
dissipated power scales linear with N for fixed density of 129^Xe atoms.
