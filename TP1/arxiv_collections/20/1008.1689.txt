A new and simple statistical approach is performed to calculate the parton
distribution functions (PDFs) of the nucleon in terms of light-front kinematic
variables. Analytic expressions of x-dependent PDFs are obtained in the whole x
region. And thereafter, we treat the temperature T as a parameter of the atomic
number A to explain the nuclear EMC effect in the region $x \in [0.2, 0.7]$. We
give the predictions of PDF ratios, and they are very different from those by
other models, thus experiments aiming at measuring PDF ratios are suggested to
provide a discrimination of different models.
