Topological insulators are new states of quantum matter which can not be
adiabatically connected to conventional insulators and semiconductors. They are
characterized by a full insulating gap in the bulk and gapless edge or surface
states which are protected by time-reversal symmetry. These topological
materials have been theoretically predicted and experimentally observed in a
variety of systems, including HgTe quantum wells, BiSb alloys, and Bi$_2$Te$_3$
and Bi$_2$Se$_3$ crystals. We review theoretical models, materials properties
and experimental results on two-dimensional and three-dimensional topological
insulators, and discuss both the topological band theory and the topological
field theory. Topological superconductors have a full pairing gap in the bulk
and gapless surface states consisting of Majorana fermions. We review the
theory of topological superconductors in close analogy to the theory of
topological insulators.
