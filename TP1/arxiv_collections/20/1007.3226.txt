Large scale graphene electronics desires lithographic patterning of narrow
graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) for device integration. However, conventional
lithography can only reliably pattern ~20nm wide GNR arrays limited by
lithography resolution, while sub-5nm GNRs are desirable for high on/off ratio
field-effect transistors (FETs) at room temperature. Here, we devised a gas
phase chemical approach to etch graphene from the edges without damaging its
basal plane. The reaction involved high temperature oxidation of graphene in a
slightly reducing environment to afford controlled etch rate (\leq ~1nm/min).
We fabricated ~20-30nm wide GNR arrays lithographically, and used the gas phase
etching chemistry to narrow the ribbons down to <10nm. For the first time, high
on/off ratio up to ~10^4 was achieved at room temperature for FETs built with
sub-5nm wide GNR semiconductors derived from lithographic patterning and
narrowing. Our controlled etching method opens up a chemical way to control the
size of various graphene nano-structures beyond the capability of top-down
lithography.
