We study the effects of the fourth generation of quarks on the total
branching ratio and the lepton polarizations in $\bar{B}_{0}\rightarrow
K_{0}^{\ast}(1430)l^{+}l^{-}$($l$ = $\mu $, $\tau $) decay. Taking fourth
generation quark mass $m_{t{\prime}}$ of about $400$ to $600$ GeV with the
mixing angle $|V_{t^{\prime}b}^{\ast}V_{t^{\prime}s}|$ in the range
$(0.05-1.4)\times 10^{-2}$ and using the phase to be $80^{o}$%, it is found
that the branching ratio and lepton polarizations are quite sensitive to these
fourth generation parameters. In future the experimental study of this decay
will give us an opportunity to study new physics effects, precisely, to search
for the fourth generation of quarks $% (t^{\prime},b^{\prime})$ in an indirect
way.
