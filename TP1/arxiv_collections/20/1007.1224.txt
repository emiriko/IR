We report on a simultaneous modelling of the expansion and radio light curves
of SN1993J. We have developed a simulation code capable of generating synthetic
expansion and radio light curves of supernovae by taking into consideration the
evolution of the expanding shock, magnetic fields, and relativistic electrons,
as well as the finite sensitivity of the interferometric arrays used in the
observations. Our software successfully fits all the available radio data of SN
1993J with an standard emission model for supernovae extended with some
physical considerations, as an evolution in the opacity of the ejecta material,
a radial drop of the magnetic fields inside the radiating region, and a
changing radial density profile of the circumstellar medium beyond day 3100
after explosion.
