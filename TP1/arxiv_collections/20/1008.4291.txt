We report on the observability of valence bonding effects in
aberration-corrected high resolution electron microscopy (HREM) images along
the [010] projection of the mineral Forsterite(Mg2SiO4). We have also performed
exit wave restorations using simulated noisy images and have determined that
both the intensities of individual images and the modulus of the restored
complex exit wave are most sensitive to bonding effects at a level of 25% for
moderately thick samples of 20-25 nm. This relatively large thickness is due to
dynamical amplification of bonding contrast arising from partial de-channeling
of 1s states.
