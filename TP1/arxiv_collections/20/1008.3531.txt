We investigate a model for the dynamics of a solid object, which moves over a
randomly vibrating solid surface and is subject to a constant external force.
The dry friction between the two solids is modeled phenomenologically as being
proportional to the sign of the object's velocity relative to the surface, and
therefore shows a discontinuity at zero velocity. Using a path integral
approach, we derive analytical expressions for the transition probability of
the object's velocity and the stationary distribution of the work done on the
object due to the external force. From the latter distribution, we also derive
a fluctuation relation for the mechanical work fluctuations, which incorporates
the effect of the dry friction.
