A precision measurment of inclusive electron scattering cross sections was
carried out at Jefferson Lab in the quasi-elastic region for ${^4}$He,
${^{12}}$C, ${^{56}}$Fe and ${^{208}}$Pb targets. Longitudinal ($R_{L}$) and
transverse ($R_{T}$) response functions of nucleon were extracted in the
momentum transfer range 0.55 GeV/c$\le$$|q|$$\le$1.0 GeV/c. To achieve the
above goal, a NaI (Tl) calorimeter was used to distinguish good electrons from
background including pions and low energy electrons rescattered from walls of
the spectrometer magnets. Due to a large set of kinematics and changes in HV
settings, a number of calibrations were performed for the NaI (Tl) detector.
Corrections for a few blocks of NaI (Tl) with bad or no signal were applied.
The resolution of NaI (Tl) detector after calibration reached $\frac{\delta
E}{\sqrt{E}} \approx 3\%$ at E=1 GeV. The performance of NaI (Tl) detector was
compared with a simulation.
