We present Swift broadband observations of the recently discovered black hole
candidate, X-ray transient, XTE J1752-223, obtained over the period of outburst
from October 2009 to June 2010. From Swift-UVOT data we confirm the presence of
an optical counterpart which displays variability correlated, in the soft
state, to the X-ray emission observed by Swift-XRT. The optical counterpart
also displays hysteretical behaviour between the states not normally observed
in the optical bands, suggesting a possible contribution from a synchrotron
emitting jet to the optical emission in the rising hard state. We offer a
purely phenomenological treatment of the spectra as an indication of the
canonical spectral state of the source during different periods of the
outburst. We find that the high energy hardness-intensity diagrams over two
separate bands follows the canonical behavior, confirming the spectral states.
Our XRT timing analysis shows that in the hard state there is significant
variability below 10Hz which is more pronounced at low energies, while during
the soft state the level of variability is consistent with being minimal. These
properties of XTE J1752-223 support its candidacy as a black hole in the
Galactic centre region.
