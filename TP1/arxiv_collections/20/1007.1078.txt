We describe the interplay between stellar evolution and dynamical mass loss
of evolving star clusters, based on the principles of stellar evolution and
cluster dynamics and on a grid of N-body simulations of cluster models. The
cluster models have different initial masses, different orbits, including
elliptical ones, and different initial density profiles. We use two sets of
cluster models: initially Roche-lobe filling and Roche-lobe underfilling. We
identify four distinct mass loss effects: (1) mass loss by stellar evolution,
(2) loss of stars induced by stellar evolution and (3) relaxation-driven mass
loss before and (4) after core collapse. Both the evolution-induced loss of
stars and the relaxation-driven mass loss need time to build up. This is
described by a delay-function of a few crossing times for Roche-lobe filling
clusters and a few half mass relaxation times for Roche-lobe underfilling
clusters. The relaxation-driven mass loss can be described by a simple power
law dependence of the mass dM/dt =-M^{1-gamma}/t0, (with M in Msun) where t0
depends on the orbit and environment of the cluster. Gamma is 0.65 for clusters
with a King-parameter W0=5 and 0.80 for more concentrated clusters with W0=7.
For initially Roche-lobe underfilling clusters the dissolution is described by
the same gamma=0.80. The values of the constant t0 are described by simple
formulae that depend on the orbit of the cluster. The mass loss rate increases
by about a factor two at core collapse and the mass dependence of the
relaxation-driven mass loss changes to gamma=0.70 after core collapse. We also
present a simple recipe for predicting the mass evolution of individual star
clusters with various metallicities and in different environments, with an
accuracy of a few percent in most cases. This can be used to predict the mass
evolution of cluster systems.
