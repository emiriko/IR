Single crystals of ${\rm Bi}_{2+x}{\rm Sr}_{2-x}{\rm Ca}_{2}{\rm Cu}_{3}{\rm
O}_{10+\delta}$(Bi2223) with $x=0.2$ were grown by a traveling solvent floating
zone method in order to investigate the superconducting properties of highly
underdoped Bi2223.Grown crystals were characterized by X-ray diffraction, DC
susceptibility and resistivity measurements, confirming Bi2223 to be the main
phase.The crystals were annealed under various oxygen partial pressures to
adjust their carrier densities from optimally doped to highly underdoped.The
fluctuation diamagnetic component above the superconducting transition
temperature $T_{\rm c}$ extracted from the anisotropic normal state
susceptibilities $\chi_{ab}(T)$ ($H\perp c$) and $\chi_{c}(T)$ ($H\parallel c$)
was found to increase with underdoping, suggesting a decrease in the
superconducting dimensionality and/or increase in the fluctuating vortex liquid
region.
