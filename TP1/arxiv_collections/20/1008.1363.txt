Ductile Regime Machining of semiconductors (DRM) offers higher quality of the
resulting surfaces. To optimize this process, it is required to understand the
thermal kinetics of silicon metallization under pressure. Such understanding is
not yet possible since the metallic phases of silicon aren't readily amenable
to thermal characterization through direct measurements. This being the case,
one has to rely on processing indirect measurement data to deduce refined
estimates of the thermal transport properties of pressurized Silicon. A
feasible measurement of this sort is the electrical resistivity, since its'
variation during indentation and consider is often an indicator of the
formation of the metallic silicon phase Si-II under the indenter. This paper,
therefore, describes a procedure by which the average thermal conductivity of
the metallic phase of silicon, Si-II is extracted from electrical resistivity
measurements taken in real time. The procedure is based on teaming a
temperature evaluation code to the resistivity measurements thus allowing the
extraction of the conductivity as a function of temperature.
