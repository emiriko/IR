Some results about existence, uniqueness, and attractive behaviour of
solutions for nonlinear Volterra integral equations with non-convolution
kernels are presented in this paper. These results are based on similar ones
about nonlinear Volterra integral equations with convolution kernels and some
comparison techniques. Therefore, this paper is devoted to find a wide class of
nonconvolution Volterra integral equations where their solutions behave like
those of Volterra equations with convolution kernels.
