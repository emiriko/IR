We study correlated two-photon transport in a (quasi) one-dimensional
photonic waveguide coupled to a three-level $\Lambda$-type emitter driven by a
classical light field. Two-photon correlation is much stronger in the waveguide
for a driven three-level emitter (3LE) than a two-level emitter. The driven 3LE
waveguide shows electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT), and we
investigate the scaling of EIT for one and two photons. We show that the two
transmitted photons are bunched together at any distance separation when energy
of the incident photons meets "two-photon resonance" criterion for EIT.
