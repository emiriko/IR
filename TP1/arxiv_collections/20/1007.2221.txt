Top quarks produced in multi-TeV processes will have large Lorentz boosts,
and their decay products will be highly collimated. In semileptonic decay
modes, this often leads to the merging of the b-jet and the hard lepton
according to standard event reconstructions, which can complicate new physics
searches. Here we explore ways of efficiently recovering this signal in the
muon channel at the LHC. We perform a particle-level study of events with muons
produced inside of boosted tops, as well as in generic QCD jets and from
W-strahlung off of hard quarks. We characterize the discriminating power of
cuts previously explored in the literature, as well two new ones. We find a
particularly powerful isolation variable which can potentially reject light QCD
jets with hard embedded muons at the 10^3 level while retaining 80~90% of the
tops. This can also be fruitfully combined with other cuts for O(1) greater
discrimination. For W-strahlung, a simple pT-scaled maximum \Delta R cut
performs comparably to a highly idealized top-mass reconstruction, rejecting an
O(1) fraction of the background with percent-scale loss of signal. Using these
results, we suggest a set of well-motivated baseline cuts for any physics
analysis involving semileptonic top quarks at TeV-scale momenta, using neither
b-tagging nor missing energy as discriminators. We demonstrate the utility of
our cuts in searching for resonances in the top-antitop invariant mass
spectrum. For example, our results suggest that 100 fb^{-1} of data from a 14
TeV LHC could be used to discover a warped KK gluon up to 4.5 TeV or higher.
