The basic objective of data visualization is to provide an efficient
graphical display for summarizing and reasoning about quantitative information.
During the last decades, political science has accumulated a large corpus of
various kinds of data such as comprehensive factbooks and atlases,
characterizing all or most of existing states by multiple and objectively
assessed numerical indicators within certain time lapse. As a consequence,
there exists a continuous trend for political science to gradually become a
more quantitative scientific field and to use quantitative information in the
analysis and reasoning. It is believed that any objective analysis in political
science must be multidimensional and combine various sources of quantitative
information; however, human capabilities for perception of large massifs of
numerical information are limited. Hence, methods and approaches for
visualization of quantitative and qualitative data (and, especially
multivariate data) is an extremely important topic. Data visualization
approaches can be classified into several groups, starting from creating
informative charts and diagrams (statistical graphics and infographics) and
ending with advanced statistical methods for visualizing multidimensional
tables containing both quantitative and qualitative information. In this
article we provide a short review of existing methods of data visualization
methods with applications in political and social science.
