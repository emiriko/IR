We investigate the correlation between integrated proton-neutron interactions
obtained by using the up-to-date experimental data of binding energies and the
$N_{\rm p} N_{\rm n}$, the product of valence proton number and valence neutron
number with respect to the nearest doubly closed nucleus. We make corrections
on a previously suggested formula for the integrated proton-neutron
interaction. Our results demonstrate a nice, nearly linear, correlation between
the integrated p-n interaction and $N_{\rm p} N_{\rm n}$, which provides us
with a firm foundation of the applicability of the $N_{\rm p} N_{\rm n}$ scheme
to nuclei far from the stability line.
