The ground state magnetic phase diagram of the one-dimensional quantum
compass model (QCM) is studied using the numerical Lanczos method. A detailed
numerical analysis of the low energy excitation spectrum is presented. The
energy gap and the spin-spin correlation functions are calculated for finite
chains. Two kind of the magnetic long-range orders, the Neel and a type of the
stripe-antiferromagnet, in the ground state phase diagram are identified. Based
on the numerical analysis, the first and second order quantum phase transitions
in the ground state phase diagram are identified.
