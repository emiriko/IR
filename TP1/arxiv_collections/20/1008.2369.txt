Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) is an advanced simulation methodology for studies
of manybody quantum systems. In this review, we focus on the electronic
structure QMC, i.e., methods relevant for systems described by the electron-ion
Hamiltonians. Some of the key QMC achievements include direct treatment of
electron correlation, accuracy in predicting energy differences and favorable
scaling in the system size. Calculations of atoms, molecules, clusters and
solids have demonstrated QMC applicability to real systems with hundreds of
electrons while providing 90-95% of the correlation energy and energy
differences typically within a few percent of experiments. Advances in accuracy
beyond these limits are hampered by the so-called fixed-node approximation
which is used to circumvent the notorious fermion sign problem. Many-body nodes
of fermion states and their properties have therefore become one of the
important topics for further progress in predictive power and efficiency of QMC
calculations. Some of our recent results on the wave function nodes and related
nodal domain topologies will be briefly reviewed. This includes analysis of
few-electron systems and descriptions of exact and approximate nodes using
transformations and projections of the highly-dimensional nodal hypersurfaces
into the 3D space. Studies of fermion nodes offer new insights into topological
properties of eigenstates such as explicit demonstrations that generic
fermionic ground states exhibit the minimal number of two nodal domains.
Recently proposed trial wave functions based on Pfaffians with pairing orbitals
are presented and their nodal properties are tested in calculations of first
row atoms and molecules. Finally, backflow "dressed" coordinates are introduced
as another possibility for capturing correlation effects and for decreasing the
fixed-node bias.
