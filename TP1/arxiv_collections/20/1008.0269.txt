The observation of isolated positive and negative charges, but not isolated
magnetic north and south poles, is an old puzzle. Instead, evidence of
effective magnetic monopoles has been found in the abstract momentum space.
Apart from Hall-related effects, few observable consequences of these abstract
monopoles are known. Here, we show that it is possible to manipulate the
monopoles by external magnetic fields and probe them by universal conductance
fluctuation (UCF) measurements in ferromagnets with strong spin-orbit coupling.
The observed fluctuations are not noise, but reproducible quasiperiodic
oscillations as a function of magnetisation direction, a novel Berry phase
fingerprint of the magnetic monopoles.
