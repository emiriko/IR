Recent work of Borwein, Choi, and the second author examined a collection of
polynomials closely related to the Goldbach conjecture: the polynomial $F_N$ is
divisible by the $N$th cyclotomic polynomial if and only if there is no
representation of $N$ as the sum of two odd primes. The coefficients of these
polynomials stabilize, as $N$ grows, to a fixed sequence $a(m)$; they derived
upper and lower bounds for $a(m)$, and an asymptotic formula for the summatory
function $A(M)$ of the sequence, both under the assumption of a famous
conjecture of Hardy and Littlewood. In this article we improve these results:
we obtain an asymptotic formula for $a(m)$ under the same assumption, and we
establish the asymptotic formula for $A(M)$ unconditionally.
