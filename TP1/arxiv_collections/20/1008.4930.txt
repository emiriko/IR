We systematically calculate quasiparticle interference (QPI) signatures for
the whole phase diagram of iron-based superconductors. Impurities inherent in
the sample together with ordered phases lead to distinct features in the QPI
images that are believed to be measured in spectroscopic imaging-scanning
tunneling microscopy (SI-STM). In the spin-density wave phase the rotational
symmetry of the electronic structure is broken, signatures of which are also
seen in the coexistence regime with both superconducting and magnetic order. In
the superconducting regime we show how the different scattering behavior for
magnetic and non-magnetic impurities allows to verify the $s^{+-}$ symmetry of
the order parameter. The effect of possible gap minima or nodes is discussed.
