An abstract polytope of rank n is said to be chiral if its automorphism group
has precisely two orbits on the flags, such that adjacent flags belong to
distinct orbits. The present paper describes a general method for deriving new
finite chiral polytopes from old finite chiral polytopes of the same rank. In
particular, the technique is used to construct many new examples in ranks 3, 4
and 5.
