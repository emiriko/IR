We define two-parameter generalizations of Andrews' $(k+1)$-marked odd Durfee
symbols and $2k$th symmetrized odd rank moments, and study the automorphic
properties of some of their generating functions. When $k=0$ we obtain families
of modular forms and mock modular forms. When $k \geq 1$, we find quasimodular
forms and quasimock modular forms.
