Reaction rate theory in solids is modified taking into account intrinsic
localized modes or discrete breathers (DBs) that can appear in crystals with
sufficient anharmonicity resulting in violation of Arrhenius law. Large
amplitude oscillations of atoms about their equilibrium positions in the
lattice cause local potentials of alternating sign, which are described in
terms of time-periodic modulations of the potential barriers for chemical
reactions taking place in the vicinity of DBs. The reaction rate averaged over
large macroscopic volumes and times including a lot of DBs is increased by a
factor that depends on the DB statistics. The breather statistics in thermal
equilibrium and in thermal spikes in solids under irradiation with swift
particles is considered, and the corresponding reaction rate amplification
factors are derived.
