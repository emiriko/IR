A prototype Scintillator-Tungsten electromagnetic calorimeter (ScECAL) for
the ILC detector was tested in 2008 at the Fermilab test beam. Data were
collected with electron, pion and muon beams in the energy range 1 to 32GeV
combined with hadronic calorimeter and Tail catcher. One of the main objectives
of the CALICE program is to establish the technology of Scintillator-based
electromagnetic calorimeter and validate the prformance of the calorimeter.
From preliminary results of the first approach of analysis with electron beam,
we obtain the ScECAL energy resolution {\sigma}stochastic = 15.15+/-0.03% and
{\sigma}constant = 1.44+/-0.02% . The deviation from the linear response is
calculated to be less than 6%.
