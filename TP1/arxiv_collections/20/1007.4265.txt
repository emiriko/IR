We study zero-temperature hysteresis in random-field XY and Heisenberg models
in the zero-frequency limit of a cyclic driving field. We consider three
distributions of the random field and present exact solutions in the mean field
limit. The results show a strong effect of the form of disorder on critical
hysteresis as well as the shape of hysteresis loops. A discrepancy with an
earlier study based on the renormalization group is resolved.
