We present a scheme to improve the noise threshold for the fault-tolerant
topological one-way computation with a constant overhead. Certain cluster
states of finite size, say star clusters, are constructed with logical qubits
through an efficient verification process to achieve high fidelity. Then, the
star clusters are connected near-deterministically with verification to form a
three-dimensional cluster state to implement the topological one-way
computation. The necessary postselection for verification is localized within
the star clusters, ensuring the salability of computation. This scheme works
with a high error rate $ \sim 1 % $ and reasonable resources comparable to or
less than those for the other fault-tolerant schemes, suggesting potentially a
noise threshold higher than 5%.
