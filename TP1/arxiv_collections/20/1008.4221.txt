This paper is concerned with the error performance analysis of binary
differential phase shift keying with differential detection over the
nonselective, Rayleigh fading channel with combining diversity reception. Space
antenna diversity reception is assumed. The diversity branches are independent,
but have nonidentically distributed statistics. The fading process in each
branch is assumed to have an arbitrary Doppler spectrum with arbitrary Doppler
bandwidth. Both optimum diversity reception and suboptimum diversity reception
are considered. Results available previously apply only to the case of first
and second-order diversity. Our results are more general in that the order of
diversity is arbitrary. Moreover, the bit error probability (BEP) result is
obtained in an exact, closed-form expression which shows the behavior of the
BEP as an explict function of the one-bit-interval fading correlation
coefficient at the matched filter output, the mean signal-to-noise ratio per
bit per branch and the order of diversity. A simple, more easily computable
Chernoff bound to the BEP of the optimum diversity detector is also derived.
