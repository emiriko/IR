The framework for playing quantum games in an Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR)
type setting is investigated using the mathematical formalism of Clifford
geometric algebra (GA). In this setting, the players' strategy sets remain
identical to the ones in the classical mixed-strategy version of the game,
which is then obtained as proper subset of the corresponding quantum game. As
examples, using GA we analyze the games of Prisoners' Dilemma and Stag Hunt
when played in the EPR type setting.
