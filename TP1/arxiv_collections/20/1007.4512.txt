We have studied the phi(1020)a0(980) S-wave scattering at threshold energies
employing chiral Lagrangians coupled to vector mesons by minimal coupling. The
interaction is described without new free parameters by considering the scalar
isovector a0(980) resonance as dynamically generated in coupled channels, and
demanding that the recently measured e+ e- -> phi(1020) f0(980) cross section
is reproduced. For some realistic choices of the parameters, the presence of a
dynamically generated isovector companion of the Y(2175) is revealed. We have
also investigated the corrections to the e+ e- -> phi(1020) pi0 eta reaction
cross section that arise from phi(1020)a0(980) re-scattering in the final
state. They are typically large and modify substantially the cross section. For
a suitable choice of parameters, the presence of the resonance would manifest
itself as a clear peak at sqrt{s}~2.03 GeV in e+ e- -> phi(1020) pi0 eta.
