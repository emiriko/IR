We investigate the transition of a quantum wave-packet through a
one-dimensional avoided crossing of molecular energy levels when the energy
levels at the crossing point are tilted. Using superadiabatic representations,
and an approximation of the dynamics near the crossing region, we obtain an
explicit formula for the transition wavefunction. Our results agree extremely
well with high precision ab-initio calculations.
