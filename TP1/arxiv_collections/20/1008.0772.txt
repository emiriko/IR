Algebraic hyperstructures represent a natural extension of classical
algebraic structures. In a classical algebraic structure, the composition of
two elements is an element, while in an algebraic hyperstructure, the
composition of two elements is a set. Algebraic hyperstructure theory has a
multiplicity of applications to other disciplines. The main purpose of this
paper is to provide examples of hyperstructures associated with elementary
particles in physical theory.
