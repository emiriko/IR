The scanning mid-IR-laser microscopy was previously demonstrated as an
effective tool for characterization of different semiconductor crystals. Now
the technique has been successfully applied for the investigation of CZ
SixGe1-x -- a promising material for photovoltaics - and multicrystalline
silicon for solar cells. In addition, this technique was shown to be
appropriate for imaging of polishing-induced defects as well as such huge
defects as "pin holes". Besides, previously unexplained "anomalous" (cubic
power) dependence of signal of the scanning mid-IR-laser microscope in the
optical-beam-induced light scattering mode on the photoexcitation power
obtained for mechanically polished samples has now been attributed to the
excess carrier scattering on charged linear defects, likely dislocation lines.
The conclusion is made in the article that the scanning mid-IR-laser microscopy
may serve as very effective tool for defect investigations in materials for
modern photovoltaics.
