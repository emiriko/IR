Very recently the BaBar collaboration has put forward a claim that the
X(3872) is not a 1^++ resonance, as most of the phenomenological work on the
subject was relying on, but rather a 2^-+ one. We examine the consequences of
this quantum number assignment for the solution of the X(3872) puzzle. The
molecular interpretation appears less likely, and the conventional charmonium
interpretation should be reconsidered. There are several well-known
difficulties with this interpretation, to which we add a new one: the
production cross section at CDF is predicted to be much smaller than that
observed. We also confirm, using a relativistic string model, the conclusion
from potential models that the mass of the state is not consistent with
expectations. In the tetraquark interpretation the 2^-+ assignment implies a
rich spectrum of partner states, although the X(3872) may be among the few
which are narrow enough to be observable.
