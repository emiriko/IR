I discuss various aspects of the role of the conformal anomaly number c in 2-
and 1+1-dimensional critical behaviour: its appearance as the analogue of
Stefan's constant, its fundamental role in conformal field theory, in the
classification of 2d universality classes, and as a measure of quantum
entanglement, among other topics.
