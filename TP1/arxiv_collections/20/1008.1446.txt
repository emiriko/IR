It is shown that the critical temperature of the superconductor is related to
the Sommerfeld constant, i.e. it is determined by the Fermi energy for I-type
superconductors. The estimation of properties of II-type superconductors
reveals a somewhat different relation of critical temperature and Fermi energy.
Among the high-temperature superconducting ceramics there are the both - I and
II - types superconductors.
