The topological effect on thermal conductivity is investigated through the
comparison among graphene nanoribbons, carbon nanotubes and the Mobius-like
graphene strips (MGS), by molecular dynamics simulation. It is found that the
thermal conductivity of MGS is less than one half of that of graphene
nanoribbons. The underlying mechanism whereby MGS acquire such low thermal
conductivity may be attributable to the enhanced phonon-phonon scattering and
localization property, which are induced by the nontrivial topology of Mobius
strip. Moreover by counting in the dimensions of MGS, a lower length/width
ratio reduces its thermal conductivity, as the phonon-phonon scattering and
localization within might be further elevated.
