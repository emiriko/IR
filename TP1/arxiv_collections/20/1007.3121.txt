Microwave induced photoconductivity of a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG)
in selectively-doped GaAs/AlAs heterostructures has been studied using the
Corbino geometry with capacitive contacts at a temperature T=1.6K and magnetic
field B up to 0.5 T. Zero-conductance states have been observed in the samples
under study subject to microwave radiation, similarly to the samples with ohmic
contacts. It has been shown that ohmic contacts do not play a significant role
for observation of zero-conductance states induced by microwave radiation
