In the context of a strongly coupled Electroweak Symmetry Breaking, composite
light scalar singlet and composite triplet of heavy vectors may arise from an
unspecified strong dynamics and the interactions among themselves and with the
Standard Model gauge bosons and fermions can be described by a $SU(2)_L\times
SU(2)_R/SU(2)_{L+R}$ Effective Chiral Lagrangian. In this framework, the
production of the $V^{+}V^{-}$ and $V^{0}V^{0}$ final states at the LHC by
gluon fusion mechanism is studied in the region of parameter space consistent
with the unitarity constraints in the elastic channel of longitudinal gauge
boson scattering and in the inelastic scattering of two longitudinal Standard
Model gauge bosons into Standard Model fermions pairs. The expected rates of
same-sign di-lepton and tri-lepton events from the decay of the $V^{0}V^{0}$
final state are computed and their corresponding backgrounds are estimated. It
is of remarkable relevance that the $V^{0}V^{0}$ final state can only be
produced at the LHC via gluon fusion mechanism since this state is absent in
the Drell-Yan process. It is also found that the $V^{+}V^{-}$ final state
production cross section via gluon fusion mechanism is comparable with the
$V^{+}V^{-}$ Drell-Yan production cross section. The comparison of the
$V^{0}V^{0}$ and $V^{+}V^{-}$ total cross sections will be crucial for
distinguishing the different models since the vector pair production is
sensitive to many couplings. This will also be useful to determine if the heavy
vectors are only composite vectors or are gauge vectors of a spontaneously
broken gauge symmetry.
