A method to interpret probe spectra of driven degenerate atomic systems is
discussed. The dressed-atom multiphoton spectroscopy (DAMS) is based on a
dressing of the atomic system with the strong coupling field, followed by a
perturbative treatment of the probe field interaction. As example, we apply the
DAMS to provide a clear interpretation for anomalous electromagnetically
induced absorption (EIA), which cannot be explained by spontaneous transfer of
coherence. We show that anomalous EIA arises from quantum interference between
competing two-photon transitions, and explain the different dependences on the
coupling field strength observed for various angular momentum setups.
