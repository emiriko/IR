Conventional wisdom holds that influenza A and B are such genetically
dissimilar viruses that infection with one cannot confer cross-immunity to the
other. However, our examination of the records of the past 25 influenza seasons
in the U.S. reveals that almost every time there is an early and severe
influenza A outbreak, the annual influenza B epidemic is almost entirely
suppressed (and is never suppressed otherwise). Temporary broad-spectrum (aka
"heterologous") immunity in the aftermath of influenza infection is the most
direct explanation for this phenomenon. We find a remarkably weak degree of
temporary cross-immunity is needed to explain these patterns, and that indeed
influenza B provides an ideal setting for the observation of heterologous
immune effects outside of the carefully controlled environment of a laboratory.
