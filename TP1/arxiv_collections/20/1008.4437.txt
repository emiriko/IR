We present the result of our investigation on the impact of the low Solar
abundance of Asplund and collaborators (2004) on the derived ages for the
oldest star clusters based on isochrone fittings. We have constructed new
stellar models and corresponding isochrones using this new solar mixture with a
proper Solar calibration. We have found that the use of the Asplund et al.
(2004) metallicity causes the typical ages for old globular clusters in the
Milky Way to be increased roughly by 10\%. Although this may appear small, it
has a significant impact on the interpretation for the formation epoch of Milky
Way globular clusters. The Asplund et al. (2004) abundance may not necessarily
threaten the current concordance cosmology but would suggest that Milky Way
globular clusters formed before the reionization and before the main galaxy
body starts to build up. This is in contrast to the current understanding on
the galaxy formation.
