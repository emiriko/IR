We report a detailed high-resolution powder neutron diffraction investigation
of the structural behaviour of the multiferroic hexagonal polymorph of YMnO3
between room temperature and 1403 K. The study was aimed at resolving previous
uncertainties regarding the nature of the paraelectric- ferroelectric
transition and the possibilities of any secondary structural transitions. We
observe a clear transition at 1258 +/- 14 K corresponding to a unit cell
tripling and a change in space group from centrosymmetric P6_3/mmc to polar
P6_3cm. Despite the fact that this symmetry permits ferroelectricity, our
experimental data for this transition analysed in terms of symmetry-adapted
displacement modes clearly supports previous theoretical analysis that the
transition is driven primarily by the antiferrodistortive K3 mode. We therefore
verify previous suggestions that YMnO3 is an improper ferrielectric.
Furthermore, our data confirm that the previously suggested intermediate phase
with space group P6_3/mcm does not occur. However, we do find evidence for an
isosymmetric phase transition (i.e. P6_3cm to P6_3cm) at ~920 K which involves
a sharp decrease in polarization. This secondary transition correlates well
with several previous reports of anomalies in physical properties in this
temperature region and may be related to Y-O hybridization.
