Throughout the early history of Science the heliocentric world model was
refused because it contradicted the thoughts of Aristotle and the medieval
"Impetus" theory of movement. Even Galileo's sky observations did not lead to
any acceptance of the heliocentric model, because scientists derived from
Aristotle's physics that the earth was static. It was not until 1640 when
Gassendi proved the principle of inertia on a moving galley, as well as
Galileo's laws of free fall with a giant wheel that "impetus-physics" which
incorporated naive beliefs about movement was abandoned. To understand the
methods of calculating movement, novice students can be stitmulaed by using
these initial experiments based on the dynamics of a ship movement and not rely
on na\"ive approach. This can help novice students to attain a concept change
from na\"ive to scientific conceptions about movement. Modern students who
study movement were found to harbour many of the same naive beliefs as our
scientific forefathers. The history behind the elimination of these naive
beliefs is presented here in order to help encourage elimination of these naive
beliefs. Several studies found these naive beliefs to be held by novice
students today. These naive beliefs held in the Science of movement have posed
major problems for teaching novice students. Conflicting methods of modelling
these movements have been the source of much controversy over time as concepts
changed. Considering a conceptual change in history can be helpful in
education.
