We describe two main classes of one-sided trigonometric and hyperbolic
Jacobi-type algorithms for computing eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Hermitian
matrices. These types of algorithms exhibit significant advantages over many
other eigenvalue algorithms. If the matrices permit, both types of algorithms
compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors with high relative accuracy.
  We present novel parallelization techniques for both trigonometric and
hyperbolic classes of algorithms, as well as some new ideas on how pivoting in
each cycle of the algorithm can improve the speed of the parallel one-sided
algorithms. These parallelization approaches are applicable to both
distributed-memory and shared-memory machines.
  The numerical testing performed indicates that the hyperbolic algorithms may
be superior to the trigonometric ones, although, in theory, the latter seem
more natural.
