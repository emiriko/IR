The $J/\Psi$ mass shift in cold nuclear matter is computed using an effective
Lagrangian approach. The mass shift is computed by evaluating $D$ and $D^*$
meson loop contributions to the $J/\Psi$ self-energy employing medium-modified
meson masses. The modification of the $D$ and $D^*$ masses in nuclear matter is
obtained using the quark-meson coupling model. The loop integrals are
regularized with dipole form factors and the sensitivity of the results to the
values of form-factor cutoff masses is investigated. The $J/\Psi$ mass shift
arising from the modification of the $D$ and $D^*$ loops at normal nuclear
matter density is found to range from -16 MeV to -24 MeV under a wide variation
of values of the cutoff masses. Experimental perspectives for the formation of
a bound state of $J/\Psi$ to a nucleus are investigated.
