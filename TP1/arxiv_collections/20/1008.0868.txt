It is well known that the 2D XY model exhibits an unusual infinite order
phase transition belonging to the Kosterlitz-Thouless (KT) universality class.
Introduction of a nematic coupling into the XY Hamiltonian leads to an
additional phase transition in the Ising universality class [D.H. Lee and G.
Grinstein, Phys. Rev. Lett. 55, 541 (1985)]. Using a combination of extensive
Monte Carlo simulations and finite size scaling, we show that the higher order
harmonics lead to a qualitatively different phase diagram, with additional
ordered phases originating from the competition between the ferromagnetic and
pseudonematic couplings. The new phase transitions belong to the 2D Potts,
Ising, or KT universality classes.
