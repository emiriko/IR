We discuss nuclear reactions which could play a role in Big Bang
Nucleosynthesis (BBN). Most of these reactions involve lithium and beryllium
isotopes and the rates for some of these have not previously been included in
BBN calculations. Few of these reactions are well studied in the laboratory. We
also discuss novel effects in these reactions, including thermal population of
nuclear target states, resonant enhancement, and non-thermal neutron reaction
products. We perform sensitivity studies which show that even given
considerable nuclear physics uncertainties, most of these nuclear reactions
have minimal leverage on the standard BBN abundance yields of 6Li and 7Li.
Although a few have the potential to alter the yields significantly, we argue
that this is unlikely.
