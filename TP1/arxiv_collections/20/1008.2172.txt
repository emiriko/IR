Einstein@Home aggregates the computer power of hundreds of thousands of
volunteers from 192 countries to "mine" large data sets. It has now found a
40.8 Hz isolated pulsar in radio survey data from the Arecibo Observatory taken
in February 2007. Additional timing observations indicate that this pulsar is
likely a disrupted recycled pulsar. PSR J2007+2722's pulse profile is
remarkably wide with emission over almost the entire spin period; the pulsar
likely has closely aligned magnetic and spin axes. The massive computing power
provided by volunteers should enable many more such discoveries.
