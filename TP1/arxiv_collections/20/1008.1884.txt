We investigate stochastic differential equations with jumps and irregular
coefficients, and obtain the existence and uniqueness of generalized stochastic
flows. Moreover, we also prove the existence and uniqueness of $L^p$-solutions
or measure-valued solutions for second order integro-differential equation of
Fokker-Planck type.
