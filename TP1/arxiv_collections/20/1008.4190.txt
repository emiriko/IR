We present an analysis of the gamma-ray data obtained with the Large Area
Telescope (LAT) onboard the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope in the direction of
SNR W49B (G43.3-0.2). A bright unresolved gamma-ray source detected at a
significance of 38 sigma is found to coincide with SNR W49B. The energy
spectrum in the 0.2-200 GeV range gradually steepens toward high energies. The
luminosity is estimated to be 1.5x10^{36} (D/8 kpc)^2 erg s^-1 in this energy
range. There is no indication that the gamma-ray emission comes from a pulsar.
Assuming that the SNR shell is the site of gamma-ray production, the observed
spectrum can be explained either by the decay of neutral pi mesons produced
through the proton-proton collisions or by electron bremsstrahlung. The
calculated energy density of relativistic particles responsible for the LAT
flux is estimated to be remarkably large, U_{e,p}>10^4 eV cm^-3, for either
gamma-ray production mechanism.
