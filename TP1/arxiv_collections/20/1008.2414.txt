The junction of a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) operating in the
tunneling regime was irradiated with femtosecond laser pulses. A photo-excited
hot electron in the STM tip resonantly tunnels into an excited state of a
single molecule on the surface, converting it from the neutral to the anion.
The electron transfer rate depends quadratically on the incident laser power,
suggesting a two-photon excitation process. This nonlinear optical process is
further confirmed by the polarization measurement. Spatial dependence of the
electron transfer rate exhibits atomic-scale variations. A two-pulse
correlation experiment reveals the ultrafast dynamic nature of photo-induced
charging process in the STM junction. Results from these experiments are
important for understanding photo-induced interfacial charge transfer in many
nanoscale inorganic-organic structures.
