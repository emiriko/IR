We investigate couplings of squarks to gauge and Higgs-bosons within the
framework of non-minimal flavour violation in the Minimal Supersymmetric
Standard Model. Introducing non-diagonal elements in the mass matrices of
squarks, we first study their impact on the self-energies and physical mass
eigenvalues of squarks. We then present an extensive analysis of bosonic squark
decays for variations of the flavour-violating parameters around the two
benchmark scenarios SPS1a' and SPS1b. Signatures, that would be characteristic
for a non-minimal flavour structure in the squark sector, can be found in wide
regions of the parameter space.
