Correlated density matrix theory is generalized to investigate equilibrium
properties of normal Fermi Liquids such as 3He and nuclear matter at nonzero
temperatures. The results also generalize the Fermi-hypernetted-chain technique
that is familiar from studies of the ground state of correlated fermions. By
employing the concept of renormalized bosons and fermions the formal results
are cast in a form that permits the direct evaluation of the statistical
properties of the correlated liquid such as the entropy and the specific heat
at constant volume among other quantities.
