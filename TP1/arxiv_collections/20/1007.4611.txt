We introduce graph state basis diagonalization to calculate the coherent
information of a quantum code passing through a Pauli channel. The scheme is
5000 times faster than the best known one for some concatenated repetition
codes, providing us a practical constructive way of approaching the quantum
capacity of a Pauli channel. The calculation of the coherent information of
non-additive quantum code can also be greatly simplified in graph state basis.
