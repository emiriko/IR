We report on the first experimental evidence of guided resonances (GRs) in
photonic crystal slabs based on aperiodically-ordered supercells. Using the
Ammann-Beenker (quasiperiodic, 8-fold symmetric) tiling geometry, we present
our study on the fabrication, experimental characterization, and full-wave
numerical simulation of two representative structures (with different filling
parameters) operating at near-infrared wavelengths (1300-1600 nm). Our results
show a fairly good agreement between measurements and numerical predictions,
and pave the way for the development of new strategies (based, e.g., on the
lattice symmetry breaking) for GR engineering.
