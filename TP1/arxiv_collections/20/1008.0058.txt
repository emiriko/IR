We present an efficient {\it ab initio} approach for the study of magnetic
transport properties based on the Boltzmann equation with the Wannier
interpolation scheme. Within the relaxation time approximation, band-resolved
electric conductivity under a finite magnetic field is obtained and the
historical motion of the electron wave packet in reciprocal space is
determined. As a typical application of this method, we have calculated the
electric conductivities of MgB$_2$ under finite magnetic fields. Multiband
characters for the individual bands are revealed, and the field dependence of
the conductivity tensor is studied systematically with the field orientated
parallel and normal to the $c$-axis, respectively. The obtained historical
motion is employed to simulate directly the cyclotron motion in the extremal
orbit and determine the corresponding effective mass. Moreover, This approach
is further exploited to calculate the Hall coefficient in the low-field limit,
without the complicated computation for the second ${\mathbf k}$ derivative of
the band.
