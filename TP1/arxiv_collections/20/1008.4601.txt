In a series of ten two-dimensional graphical vector addition questions with
varying visual representations, most students stuck to a single solution
method, be it correct or incorrect. Changes to the visual representation
include placing vectors on a grid, making the vectors arrangements symmetric,
varying the separation between vectors, and reversing the direction of either
vector. We discuss the questions asked of students and their responses,
emphasizing the results of one student who did change solution methods during
an interview.
