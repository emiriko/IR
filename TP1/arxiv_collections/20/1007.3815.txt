This paper is a complement to our earlier work \cite{BCSS10b}. With the help
of the multi-scale analysis, we derive, from estimates obtained in
\cite{BCSS10b}, dynamical localization for a multi-particle Anderson model in a
Euclidean space $\D{R}^{d}$, $d\geq 1$, with a short-range interaction, subject
to a random alloy-type potential.
