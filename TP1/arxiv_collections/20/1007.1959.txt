We investigate standing kink magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) oscillations in a
prominence fine structure modeled as a straight and cylindrical magnetic tube
only partially filled with the prominence material, and with its ends fixed at
two rigid walls representing the solar photosphere. The prominence plasma is
partially ionized and a transverse inhomogeneous transitional layer is included
between the prominence thread and the coronal medium. Thus, ion-neutral
collisions and resonant absorption are the considered damping mechanisms.
Approximate analytical expressions of the period, the damping time, and their
ratio are derived for the fundamental mode in the thin tube and thin boundary
approximations. We find that the dominant damping mechanism is resonant
absorption, which provides damping ratios in agreement with the observations,
whereas ion-neutral collisions are irrelevant for the damping. The values of
the damping ratio are independent of both the prominence thread length and its
position within the magnetic tube, and coincide with the values for a tube
fully filled with the prominence plasma. The implications of our results in the
context of the MHD seismology technique are discussed, pointing out that the
reported short-period (2 - 10 min) and short-wavelength (700 - 8,000 km) thread
oscillations may not be consistent with a standing mode interpretation and
could be related to propagating waves. Finally, we show that the inversion of
some prominence physical parameters, e.g., Alfv\'en speed, magnetic field
strength, transverse inhomogeneity length-scale, etc., is possible using
observationally determined values of the period and damping time of the
oscillations along with the analytical approximations of these quantities.
