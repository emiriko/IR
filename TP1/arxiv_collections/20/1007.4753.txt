The 511 keV positron annihilation emission remains a mysterious component of
the high energy emission of our Galaxy. Its study was one of the key scientific
objective of the SPI spectrometer on-board the INTEGRAL satellite. In fact, a
lot of observing time has been dedicated to the Galactic disk with a particular
emphasis on the central region. A crucial issue in such an analysis concerns
the reduction technique used to treat this huge quantity of data, and more
particularly the background modeling. Our method, after validation through a
variety of tests, is based on detector pattern determination per ~6 month
periods, together with a normalisation variable on a few hour timescale. The
Galactic bulge is detected at a level of ~70 sigma allowing more detailed
investigations. The main result is that the bulge morphology can be modelled
with two axisymmetric Gaussians of 3.2 deg. and 11.8 deg. FWHM and respective
fluxes of 2.5 and 5.4 x 10^-4 photons/(cm^2.s^1). We found a possible shift of
the bulge centre towards negative longitude at l=-0.6 +/- 0.2 degrees. In
addition to the bulge, a more extended structure is detected significantly with
flux ranging from 1.7 to 2.9 x10^-3 photons/(cm^2.s^1) depending on its assumed
geometry (pure disk or disk plus halo). The disk emission is also found to be
symmetric within the limits of the statistical errors.
