In the framework of a 4m class Solar Telescope we studied the performance of
the MCAO using the LOST simulation package. In particular, in this work we
focus on two different methods to reduce the time delay error which is
particularly critical in solar adaptive optics: a) the optimization of the
wavefront reconstruction by reordering the modal base on the basis of the
Mutual Information and b) the possibility of forecasting the wavefront
correction through different approaches. We evaluate these techniques
underlining pros and cons of their usage in different control conditions by
analyzing the results of the simulations and make some preliminary tests on
real data.
