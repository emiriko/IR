The observation of a separation between the antiferromagnetic phase boundary
and the small-large Fermi surface transition in recent experiments has led to
the proposal that frustration is an important additional tuning parameter in
the Kondo lattice model of heavy fermion materials. The introduction of a Kondo
(K) and a frustration (Q) axis into the phase diagram permits us to discuss the
physics of heavy fermion materials in a broader perspective. The current
experimental situation is analysed in the context of this combined "QK" phase
diagram. We discuss various theoretical models for the frustrated Kondo
lattice, using general arguments to characterize the nature of the $f$-electron
localization transition that occurs between the spin liquid and heavy Fermi
liquid ground-states. We concentrate in particular on the Shastry--Sutherland
Kondo lattice model, for which we establish the qualitative phase diagram using
strong coupling arguments and the large-$N$ expansion. The paper closes with
some brief remarks on promising future theoretical directions.
