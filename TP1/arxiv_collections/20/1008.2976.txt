We report $^{75}$As NMR measurements in BaFe$_2$As$_2$ doped with Ni. Like
Co, Ni doping suppresses the antiferromagnetic and structural phase transitions
and gives rise to superconductivity for sufficiently large Ni doping. The spin
lattice relaxation rate diverges at $T_N$, with a critical exponent consistent
with 3D ordering of local moments. In the ordered state the spectra quickly
broaden inhomogeneously with doping. We extract the average size of the ordered
moment as a function of doping, and show that a model in which the order
remains commensurate but with local amplitude variations in the vicinity of the
dopant fully explains our observations.
