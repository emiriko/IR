A unified approach to studying convergence and stochastic stability of
continuous time consensus protocols (CPs) is presented in this work. Our method
applies to networks with directed information flow; both cooperative and
noncooperative interactions; networks under weak stochastic forcing; and those
whose topology and strength of connections may vary in time. The graph
theoretic interpretation of the analytical results is emphasized. We show how
the spectral properties, such as algebraic connectivity and total effective
resistance, as well as the geometric properties, such the dimension and the
structure of the cycle subspace of the underlying graph, shape stability of the
corresponding CPs. In addition, we explore certain implications of the spectral
graph theory to CP design. In particular, we point out that expanders, sparse
highly connected graphs, generate CPs whose performance remains uniformly high
when the size of the network grows unboundedly. Similarly, we highlight the
benefits of using random versus regular network topologies for CP design. We
illustrate these observations with numerical examples and refer to the relevant
graph-theoretic results.
