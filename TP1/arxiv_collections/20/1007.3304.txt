We derive a special scalar field potential using the anisotropic Bianchi type
I cosmological model from canonical quantum cosmology under determined
conditions in the evolution to anisotropic variables $\beta_\pm$. In the
process, we obtain a family of potentials that has been introduced by hand in
the literature to explain cosmological data. Considering supersymmetric quantum
cosmology, this family is scanned, fixing the exponential potential as more
viable in the inflation scenario $\rm V (\phi) = V_0 \,e^{-\sqrt{3}\phi}$.
