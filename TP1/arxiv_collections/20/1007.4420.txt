We formulate a Ginsparg-Wilson relation on a fuzzy 2-sphere for matter in the
adjoint representation of the gauge group. Because of the Ginsparg-Wilson
relation, an index theorem is satisfied. Our formulation is applicable to
topologically nontrivial configurations as monopoles. It gives a solid basis
for obtaining chiral fermions, which are an important ingredient of the
standard model, from matrix model formulations of the superstring theory, such
as the IIB matrix model, by considering topological configurations in the extra
dimensions. We finally discuss whether this mechanism really works.
