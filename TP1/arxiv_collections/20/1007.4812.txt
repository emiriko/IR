We examine the dark matter phenomenology in supersymmetric light higgs boson
scenarios, adapting nonuniversal Higgs masses at the gauge coupling unification
scale. The correct relic density is obtained mostly through the annihilation
into a pseudoscalar $A$, which gives high values for the self-annihilation
cross-section at present times. Our analysis shows that most part of the $A$
pole region can produce detectable gamma-rays and antiproton signals, and still
be compatible with with recent direct detection data from XENON100 and CDMS-II.
