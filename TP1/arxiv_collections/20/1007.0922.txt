The self-organization of a Bose-Einstein condensate in a transversely pumped
optical cavity is a process akin to crystallization: when pumped by a laser of
sufficient intensity, the coupled matter and light fields evolve,
spontaneously, into a spatially modulated pattern, or crystal, whose lattice
structure is dictated by the geometry of the cavity. In cavities having
multiple degenerate modes, the quasi-continuum of possible lattice
arrangements, and the continuous symmetry breaking associated with the adoption
of a particular lattice arrangement, give rise to phenomena such as phonons,
defects, and frustration, which have hitherto been unexplored in ultracold
atomic settings involving neutral atoms. The present work develops a
nonequilibrium field-theoretic approach to explore the self-organization of a
BEC in a pumped, lossy optical cavity. We find that the transition is well
described, in the regime of primary interest, by an effective equilibrium
theory. At nonzero temperatures, the self-organization occurs via a
fluctuation-driven first-order phase transition of the Brazovskii class; this
transition persists to zero temperature, and crosses over into a quantum phase
transition of a new universality class. We make further use of our
field-theoretic description to investigate the role of nonequilibrium
fluctuations on the self-organization transition, as well as to explore the
nucleation of ordered-phase droplets, the nature and energetics of topological
defects, supersolidity in the ordered phase, and the possibility of frustration
controlled by the cavity geometry. In addition, we discuss the range of
experimental parameters for which we expect the phenomena described here to be
observable, along with possible schemes for detecting ordering and fluctuations
via either atomic correlations or the correlations of the light emitted from
the cavity.
