Single-Photon Cooling (SPC), noted for its potential as a versatile method
for cooling a variety of atomic species, has recently been demonstrated
experimentally. In this paper, we study possible ways to improve the
performance of SPC by applying it to atoms trapped inside a wedge billiard. The
main feature of wedge billiard for atoms, also experimentally realized
recently, is that the nature of atomic trajectories within it changes from
stable periodic orbit to random chaotic motion with the change in wedge angle.
We find that a high cooling efficiency is possible in this system with a
relatively weak dependence on the wedge angle, and that chaotic dynamics,
rather than regular orbit, is more desirable for enhancing the performance of
SPC.
