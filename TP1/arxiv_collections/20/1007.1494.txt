The spin states and electronic structure of layered perovskite La1.5Ca0.5CoO4
are investigated using fullpotential linearized augmented plane-wave method.
All the computational results indicate that the Co2+ ion is in a high-spin
state and the Co3+ in a low-spin state. The Co2+ t2g orbitals with a small
crystal-field splitting are mixed by spin-orbit coupling, which accounts for
the observed easy in-plane magnetism. The nonmagnetic LS-Co3+ state, which is
stabilized by a strong crystal field, provides a natural explanation for the
observed low magnetic ordering temperature and a spin-blockade phenomenon of
the electron hopping. Furthermore, we find that the intermediate-spin state of
Co3+ has a large multiplet splitting. But the lowest-lying IS state of Co3+ is
still higher in energy than the LS ground state by a few hundred millielectron
volts and the HS state of Co3+ is even less stable, both in sharp contrast to a
recent experimental study which suggested the HS+IS mixed Co3+ ground state. We
note that either the IS-Co3+ or HS-Co3+ states or their mixture would produce a
wrong out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy and a much higher magneticordering
temperature than observed. Thus, the present work sheds light on this material
concerning its electronic and magnetic structure, and it would stimulate
different experiments to settle this intriguing spin-state issue.
