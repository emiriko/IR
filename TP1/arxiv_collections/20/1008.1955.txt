Found in all eukaryotic cells, linker histones H1 are known to bind to and
rearrange nucleosomal linker DNA. In vitro, the fundamental nature of H1/DNA
interactions has attracted wide interest among research communities - for
biologists from a chromatin organization deciphering point of view, and for
physicists from the study of polyelectrolyte interactions point of view. Hence,
H1/DNA binding processes, structural and dynamical information about these
self-assemblies is of broad importance. Targeting a quantitative understanding
of H1 induced DNA compaction mechanisms our strategy is based on using small
angle X-ray microdiffraction in combination with microfluidics. The usage of
microfluidic hydrodynamic focusing devices facilitate a microscale control of
these self-assembly processes. In addition, the method enables time-resolved
access to structure formation in situ, in particular to transient intermediate
states. The observed time dependent structure evolution shows that the
interaction of H1 with DNA can be described as a two step process: an initial
unspecific binding of H1 to DNA is followed by a rearrangement of molecules
within the formed assemblies. The second step is most likely induced by
interactions between the charged side chains of the protein and DNA. This leads
to an increase in lattice spacing within the DNA/protein assembly and induces a
decrease in the correlation length of the mesophases, probably due to a local
bending of the DNA.
