The new generation of planar Penning traps promises to be a flexible and
versatile tool for quantum information studies. Here, we propose a fully
controllable and reversible way to change the typical trapping harmonic
potential into a double-well potential, in the axial direction. In this
configuration a trapped particle can perform coherent oscillations between the
two wells. The tunneling rate, which depends on the barrier height and width,
can be adjusted at will by varying the potential difference applied to the trap
electrodes. Most notably, tunneling rates in the range of kHz are achievable
even with a trap size of the order of 100 microns.
