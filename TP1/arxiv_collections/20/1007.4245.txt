We have studied the thermal, magnetic, and electrical properties of the
ternary intermetallic system CeNiGe$_{3}$ by means of specific heat,
magnetization, and resistivity measurements. The specific heat data, together
with the anisotropic magnetic susceptibility, was analyzed on the basis of the
point charge model of crystalline electric field. The $J$\,=\,5/2 multiplet of
the Ce$^{3+}$ is split by the crystalline electric field (CEF) into three
Kramers doublets, where the second and third doublet are separated from the
first (ground state) doublet by $\Delta_{1}$ $\sim$ 100\,K and $\Delta_{2}$
$\sim$ 170\,K, respectively. In zero field CeNiGe$_{3}$ exhibits an
antiferromangeic order below $T_{N}$ = 5.0\,K. For
\textbf{H}\,$\parallel$\,\textbf{a} two metamagnetic transitions are clearly
evidenced between 2\,$\sim$\,4\,K from the magnetization isotherm and extended
down to 0.4\,K from the magnetoresistance measurements. For
\textbf{H}\,$\parallel$\,\textbf{a}, $T_{N}$ shifts to lower temperature as
magnetic field increases, and ultimately disappears at $H_{c}$ $\sim$
32.5\,kOe. For $H\,>\,H_{c}$, the electrical resistivity shows the quadratic
temperature dependence ($\Delta\rho = A T^{2}$). For $H \gg H_{c}$, an
unconventional $T^{n}$-dependence of $\Delta\rho$ with $n > 2$ emerges, the
exponent $n$ becomes larger as magnetic field increases. Although the
antiferromagnetic phase transition temperature in CeNiGe$_{3}$ can be
continuously suppressed to zero, it provides an example of field tuning that
does not match current simple models of Quantum criticality.
