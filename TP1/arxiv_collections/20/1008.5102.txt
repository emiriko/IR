We construct an N=1 supersymmetric gauge theory from z=3 Lifshitz field
theory. By modifying the supersymmetry (susy) algebra based on the spacetime
symmetry SO(3) $\times$ scaling symmetry, we get a supersymmetric Lagrangian
with scalar, fermion and gauge fields, all of whom have the same limiting
speed. This solves some naturalness problems of the original Lifshitz theory
which is characterized by Lorentz symmetry violation. In order that the susy
breaking does not introduce any disastrous terms into the theory, the susy
breaking scale is required to be smaller than the scale of Lorentz symmetry
violation.
