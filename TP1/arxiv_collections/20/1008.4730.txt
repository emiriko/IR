Recent observations from the Extreme-ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer (EIS)
on board Hinode have shown that low density areas on the periphery of active
regions are characterized by strong blue-shifts at 1 MK. These Doppler shifts
have been associated with outward propagating disturbances observed with
Extreme-ultraviolet and soft X-ray imagers. Since these instruments can have
broad temperature responses we investigate these intensity fluctuations using
the monochromatic imaging capabilities of EIS and confirm their 1 MK nature. We
also find that the Fe XII 195.119 A blue shifted spectral profiles at their
footpoints exhibit transient blue wing enhancements on timescales as short as
the 5 minute cadence. We have also looked at the fan peripheral loops observed
at 0.6 MK in Si VII 275.368 A in those regions and find no sign of the
recurrent outward propagating disturbances with velocities of 40 - 130 km/s
seen in Fe XII. We do observe downward trends (15 - 20 km/s) consistent with
the characteristic red-shifts measured at their footpoints. We, therefore, find
no evidence that the structures at these two temperatures and the intensity
fluctuations they exhibit are related to one another.
