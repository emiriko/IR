We experimentally and theoretically study self-phase modulation by Kerr
effect in a liquid filled hollow core photonic crystal fiber. We perform a
complete characterization of the linear optical properties of the hollow core
photonic band gap fiber filled with deuterated acetone to determine all the
characteristics of the propagation mode. The nonlinear coefficient of the fiber
is determined by fitting the output spectra broadened by self-phase modulation
with a new analytical expression giving the spectra of a secant hyperbolic
pulse transmitted through a Kerr media. The experiment allows a precise
determination of the nonlinear index change of acetone-d6 equal to
(1.15$\pm$0.17)x10-19 m2W-1.
