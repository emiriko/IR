In this article, we analyze the microlocal properties of the linearized
forward scattering operator $F$ and the reconstruction operator $F^{*}F$
appearing in bistatic synthetic aperture radar imaging. In our model, the radar
source and detector travel along a line a fixed distance apart. We show that
$F$ is a Fourier integral operator, and we give the mapping properties of the
projections from the canonical relation of $F$, showing that the right
projection is a blow-down and the left projection is a fold. We then show that
$F^{*}F$ is a singular FIO belonging to the class $I^{3,0}$.
