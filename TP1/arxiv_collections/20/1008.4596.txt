The Higgs concept can be assigned a precise quantitative cosmic identity with
a physically anchored cryptographic analysis. Specifically demonstrated is the
direct correspondence of the supersymmetric solution pair (BHh1 and BHh2) of
the Higgs Congruence in the extension field to the observed magnitudes of the
cosmological constants and . These results are in perfect agreement with the
maximally preferred magnitudes of these quantities as experimentally determined
(0.712 < {\Omega}{\Lambda}< 0.758 and 0.242 < {\Omega}m< 0.308) by the
concordance of measured ranges. The corresponding theoretical values found also
satisfy exactly the condition for perfect flatness, an outcome that is
legislated by the concept of supersymmetry in . Since previous work has
established that the fine-structure constant {\alpha} can be uniquely computed
in the corresponding physically defined prime field, in sharp accord with the
best high-precision measurement (~370 ppt) of {\alpha}, the computation of and
with the identical cryptographic apparatus demonstrates that a precise
quantitative relationship exists between fundamental micro-scale couplings and
the largest cosmic-scale entities. Since both fields and are fully defined by
the prime (mod 4), the alliance of these quantitative findings relating
provides additional confirming evidence for the correctness of its previously
established physically based magnitude. Ultimately, a coherent synthesis is
achieved in conformance with observational data that quantitatively relates the
six physically intrinsic universal parameters {\alpha}, G, h, c,
{\Omega}{\Lambda}, and {\Omega}m.
