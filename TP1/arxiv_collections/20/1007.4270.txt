A subgroup H of a reductive group G is horospherical if it contains a maximal
unipotent subgroup. We describe the Grothendieck semigroup of invariant
subspaces of regular functions on G/H as a semigroup of convex polytopes. From
this we obtain a formula for the number of solutions of a generic system of
equations on G/H in terms of mixed volume of polytopes. This generalizes
Bernstein-Kushnirenko theorem from toric geometry.
