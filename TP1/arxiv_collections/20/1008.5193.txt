Detection of high-energy (~> 100 MeV) gamma rays by the Fermi Large Area
Telescope (LAT) from a nova in the symbiotic binary system V407 Cygni has
opened possibility of high-energy neutrino detection from this type of sources.
Thermonuclear explosion on the white dwarf surface sets off a nova shell in
motion that expands and slows down in a dense surrounding medium provided by
the red giant companion. Particles are accelerated in the shocks of the shell,
and interact with surrounding medium to produce observed gamma rays. We show
that proton-proton interaction, which is most likely responsible for producing
gamma rays via neutral pion decay, produces ~> 0.1 GeV neutrinos that can be
detected by the current and future experiments at ~> 10 GeV.
