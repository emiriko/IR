The propagation of charm and bottom quarks through an ellipsoidal domain of
quark gluon plasma has been studied within the ambit of non-equilibrium
statistical mechanics. Energy dissipation of heavy quarks by both radiative and
collisional processes are taken in to account. The experimental data on the
elliptic flow of the non-photonic electrons resulting from the semi-leptonic
decays of hadrons containing heavy flavours has been reproduced with the same
formalism that has been used earlier to reproduce the nuclear suppression
factors. The elliptic flow of the non-photonic electron from heavy meson decays
produced in nuclear collisions at LHC and low energy RHIC run have also been
predicted.
