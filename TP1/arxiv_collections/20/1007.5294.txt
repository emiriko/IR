The covariantly constant spacetime torsion is one of the fields which may
break Lorentz and CPT symmetry. We review the previous works on the dynamical
torsion in the framework of effective quantum field theory (QFT). It turns out
that the existence of propagating torsion is strongly restricted by the QFT
principles. In particular, the torsion mass must be much greater than the
masses of all fermionic particles. In this situation, the main chance to
observe torsion is due to some symmetry breaking which may, in principle,
produce almost constant background torsion field.
