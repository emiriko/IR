The successful completion of a software development process depends on the
analytical capability and foresightedness of the project manager. For the
project manager, the main intriguing task is to manage the risk factors as they
adversely influence the completion deadline. One such key risk factor is staff
training. The risk of this factor can be avoided by pre-judging the amount of
training required by the staff. So, a procedure is required to help the project
manager make this decision. This paper presents a system that uses influence
diagrams to implement the risk model to aid decision making. The system also
considers the cost of conducting the training, based on various risk factors
such as, (i) Lack of experience with project software; (ii) Newly appointed
staff; (iii) Staff not well versed with the required quality standards; and
(iv) Lack of experience with project environment. The system provides estimated
requirement details for staff training at the beginning of a software
development project.
