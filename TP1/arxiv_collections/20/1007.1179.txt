We describe a compression method for floating-point astronomical images that
gives compression ratios of 6 -- 10 while still preserving the scientifically
important information in the image. The pixel values are first preprocessed by
quantizing them into scaled integer intensity levels, which removes some of the
uncompressible noise in the image. The integers are then losslessly compressed
using the fast and efficient Rice algorithm and stored in a portable FITS
format file. Quantizing an image more coarsely gives greater image compression,
but it also increases the noise and degrades the precision of the photometric
and astrometric measurements in the quantized image. Dithering the pixel values
during the quantization process can greatly improve the precision of
measurements in the images. This is especially important if the analysis
algorithm relies on the mode or the median which would be similarly quantized
if the pixel values are not dithered. We perform a series of experiments on
both synthetic and real astronomical CCD images to quantitatively demonstrate
that the magnitudes and positions of stars in the quantized images can be
measured with the predicted amount of precision. In order to encourage wider
use of these image compression methods, we have made available a pair of
general-purpose image compression programs, called fpack and funpack, which can
be used to compress any FITS format image.
