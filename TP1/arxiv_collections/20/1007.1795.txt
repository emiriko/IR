We explain how quantum gravity can be defined by quantizing spacetime itself.
A pinpoint is that the gravitational constant G = L_P^2 whose physical
dimension is of (length)^2 in natural unit introduces a symplectic structure of
spacetime which causes a noncommutative spacetime at the Planck scale L_P. The
symplectic structure of spacetime M leads to an isomorphism between symplectic
geometry (M, \omega) and Riemannian geometry (M, g) where the deformations of
symplectic structure \omega in terms of electromagnetic fields F=dA are
transformed into those of Riemannian metric g. This approach for quantum
gravity allows a background independent formulation where spacetime as well as
matter fields is equally emergent from a universal vacuum of quantum gravity
which is thus dubbed as the quantum equivalence principle.
