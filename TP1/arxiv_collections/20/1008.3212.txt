One important way to characterize the states having a gauge symmetry
spontaneously broken over multibands should be to look at their collective
excitation modes. We find that a three-band system has multiple Leggett modes
with significantly different masses, which can be classified into different
dynamical classes according to whether multiple inter-band Josephson currents
add or cancel. This provides a way to dynamically characterize multiband
superconductivity while the pairing symmetry is a static property.
