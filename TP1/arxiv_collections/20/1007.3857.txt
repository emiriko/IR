By means of the description of the standard relative dynamics in terms of
gravito-electromagnetic fields, in the context of natural splitting, we
formally introduce the gravito-magnetic Aharonov-Bohm effect. Then, we
interpret the Sagnac effect as a gravito-magnetic Aharonov-Bohm effect and we
exploit this formalism for studying the General Relativistic corrections to the
Sagnac effect in stationary and axially symmetric geometries.
