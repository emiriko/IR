We develop a systematic perturbative method to obtain analytic solution of
the Generalized Dorokhov-Mello-Pereyra-Kumar (DMPK) equation in the strongly
disordered regime which describes the evolution of the joint probability
distribution of the transmission eigenvalues with system size. The solution
allows us to obtain the distribution of conductance analytically in the
insulating regime. Our results are consistent with existing numerical
simulations of the three dimensional tight binding Anderson model, and suggests
a possible description of the Anderson transition in the presence of a very
broad, highly asymmetric conductance distribution.
