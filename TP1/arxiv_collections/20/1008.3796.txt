Extending mode-coupling theory, we elaborate a microscopic theory for the
glass transition of liquids confined between two parallel flat hard walls. The
theory contains the standard MCT equations in bulk and in two dimensions as
limiting cases and requires as input solely the equilibrium density profile and
the structure factors of the fluid in confinement. We evaluate the phase
diagram as a function of the distance of the plates for the case of a hard
sphere fluid and obtain an oscillatory behavior of the glass transtion line as
a result of the structural changes related to layering.
