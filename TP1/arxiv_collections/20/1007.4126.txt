This Symposium is devoted to the Memory of Lev Kofman,
June-17-1957-November-12-2009.
  The accelerated expansion of the Universe, which is today observed, shows
that cosmological dynamics is dominated by the so-called Dark Energy field
which provides a large negative pressure. This is the standard picture, in
which such new ingredient is considered as a source of the right hand side of
the field equations. It should be some form of non-clustered non-zero vacuum
energy which, together with the clustered Dark Matter, drives the global
dynamics. This is the so-called "concordance model" (ACDM) which gives, in
agreement with the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMBR), dim Lyman
Limit Systems (LLS) and type la supernovae (SNeIa) data, a good framework to
understand the today observed Universe. However, it presents several
shortcomings as the well known "coincidence" and "cosmological constant"
problems . An alternative approach is to have a better understanding of the
energy concept in General Relativity and also to change the left hand side of
the field equations, and check if observed cosmic dynamics can be achieved by
extending general relativity. In this different context, it is not required to
search candidates for Dark Energy and Dark Matter, which till now have not been
found. Rather, one can only stand on the "observed" ingredients: curvature and
baryon matter, to account for the observations. Considering this point of view,
one can think of that gravity is not scale-invariant. The goal of this
Symposium is to obtain a tapestry of the present status of theory and
observations concerning Gravitation and Dark Universe.
