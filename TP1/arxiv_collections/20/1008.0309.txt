In this paper we discuss the sign of helicity in the $\alpha$-$\Omega$ dynamo
and propose a wave-$\Omega$ model in which the $\alpha$ effect in the geodynamo
is induced by helical wave but not helical flow as in the solar dynamo. We then
tentatively interpret the mechanisms of the Earth's magnetic westward drift,
tilt angle, and dipole reversals.
