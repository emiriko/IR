This paper briefly reviews some of the exciting studies of the local Universe
that will be enabled with the European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT). As
illustrative examples, it summarizes a few of the scientific goals that have
been set for this instrument for studies of young starburst clusters, evolved
stars, the Galactic centre, Galactic structure, nucleo-chronometry, the
interpretation of the "Spite Plateau," and the properties of resolved stellar
populations in external galaxies. It finishes on a note of warning that we
really need to be even more innovative and adventurous if we are to justify the
cost of the E-ELT.
