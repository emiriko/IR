In this paper, we give a new framework for constructing low ML decoding
complexity Space-Time Block Codes (STBCs) using codes over the finite field
$\mathbb{F}_4$. Almost all known low ML decoding complexity STBCs can be
obtained via this approach. New full-diversity STBCs with low ML decoding
complexity and cubic shaping property are constructed, via codes over
$\mathbb{F}_4$, for number of transmit antennas \mbox{$N=2^m$}, \mbox{$m \geq
1$}, and rates \mbox{$R>1$} complex symbols per channel use. When \mbox{$R=N$},
the new STBCs are information-lossless as well. The new class of STBCs have the
least known ML decoding complexity among all the codes available in the
literature for a large set of \mbox{$(N,R)$} pairs.
