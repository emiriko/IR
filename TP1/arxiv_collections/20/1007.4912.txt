We report the observation of spontaneous and ultra-sharp jumps in the low
temperature magnetization isotherms of polycrystalline Nd5Ge3. Field-induced
and ultra-sharp jumps are also seen in resistivity and heat capacity data.
These jumps are accompanied by field-induced irreversibilities. The consistency
seen in these three data clearly shows that the spin, electronic and lattice
states are strongly coupled. Time-induced growth of the ferromagnetic phase is
observed at a constant field and temperature, implying the metastability of the
magnetic phase in the low field region. Various experimental findings point
towards a strong field-induced magneto-structural irreversibility in this
compound.
