The earlier paper of this same title demonstrated a collapse of relaxation
data of fragile supercooled glass forming liquids [\textit{J. Phys. Chem. B}
\textbf{113}, 5563-5567 (2009)]. For temperature $T$ below that of the onset to
supercooled behavior, $T_{\mathrm{o}}$, the logarithm of structural relaxation
time, $\log \tau$, is given by the parabolic form $\log
(\tau/\tau_{\mathrm{o}}) \, =\, J^2(1/T - 1/T_{\mathrm{o}})^{2}$, where $J$ and
$\tau_{\mathrm{o}}$ are temperature independent. This paper presents further
applications of this formula. In particular, it is shown that the effects of
attractive forces in numerical simulation of glass forming liquids can be
logically organized in terms of $J$ and $T_{\mathrm{o}}$. Further, analysis of
experimental data for several systems suggests that $J$ and $T_{\mathrm{o}}$
are material properties. In contrast, values of similar parameters for other
fitting formulas are shown to depend not only upon the material but also upon
the range of data used in fitting these formulas. Expressions demonstrated to
fail in this way include the Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann formula, a
double-exponential formula, and a fractional exponential formula.
