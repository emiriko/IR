The Purcell factor is the standard figure of merit for spontaneous emission
enhancement in microcavities, that has also been proposed to describe emission
enhancements for plasmonic resonances. A comparison is made of quality factor,
mode volume and Purcell factor for single and coupled plasmon spheres to exact
calculations of emission rates. The paper explains why the Purcell factor is
not appropriate for plasmon antennas.
