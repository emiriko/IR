The interaction between emerging magnetic flux and the pre-existing ambient
field has become a "hot" topic for both numerical simulations and
high-resolution observations of the solar atmosphere. The appearance of
brightenings and surges during episodes of flux emergence is believed to be a
signature of magnetic reconnection processes. We present an analysis of a
small-scale flux emergence event in NOAA 10971, observed simultaneously with
the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope on La Palma and the \emph{Hinode} satellite
during a joint campaign in September 2007. Extremely high-resolution G-band,
H$\alpha$, and \ion{Ca}{2} H filtergrams, \ion{Fe}{1} and \ion{Na}{1}
magnetograms, EUV raster scans, and X-ray images show that the emerging region
was associated with chromospheric, transition region and coronal brightenings,
as well as with chromospheric surges. We suggest that these features were
caused by magnetic reconnection at low altitude in the atmosphere. To support
this idea, we perform potential and linear force-free field extrapolations
using the FROMAGE service. The extrapolations show that the emergence site is
cospatial with a 3D null point, from which a spine originates. This magnetic
configuration and the overall orientation of the field lines above the emerging
flux region are compatible with the structures observed in the different
atmospheric layers, and remain stable against variations of the force-free
field parameter. Our analysis supports the predictions of recent 3D numerical
simulations that energetic phenomena may result from the interaction between
emerging flux and the pre-existing chromospheric and coronal field.
