In this work it is continued the investigation of the space-time scales of
the hadronization process in the framework of string model. The average
formation lengths of several widely using species of baryons (antibaryons) such
as $p$ ($\bar{p}$), $n$ ($\bar{n}$), $\Delta$ ($\bar{\Delta}$), $\Lambda$
($\bar{\Lambda}$) and $\Sigma$ ($\bar{\Sigma}$) are studied. It is shown that
they depend from electrical charges or, more precise, from quark contents of
the hadrons. In particular, the average formation lengths of positively charged
hadrons, for example protons, are considerably larger than of their negatively
charged antiparticles, antiprotons. This statement is fulfilled for all nuclear
targets and any value of the Bjorken scaling variable $x_{Bj}$. The main
mechanism is direct production. Additional production mechanism in result of
decay of resonances gives small contribution. It is shown that the average
formation lengths of protons (antiprotons) are slowly rising (decreasing)
functions of $x_{Bj}$, the ones of neutrons and antineutrons are slowly
decreasing functions of $x_{Bj}$. The shape and behavior of average formation
lengths for baryons qualitatively coincide with the ones for pseudoscalar
mesons obtained earlier.
