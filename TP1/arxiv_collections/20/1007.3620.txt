We consider observational properties of gamma-ray bursts (GRB) transmitted by
hypothetical wormholes (WH). Such burst would be observable as repeating
source, analogous to Soft Gamma-Repeaters (SGR). We show that the known sources
of SGR cannot be WH candidates. We also discuss observational properties of GRB
which might be a signature of WH.
