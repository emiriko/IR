We have performed an angle-resolved photoemission study of the iron pnictide
superconductor KFe2As2 with Tc 4 K. Most of the observed Fermi surfaces show
almost two-dimensional shapes, while one of the quasi-particle bands near the
Fermi level has a strong dispersion along the kz direction, consistent with the
result of a band-structure calculation. However, hole Fermi surfaces \alpha and
\zeta are smaller than those predicted by the calculation while other Fermi
surfaces are larger. These observations are consistent with the result of a de
Haas-van Alphen study and a theoretical prediction on inter-band scattering,
possibly indicating many body effects on the electronic structure.
