Motivated by recent experiments with confined binary liquid mixtures near
their continous demixing phase transition we study the critical behavior of a
system, which belongs to the Ising universality class, for the film geometry
with one planar wall chemically structured such that there is a laterally
alternating adsorption preference for the species of the binary liquid mixture.
By means of Monte Carlo simulations and finite-size scaling analysis we
determine the critical Casimir force and the corresponding universal scaling
function.
