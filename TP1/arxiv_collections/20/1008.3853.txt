Motivated by recent time domain experiments on ultrafast atom ionization, we
analyze the transients and timescales that characterize, besides the relatively
long lifetime, the decay by tunneling of a localized state. While the tunneling
starts immediately, some time is required for the outgoing flux to develop.
This short-term behavior depends strongly on the initial state. For the initial
state tightly localized so that the initial transients are dominated by
over-the-barrier motion, the timescale for the flux propagation through the
barrier is close to the B\"uttiker-Landauer traversal time. Then a
quasistationary, slowly decay process follows, which sets ideal conditions for
observing diffraction in time at longer times and distances. To define
operationally a tunnelling time at the barrier edge, we extrapolate backwards
the propagation of the wave packet escaped from the potential. This
extrapolated time is considerably longer than the timescale of the flux and
density buildup at the barrier edge.
