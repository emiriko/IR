We calculate the ttbar forward-backward asymmetry, A_FB^t, in Randall-Sundrum
(RS) models taking into account the dominant next-to-leading order (NLO)
corrections in QCD. At Born level we include the exchange of Kaluza-Klein (KK)
gluons and photons, the Z boson and its KK excitations, as well as the Higgs
boson, whereas beyond the leading order (LO) we consider the interference of
tree-level KK-gluon exchange with one-loop QCD box diagrams and the
corresponding bremsstrahlungs corrections. We find that the strong suppression
of LO effects, that arises due to the elementary nature and the mostly
vector-like couplings of light quarks, is lifted at NLO after paying the price
of an additional factor of alpha_s/(4 pi). In spite of this enhancement, the
resulting RS corrections in A_FB^t remain marginal, leaving the predicted
asymmetry SM-like. As our arguments are solely based on the smallness of the
axial-vector couplings of light quarks to the strong sector, our findings are
model-independent and apply to many scenarios of new physics that address the
flavor problem via geometrical sequestering.
