We demonstrate how the controlled positioning of a plasmonic nanoparticle
modifies the photoluminescence of a single epitaxial GaAs quantum dot. The
antenna particle leads to an increase of the luminescence intensity by about a
factor of eight. Spectrally and temporally resolved photoluminescence
measurements prove an increase of the quantum dot's excitation rate. The
combination of stable epitaxial quantum emitters and plasmonic nanostructures
promises to be highly beneficial for nanoscience and quantum optics.
