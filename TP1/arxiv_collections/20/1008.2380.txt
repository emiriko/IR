We use computer algebra to determine the Lie invariants of degree <= 12 in
the free Lie algebra on two generators corresponding to the natural
representation of the simple 3-dimensional Lie algebra sl(2,C). We then
consider the free Lie algebra on three generators, and compute the Lie
invariants of degree <= 7 corresponding to the adjoint representation of
sl(2,C), and the Lie invariants of degree <= 9 corresponding to the natural
representation of sl(3,C). We represent the action of sl(2,C) and sl(3,C) on
Lie polynomials by computing the coefficient matrix with respect to the basis
of Hall words. We then use algorithms for linear algebra (row canonical form,
Hermite normal form, lattice basis reduction) to compute a basis of the
nullspace.
