Recently, a chaos-based image encryption algorithm called MCKBA (Modified
Chaotic-Key Based Algorithm) was proposed. This paper analyzes the security of
MCKBA and finds that it can be broken with a differential attack, which
requires only four chosen plain-images. Performance of the attack is verified
by experimental results. In addition, some defects of MCKBA, including
insensitivity with respect to changes of plain-image/secret key, are reported.
