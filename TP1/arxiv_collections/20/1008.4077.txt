This article describes the design and performance of the muon monitor for the
T2K (Tokaito-Kamioka) long baseline neutrino oscillation experiment. The muon
monitor consists of two types of detector arrays: ionization chambers and
silicon PIN photodiodes. It measures the intensity and profile of muons
produced, along with neutrinos, in the decay of pions. The measurement is
sensitive to the intensity and direction of the neutrino beam. The linearity
and stability of the detectors were measured in beam tests to be within 2.4%
and 1.5%, respectively. Based on the test results, the precision of the beam
direction measured by the muon monitor is expected to be 0.25 mrad.
