This paper presents a simple local medium access control protocol, called
\textsc{Jade}, for multi-hop wireless networks with a single channel that is
provably robust against adaptive adversarial jamming. The wireless network is
modeled as a unit disk graph on a set of nodes distributed arbitrarily in the
plane. In addition to these nodes, there are adversarial jammers that know the
protocol and its entire history and that are allowed to jam the wireless
channel at any node for an arbitrary $(1-\epsilon)$-fraction of the time steps,
where $0<\epsilon<1$ is an arbitrary constant. We assume that the nodes cannot
distinguish between jammed transmissions and collisions of regular messages.
Nevertheless, we show that \textsc{Jade} achieves an asymptotically optimal
throughput if there is a sufficiently dense distribution of nodes.
