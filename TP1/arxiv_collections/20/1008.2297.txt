Order statistics find applications in various areas of communications and
signal processing. In this paper, we introduce an unified analytical framework
to determine the joint statistics of partial sums of ordered random variables
(RVs). With the proposed approach, we can systematically derive the joint
statistics of any partial sums of ordered statistics, in terms of the moment
generating function (MGF) and the probability density function (PDF). Our
MGF-based approach applies not only when all the K ordered RVs are involved but
also when only the Ks (Ks < K) best RVs are considered. In addition, we present
the closed-form expressions for the exponential RV special case. These results
apply to the performance analysis of various wireless communication systems
over fading channels.
