The delayed choice experiments are a collection of experiments where the
counterintuitive laws of quantum mechanics are manifested in a very striking
way. Although the delayed choice experiments can be very accurately described
with the standard framework of quantum optics, a more didactical and intuitive
explanation seems not to have been given so far. In this note, we fill that
gap.
