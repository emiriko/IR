Weierstrass representation is a classical parameterization of minimal
surfaces. However, two functions should be specified to construct the
parametric form in Weierestrass representation. In this paper, we propose an
explicit parametric form for a class of parametric polynomial minimal surfaces
of arbitrary degree. It includes the classical Enneper surface for cubic case.
The proposed minimal surfaces also have some interesting properties such as
symmetry, containing straight lines and self-intersections. According to the
shape properties, the proposed minimal surface can be classified into four
categories with respect to $n=4k-1$ $n=4k+1$, $n=4k$ and $n=4k+2$. The explicit
parametric form of corresponding conjugate minimal surfaces is given and the
isometric deformation is also implemented.
