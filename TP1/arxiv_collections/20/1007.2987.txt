We have studied the analytical dynamics of Bell nonlocality as measured by
CHSH inequality and entanglement as measured by concurrence for two noisy
qubits that have dipole-dipole interaction. The nonlocal entanglement created
by the dipole-dipole interaction is found to be protected from sudden death for
certain initial states.
