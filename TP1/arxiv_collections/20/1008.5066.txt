We propose a new algorithm, for parameter estimation that is applicable to
imaging using moving and synthetic aperture arrays. The new method results in
higher resolution and more accurate estimation than commonly used methods when
strong interfering sources are present inside and outside the field of view
(terrestrial interference, confusing sources).
