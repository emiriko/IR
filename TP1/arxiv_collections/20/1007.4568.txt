I have shown that if we assume that the Standard Model of particle physics
and Feynman-Weinberg quantum gravity holds at all times, then in the very early
universe, the Cosmic Background Radiation (CBR) cannot couple to right handed
electrons and quarks. If this property of CBR has persisted to the present day,
the Ultra HIgh Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECR) can propagate a factor of ten further
than they could if the CBR were an electromagnetic field, since most of the
cross section for pion production when a UHECR hits a CBR photon is due to a
quark spin flip, and such a flip cannot occur if the CBR photon cannot couple
to right handed quarks. The GZM effect will still reduce the number of UHECR,
but UHECR can arrive from a distance of a redshift of up to $z=0.1$. I show
that taking this additional propagation distance into account allows us to
identify the sources of 4 of the 6 UHECR which the Pierre Auger Collaboration
could not identify, and also identify the source of the 320 EeV UHECR seen by
the Fly's Eye instrument. I suggest an experiment to test this hypothesis about
the CBR.
