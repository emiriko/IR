Dynamic x-ray studies may reach temporal resolutions limited by only the
x-ray pulse duration if the detector is fast enough to segregate synchrotron
pulses. An analog integrating pixel array detector with in-pixel storage and
temporal resolution of around 150 ns, sufficient to isolate pulses, is
presented. Analog integration minimizes count-rate limitations and in-pixel
storage captures successive pulses. Fundamental tests of noise and linearity as
well as high-speed laser measurements are shown. The detector resolved
individual bunch trains at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS)
at levels of up to 3.7x10^3 x-rays/pixel/train. When applied to turn-by-turn
x-ray beam characterization single-shot intensity measurements were made with a
repeatability of 0.4% and horizontal oscillations of the positron cloud were
detected. This device is appropriate for time-resolved Bragg spot single
crystal experiments.
