Evidence of a non-thermal magnetic relaxation in the intermediate state of a
type-I superconducor is presented. It is attributed to quantum tunneling of
interfaces separating normal and superconducting regions. Tunneling barriers
are estimated and temperature of the crossover from thermal to quantum regime
is obtained from Caldeira-Leggett theory. Comparison between theory and
experiment points to tunneling of interface segments of size comparable to the
coherence length, by steps of order one nanometer.
