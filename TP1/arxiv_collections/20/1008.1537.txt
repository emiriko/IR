In this paper, we discuss our first attempts to model the broadband
persistent emission of magnetars within a self consistent, physical scenario.
We present the predictions of a synthetic model that we calculated with a new
Monte Carlo 3-D radiative code. The basic idea is that soft thermal photons
(e.g. emitted by the star surface) can experience resonant cyclotron
upscattering by a population of relativistic electrons threated in the twisted
magnetosphere. Our code is specifically tailored to work in the
ultra-magnetized regime; polarization and QED effects are consistently
accounted for, as well different configurations for the magnetosphere. We
discuss the predicted spectral properties in the 0.1-1000 keV range, the
polarization properties, and we present the model application to a sample of
magnetars soft X-ray spectra.
