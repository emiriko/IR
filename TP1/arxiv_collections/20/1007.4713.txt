We study low-temperature transport through a Coulomb blockaded quantum dot
(QD) contacted by a normal (N), and a superconducting (S) electrode. Within an
effective cotunneling model the conduction electron self energy is calculated
to leading order in the cotunneling amplitudes and subsequently resummed to
obtain the nonequilibrium T-matrix, from which we obtain the nonlinear
cotunneling conductance. For even occupied dots the system can be conceived as
an effective S/N-cotunnel junction with subgap transport mediated by Andreev
reflections. The net spin of an odd occupied dot, however, leads to the
formation of sub-gap resonances inside the superconducting gap which gives rise
to a characteristic peak-dip structure in the differential conductance, as
observed in recent experiments.
