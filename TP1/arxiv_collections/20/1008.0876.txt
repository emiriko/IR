The ATLAS experiment is one of two large general-purpose particle detectors
at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at the CERN laboratory in Geneva,
Switzerland. ATLAS has been collecting data from the collisions of protons
since December 2009, in order to investigate the conditions that existed during
the early Universe and the origins of mass, and other topics in fundamental
particle physics. The innermost layers of the ATLAS detector will be exposed to
the most radiation over the first few years of operation at the LHC. In
particular, the layer closest to the beam pipe, the B-layer, will degrade over
time due to the added radiation. To compensate for its degradation, it will be
replaced with an Insertable B-Layer (IBL) around 2016. The design of and R&D
for the IBL is ongoing, as the hope is to use the most current technologies in
the building of this new sub-detector layer. One topic of interest is the use
of more thermally conductive glues in the construction of the IBL, in order to
facilitate in the dissipation of heat from the detector. In this paper the
measurement and use of highly thermally conductive glues, in particular those
that are diamond-loaded, will be discussed. The modified transient plane source
technique for thermal conductivity is applied in characterizing the glues
across a wide temperature range.
