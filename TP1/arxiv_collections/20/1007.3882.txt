An EPW-sextic is a special 4-dimensional hypersurfaces of degree 6 which
comes equipped with a double cover which generically is a Hyperkaehler 4-fold
deformation equivalent to the Hilbert square of a K3 surface. The family of
EPW-sextics is analogous to the family of cubic 4-fold hypersurfaces, more
precisely double EPW-sextics are analogous to varieties of lines on cubic
4-folds. This first paper in a series on moduli and periods of double
EPW-sextics is mainly concerned with the classification of EPW-sextics which
are analogous to cubic 4-folds whose singular locus has strictly positive
dimension.
