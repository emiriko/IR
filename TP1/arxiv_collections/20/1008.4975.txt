Quantum magnetic oscillations in SrTiO3/\LaAlO3 interface are observed. The
evolution of their frequency and amplitude at various gate voltages and
temperatures is studied. The data are consistent with the Shubnikov de-Haas
theory. The Hall resistivity rho exhibits nonlinearity at low magnetic field.
It is fitted assuming multiple carrier contributions. The comparison between
the mobile carrier density inferred from the Hall data and the oscillation
frequency suggests multiple valley and spin degeneracy. The small amplitude of
the oscillations is discussed in the framework of the multiple band scenario.
