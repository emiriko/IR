In this contribution we discuss the impact of PDF uncertainties on t\bar{t}
and t-channel single-top production at the LHC. We present predictions for
total cross-sections computed at NLO accuracy with different PDF sets. For
single- top production, we point out that the uncertainty arising from the
choice of the bottom quark mass is one of the dominant theoretical
uncertainties on the total cross-section. Finally, the possibility of using PDF
induced correlations between top quark and electroweak vector boson production
cross-sections to improve the accuracy of LHC measurements is investigated.
