We study the collapse and revival of coherence induced by dipolar spin waves
in a trapped gas of Rb-87 atoms. In particular we observe spatially localized
collapse and revival of Ramsey fringe contrast and show how the pattern of
coherence depends on strength of the spin wave excitation. We find that the
spatial character of the coherence dynamics is incompatible with a simple model
based only on position-space overlap of wave functions. This phenomenon
requires a full phase-space description of the atomic spin using a quantum
Boltzmann transport equation, which highlights spin wave-induced coherent spin
currents and the ensuing dynamics they drive.
