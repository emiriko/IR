The Kane-Mele (KM) model is proposed to describe the quantum spin Hall effect
of electrons on the two-dimensional honeycomb lattice. Here, we will show that,
in a certain parameter region, the London equation is obtained from the
effective field theory of the layered KM model with an electronic correlation.
