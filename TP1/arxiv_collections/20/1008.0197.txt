We study the propagation properties of the solutions of the finite-difference
space semi-discrete wave equation on an uniform grid of the whole Euclidean
space. We provide a construction of high frequency wave packets that propagate
along the corresponding bi-characteristic rays of Geometric Optics with a group
velocity arbitrarily close to zero. Our analysis is motivated by control
theoretical issues. In particular, the continuous wave equation has the
so-called observability property: for a sufficiently large time, the total
energy of its solutions can be estimated in terms of the energy concentrated in
the exterior of a compact set. This fails to be true, uniformly on the
mesh-size parameter, for the semi-discrete schemes and the observability
constant blows-up at an arbitrarily large polynomial order. Our contribution
consists in providing a rigorous derivation of those wave packets and in
analyzing their behavior near that ray, by taking into account the subtle added
dispersive effects that the numerical scheme introduces.
