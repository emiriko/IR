In this note, we propose a novel application of geoparticle physics, namely
using a muon tomograph to study ice-filled cleft systems in steep bedrock
permafrost. This research could significantly improve our understanding of high
alpine permafrost in general and climate-permafrost induced rockfall in
particular.
