Static axisymmetric thin-shell wormholes are constructed within the framework
of the Brans-Dicke scalar-tensor theory of gravity. Examples of wormholes
associated with vacuum and electromagnetic fields are studied. All
constructions must be threaded by exotic matter, except in the case of
geometries with a singularity of finite radius, associated with an electric
field, which can have a throat supported by ordinary matter. These results are
achieved with any of the two definitions of the flare-out condition considered.
