The deconfinement phase transition from hadronic matter to quark matter in
the interior of compact stars is investigated. The hadronic phase is described
in the framework of relativistic mean-field (RMF) theory, when also the
scalar-isovector delta-meson effective field is taken into account. The MIT bag
model for describing a quark phase is used. The changes of the parameters of
phase transition caused by the presence of delta-meson field are explored.
Finally, alterations in the integral and structural parameters of hybrid stars
due to both deconfinement phase transition and inclusion of delta-meson field
are discussed.
