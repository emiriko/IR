Herschel-HIFI observations of high-J lines (up to J_u=10) of 12CO, 13CO and
C18O are presented toward three deeply embedded low-mass protostars, NGC 1333
IRAS 2A, IRAS 4A, and IRAS 4B, obtained as part of the Water In Star-forming
regions with Herschel (WISH) key program. The spectrally-resolved HIFI data are
complemented by ground-based observations of lower-J CO and isotopologue lines.
The 12CO 10-9 profiles are dominated by broad (FWHM 25-30 km s^-1) emission.
Radiative transfer models are used to constrain the temperature of this shocked
gas to 100-200 K. Several CO and 13CO line profiles also reveal a medium-broad
component (FWHM 5-10 km s^-1), seen prominently in H2O lines. Column densities
for both components are presented, providing a reference for determining
abundances of other molecules in the same gas. The narrow C18O 9-8 lines probe
the warmer part of the quiescent envelope. Their intensities require a jump in
the CO abundance at an evaporation temperature around 25 K, thus providing new
direct evidence for a CO ice evaporation zone around low-mass protostars.
