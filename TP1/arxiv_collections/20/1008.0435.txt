Recent experiments on Bi-based cuprate superconductors have revealed an
unexpected enhancement of the pairing correlations near the interstitial oxygen
dopant ions. Here we propose a possible mechanism -- based on local screening
effects -- by which the oxygen dopants do modify the electronic parameters
within the CuO_2 planes and strongly increase the superexchange coupling J.
This enhances the spin pairing effects locally and may explain the observed
spatial variations of the density of states and the pairing gap.
