We propose a theoretical scheme to realize tailorable couplings between a
cantilever and a superconducting charge qubit. By tuning the controllable
parameters of the qubit, both linear and nonlinear couplings between the
cantilever and the qubit can be achieved. Based on these couplings, we show the
preparation of the cantilever into some interesting quantum states, such as
superposed coherent states and squeezed states, via manipulating and detecting
the qubit. We also study the influence of the environment on quantum states of
the cantilever. It is indicated that decoherence induced by the environment can
drive the cantilever from superposed coherent states into the steady coherent
state. It is also found that the environment can induce the steady-state
position squeezing of the cantilever under a critical temperature. These
results will shed new light on production of nonclassical effects of the
cantilever.
