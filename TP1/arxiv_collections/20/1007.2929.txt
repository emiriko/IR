In this note, we investigate the possibility of avoiding the Big Bang
singularity with a single scalar field which couples non-minimally to gravity.
We show that in the case that gravity couples linearly to the field, some
severe conditions on the field's potential have to be imposed. However, in
non-linear case, it is quite generic to avoid the singularity with single
scalar field.
