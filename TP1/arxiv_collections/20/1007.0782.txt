We derive and discuss an experimentally realistic model describing ultracold
atoms in an optical lattice including a commensurate, but staggered, Zeeman
field. The resulting band structure is quite exotic; fermions in the third band
have an unusual rounded picture-frame Fermi surface (essentially two concentric
squircles), leading to imperfect nesting. We develop a generalized
SO(3,1)xSO(3,1) theory describing the spin and charge degrees of freedom
simultaneously, and show that the system can develop a coupled
spin-charge-density wave order. This ordering is absent in studies of the
Hubbard model that treat spin and charge density separately.
