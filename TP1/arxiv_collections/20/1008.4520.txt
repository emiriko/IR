The photoproduction of $\omega$ mesons on LH_2, C and Nb has been studied for
incident photon energies from 900 to 1300 MeV using the CB/TAPS detector at
ELSA. The $\omega$ line shape does not show any significant difference between
the LH_2 and the Nb targets. The data are compared with results of transport
calculations that predict a sensitivity of the $\omega$ line shape to in-medium
modifications near the production threshold on a free nucleon of
$E_{\gamma}^{lab}$ = 1109 MeV.}
