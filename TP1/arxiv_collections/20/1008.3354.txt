Strong electrically tunable exciton g-factors are observed in individual
(Ga)InAs self-assembled quantum dots and the microscopic origin of the effect
is explained. Realistic eight band k.p simulations quantitatively account for
our observations, simultaneously reproducing the exciton transition energy, DC
Stark shift, diamagnetic shift and g-factor tunability for model dots with the
measured size and a comparatively low In-composition of x(In)~35% near the dot
apex. We show that the observed g-factor tunability is dominated by the hole,
the electron contributing only weakly. The electric field induced perturbation
of the hole wavefunction is shown to impact upon the g-factor via orbital
angular momentum quenching, the change of the In:Ga composition inside the
envelope function playing only a minor role. Our results provide design rules
for growing self-assembled quantum dots for electrical spin manipulation via
electrical g-factor modulation.
