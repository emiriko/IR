We examine anomalous ZZH and gammaZH interactions in the process e+e- -> HZ
followed by Z -> l+l- at a linear collider. We study the effects of beam
polarization, both longitudinal and transverse, in probing these anomalous
couplings. We study various correlations constructed out of the initial and
final state lepton momenta and the spins of electron and positron. We evaluate
the sensitivity of these observables to probe anomalous couplings at the linear
collider.
