In the paper, we apply the weak gravity conjecture to the holographic
quintessence model of dark energy. Three different holographic dark energy
models are considered: without the interaction in the non-flat universe; with
interaction in the flat universe; with interaction in the non-flat universe. We
find that only in the models with the spatial curvature and interaction term
proportional to the energy density of matter, it is possible for the weak
gravity conjecture to be satisfied.
