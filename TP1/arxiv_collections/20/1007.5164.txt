We present a lattice study of net-baryon number fluctuations in (2+1)-flavor
QCD. The results are based on a Taylor expansion of the pressure with respect
to the baryon chemical potential. We calculate higher moments of the net-baryon
number fluctuations and compare with the corresponding resonance gas results.
We find that for temperature below 0.9T_c the fluctuations seem to agree with
the hadron resonance gas predictions. Close to T_c, higher moments are
increasingly more sensitive to the critical behavior of the QCD phase
transition. Furthermore, we estimate the radius of convergence of the Taylor
series as well as the curvature of the transition line in the temperature
chemical potential plane.
