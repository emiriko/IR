We fabricated a large number of single and bilayer graphene transistors and
carried out a systematic experimental study of their low-frequency noise
characteristics. A special attention was given to determining the dominant
noise sources in these devices and the effect of aging on the current-voltage
and noise characteristics. The analysis of the noise spectral density
dependence on the area of graphene channel showed that the dominant
contributions to the low-frequency electronic noise come from the graphene
layer itself rather than from the contacts. Aging of graphene transistors due
to exposure to ambient for over a month resulted in substantially increased
noise attributed to the decreasing mobility of graphene and increasing contact
resistance. The noise spectral density in both single and bilayer graphene
transistors either increased with deviation from the charge neutrality point or
depended weakly on the gate bias. This observation confirms that the
low-frequency noise characteristics of graphene transistors are qualitatively
different from those of conventional silicon metal-oxide-semiconductor
field-effect transistors.
