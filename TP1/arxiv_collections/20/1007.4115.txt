A resonating valence bond RVB approach is taken to demonstrate formation of
real-space Cooper pairs and High-TC superconductivity HTS. Non-adiabatic
coupling between holes aggregates (super-atoms) and undoped anti-ferromagnet
cause virtual excitations in either system due to inter-system coupling. HTS is
said to reflect cooperative co-existence of two Bose-Einstein condensates in
terms of one real-space Cooper pair condensate, and a second magnon condensate,
which form at the same critical temperature. TC is formulated in terms of the
super-exchange interaction. Connection is made to an equivalent real-space BCS
formulation of HTS. Novel perspectives on the HTS in the electron-doped
Sr1-xLaxCuO2 and Nd2-xCexCuO4 emerge.
