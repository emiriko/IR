The arrival directions of ultrahigh energy extensive air showers (EAS) by
Yakutsk, AGASA and P. Auger data are considered. It is found that the arrival
directions of EAS with a deficit muons by Yakutsk data are not isotropy.
Majority of these EAS form doublets which have maximum at side anticenter of
Galaxy. It is shown that some EAS by data of Yakutsk, AGASA, P.Auger correlate
with pulsars. These pulsars are situated near Input and Output Local arm Galaxy
Orion. The majority of these pulsars have a short period rotate around of their
axes. The problem of cosmic ray origin is discussed.
