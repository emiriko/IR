We report on an update of the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) ABKM09
parton distributions functions. They are obtained with the use of the combined
HERA collider Run I inclusive deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) data and the
partial NNLO corrections to the heavy quark electro-production taken into
account. The value of the strong couplig constant $\alpha^{\rm NNLO}_{\rm
s}(M_{\rm Z})=0.1147(12)$ is obtained. The standard candle cross sections for
the Tevatron collider and the LHC estimated with the updated PDFs are provided.
