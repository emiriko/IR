In this paper we propose a Lagrangian method for solving Lane-Emden equation
which is a nonlinear ordinary differential equation on semi-infinite interval.
This approach is based on a Modified generalized Laguerre functions Lagrangian
method. The method reduces the solution of this problem to the solution of a
system of algebraic equations. We also present the comparison of this work with
some well-known results and show that the present solution is acceptable.
