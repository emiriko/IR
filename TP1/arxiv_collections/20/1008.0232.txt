The production of phi mesons in the collisions of 2.83 GeV protons with C,
Cu, Ag, and Au at forward angles has been measured via the phi -> K+K- decay
using the COSY-ANKE magnetic spectrometer. The phi meson production cross
section follows a target mass dependence of A^0.56+/-0.02 in the momentum
region of 0.6-1.6 GeV/c. The comparison of the data with model calculations
suggests that the in-medium phi width is about an order of magnitude larger
than its free value.
