We solve a Langevin equation, first studied by de Gennes, in which there is a
solid-solid or dry friction force acting on a Brownian particle in addition to
the viscous friction usually considered in the study of Brownian motion. We
obtain both the time-dependent propagator of this equation and the velocity
correlation function by solving the associated time-dependent Fokker-Planck
equation. Exact results are found for the case where only dry friction acts on
the particle. For the case where both dry and viscous friction forces are
present, series representations of the propagator and correlation function are
obtained in terms of parabolic cylinder functions. Similar series
representations are also obtained for the case where an external constant force
is added to the Langevin equation.
