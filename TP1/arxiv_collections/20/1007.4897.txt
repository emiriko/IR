QCD undergoes a deconfining transition at high temperature to a "quark-gluon
plasma" phase where hadrons may become unbound. In this work, meson correlation
functions at non-zero momentum are studied both in the confined and plasma
phases using the Maximum Entropy Method. In particular, both the longitudinal
and transverse modes of the vector correlation functions are considered. Only
in the case of light quarks in the plasma phase, we find that both longitudinal
and transverse spectral functions have a non-zero intercept at zero energy.
