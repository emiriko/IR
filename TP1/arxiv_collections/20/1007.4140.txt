Non-standard physics may induce detectable flavor-changing $\Delta B=2$
interactions without inducing their flavor-conserving counterparts. Searches
for $n$-$\overline n$ oscillations do not constrain such interactions, thereby
motivating dedicated searches for $\Delta B=2$ nuclear decays into strange
final states. In particular, the simple model herein proposed enables dibaryon
decay exclusively into states with $S=2$.
