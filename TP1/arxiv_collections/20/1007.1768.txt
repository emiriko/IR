The stochastic modelling of biological systems is an informative, and in some
cases, very adequate technique, which may however result in being more
expensive than other modelling approaches, such as differential equations. We
present StochKit-FF, a parallel version of StochKit, a reference toolkit for
stochastic simulations. StochKit-FF is based on the FastFlow programming
toolkit for multicores and exploits the novel concept of selective memory. We
experiment StochKit-FF on a model of HIV infection dynamics, with the aim of
extracting information from efficiently run experiments, here in terms of
average and variance and, on a longer term, of more structured data.
