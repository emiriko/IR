The influence of delay-time between two sequential femtosecond pulses on the
properties of nanoparticles obtained via laser ablation of gold in ethanol has
been studied. The morphological and optical properties of the nanoparticles
attained were characterized using high resolution transmission electron
microscopy and UV_Vis absorption spectroscopy, respectively. Furthermore, the
size distribution of nanoparticles was determined by means of a centrifugal
sedimentation particle size analyzer. It is found that the time delay
variations lead to corresponding changes in size distribution, plasmon
resonance position as well as the rate of nanoparticles generation.
