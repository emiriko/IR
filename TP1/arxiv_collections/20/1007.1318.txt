We investigate the jet morphology and kinematics of a statistically complete
radio-loud AGN sample in terms of the gamma-ray properties of the sources.
Gamma-ray detected AGN dominate the high end of the jet apparent speed
distribution of the total sample. Gamma-variable sources show stronger
evolution in their jet morphology. A 5.1% of the sources show large (> 15
degrees) swings in their jet ejection angle.
