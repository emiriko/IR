Backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) in the sense of
Pardoux-Peng [Backward stochastic differential equations and quasilinear
parabolic partial differential equations, Lecture Notes in Control and Inform.
Sci., 176, 200--217, 1992] provide a non-Markovian extension to certain classes
of non-linear partial differential equations; the non-linearity is expressed in
the so-called driver of the BSDE. Our aim is to deal with drivers which have
very little regularity in time. To this end we establish continuity of BSDE
solutions with respect to rough path metrics in the sense of Lyons
[Differential equations driven by rough signals. Rev. Mat. Iberoamericana 14,
no. 2, 215--310, 1998] and so obtain a notion of "BSDE with rough driver".
Existence, uniqueness and a version of Lyons' limit theorem in this context are
established. Our main tool, aside from rough path analysis, is the stability
theory for quadratic BSDEs due to Kobylanski [Backward stochastic differential
equations and partial differential equations with quadratic growth. Ann.
Probab., 28(2):558--602, 2000].
