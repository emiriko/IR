It is known that the Fuchsian differential equation which produces the sixth
Painlev\'e equation corresponds to the Fuchsian differential equation with
different parameters via Euler's integral transformation, and Heun's equation
also corresponds to Heun's equation with different parameters, again via
Euler's integral transformation. In this paper we study the correspondences in
detail. After investigating correspondences with respect to monodromy, it is
demonstrated that the existence of polynomial-type solutions corresponds to
apparency (non-branching) of a singularity. For the elliptical representation
of Heun's equation, correspondence with respect to monodromy implies
isospectral symmetry. We apply the symmetry to finite-gap potentials and
express the monodromy of Heun's equation with parameters which have not yet
been studied.
