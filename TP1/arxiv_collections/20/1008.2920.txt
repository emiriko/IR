We propose an operational form for the kernel of a mapping between an
operator acting in a Hilbert space of a quantum system with SU(n) symmetry
group and its symbol in the corresponding classical phase space. For symmetric
irreps of SU(n), this mapping is bijective. We briefly discuss complications
that will occur in the general case.
