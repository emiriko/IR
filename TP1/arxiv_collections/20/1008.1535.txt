We present the first observations of the transverse component of photospheric
magnetic field acquired by the imaging magnetograph Sunrise/IMaX. Using an
automated detection method, we obtain statistical properties of 4536 features
with significant linear polarization signal. Their rate of occurrence is 1-2
orders of magnitude larger than values reported by previous studies. We show
that these features have no characteristic size or lifetime. They appear
preferentially at granule boundaries with most of them being caught in downflow
lanes at some point in their evolution. Only a small percentage are entirely
and constantly embedded in upflows (16%) or downflows (8%).
