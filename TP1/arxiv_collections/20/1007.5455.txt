A subordinate Brownian motion is a L\'evy process which can be obtained by
replacing the time of the Brownian motion by an independent subordinator. The
infinitesimal generator of a subordinate Brownian motion is $-\phi(-\Delta)$,
where $\phi$ is the Laplace exponent of the subordinator. In this paper, we
consider a large class of subordinate Brownian motions without diffusion
component and with $\phi$ comparable to a regularly varying function at
infinity. This class of processes includes symmetric stable processes,
relativistic stable processes, sums of independent symmetric stable processes,
sums of independent relativistic stable processes, and much more. We give sharp
two-sided estimates on the Green functions of these subordinate Brownian
motions in any bounded $\kappa$-fat open set $D$. When $D$ is a bounded
$C^{1,1}$ open set, we establish an explicit form of the estimates in terms of
the distance to the boundary. As a consequence of such sharp Green function
estimates, we obtain a boundary Harnack principle in $C^{1,1}$ open sets with
explicit rate of decay.
