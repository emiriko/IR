The effect of physical aging of semi-conducting polypyrrole at ambient
temperature for two years duration on the dielectric loss at various pressures
is investigated. Changes of the dielectric loss spectra and the modification of
the values of the activation volume for relaxation are interpreted through the
division of chain clusters into smaller components and the reduction of the
size of the conductive grains.
