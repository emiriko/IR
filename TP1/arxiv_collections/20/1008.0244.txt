This short review summarizes recent developments and results in connection
with point-form dynamics of relativistic quantum systems. We discuss a Poincare
invariant multichannel formalism which describes particle production and
annihilation via vertex interactions that are derived from field theoretical
interaction densities. We sketch how this rather general formalism can be used
to derive electromagnetic form factors of confined quark-antiquark systems. As
a further application it is explained how the chiral constituent quark model
leads to hadronic states that can be considered as bare hadrons dressed by
meson loops. Within this approach hadron resonances acquire a finite
(non-perturbative) decay width. We will also discuss the point-form dynamics of
quantum fields. After recalling basic facts of the free-field case we will
address some quantum field theoretical problems for which canonical
quantization on a space-time hyperboloid could be advantageous.
