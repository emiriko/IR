Almost half a century passed between the discovery of superconductivity by
Kamerlingh Onnes and the theoretical explanation of the phenomenon by Bardeen,
Cooper and Schrieffer. During the intervening years the brightest minds in
theoretical physics tried and failed to develop a microscopic understanding of
the effect. A summary of some of those unsuccessful attempts to understand
superconductivity not only demonstrates the extraordinary achievement made by
formulating the BCS theory, but also illustrates that mistakes are a natural
and healthy part of the scientific discourse, and that inapplicable, even
incorrect theories can turn out to be interesting and inspiring.
