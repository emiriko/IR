We have studied the molecular hydrogen energetics of the edge-on spiral
galaxy NGC\,891, using a 34-position map in the lowest three pure rotational
H$_2$ lines observed with the Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph. The S(0), S(1),
and S(2) lines are bright with an extinction corrected total luminosity of
$\sim2.8 \times 10^{7}$ L$_{\odot}$, or 0.09\% of the total-infrared luminosity
of NGC\,891. The H$_2$ line ratios are nearly constant along the plane of the
galaxy -- we do not observe the previously reported strong drop-off in the
S(1)/S(0) line intensity ratio in the outer regions of the galaxy, so we find
no evidence for the very massive cold CO-free molecular clouds invoked to
explain the past observations. The H$_2$ level excitation temperatures increase
monotonically indicating more than one component to the emitting gas. More than
99\% of the mass is in the lowest excitation (T$_{ex}$ $\sim$125 K) ``warm''
component. In the inner galaxy, the warm H$_2$ emitting gas is $\sim$15\% of
the CO(1-0)-traced cool molecular gas, while in the outer regions the fraction
is twice as high. This large mass of warm gas is heated by a combination of the
far-UV photons from stars in photo-dissociation regions (PDRs) and the
dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy. Including the observed far-infrared
[OI] and [CII] fine-structure line emission and far-infrared continuum emission
in a self-consistent manner to constrain the PDR models, we find essentially
all of the S(0) and most (70\%) of the S(1) line arises from low excitation
PDRs, while most (80\%) of the S(2) and the remainder of the S(1) line emission
arises from low velocity microturbulent dissipation.
