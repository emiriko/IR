Using the proof-program (Curry-Howard) correspondence, we give a new method
to obtain models of ZF and relative consistency results in set theory. We show
the relative consistency of ZF + DC + there exists a sequence of subsets of R
the cardinals of which are strictly decreasing + other similar properties of R.
These results seem not to have been previously obtained by forcing.
