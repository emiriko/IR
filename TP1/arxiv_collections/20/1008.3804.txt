We investigate a two-orbital Anderson lattice model with Ising orbital
intersite exchange interactions by means of dynamical mean field theory
combined with the static mean field approximation of the intersite orbital
interactions. Focusing on Ce-based heavy-fermion compounds, we examine the
orbital crossover between the two orbital states, when the total f-electron
number per site n_f is n_f ~ 1. We show that a "meta-orbital" transition, at
which the occupancy of the two orbitals changes steeply, occurs when the
hybridization between the ground-state f-electron orbital and conduction
electrons are smaller than that between the excited f-electron orbital and
conduction electrons. Near the meta-orbital critical end point, the orbital
fluctuations are enhanced, and couple with the charge fluctuations. A critical
theory of the meta-orbital fluctuations is also developed by applying the
self-consistent renormalization theory of itinerant electron magnetism to the
orbital fluctuations. The critical end point, first-order transition and
crossover are described within Gaussian approximations of orbital fluctuations.
We discuss the relevance of our results to CeAl2, CeCu2Si2, CeCu2Ge2 and the
related compounds, which all have low-lying crystalline-electric-field excited
states.
