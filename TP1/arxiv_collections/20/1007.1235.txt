We report the discovery of water vapour toward the carbon star V Cygni. We
have used Herschel's HIFI instrument, in dual beam switch mode, to observe the
1(11) - 0(00) para-water transition at 1113.3430 GHz in the upper sideband of
the Band 4b receiver. The observed spectral line profile is nearly parabolic,
but with a slight asymmetry associated with blueshifted absorption, and the
integrated antenna temperature is 1.69 \pm 0.17 K km/s. This detection of
thermal water vapour emission, carried out as part of a small survey of water
in carbon-rich stars, is only the second such detection toward a carbon-rich
AGB star, the first having been obtained by the Submillimeter Wave Astronomy
Satellite toward IRC+10216. For an assumed ortho-to-para ratio of 3 for water,
the observed line intensity implies a water outflow rate ~ (3 - 6) E-5 Earth
masses per year and a water abundance relative to H2 of ~ (2-5) E-6. This value
is a factor of at least 1E+4 larger than the expected photospheric abundance in
a carbon-rich environment, and - as in IRC+10216 - raises the intriguing
possibility that the observed water is produced by the vapourisation of
orbiting comets or dwarf planets. However, observations of the single line
observed to date do not permit us to place strong constraints upon the spatial
distribution or origin of the observed water, but future observations of
additional transitions will allow us to determine the inner radius of the
H2O-emitting zone, and the H2O ortho-to-para ratio, and thereby to place
important constraints upon the origin of the observed water emission.
