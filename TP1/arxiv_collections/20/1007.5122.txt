With a simple transformation of the three exponents the generalized Fermat
equation can be put into the same form as the Fermat equation. When it is
rewritten into this new altered form any real solutions to the altered equation
equal a subset of real solutions to the Fermat equation. This result, along
with a paradigm previously established by G. Frey and Y. Hellegouarch, can be
used to show that the generalized Fermat equation has no solutions in coprime
integers. In fact we prove one can derive an elliptic curve over $\mathbb{Q}$
for primes (p \geq 3), from the assumption that (x_{0}^{k} + y_{0}^{l} =
z_{0}^{m}), (k, l, m \geq 3), has coprime solutions in integers. The curve then
can be used to show the unsolvability of this equation. Our aim is not to
arrive at very deep results. Rather the goal in this paper is to apply prior
results obtained by G. Frey, K. Ribet and A. Wiles, to show the lack of
solutions to the generalized Fermat equation.
