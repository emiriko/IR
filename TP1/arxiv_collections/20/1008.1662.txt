We examine deterministic and nondeterministic state complexities of regular
operations on prefix-free languages. We strengthen several results by providing
witness languages over smaller alphabets, usually as small as possible. We next
provide the tight bounds on state complexity of symmetric difference, and
deterministic and nondeterministic state complexity of difference and cyclic
shift of prefix-free languages.
