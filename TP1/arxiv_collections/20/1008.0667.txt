From the beginning of quantum mechanics, there has been a discussion about
the concept of reality, as exemplified by the EPR paradox. To many, the idea of
the paradox and the possibility of local hidden variables was dismissed by the
Bell inequality. Yet, there remains considerable evidence that this inequality
can be violated even by classical systems, so that experiments showing quantum
behavior and the violation of the inequality must be questioned. Here, we
demonstrate that classical optical polarization experiments based upon noise in
the system can be shown to violate the Bell inequality.
