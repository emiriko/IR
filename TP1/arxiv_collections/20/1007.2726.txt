Given a tournament T=(V,A), a subset X of V is an interval of T provided that
for any a, b\in X and x\in V-X, (a,x) \in A if and only if (b,x)\in A. For
example, \emptyset, \{x\} (x\in V) and V are intervals of T, called trivial
intervals. A tournament, all the intervals of which are trivial, is
indecomposable; otherwise, it is decomposable. A vertex x of an indecomposable
tournament is critical if T-x is decomposable. In 1993, J.H. Schmerl and W.T.
Trotter characterized the tournaments, all the vertices of which are critical,
called critical tournaments. The cardinality of these tournaments is odd. Given
an odd integer m \geq 5, there exist three critical tournaments of cardinality
. and there are exactly three critical tournaments for each such a cardinality.
In this article, we characterize the tournaments which admit a single non
critical vertex, that we call (-1)-critical tournaments. The cardinality of
these tournaments is odd. Given an odd integer m \geq 7, there exist 3m-15
(-1)-critical tournaments of cardinality m.
