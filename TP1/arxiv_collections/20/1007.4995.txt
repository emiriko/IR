In this paper, we study the quantum corrections to the thermodynamical
quantities (temperature and entropy) for a Bardeen charged regular black hole
by using a quantum tunneling approach over semiclassical approximations. Taking
into account the quantum effects, the semiclassical Bekenstein-Hawking
temperature and the area law are obtained, which are then used in the first law
of thermodynamics to evaluate corrections to these quantities. It is
interesting to mention here that these corrections reduce to the corresponding
corrections for the Schwarzschild black hole when the charge $e=0$.
