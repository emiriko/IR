The conductivity and permittivity optical spectra of iron-pnictide
Ba(Fe0.9Co0.1)2As2 film (Tc=20 K) are analyzed. In the superconducting state,
at all temperatures up to Tc the temperature dependences of the magnetic field
penetration depth and of the superconducting condensate density are well
described within the generalized two-band BCS model with intraband and
interband pairing interactions considered. It is shown that the smaller
superconducting energy gap 2{\Delta} = 3.7 meV develops in the electronic
subsystem while the larger gap 2{\Delta} >= 7 meV opens in the hole subsystem.
The normal state parameters (plasma frequencies and scattering rates) of
electron and hole conduction bands are determined. At all temperatures the
obtained data are consistent with the results of electronic photoemission
experiments on Ba(Fe1-x Cox)2As2.
