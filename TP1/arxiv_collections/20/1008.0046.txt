We measure frequency- and dissipation-quadrature noise in superconducting
lithographed microwave resonators with sensitivity near the vacuum noise level
using a Josephson parametric amplifier. At an excitation power of 100~nW, these
resonators show significant frequency noise caused by two-level systems. No
excess dissipation-quadrature noise (above the vacuum noise) is observed to our
measurement sensitivity. These measurements demonstrate that the excess
dissipation-quadrature noise is negligible compared to vacuum fluctuations, at
typical readout powers used in micro-resonator applications. Our results have
important implications for resonant readout of various devices such as
detectors, qubits and nano-mechanical oscillators.
