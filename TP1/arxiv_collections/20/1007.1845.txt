Transparent SrO-0.5Li2O-4.5B2O3 (SLBO) and BaO-0.5Na2O-4.5B2O3 (BNBO) glasses
were fabricated via the conventional melt-quenching technique. The amorphous
and glassy characteristics of the as-quenched samples were respectively
confirmed by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and Differential Thermal Analysis
(DTA) studies. Optically clear SLBO and BNBO glass nano/microcrystal composites
were obtained by heat-treating the as-quenched glasses slightly above their
respective glass transition temperatures. These glass nano/microcrystal
composites exhibited second harmonic signals in transmission mode when exposed
to infrared laser beam at \lambda =1064 nm. Interestingly second-harmonic waves
were found to undergo optical diffraction and was attributed to the presence of
self-organized microcrystalline patterns associated with 0.5-2\mu m
periodicities.
