I present the latest calculations of total and differential cross sections
for top-antitop pair production and single top quark production via all main
partonic channels. Higher-order corrections from the resummation of soft gluons
are added through NNLL accuracy. Detailed numerical results are presented for
approximate NNLO cross sections and top quark transverse momentum distributions
at the Tevatron and LHC colliders.
