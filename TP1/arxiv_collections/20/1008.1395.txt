Black Hole Nonformation was suggested in 2006 by Vachaspati, Stojkovic and
Krauss as a sensible solution to the paradox of information, as deduced from
calculations in the semiclassical theory of Gravitation. Our own results in the
context of classical General Relativity (with the addition of several
thermodynamic argumentations) led us to an equivalent statement: collapsing
bodies emit their complete amount of mass and energy as radiation before the
formation of any event horizon. In this paper, we submit the metric we rendered
to the test of Einstein Field Equations, and we propose some modifications to
extend our solutions to more general situations, as the initial moments of
collapse and electrically charged collapses, as well as we effectuate some
considerations about rotating collapses.
