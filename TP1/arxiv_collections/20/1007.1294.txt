We study the dynamics of two lower bounds of concurrence in bipartite quantum
systems when one party goes through an arbitrary channel. We show that these
lower bounds obey the factorization law similar to that of [Konrad et al., Nat.
Phys. 4, 99 (2008)]. We also, discuss the application of this property, in an
example.
