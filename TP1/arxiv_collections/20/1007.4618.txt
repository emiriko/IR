We consider the Wigner function evolution of Fock states $|n\rangle$ linearly
coupled to a Markovian bath of oscillators. In the absence of environmental
coupling, apparent ``quantumness'' increases with $n$, but the presence of any
environmental interaction causes high-$n$ states to lose their quantum features
more rapidly than low-$n$ states. Using the negative volume of the Wigner
function as a metric \cite{kenfack04}, we observe a time-dependent quantumness
peak across the eigenstates.
