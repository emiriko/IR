We use classical results from the theory of linear preserver problems to
characterize operators that send the set of pure states with Schmidt rank no
greater than k back into itself, extending known results characterizing
operators that send separable pure states to separable pure states. We also
provide a new proof of an analogous statement in the multipartite setting. We
use these results to develop a bipartite version of a classical result about
the structure of maps that preserve rank-1 operators and then characterize the
isometries for two families of norms that have recently been studied in quantum
information theory. We see in particular that for k at least 2 the operator
norms induced by states with Schmidt rank k are invariant only under local
unitaries, the swap operator and the transpose map. However, in the k = 1 case
there is an additional isometry: the partial transpose map.
