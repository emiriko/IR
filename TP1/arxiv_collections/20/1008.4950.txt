A uniaxial chiral metamaterial is constructed by double-layered four "U"
split ring resonators mutually twisted by 90 degrees. It shows a giant optical
activity and circular dichroism. The retrieval results reveal that a negative
refractive index is realized for circularly polarized waves due to the large
chirality. The experimental results are in good agreement with the numerical
results.
