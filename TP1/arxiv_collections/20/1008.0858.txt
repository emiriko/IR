We have observed Centaurus A with the MID-infrared Interferometric instrument
(MIDI) at the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) at resolutions of 7 -
15 mas (at 12.5 micron) and filled gaps in the (u,v) coverage in comparison to
earlier measurements. We are now able to describe the nuclear emission in terms
of geometric components and derive their parameters by fitting models to the
interferometric data. With simple geometrical models, the best fit is achieved
for an elongated disk with flat intensity profile with diameter 76 +/- 9 mas x
35 +/- 2 mas (1.41 +/- 0.17 pc x 0.65 +/- 0.03 pc) whose major axis is oriented
at a position angle (PA) of 10.1 +/- 2.2 degrees east of north. A point source
contributes 47 +/- 11 % of the nuclear emission at 12.5 micron. There is also
evidence that neither such a uniform nor a Gaussian disk are good fits to the
data. This indicates that we are resolving more complicated small-scale
structure in AGNs with MIDI, as has been seen in Seyfert galaxies previously
observed with MIDI. The PA and inferred inclination i = 62.6 +2.1/-2.6 degrees
of the dust emission are compared with observations of gas and dust at larger
scales.
