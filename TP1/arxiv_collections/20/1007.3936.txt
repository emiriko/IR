We present an HI 21 cm absorption survey with the Green Bank Telescope (GBT)
of galaxy-quasar pairs selected by combining data from the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey (SDSS) and the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-Centimeters
(FIRST) survey. Our sample consists of 23 sightlines through 15 low-redshift
foreground galaxy - background quasar pairs with impact parameters ranging from
1.7 kpc up to 86.7 kpc. We detected one absorber in the GBT survey from the
foreground dwarf galaxy, GQ1042+0747, at an impact parameter of 1.7 kpc and
another possible absorber in our follow-up Very Large Array (VLA) imaging of
the nearby foreground galaxy, UGC 7408. Both of the absorbers are narrow (FWHM
of 3.6 and 4.8 km/s), have sub Damped Lyman alpha column densities, and most
likely originate in the disk gas of the foreground galaxies. We also detected H
I emission from three foreground galaxies, including UGC 7408. Although our
sample contains both blue and red galaxies, the two H I absorbers as well as
the H I emissions are associated with blue galaxies. We discuss the physical
conditions in the 21 cm absorbers and some drawbacks of the large GBT beam for
this type of survey.
