Topological insulators [1-6] is a new quantum phase of matter with exotic
properties such as dissipationless transport and protection against Anderson
localization [7]. These new states of quantum matter could be one of the
missing links for the realization of quantum computing [8,9] and will probably
result in new spintronic or magnetoelectric devices. Moreover, topological
insulators will be a strong competitor with graphene in electronic application.
Because of these potential application the topological insulator research has
literally exploded during the last year. Motivated by the fact that up-to-date
only few 3D systems are identified to belong to this new quantum phase [10-18]
we have used massive computing in combination with data-mining to search for
new strong topological insulators. In this letter we present a number of
non-layered compounds that show band inversion at the $\Gamma$-point, a clear
signal of a strong topological insulator.
