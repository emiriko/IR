A lot of image registration techniques have been developed with great
significance for data analysis in medicine, astrophotography, satellite imaging
and few other areas. This work proposes a method for medical image registration
using Fast Walsh Hadamard transform. This algorithm registers images of the
same or different modalities. Each image bit is lengthened in terms of Fast
Walsh Hadamard basis functions. Each basis function is a notion of determining
various aspects of local structure, e.g., horizontal edge, corner, etc. These
coefficients are normalized and used as numerals in a chosen number system
which allows one to form a unique number for each type of local structure. The
experimental results show that Fast Walsh Hadamard transform accomplished
better results than the conventional Walsh transform in the time domain. Also
Fast Walsh Hadamard transform is more reliable in medical image registration
consuming less time.
