The Fermi observatory is advancing our knowledge of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs)
through pioneering observations at high energies, covering more than 7 decades
in energy with the two on-board detectors, the Large Area Telescope (LAT) and
the Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM). Here we report on the observation of the
long GRB 090217A which triggered the GBM and has been detected by the LAT with
a significance greater than 9 sigma. We present the GBM and LAT observations
and on-ground analyses, including the time-resolved spectra and the study of
the temporal profile from 8 keV up to 1 GeV. All spectra are well reproduced by
a Band model. We compare these observations to the first two LAT-detected, long
bursts GRB 080825C and GRB 080916C. These bursts were found to have
time-dependent spectra and exhibited a delayed onset of the high-energy
emission, which are not observed in the case of GRB 090217A. We discuss some
theoretical implications for the high-energy emission of GRBs.
