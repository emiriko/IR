The Chen series map giving the universal monodromy representation of
$\mathbb{P}^1\backslash\{0,1,\infty\}$ is extended to an injective 1-cocycle of
$PSL(2, \mathbb{Z})$ into power series with complex coefficients in two
non-commuting variables, twisted by an action of $S_3.$ The definition of the
1-cocycle is effected by parallel transport of flat sections of the bundle,
also with an $S_3$ twisting, along paths in
$\mathbb{P}^1\backslash\{0,1,\infty\}$ which are explicitly associated to
elements of $PSL(2, \mathbb{Z})$. The resulting action of the modular group on
the polylogarithm generating function is shown to yield a family of proofs of
the analytic continuation and functional equation of the Riemann zeta function.
