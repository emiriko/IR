As a result of the application of coarse-graining procedures to describe
complex fluids, the study of systems consisting of particles interacting
through bounded, repulsive pair potentials has become of increasing interest in
the last years. A well known example is the so-called Generalized Exponential
Model (GEM-$m$), for which the interaction between particles is described by
the potential $v(r)=\epsilon\exp[-(r/\sigma)^m]$. Interactions with $m > 2$
lead to the formation of a novel phase of soft matter consisting of cluster
crystals. Recent studies on the phase behavior of binary mixtures of GEM-$m$
particles have provided evidence for the formation of novel kinds of alloys,
depending on the cross interactions between the two species. This work aims to
study the dynamic behavior of such binary mixtures by means of extensive
molecular dynamics simulations, and in particular to investigate the effect of
the addition of non-clustering particles on the dynamic scenario of
one-component cluster crystals. Analogies and differences with the
one-component case are revealed and discussed by analyzing self- and collective
dynamic correlators.
