Using a newly developed quantum Monte Carlo technique, we provide strong
evidence for the stability of a saturated ferromagnetic phase in the
high-density regime of the two-dimensional infinite-U Hubbard model. By
decreasing the electron density, a discontinuous transition to a paramagnetic
phase is observed, accompanied by a divergence of the susceptibility on the
paramagnetic side. This behavior, resulting from a high degeneracy among
different spin sectors, is consistent with an infinite-order phase transition.
The remarkable stability of itinerant ferromagnetism renews the hope to
describe this phenomenon within a purely kinetic mechanism and will facilitate
the validation of experimental quantum simulators with cold atoms loaded in
optical lattices.
