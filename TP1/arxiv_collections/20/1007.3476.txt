New techniques in cross-layer wireless networks are building demand for
ubiquitous channel sounding, that is, the capability to measure channel impulse
response (CIR) with any standard wireless network and node. Towards that goal,
we present a software-defined IEEE 802.11b receiver and CIR estimation system
with little additional computational complexity compared to 802.11b reception
alone. The system implementation, using the universal software radio peripheral
(USRP) and GNU Radio, is described and compared to previous work. By overcoming
computational limitations and performing direct-sequence spread-spectrum
(DS-SS) matched filtering on the USRP, we enable high-quality yet inexpensive
CIR estimation. We validate the channel sounder and present a drive test
campaign which measures hundreds of channels between WiFi access points and an
in-vehicle receiver in urban and suburban areas.
