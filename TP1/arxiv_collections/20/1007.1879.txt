We consider a two-component-liquid model, a la Landau, for the quark-gluon
plasma. Qualitatively, the model fits well some crucial observations concerning
the plasma properties. Dynamically, the model assumes the existence of an
effective scalar field which is condensed. The existence of such a condensate
is supported by lattice data. We indicate a possible crucial test of the model
by lattice simulations.
