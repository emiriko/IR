In this paper we present an integro-differential diffusion equation for
continuous time random walk that is valid for a generic waiting time
probability density function. Using this equation we also study diffusion
behaviors for a couple of specific waiting time probability density functions
such as exponential, and a combination of power law and generalized
Mittag-Leffler function. We show that for the case of the exponential waiting
time probability density function a normal diffusion is generated and the
probability density function is Gaussian distribution. In the case of the
combination of a power-law and generalized Mittag-Leffler waiting probability
density function we obtain the subdiffusive behavior for all the time regions
from small to large times, and probability density function is non-Gaussian
distribution.
