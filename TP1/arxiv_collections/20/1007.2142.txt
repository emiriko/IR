Nanocomposite films of Zinc Oxide and Silicon were grown by thermal
evaporation technique using varying ratios of ZnO:Si in the starting material.
Analysis reveal the role of ZnO and amorphous silicon interface in contributing
to relatively less common blue photoluminescence emissions (at $\sim$ 400 and
470nm). These blue peaks are observed along with the emissions resulting from
band edge transition (370nm) and those related to defects (522nm) of ZnO.
Careful analysis shows that along with the grain size of ZnO, a suitable
compositional ratio (of ZnO to silicon) is critical for the coexistence of all
the four peaks. Proper selection of conditions can give comparable
photoluminescence peak intensities leading to broad-band emission.
