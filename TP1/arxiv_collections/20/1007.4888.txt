The hierarchies of both Lovelock gravity and power-Yang-Mills field are
combined through gravity in a single theory. In static, spherically symmetric
ansatz exact particular integrals are obtained in all higher dimensions. The
advantage of such hierarchies is the possibility of choosing coefficients,
which are arbitrary otherwise, to cast solutions into tractable forms. To our
knowledge the solutions constitute the most general spherically symmetric
metrics that incorporate complexities both of Lovelock and Yang-Mills
hierarchies within the common context. A large portion of our general class of
solutions concern and addresses to black holes for which specific examples are
given. Thermodynamical behaviors of the system is briefly discussed in
particular dimensions.
