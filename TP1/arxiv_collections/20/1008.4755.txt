We present a systematic theoretical study of spin-dependent recombination and
its effect on optical orientation of photoelectron spins in semiconductors with
deep paramagnetic centers. For this aim we generalize the Shockley-Read theory
of recombination of electrons and holes through the deep centers with allowance
for optically-induced spin polarization of free and bound electrons. Starting
from consideration of defects with three charge states we turn to the
two-charge-state model possessing nine parameters and show that it is
compatible with available experimental data on undoped GaAsN alloys. In the
weak- and strong-pumping limits, we derive simple analytic equations which are
useful in prediction and interpretation of experimental results. Experimental
and theoretical dependencies of the spin-dependent-recombination ratio and
degree of photoluminescence circular polarization on the pumping intensity and
the transverse magnetic field are compared and discussed.
