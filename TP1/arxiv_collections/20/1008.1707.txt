A new Monte Carlo code for the simulation of the channeling of
ultrarelativistic charged projectiles in single crystals is presented. A
detailed description of the underlying physical model and the computation
algorithm is given. First results obtained with the code for the channeling of
855 MeV electrons in Silicon crystal are presented. The dechanneling lengths
for (100), (110) and (111) crystallographic planes are estimated. In order to
verify the code, the dependence of the intensity of the channeling radiation on
the crystal dimension along the beam direction is calculated. A good agreement
of the obtained results with recent experimental data is observed.
