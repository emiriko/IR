Context. The first magnetic fields in O- and B-type stars that do not belong
to the Bp-star class, have been discovered. The cyclic UV wind-line
variability, which has been observed in a significant fraction of early-type
stars, is likely to be related to such magnetic fields. Aims. We attempt to
improve our understanding of massive-star magnetic fields, and observe
twenty-five carefully-selected, OB-type stars. Methods. Of these stars we
obtain 136 magnetic field strength measurements. We present the UV wind-line
variability of all selected targets and summarise spectropolarimetric
observations acquired using the MUSICOS spectropolarimeter, mounted at the TBL,
Pic du Midi, between December 1998 and November 2004. From the average Stokes I
and V line profiles, derived using the LSD method, we measure the magnetic
field strengths, radial velocities, and first moment of the line profiles.
Results. No significant magnetic field is detected in any OB-type star that we
observed. Typical 1{\sigma} errors are between 15 and 200 G. A possible
magnetic-field detection for the O9V star 10 Lac remains uncertain, because the
field measurements depend critically on the fringe- effect correction in the
Stokes V spectra. We find excess emission in UV-wind lines, centred about the
rest wavelength, to be a new indirect indicator of the presence of a magnetic
field in early B-type stars. The most promising candidates to host magnetic
fields are the B-type stars {\delta} Cet and 6 Cep, and a number of O stars.
Conclusions. Although some O and B stars have strong dipolar field, which cause
periodic variability in the UV wind-lines, such strong fields are not
widespread. If the variability observed in the UV wind-lines of OB stars is
generally caused by surface magnetic fields, these fields are either weak
(<~few hundred G) or localised.
