We improve the steady-state ab initio laser theory (SALT) of Tureci et al. by
expressing its fundamental self-consistent equation in a basis set of threshold
constant flux states that contains the exact threshold lasing mode. For
cavities with non-uniform index and/or non-uniform gain, the new basis set
allows the steady-state lasing properties to be computed with much greater
efficiency. This formulation of the SALT can be solved in the single-pole
approximation, which gives the intensities and thresholds, including the
effects of nonlinear hole-burning interactions to all orders, with negligible
computational effort. The approximation yields a number of analytic
predictions, including a "gain-clamping" transition at which strong modal
interactions suppress all higher modes. We show that the single-pole
approximation agrees well with exact SALT calculations, particularly for high-Q
cavities. Within this range of validity, it provides an extraordinarily
efficient technique for modeling realistic and complex lasers.
