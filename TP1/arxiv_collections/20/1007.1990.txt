We extract the light-cone wavefunctions of the rho meson using the HERA data
on diffractive rho photoproduction. We find good agreement with predictions for
the distribution amplitude based on QCD sum rules and from the lattice. We also
find that the data prefer a transverse wavefunction with enhanced end-point
contributions.
