To generalize some fundamental results on group schemes to the super context,
we study the quotient sheaf $G \tilde{/} H$ of an algebraic supergroup $G$ by
its closed supersubgroup $H$, in arbitrary characteristic $\neq$ 2. Our main
theorem states that $G \tilde{/} H$ is a Noetherian superscheme. This together
with derived results give positive answers to interesting questions posed by J.
Brundan.
