The present study deals with dissipative future universe without big rip in
context of Eckart formalism. The generalized chaplygin gas, characterized by
equation of state $p=-\frac{A}{\rho^\frac{1}{\alpha}}$, has been considered as
a model for dark energy due to its dark-energy-like evolution at late time. It
is demonstrated that, if the cosmic dark energy behaves like a fluid with
equation of state $p=\omega\rho$; $\omega < -1$, as well as chaplygin gas
simultaneously then the big rip problem does not arises and the scale factor is
found to be regular for all time.
