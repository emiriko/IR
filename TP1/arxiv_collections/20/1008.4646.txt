The data collected by ATIC, PPB-BETS, FERMI-LAT and HESS all indicate that
there is an electron/positron excess in the cosmic ray energy spectrum above
$\sim$ 100 GeV, although different instrumental teams do not agree on the
detailed spectral shape. PAMELA also reported a clear excess feature of the
positron fraction above several GeV, but no excess in anti-protons. Here we
review the observational status and theoretical models of this interesting
observational feature. We pay special attention to various physical
interpretations proposed in the literature, including modified supernova
remnant models for the $e^\pm$ background, new astrophysical sources, and new
physics (the dark matter models). We suggest that although most models can make
a case to interpret the data, with the current observational constraints the
dark matter interpretations, especially those invoking annihilation, require
much more exotic assumptions than some astrophysical interpretations. Future
observations may present some ``smoking-gun'' observational tests to
differentiate among different models and to identify the correct interpretation
to the phenomenon.
