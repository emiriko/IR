We have measured the magnetic properties of a mixed valency iron phosphate.
It presents an original structure with crossed chains containing Fe II and
orthogonal to the longest direction of the crystallites. Microstructural
investigations using electron microscopy show the presence of random
nano-twinning. The ac susceptibility measurements demonstrate similarities with
the kinetics of a disordered magnetic, spin-glass like, state but are shown to
be essentially due to this peculiar disorder. Scaling properties are
characteristics of 3D second order transition implying that this disorder at a
small scale does not influence significantly long range magnetic ordering. At
low temperature, a decrease of the spontaneous magnetization and an
irreversible metamagnetic transition is observed, and is attributed to a
canting of the spins in the iron chain.
