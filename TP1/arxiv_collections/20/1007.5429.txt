We establish global Gaussian estimates for the Green's matrix of divergence
form, second order parabolic systems in a cylindrical domain under the
assumption that weak solutions of the system vanishing on a portion of the
boundary satisfy a certain local boundedness estimate and a local H\"older
estimate. From these estimates, we also derive global estimates for the Green's
matrix for elliptic systems with bounded measurable coefficients in two
dimensional domains. We present a unified approach valid for both the scalar
and vectorial cases and discuss several applications of our result.
