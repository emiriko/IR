Using simultaneous observations in X-rays and optical, we have performed a
homogeneous analysis of the cross-correlation behaviours of four X-ray
binaries: SWIFT J1753.5-0127, GX 339-4, Sco X-1, and Cyg X-2. With high
time-resolution observations using ULTRACAM and RXTE, we concentrate on the
short time-scale, dt<20 s, variability in these sources. Here we present our
database of observations, with three simultaneous energy bands in both the
optical and the X-ray, and multiple epochs of observation for each source, all
with ~second or better time resolution. For the first time, we include a
dynamical cross-correlation analysis, i.e., an investigation of how the
cross-correlation function changes within an observation. We describe a number
of trends which emerge. We include the full dataset of results, and pick a few
striking relationships from among them for further discussion. We find, that
the surprising form of X-ray/optical cross-correlation functions, a positive
correlation signal preceded by an anti-correlation signal, is seen in all the
sources at least some of the time. Such behaviour suggests a mechanism other
than reprocessing as being the dominant driver of the short-term variability in
the optical emission. This behaviour appears more pronounced when the X-ray
spectrum is hard. Furthermore, we find that the cross-correlation relationships
themselves are not stable in time, but vary significantly in strength and form.
This all hints at dynamic interactions between the emitting components which
could be modelled through non-linear or differential relationships.
