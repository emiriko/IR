We propose the lepton mixing matrix at high energy scale to be connected to
quark mixing matrix by the similar transformation. The similarity between CKM
and PMNS significantly narrows down the ranges in physical parameters. The
condition requires $\sin\theta_{13}$ not to be larger than 0.15, masses to be
of quasi-degenerate normal ordering, and $\tan\beta$ to be large.
