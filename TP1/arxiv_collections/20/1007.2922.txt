Explicit solution for the 2-point correlation function in a non-equilibrium
steady state of a nearly isotropic boundary-driven open XY spin 1/2 chain in
the Lindblad formulation is provided. A non-equilibrium quantum phase
transition from exponentially decaying correlations to long-range order is
discussed analytically. In the regime of long-range order a new phenomenon of
correlation resonances is reported, where the correlation response of the
system is unusually high for certain discrete values of the external bulk
parameter, e.g. the magnetic field.
