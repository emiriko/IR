We study the behaviour of semistability under tensor product in various
settings: vector bundles, euclidean and hermitian lattices (alias Humbert forms
or Arakelov bundles), multifiltered vector spaces.
  One approach to show that semistable vector bundles in characteristic zero
are preserved by tensor product is based on the notion of nef vector bundles.
We revisit this approach and show how far it can be transferred to hermitian
lattices. J.-B. Bost conjectured that semistable hermitian lattices are
preserved by tensor product. Using properties of nef hermitian lattices, we
establish an inequality which improves on earlier results in that direction. On
the other hand, we show that, in contrast to nef vector bundles, nef hermitian
lattices are not preserved by tensor product.
  We axiomatize our method in the general context of monoidal categories, and
give an elementary proof of the fact that semistable multifiltered vector
spaces (which play a role in diophantine approximation) are preserved by tensor
product.
