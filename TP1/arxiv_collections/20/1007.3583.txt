Second gradient theories have been developed in mechanics for treating
different phenomena as capillarity in fluids, plasticity and friction in
granular materials or shear band deformations. Here, there is an attempt of
formulating a second gradient Biot like model for porous materials. In
particular the interest is focused in describing the local dilatant behaviour
of a porous material induced by pore opening elastic and capillary interaction
phenomena among neighbouring pores and related micro-filtration phenomena by
means of a continuum microstructured model. The main idea is to extend the
classical macroscopic Biot model by including in the description second
gradient effects. This is done by assuming that the surface contribution to the
external work rate functional depends on the normal derivative of the velocity
or equivalently assuming that the strain work rate functional depends on the
porosity and strain gradients. According to classical thermodynamics suitable
restrictions for stresses and second gradient internal actions (hyperstresses)
are recovered, so as to determine a suitable extended form of the constitutive
relation and Darcy's law. Finally a numerical application of the envisaged
model to one-dimensional consolidation is developed; the obtained results
generalize those by Terzaghi; in particular interesting phenomena occurring
close to the consolidation external surface and the impermeable wall can be
described, which were not accounted for previously.
