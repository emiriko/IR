Adatoms offer an effective route to modify and engineer the properties of
graphene. In this work, we create dilute fluorinated graphene using a clean,
controlled and reversible approach. At low carrier densities, the system is
strongly localized and exhibits an unexpected, colossal negative
magnetoresistance. The zero-field resistance is reduced by a factor of 40 at
the highest field of 9 T and shows no sign of saturation. Unusual "staircase"
field dependence is observed below 5 K. The magnetoresistance is highly
anisotropic. We discuss possible origins, considering quantum interference
effects and adatom-induced magnetism in graphene.
