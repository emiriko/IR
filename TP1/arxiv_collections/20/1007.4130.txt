For systems with a mixed phase space we demonstrate that dynamical tunneling
universally leads to a fractional power law of the level-spacing distribution
P(s) over a wide range of small spacings s. Going beyond Berry-Robnik
statistics, we take into account that dynamical tunneling rates between the
regular and the chaotic region vary over many orders of magnitude. This results
in a prediction of P(s) which excellently describes the spectral data of the
standard map. Moreover, we show that the power-law exponent is proportional to
the effective Planck constant h.
