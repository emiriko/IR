We derive from Jefimenko's equations a multipole expansion in order to obtain
the exact expressions for the electric and magnetic fields of an electric
dipole with an arbitrary time dependence. A few comments are also made about
the usual expositions found in most common undergraduate and graduate textbooks
as well as in the literature on this topic.
