We propose a E_6 inspired supersymmetric model with a non-Abelian discrete
flavor symmetry; SU(3)_c x SU(2)_W x U(1)_Y x U(1)_X x S_4 x Z_2. In our
scenario, the additional abelian gauge symmetry; U(1)_X, not only solves the
mu-problem in the minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model(MSSM), but also
requires new exotic fields which play an important role in solving flavor
puzzles. If our exotic quarks can be embedded into a S_4 triplet, which
corresponds to the number of the generation, one finds that dangerous proton
decay can be well-suppressed. Hence, it might be expected that the generation
structure for lepton and quark in the SM(Standard Model) can be understood as a
new system in order to stabilize the proton in a supersymemtric standard model
(SUSY). Moreover, due to the nature of the discrete non-Abelian symmetry
itself, Yukawa coupling constants of our model are drastically reduced. In our
previous work, we actually have found much success. However, we also have to
solve Higgs mediated FCNC at tree level, as is often the case with such
extended Higgs models. In this paper, we propose a promising mechanism which
could make cancellation between Higgs and SUSY contributions.
