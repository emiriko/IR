We show how the Minkowskian space-time emerges from a topologically
homogeneous causal network, presenting a simple analytical derivation of the
Lorentz transformations, with metric as pure event-counting. The derivation
holds generally for d=1 space dimension, however, it can be extended to d>1 for
special causal networks.
