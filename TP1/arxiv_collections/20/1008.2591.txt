Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis has been instrumental in the birth and
developments of proteomics, although it is no longer the exclusive separation
tool used in the field of proteomics. In this review, a historical perspective
is made, starting from the days where two-dimensional gels were used and the
word proteomics did not even exist. The events that have led to the birth of
proteomics are also recalled, ending with a description of the now well-known
limitations of two-dimensional gels in proteomics. However, the
often-underestimated advantages of two-dimensional gels are also underlined,
leading to a description of how and when to use two-dimensional gels for the
best in a proteomics approach. Taking support of these advantages (robustness,
resolution, and ability to separate entire, intact proteins), possible future
applications of this technique in proteomics are also mentioned.
