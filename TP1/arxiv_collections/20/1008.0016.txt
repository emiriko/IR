Triggering the electroweak symmetry breaking may not be the only key role
played by the Higgs boson in particle physics. In a recently proposed warped
five-dimensional $SO(5)\otimes U(1)$ gauge-Higgs unification model the Higgs
boson can also constitute the dark matter that permeates the universe. The
stability of the Higgs boson in this model is guaranteed in all orders of
perturbation theory by the conservation of an H-parity quantum number that
forbids triple couplings to all SM particles. Recent astrophysical data
constrain the mass of such a Higgs dark matter particle to a narrow window of
70-90 GeV range. We show that the Large Hadron Collider can observe these Higgs
bosons in the weak boson fusion channel with about 240$\fb^{-1}$ of integrated
luminosity in that mass range.
