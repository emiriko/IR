A brief survey of the zeta function regularization and multiplicative anomaly
issues when the associated zeta function of fluctuation operator is the regular
at the origin (regular case) as well as when it is singular at the origin
(singular case) is presented. In the singular case, new results for the
multiplicative anomaly are presented
