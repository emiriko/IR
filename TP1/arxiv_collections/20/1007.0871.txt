We propose a new motivation for the stability of dark matter (DM). We suggest
that the same non-abelian discrete flavor symmetry which accounts for the
observed pattern of neutrino oscillations, spontaneously breaks to a Z2
subgroup which renders DM stable. The simplest scheme leads to a scalar doublet
DM potentially detectable in nuclear recoil experiments, inverse neutrino mass
hierarchy, hence a neutrinoless double beta decay rate accessible to upcoming
searches, while reactor angle equal to zero gives no CP violation in neutrino
oscillations.
