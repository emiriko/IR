Recent results from the Pierre Auger Observatory show energy dependent
chemical composition of ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays (UHECR) with a growing
fraction of heavy elements at high energies. This points to a non-negligible
contribution of the Galactic sources, such as past GRBs and other rare but
powerful stellar explosions in the Milky Way. The effects of diffusion in the
Galactic magnetic fields alter the observed composition and render the flux of
UHECR isotropic, up to a few per cent anisotropy in the direction of the
Galactic Center, as well as some small-scale anisotropy with "hot spots" due to
the locations of the most recent/closest bursts.
