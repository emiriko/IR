We report a combination of physical property and neutron scattering
measurements for polycrystalline samples of the one-dimensional spin chain
compound CoV2O6. Heat capacity measurements show that an effective S = 1/2
state is found at low temperatures and that magnetic fluctuations persist up to
6.Tn. Above Tn = 6.3 K, measurements of the magnetic susceptibility as a
function of T and H show that the nearest neighbour exchange is ferromagnetic.
In the ordered state, we have discovered a crossover from a metamagnet with
strong fluctuations between 5 K and Tn to a state with a 1/3 magnetisation
plateau at 2 < T < 5 K. We use neutron powder diffraction measurements to show
that the AFM state has incommensurate long range order and inelastic time of
flight neutron scattering to examine the magnetic fluctuations as a function of
temperature. Above Tn, we find two broad bands between 3.5 and 5 meV and
thermally activated low energy features which correspond to transitions within
these bands. These features show that the excitations are deconfined solitons
rather than the static spin reversals predicted for a uniform FM Ising spin
chain. Below Tn, we find a ladder of states due to the confining effect of the
internal field. A region of weak confinement below Tn, but above 5 K, is
identified which may correspond to a crossover between 2D and 3D magnetic
ordering.
