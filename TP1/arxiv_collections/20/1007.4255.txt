We experimentally demonstrate coherence recovery of singlet-triplet
superpositions by interlacing qubit rotations between Carr-Purcell (CP) echo
sequences. We then compare performance of Hahn, CP, concatenated dynamical
decoupling (CDD) and Uhrig dynamical decoupling (UDD) for singlet recovery. In
the present case, where gate noise and drift combined with spatially varying
hyperfine coupling contribute significantly to dephasing, and pulses have
limited bandwidth, CP and CDD yield comparable results, with T2 ~ 80
microseconds.
