We analyze the deformation and energetics of a thin elastic cylindrical tube
compressed between two plates which are parallel to the tube axis. The
deformation is studied theoretically using exact numerical simulations and the
variational approach. These results are used to interpret the experimental data
obtained by pressing plastic-foil tubes in an apparatus specially designed for
this purpose.
  A simplified variant of the physics that we present was used as a basis for
one of the experimental problems posed on the 41st International Physics
Olympiad held in Zagreb, Croatia in July 2010.
