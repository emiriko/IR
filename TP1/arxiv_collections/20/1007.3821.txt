By quantum Monte Carlo simulation of a realistic multiorbital Anderson
impurity model, we study the spin-orbit interaction (SOI) of an Fe impurity in
Au host metal. We show, for the first time, that the SOI is strongly
renormalized by the quantum spin fluctuation. Based on this mechanism, we can
explain why the gigantic spin Hall effect in Au with Fe impurities was observed
in recent experiment, while it is not visible in the anomalous Hall effect. In
addition, we show that the SOI is strongly renormalized by the Coulomb
correlation U. Based on this picture, we can explain past discrepancies in the
calculated orbital angular momenta for an Fe impurity in an Au host.
