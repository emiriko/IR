The D{\O} and CDF experiments have each collected more than 8 fb-in Run II of
Fermilab's Tevatron, and have many recent search results which use up to 5.2
fb-1 . Here I summarize the results of a variety of searches for physics beyond
the Standard Model with an emphasis on searches for very exotic phenomena. I
will present the status of model-inspired searches for several signatures of
supersymmetry, as well as several other searches for several "hidden- valley"
inspired models, all of which contain photons and jets in the final state.
