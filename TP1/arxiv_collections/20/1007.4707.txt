With this paper, we contribute to the understanding of ant colony
optimization (ACO) algorithms by formally analyzing their runtime behavior. We
study simple MAX-MIN ant systems on the class of linear pseudo-Boolean
functions defined on binary strings of length 'n'. Our investigations point out
how the progress according to function values is stored in pheromone. We
provide a general upper bound of O((n^3 \log n)/ \rho) for two ACO variants on
all linear functions, where (\rho) determines the pheromone update strength.
Furthermore, we show improved bounds for two well-known linear pseudo-Boolean
functions called OneMax and BinVal and give additional insights using an
experimental study.
