We analyze the Drell-Yan lepton pair production at forward rapidity at the
Large Hadron Collider. Using the dipole framework for the computation of the
cross section we find a significant suppression in comparison to the collinear
factorization formula due to saturation effects in the dipole cross section. We
develop a twist expansion in powers of Q_s^2/M^2 where Q_s is the saturation
scale and M the invariant mass of the produced lepton pair. For the nominal LHC
energy the leading twist description is sufficient down to masses of 6 GeV.
Below that value the higher twist terms give a significant contribution.
