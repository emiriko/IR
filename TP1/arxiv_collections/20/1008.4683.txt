Recently, new quantum features have been observed and studied in the area of
nanostructured layers. Nanograting on the surface of the thin layer imposes
additional boundary conditions on the electron wave function and induces
G-doping or geometry doping. G-doping is equivalent to donor doping from the
point of view of the increase in electron concentration n. However, there are
no ionized impurities. This preserves charge carrier scattering to the
intrinsic semiconductor level and increases carrier mobility with respect to
the donor-doped layer. G-doping involves electron confinement to the
nanograting layer. Here, we investigate the system of multiple nanograting
layers forming a series of hetero- or homojunctions. The system includes main
and barrier layers. In the case of heterojunctions, both types of layers were
G-doped. In the case of homojunctions, main layers were G-doped and barrier
layers were donor-doped. In such systems, the dependence of n on layer geometry
and material parameters was analysed. Si and GaAs homojunctions and
GaAs/AlGaAs, Si/SiGe, GaInP/AlGAs, and InP/InAlAs heterojunctions were studied.
G-doping levels of 10^18-10^19 cm^-3 were obtained in homojunctions and type II
heterojunctions. High G-doping levels were attained only when the difference
between band gap values was low.
