Super-spreading events for infectious diseases occur when some infected
individuals infect more than the average number of secondary cases. Several
super-spreading individuals have been identified for the 2003 outbreak of
severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). We develop a model for
super-spreading events of infectious diseases, which is based on the outbreak
of SARS. Using this model we describe two methods for estimating the parameters
of the model, which we demonstrate with the small-scale SARS outbreak at the
Amoy Gardens, Hong Kong, and the large-scale outbreak in the entire Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region. One method is based on parameters calculated for
the classical susceptible - infected - removed (SIR) disease model. The second
is based on parameter estimates found in the literature. Using the parameters
calculated for the SIR model, our model predicts an outcome similar to that for
the SIR model. On the other hand, using parameter estimates from SARS
literature our model predicts a much more serious epidemic.
