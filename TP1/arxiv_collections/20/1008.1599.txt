We show that quantum algorithms can be used to re-prove a classical theorem
in approximation theory, Jackson's Theorem, which gives a nearly-optimal
quantitative version of Weierstrass's Theorem on uniform approximation of
continuous functions by polynomials. We provide two proofs, based respectively
on quantum counting and on quantum phase estimation.
