An integer $a$ is said to be regular (mod $r$) if there exists an integer $x$
such that $a^2x\equiv a\pmod{r}$. In this paper we introduce an analogue of
Ramanujan's sum with respect to regular integers (mod $r$) and show that this
analogue possesses properties similar to those of the usual Ramanujan's sum.
