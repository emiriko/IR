We propose an entanglement mean field theory inspired approach for dealing
with interacting classical many-body systems. It involves a coarse-graining
technique that terminates a step before the mean field theory: While mean field
theory deals with only single-body physical parameters, the entanglement mean
field theory deals with single- as well as two-body ones. We improve the theory
to a cluster entanglement mean field, that deals with a fundamental unit of the
lattice of the many-body system. We apply these methods to interacting Ising
spin systems in several lattice geometries and dimensions, and show that the
predictions of the onset of criticality of these models are much better in the
proposed theories as compared to the corresponding ones in mean field theories.
