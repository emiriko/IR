Single electron transistors (SETs) made from single wall carbon nanotubes
(SWCNTs) are promising for quantum electronic devices operating with ultra-low
power consumption and allow fundamental studies of electron transport. We
report on SETs made by registered in-plane growth utilizing tailored nanoscale
catalyst patterns and chemical vapor deposition. Metallic SWCNTs have been
removed by an electrical burn-in technique and the common gate hysteresis was
removed using PMMA and baking, leading to field effect transistors with large
on/off ratios up to 10^5. Further segmentation into 200 nm short semiconducting
SWCNT devices created quantum dots which display conductance oscillations in
the Coulomb blockade regime. The demonstrated utilization of registered
in-plane growth opens possibilities to create novel SET device geometries which
are more complex, i.e. laterally ordered and scalable, as required for advanced
quantum electronic devices.
