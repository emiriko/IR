With a terahertz time-domain spectrometer (0.3 - 3.0 THz) we have measured
the optical conductivity of the type-I clathrate Ba$_8$Ga$_{16}$Sn$_{30}$ at
temperatures from 300 K down to 7 K. Independent six spectra superimposed on
the Drude conductivity are identified to infrared active vibrational modes of
guest Ba ions and the cages. While the spectra of five higher-frequency modes
depend hardly on temperature, the lowest-lying spectrum with a peak at 0.72 THz
due to the Ba(2) ion's off-centering vibration in the oversized cage changes
with temperature characteristically. With lowering temperature, the spectral
shape of this so-called rattling phonon continues to become so broad that the
line-width amounts to be comparable to the peak frequency. Furthermore, below
about 100 K, the single broad peak tends to split into two subpeaks. While this
splitting can be explained by assuming a multi-well anharmonic potential, the
strong enhancement of the line-width broadening toward low temperature, cannot
be understood, since the Boltzmann factor generally sharpens the
low-temperature spectra.
