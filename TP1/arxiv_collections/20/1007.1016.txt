Nonlinear bilateral filters (BF) deliver a fine blend of computational
simplicity and blur-free denoising. However, little is known about their
nature, noise-suppressing properties, and optimal choices of filter parameters.
Our study is meant to fill this gap-explaining the underlying mechanism of
bilateral filtering and providing the methodology for optimal filter selection.
Practical application to CT image denoising is discussed to illustrate our
results.
