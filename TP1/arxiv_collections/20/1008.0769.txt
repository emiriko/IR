The lilypond model on a point process in $d$-space is a growth-maximal system
of non-overlapping balls centred at the points. We establish central limit
theorems for the total volume and the number of components of the lilypond
model on a sequence of Poisson or binomial point processes on expanding
windows. For the lilypond model over a homogeneous Poisson process, we give
subexponentially decaying tail bounds for the size of the cluster at the
origin. Finally, we consider the enhanced Poisson lilypond model where all the
balls are enlarged by a fixed amount (the enhancement parameter), and show that
for $d > 1 $ the critical value of this parameter, above which the enhanced
model percolates, is strictly positive.
