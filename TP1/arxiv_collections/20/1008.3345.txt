By studying the notion of a fundamentally minimal length scale in
asymptotically safe gravity we find that a specific version of deformed special
relativity (DSR) naturally arises in this approach. We then consider two
thought experiments to examine the interpretation of the scenario and discuss
similarities and differences to other approaches to DSR.
