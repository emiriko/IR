We study the local-in-time regularity of the Brownian motion with respect to
localized variants of modulation spaces M^{p, q}_s and Wiener amalgam spaces
W^{p, q}_s. We show that the periodic Brownian motion belongs locally in time
to M^{p, q}_s (T) and W^{p, q}_s (T) for (s-1)q < -1, and the condition on the
indices is optimal. Moreover, with the Wiener measure \mu on T, we show that
(M^{p, q}_s (T), \mu) and (W^{p, q}_s (T), \mu) form abstract Wiener spaces for
the same range of indices, yielding large deviation estimates. We also
establish the endpoint regularity of the periodic Brownian motion with respect
to a Besov-type space \ft{b}^s_{p, \infty} (T). Specifically, we prove that the
Brownian motion belongs to \ft{b}^s_{p, \infty} (T) for (s-1) p = -1, and it
obeys a large deviation estimate. Finally, we revisit the regularity of
Brownian motion on usual local Besov spaces B_{p, q}^s, and indicate the
endpoint large deviation estimates.
