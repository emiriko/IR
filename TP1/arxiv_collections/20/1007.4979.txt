The properties of the $\bar K^*$ meson in dense matter are studied using a
unitary approach in coupled channels within the framework of the local hidden
gauge formalism. We obtain the $\bar K^*$ spectral function in the nuclear
medium and we found that the $\bar K^*$ develops an in-medium width up to five
times bigger than in free space. We also estimate the transparency ratio of the
$\gamma A \to K^+ K^{*-} A^\prime$ reaction, which we propose as a feasible
experimental scenario to detect in-medium modifications of the $\bar K^*$
meson.
