For the spin models with continuous symmetry on regular lattices and finite
range of interactions the lower critical dimension is d=2. In two dimensions
the classical XY-model displays Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition
associated with unbinding of topological defects (vortices and antivortices).
We perform a Monte Carlo study of the classical XY-model on Sierpinski pyramids
whose fractal dimension is D=log4/log2=2 and the average coordination number
per site is about 7. The specific heat does not depend on the system size which
indicates the absence of long range order. From the dependence of the helicity
modulus on the cluster size and on boundary conditions we draw a conclusion
that in the thermodynamic limit there is no Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless
transition at any finite temperature. This conclusion is also supported by our
results for linear magnetic susceptibility. The lack of finite temperature
phase transition is presumably caused by the finite order of ramification of
Sierpinski pyramid.
