Inhomogeneous magnetoelectric effect in magnetization distribution
heterogeneities (0-degree domain walls) appeared on crystal lattice defect of
the multiferroic material has been investigated. Magnetic symmetry based
predictions of kind of electrical polarization distribution in their volumes
were used. It was found that magnetization distribution heterogeneity with any
symmetry produces electrical polarization. Results were systemized in scope of
micromagnetic structure chirality. It was shown that all 0-degree domain walls
with time-noninvariant chirality have identical type of spatial distribution of
the magnetization and polarization.
