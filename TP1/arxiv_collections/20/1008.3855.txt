In this paper the celebrated arcsine aging scheme of G. Ben Arous and J.
Cern\'y is taken up. Using a brand new approach based on point processes and
weak convergence techniques, this scheme is implemented in a wide class of
Markov processes that can best be described as Glauber dynamics of discrete
disordered systems. More specifically, conditions are given for the underlying
clock process (a partial sum process that measures the total time elapsed along
paths of a given length) to converge to a subordinator, and this subordinator
is constructed explicitly. This approach is illustrated on Bouchaud's
asymmetric trap model on the complete graph for which aging is for the first
time proved, and the full, optimal picture, obtained.
