We exploit the SU(N) irreducible Schwinger boson to construct SU(N) coherent
states. This construction of SU(N) coherent state is analogous to the
construction of the simplest Heisenberg-Weyl coherent states. The coherent
states belonging to irreducible representations of SU(N) are labeled by the
eigenvalues of the $(N-1)$ SU(N) Casimir operators and are characterized by
$(N-1)$ complex orthonormal vectors describing the SU(N) group manifold.
