We utilize the extensive datasets available for the Perseus molecular cloud
to analyze the relationship between the kinematics of small-scale dense cores
and the larger structures in which they are embedded. The kinematic measures
presented here can be used in conjunction with those discussed in our previous
work as strong observational constraints that numerical simulations (or
analytic models) of star formation should match. We find that dense cores have
small motions with respect to the 13CO gas, about one third of the 13CO
velocity dispersion along the same line of sight. Within each extinction
region, the core-to-core velocity dispersion is about half of the total (13CO)
velocity dispersion seen in the region. Large-scale velocity gradients account
for roughly half of the total velocity dispersion in each region, similar to
what is predicted from large-scale turbulent modes following a power spectrum
of P(k) ~ k^{-4}.
