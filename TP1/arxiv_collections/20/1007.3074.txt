We consider the classical coupled, combined-field integral equation
formulations for time-harmonic acoustic scattering by a sound soft bounded
obstacle. In recent work, we have proved lower and upper bounds on the $L^2$
condition numbers for these formulations, and also on the norms of the
classical acoustic single- and double-layer potential operators. These bounds
to some extent make explicit the dependence of condition numbers on the wave
number $k$, the geometry of the scatterer, and the coupling parameter. For
example, with the usual choice of coupling parameter they show that, while the
condition number grows like $k^{1/3}$ as $k\to\infty$, when the scatterer is a
circle or sphere, it can grow as fast as $k^{7/5}$ for a class of `trapping'
obstacles. In this paper we prove further bounds, sharpening and extending our
previous results. In particular we show that there exist trapping obstacles for
which the condition numbers grow as fast as $\exp(\gamma k)$, for some
$\gamma>0$, as $k\to\infty$ through some sequence. This result depends on
exponential localisation bounds on Laplace eigenfunctions in an ellipse that we
prove in the appendix. We also clarify the correct choice of coupling parameter
in 2D for low $k$. In the second part of the paper we focus on the boundary
element discretisation of these operators.
  We discuss the extent to which the bounds on the continuous operators are
also satisfied by their discrete counterparts and, via numerical experiments,
we provide supporting evidence for some of the theoretical results, both
quantitative and asymptotic, indicating further which of the upper and lower
bounds may be sharper.
