In this note, we describe a theory of linked Hom spaces which complements
that of linked Grassmannians. Given two chains of vector bundles linked by maps
in both directions, we give conditions for the space of homomorphisms from one
chain to the other to be itself represented by a vector bundle. We apply this
to present a more transparent version of an earlier construction of limit
linear series spaces out of linked Grassmannians.
