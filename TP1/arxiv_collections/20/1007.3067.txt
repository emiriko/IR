We simulate SU(2) gauge theory with six massless fundamental Dirac fermions.
We measure the running of the coupling and the mass in the Schroedinger
Functional scheme. We observe very slow running of the coupling constant. We
measure the mass anomalous dimension gamma, and find it is between 0.135 and
1.03 in the range of couplings consistent with the existence of an IR fixed
point.
