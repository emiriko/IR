Following the recent approach of using order domains to construct Grobner
bases from general projective varieties, we examine the parity and
time-reversal arguments relating de Witt and Lyman's assertion that all path
weights associated with homotopy in dimensions d <= 2 form a faithful
representation of the fundamental group of a quantum system. We then show how
the most general polynomial ring obtained for a fermionic quantum system does
not, in fact, admit a faithful representation, and so give a general
prescription for calcluating Grobner bases for finite temperature many-body
quantum system and show that their complexity class is BQP.
