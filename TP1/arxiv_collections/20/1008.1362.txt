The Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) is a NASA Small Explorer
mission that will carry the first focusing hard X-ray (5 -- 80 keV) telescope
to orbit. NuSTAR will offer a factor 50 -- 100 sensitivity improvement compared
to previous collimated or coded mask imagers that have operated in this energy
band. In addition, NuSTAR provides sub-arcminute imaging with good spectral
resolution over a 12-arcminute field of view. After launch, NuSTAR will carry
out a two-year primary science mission that focuses on four key programs:
studying the evolution of massive black holes through surveys carried out in
fields with excellent multiwavelength coverage, understanding the population of
compact objects and the nature of the massive black hole in the center of the
Milky Way, constraining explosion dynamics and nucleosynthesis in supernovae,
and probing the nature of particle acceleration in relativistic jets in active
galactic nuclei. A number of additional observations will be included in the
primary mission, and a guest observer program will be proposed for an extended
mission to expand the range of scientific targets. The payload consists of two
co-aligned depth-graded multilayer coated grazing incidence optics focused onto
solid state CdZnTe pixel detectors. To be launched in early 2012 on a Pegasus
rocket into a low-inclination Earth orbit. Data will be publicly available at
GSFC's High Energy Astrophysics Science Archive Research Center (HEASARC)
following validation at the science operations center located at Caltech.
