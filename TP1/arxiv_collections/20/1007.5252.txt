Josephson junctions with iron pnictides open the way for fundamental
experiments on superconductivity in these materials and their application in
superconducting devices. Here, we present hybrid Josephson junctions with a
BaFe_{1.8}Co_{0.2}As_2 thin film electrode, an Au barrier and a PbIn counter
electrode. The junctions show RSJ-like current-voltage characteristics up to
the critical temperature of the counter electrode of about 7.2K. The
temperature dependence of the critical current, IC, does not show an
Ambegaokar-Baratoff behavior. Well-pronounced Shapiro steps are observed at
microwave frequencies of 10-18GHz. Assuming an excess current, I_ex, of 200
{\mu}A at 4.2K we get an effective I_C R_N product of 6 {\mu}V.
