The utility of an application of the analyticity in a phenomenology of
electro-weak structure of hadrons is demonstrated in a number of obtained new
and experimentally verifiable results. With this aim first the problem of an
inconsistency of the asymptotic behavior of VMD model with the asymptotic
behavior of form factors of baryons and nuclei is solved generally and a
general approach for determination of the lowest normal and anomalous
singularities of form factors from the corresponding Feynman diagrams is
reviewed. Then many useful applications by making use of the analytic
properties of electro-weak form factors and amplitudes of various
electromagnetic processes of hadrons are carried out.
