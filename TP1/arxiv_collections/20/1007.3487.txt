We report on the experimental observation of a new type of dark soliton in a
fiber laser made of all normal group velocity dispersion fibers. It was shown
that the soliton is formed due to the cross coupling between two different
wavelength laser beams and has the characteristic of separating the two
different wavelength laser emissions. Moreover, we show experimentally that the
dual-wavelength dark solitons have a much lower pump threshold than that of the
nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation dark solitons formed in the same laser.
