Let $U_n(q)$ denote the upper triangular group of degree $n$ over the finite
field $\F_q$ with $q$ elements. It is known that irreducible constituents of
supercharacters partition the set of all irreducible characters $\Irr(U_n(q)).$
In this paper we present a correspondence between supercharacters and pattern
subgroups of the form $U_k(q)\cap {}^wU_k(q)$ where $w$ is a monomial matrix in
$GL_k(q)$ for some $k<n.$
