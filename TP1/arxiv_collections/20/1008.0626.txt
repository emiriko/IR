The spectra of AGN from the ultraviolet to the near infrared, exhibit
emission lines covering a wide range of ionisation states, from neutral species
such as [O I] 6300A, up to [Fe XIV] 5303A. Here we report on some recent
studies of the properties of highly ionised lines (HILs), plus two case studies
of individual objects. Future IFU observations at high spatial and good
spectral resolution, will probe the excitation and kinematics of the gas in the
zone between the extended NLR and unresolved BLR. Multi-component SED fitting
can be used to link the source of photoionisation with the strengths and ratios
of the HILs.
