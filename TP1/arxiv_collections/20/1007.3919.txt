In this article I study H\"older regularity for solutions of a transport
equation based in the dissipative quasi-geostrophic equation. Following a
recent idea of A. Kiselev and F. Nazarov, I will use the molecular
characterization of local Hardy spaces in order to obtain information on
H\"older regularity of such solutions. This will be done by following the
evolution of molecules in a backward equation.
