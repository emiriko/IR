Using lubrication theory, drying processes of sessile colloidal droplets on a
solid substrate are studied. A simple model is proposed to describe temporal
dynamics both the shape of the drop and the volume fraction of the colloidal
particles inside the drop. The concentration dependence of the viscosity is
taken into account. It is shown that the final shapes of the drops depend on
both the initial volume fraction of the colloidal particles and the capillary
number. The results of our simulations are in a reasonable agreement with the
published experimental data. The computations for the drops of aqueous solution
of human serum albumin (HSA) are presented.
