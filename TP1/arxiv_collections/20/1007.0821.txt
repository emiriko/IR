The satellite-borne experiment PAMELA has been used to make a new measurement
of the cosmic-ray antiproton flux and the antiproton-to-proton flux ratio which
extends previously published measurements down to 60 MeV and up to 180 GeV in
kinetic energy. During 850 days of data acquisition approximately 1500
antiprotons were observed. The measurements are consistent with purely
secondary production of antiprotons in the galaxy. More precise secondary
production models are required for a complete interpretation of the results.
