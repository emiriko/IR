Large angle photodisintegration of two nucleons from the 3He nucleus is
studied within the framework of the hard rescattering model (HRM). In the HRM
the incoming photon is absorbed by one nucleon's valence quark that then
undergoes a hard rescattering reaction with a valence quark from the second
nucleon producing two nucleons emerging at large transverse momentum .
Parameter free cross sections for pp and pn break up channels are calculated
through the input of experimental cross sections on pp and pn elastic
scattering. The calculated cross section for pp breakup and its predicted
energy dependency are in good agreement with recent experimental data.
Predictions on spectator momentum distributions and helicity transfer are also
presented.
