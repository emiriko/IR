Context. For accurately measuring intensities and determining magnetic field
strengths of small-scale solar (magnetic) structure, knowledge of and
compensation for the point spread function is crucial. For images recorded with
the Swedish 1-meter Solar Telescope, restoration with Multi-Frame Blind
Deconvolution and Joint Phase Diverse Speckle methods lead to remarkable
improvements in image quality but granulation contrasts that are too low,
indicating additional stray light. Aims. We propose a method to compensate for
stray light from high-order atmospheric aberrations not included in MFBD and
JPDS processing. Methods. To compensate for uncorrected aberrations, a
reformulation of the image restoration process is proposed that allows the
average effect of hundreds of high-order modes to be compensated for by relying
on Kolmogorov statistics for these modes. The applicability of the method
requires simultaneous measurements of Fried's parameter r0. The method is
tested with simulations as well as real data and extended to include
compensation for conventional stray light. Results. We find that only part of
the reduction of granulation contrast in SST images is due to uncompensated
high-order aberrations. The remainder is still unaccounted for and attributed
to stray light from the atmosphere, the telescope with its re-imaging system
and to various high-altitude seeing effects. Conclusions. We conclude that
statistical compensation of high-order modes is a viable method to reduce the
loss of contrast occurring when a limited number of aberrations is explicitly
compensated for with MFBD and JPDS processing. We show that good such
compensation is possible with only 10 recorded frames. The main limitation of
the method is that already MFBD and JPDS processing introduces high-order
compensation that, if not taken into account, can lead to over-compensation.
