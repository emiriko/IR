The Hubbard model on a Sierpinski gasket fractal is carefully examined within
a Hartree-Fock mean field approach. We examine the influence of a magnetic flux
threading the gasket on its ground state energy, persistent current and the
Drude weight. Both an isotropic gasket and its anisotropic counterpart have
been examined. The variance in the patterns of the calculated physical
quantities are discussed for two situations, viz, at half-filling and when the
`band' is less than half-filled. The phase reversal of the persistent currents
and the change of the Drude weight as a function of the Hubbard interaction are
found to exhibit interesting patterns that have so far remained unaddressed.
