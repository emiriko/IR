From the viewpoint of classical electrodynamics, we identify the role of
spin-to-orbital angular momentum conversion in spin Hall effect of light (SHE).
We introduce a distinct separation between spin and orbital angular momenta to
clarify the spin-orbital interaction in the SHE of light. We demonstrate that
the refractive index gradient can enhance or suppress the spin-to-orbital
angular momentum conversion, and thus can control the SHE of light in
conventional beam refraction. We suggest that the metamaterial whose refractive
index can be tailored arbitrarily may become a good candidate for amplifying or
eliminating the SHE of light, and by properly facilitating the spin-to-orbital
angular momentum conversion the SHE may be enhanced dramatically. The
transverse shifts governed by the spin-to-orbital angular momentum conversion,
provide us a clear physical picture to clarify the role of refractive index
gradient in the SHE of light. These findings provide a pathway for modulating
the SHE of light and can be extrapolated to other physical systems.
