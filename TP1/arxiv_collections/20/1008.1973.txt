We present recent W and charged lepton asymmetry measurements from the CDF
and D0 experiments. Theoretical predictions agree with the CDF W asymmetry,
measured using a new matrix element technique. These theoretical predictions
are less consistent with the latest lepton asymmetry measurements from D0 and
CDF, especially for high charged lepton transverse momentum.
