Transport properties of open chaotic ballistic systems and their statistics
can be expressed in terms of the scattering matrix connecting incoming and
outgoing wavefunctions. Here we calculate the dependence of correlation
functions of arbitrarily many pairs of scattering matrices at different
energies on the Ehrenfest time using trajectory based semiclassical methods.
This enables us to verify the prediction from effective random matrix theory
that one part of the correlation function obtains an exponential damping
depending on the Ehrenfest time, while also allowing us to obtain the
additional contribution which arises from bands of always correlated
trajectories. The resulting Ehrenfest-time dependence, responsible e.g. for
secondary gaps in the density of states of Andreev billiards, can also be seen
to have strong effects on other transport quantities like the distribution of
delay times.
