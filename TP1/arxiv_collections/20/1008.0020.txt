We consider the one-dimensional initial value problem for the viscous
transport equation with nonlocal velocity $u_t = u_{xx} - \left(u (K^\prime
\ast u)\right)_{x}$ with a given kernel $K'\in L^1(\R)$. We show the existence
of global-in-time nonnegative solutions and we study their large time
asymptotics. Depending on $K'$, we obtain either linear diffusion waves ({\it
i.e.}~the fundamental solution of the heat equation) or nonlinear diffusion
waves (the fundamental solution of the viscous Burgers equation) in asymptotic
expansions of solutions as $t\to\infty$. Moreover, for certain aggregation
kernels, we show a concentration of solution on an initial time interval, which
resemble a phenomenon of the spike creation, typical in chemotaxis models.
