In type-II superconductors that contain a lattice of magnetic moments,
vortices polarize the magnetic system inducing additional contributions to the
vortex mass, vortex viscosity, and vortex-vortex interaction. Extra magnetic
viscosity is caused by radiation of spin waves by a moving vortex. Like in the
case of Cherenkov radiation, this effect has a characteristic threshold
behavior and the resulting vortex viscosity may be comparable to the well-known
Bardeen-Stephen contribution. The threshold behavior leads to an anomaly in the
current-voltage characteristics, and a drop in dissipation for a current
interval that is determined by the magnetic excitation spectrum.
