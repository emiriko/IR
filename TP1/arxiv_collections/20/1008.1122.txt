The burgeoning fields of quantum computing and quantum key distribution have
created a demand for a quantum memory. The gradient echo memory scheme is a
quantum memory candidate for light storage that can boast efficiencies
approaching unity, as well as the flexibility to work with either two or three
level atoms. The key to this scheme is the frequency gradient that is placed
across the memory. Currently the three level implementation uses a Zeeman
gradient and warm atoms. In this paper we model a new gradient creation
mechanism - the ac Stark effect - to provide an improvement in the flexibility
of gradient creation and field switching times. We propose this scheme in
concert with a move to cold atoms (~1 mK). These temperatures would increase
the storage times possible, and the small ensemble volumes would enable large
ac Stark shifts with reasonable laser power. We find that memory bandwidths on
the order of MHz can be produced with experimentally achievable laser powers
and trapping volumes, with high precision in gradient creation and switching
times on the order of nanoseconds possible. By looking at the different
decoherence mechanisms present in this system we determine that coherence times
on the order of 10s of milliseconds are possible, as are delay-bandwidth
products of approximately 50 and efficiencies over 90%.
