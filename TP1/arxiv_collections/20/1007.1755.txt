We study hot electron transport in short-channel suspended multilayer
graphene devices created by a distinct experimental approach. For devices with
semi-transparent contact barriers, a dip of differential conductance (dI/dV)
has been observed at source drain bias Vd = 0, along with anomalies at higher
Vd likely induced by optical phonon scattering. For devices with low contact
barriers, only the dI/dV dip at Vd = 0 is observed, and we find a well-fit
logarithmic dependence of dI/dV on both the bias Vd and the temperature T. The
logarithmic Vd dependence is explained with the hot electron effect and the
logarithmic T dependence could be attributed to the weak-localization in
two-dimensions.
