The survey phase of the Kepler Mission includes a number of hot subdwarf B
(sdB) stars to search for nonradial pulsations. We present our analysis of two
sdB stars that are found to be g-mode pulsators of the V1093 Her class. These
two stars also display the distinct irradiation effect typical of sdB stars
with a close M-dwarf companion with orbital periods of less than half a day.
Because the orbital period is so short, the stars should be in synchronous
rotation, and if so, the rotation period should imprint itself on the multiplet
structure of the pulsations. However, we do not find clear evidence for such
rotational splitting. Though the stars do show some frequency spacings that are
consistent with synchronous rotation, they also display multiplets with
splittings that are much smaller. Longer-duration time series photometry will
be needed to determine if those small splittings are in fact rotational
splitting, or caused by slow amplitude or phase modulation. Further data should
also improve the signal-to-noise, perhaps revealing lower amplitude
periodicities that could confirm the expectation of synchronous rotation. The
pulsation periods seen in these stars show period spacings that are suggestive
of high-overtone g-mode pulsations.
