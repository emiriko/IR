We calculate the heavy quarkonium energy levels and decay widths in a
quark-gluon plasma, whose temperature T and screening mass m_D satisfy the
hierarchy m alpha_s >> T >> m alpha_s^2 >> m_D (m being the heavy-quark mass),
at order m alpha_s^5. We first sequentially integrate out the scales m, m
alpha_s and T, and, next, we carry out the calculations in the resulting
effective theory using techniques of integration by regions. A collinear region
is identified, which contributes at this order. We also discuss the
implications of our results concerning heavy quarkonium suppression in heavy
ion collisions.
