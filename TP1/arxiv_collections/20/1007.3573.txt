The Little Higgs (LH) idea attempts to cure the little amount of fine-tuning
necessary to bridge the gap between the Higgs mass (electroweak scale) and the
new physics scale suggested by electroweak precision tests (~10 TeV). However,
we show that LH models do not survive the confrontation with experimental
limits on lepton flavor mixing, assuming the same naturalness arguments that
motivate their introduction. Two different LH models are analyzed and several
aspects of their one-loop predictions for lepton flavor-changing processes are
discussed.
