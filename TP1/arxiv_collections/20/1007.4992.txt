Study of nonlocal correlations in term of Hardy's argument has been quite
popular in quantum mechanics. Recently Hardy's argument of non-locality has
been studied in the context of generalized non-signaling theory as well as
theory respecting information causality. Information causality condition
significantly reduces the success probability for Hardy's argument when
compared to the result based on non-signaling condition. Here motivated by the
fact that maximally entangled state in quantum mechanics does not exhibit
Hardy's non-local correlation, we do a qualitative study of the property of
local randomness of measured observable on each side reproducing Hardy's
non-locality correlation,in the context of information causality condition. On
applying the necessary condition for respecting the principle of information
causality, we find that there are severe restrictions on the local randomness
of measured observable in contrast to results obtained from no-signaling
condition.Still, there are some restrictions imposed by quantum mechanics that
are not obtained from information causality condition.
