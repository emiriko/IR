Hadronic event shapes, that is, event shapes at hadron colliders, could
provide a great way to test both standard and non-standard theoretical models.
However, they are significantly more complicated than event shapes at e+e-
colliders, involving multiple hard directions, multiple channels and multiple
color structures. In this paper, hadronic event shapes are examined with
Soft-Collinear Effective Theory (SCET) by expanding around the dijet limit. A
simple event shape, threshold thrust, is defined. This observable is global and
has no free parameters, making it ideal for clarifying how resummation of
hadronic event shapes can be done in SCET. Threshold thrust is calculated at
next-to-leading fixed order (NLO) in SCET and resummed to
next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy (NNLL). The scale-dependent parts
of the soft function are shown to agree with what is expected from general
observations, and the factorization formula is explicitly shown to be
renormalization group invariant to 1-loop. Although threshold thrust is not
itself expected to be phenomenologically interesting, it can be modified into a
related observable which allows the jet pT distribution to be calculated and
resummed to NNLL+NLO accuracy. As in other processes, one expects resummation
to be important even for moderate jet momenta due to dynamical threshold
enhancement. A general discussion of threshold enhancement and non-global logs
in hadronic event shapes is also included.
