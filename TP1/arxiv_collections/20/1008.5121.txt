We present a new form of a Parrondo game using discrete-time quantum walk on
a line. The two players A and B with different quantum coins operators,
individually losing the game can develop a strategy to emerge as joint winners
by using their coins alternatively, or in combination for each step of the
quantum walk evolution. We also present a strategy for a player A (B) to have a
winning probability more than player B (A). Significance of the game strategy
in information theory and physical applications are also discussed.
