We present in this paper, a modelling of an expertise in pragmatics. We
follow knowledge engineering techniques and observe the expert when he analyses
a social discussion forum. Then a number of models are defined. These models
emphasises the process followed by the expert and a number of criteria used in
his analysis. Results can be used as guides that help to understand and
annotate discussion forum. We aim at modelling other pragmatics analysis in
order to complete the base of guides; criteria, process, etc. of discussion
analysis
