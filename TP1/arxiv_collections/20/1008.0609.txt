The Cell Network Model is a fracture model recently introduced that resembles
the microscopical structure and drying process of the parenchymatous tissue of
the Bamboo Guadua angustifolia. The model exhibits a power-law distribution of
avalanche sizes, with exponent -3.0 when the breaking thresholds are randomly
distributed with uniform probability density. Hereby we show that the same
exponent also holds when the breaking thresholds obey a broad set of Weibull
distributions, and that the humidity decrements between successive avalanches
(the equivalent to waiting times for this model) follow in all cases an
exponential distribution. Moreover, the fraction of remaining junctures shows
an exponential decay in time. In addition, introducing partial breakings and
cumulative damages induces a crossover behavior between two power-laws in the
avalanche size histograms. This results support the idea that the Cell Network
Model may be in the same universality class as the Random Fuse Model.
