The function g(r,t) = p(r+q)^(-{\beta}). e^(kt) is introduced as a basic
informetric function describing the classical informetric laws (through its
Mandelbrot part) and a time evolution. It is shown that this function is a
solution of a wave-type and of a heat-type partial differential equation. It is
suggested that our approach may lead to a description of informetrics in a
partial differential equation setting, formally similar to that for well-known
physical laws.
