It is well known that text compression can be achieved by predicting the next
symbol in the stream of text data based on the history seen up to the current
symbol. The better the prediction the more skewed the conditional probability
distribution of the next symbol and the shorter the codeword that needs to be
assigned to represent this next symbol. What about the opposite direction ?
suppose we have a black box that can compress text stream. Can it be used to
predict the next symbol in the stream ? We introduce a criterion based on the
length of the compressed data and use it to predict the next symbol. We examine
empirically the prediction error rate and its dependency on some compression
parameters.
