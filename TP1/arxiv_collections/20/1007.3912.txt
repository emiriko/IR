The structure of baryon resonance in coupled-channel meson-baryon scattering
is studied from the viewpoint of chiral dynamics. The meson-baryon scattering
amplitude can be successfully described together with the properties of the
resonance in the scattering, by implementing the unitarity condition for the
amplitude whose low energy structure is constrained by chiral theorem.
Recently, there have been a major progress in the study of the structure of the
resonance in chiral dynamics. We review the methods to clarify the structure of
the resonance by focusing on the Lambda(1405) resonance.
