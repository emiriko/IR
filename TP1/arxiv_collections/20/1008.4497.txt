Krzakala, Ricci-Tersenghi and Zdeborova have shown recently that the random
field Ising model with non-negative interactions and arbitrary external
magnetic field on an arbitrary lattice does not have a static spin glass phase.
In this paper we generalize the proof to a soft scalar spin version of the
Ising model: the Ginzburg-Landau model with random magnetic field and random
temperature-parameter. We do so by proving that the spin glass susceptibility
cannot diverge unless the ferromagnetic susceptibility does.
