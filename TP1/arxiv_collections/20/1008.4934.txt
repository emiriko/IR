According to the Van Citter-Zernike theorem the intensity distribution of a
spatially incoherent source and the mutual coherence function of the light
impinging on two wave sensors are related. It is the comparable relationship
using a single mobile sensor moving at a certain velocity relative to the
source which is calculated in this article. The autocorelation function of the
electric field at the sensor contains information about the intensity
distribution. This expression could be employed in aperture synthesis.
