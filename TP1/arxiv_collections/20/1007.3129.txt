We report on the observation of dispersion-managed (DM) dark soliton emission
in a net-normal dispersion erbium-doped fiber laser. We found experimentally
that dispersion management could not only reduce the pump threshold for the
dark soliton formation in a fiber laser, but also stabilize the single dark
soliton evolution in the cavity. Numerical simulations have also confirmed the
DM dark soliton formation in a fiber laser.
