Formal modelling of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) is a challenging task due to
high complexity, interaction, parallelism and continuous change of roles and
organisation between agents. In this paper we record our research experience on
formal modelling of MAS. We review our research throughout the last decade, by
describing the problems we have encountered and the decisions we have made
towards resolving them and providing solutions. Much of this work involved
membrane computing and classes of P Systems, such as Tissue and Population P
Systems, targeted to the modelling of MAS whose dynamic structure is a
prominent characteristic. More particularly, social insects (such as colonies
of ants, bees, etc.), biology inspired swarms and systems with emergent
behaviour are indicative examples for which we developed formal MAS models.
Here, we aim to review our work and disseminate our findings to fellow
researchers who might face similar challenges and, furthermore, to discuss
important issues for advancing research on the application of membrane
computing in MAS modelling.
