A review. Problems: 1-Many empirical parameters and large dimension number;
2-Gravitation and Electrodynamics are challenged by dark matter and energy.
Energy and nonlinear electrodynamics are fundamental in a unified nonlinear
interaction. Nuclear energy appears as nonlinear SU(2) magnetic energy.
Gravitation and electromagnetism are unified giving Einstein's equation and a
geometric energy momentum tensor. A solution energy in the newtonian limit
gives the gravitational constant G. Outside of this limit G is variable. May be
interpreted as dark matter or energy. In vacuum, known gravitational solutions
are obtained. Electromagnetism is an SU(2) subgroup. A U(1) limit gives
Maxwell's equations. Geometric fields determine a generalized Dirac equation
and are the germ of quantum physics. Planck's h and of Einstein's c are given
by the potential and the metric. Excitations have quanta of charge, flux and
spin determining the FQHE. There are only three stable 1/2 spin fermions. Mass
is a form of energy. The rest energies of the fermions give the proton/electron
mass ratio. Potential excitations have energies equal to the weak boson masses
allowing a geometric interpretation of Weinberg's angle. SU(2) gives the
anomalous magnetic moments of proton, electron, neutron and generates nuclear
range attractive potentials strong enough to produce the binding energies of
the deuteron and other nuclides. Lepton and meson masses are due to topological
excitations. The geometric mass spectrum is satisfactory. The proton has a
triple structure. The alpha constant is a geometric number.
