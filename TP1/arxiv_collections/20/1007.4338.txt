We propose an alternative method to factorize an integer by using three
harmonic oscillators. These oscillators are coupled together via specific Kerr
nonlinear interactions. This method can be applied even if two harmonic
oscillators are prepared in mixed states. As simple examples, we show how to
factorize N=15 and 35 using this approach. The effect of dissipation of the
harmonic oscillators on the performance of this method is studied. We also
study the realization of nonlinear interactions between the coupled
oscillators. However, the probability of finding the factors of a number is
inversely proportional to its input size. The probability becomes low when this
number is large. We discuss the limitations of this approach.
