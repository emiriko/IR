We show how dissipative dynamics can give rise to pairing for two-component
fermions on a lattice. In particular, we construct a "parent" Liouvillian
operator so that a BCS-type state of a given symmetry, e.g. a d-wave state, is
reached for arbitrary initial states in the absence of conservative forces. The
system-bath couplings describe single-particle, number conserving and
quasi-local processes. The pairing mechanism crucially relies on Fermi
statistics. We show how such Liouvillians can be realized via reservoir
engineering with cold atoms representing a driven dissipative dynamics.
