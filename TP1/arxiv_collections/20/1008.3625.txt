In this paper, we analyze the security of an RFID authentication protocol
proposed by Liu and Bailey [1], called Privacy and Authentication Protocol
(PAP), and show its vulnerabilities and faulty assumptions. PAP is a privacy
and authentication protocol designed for passive tags. The authors claim that
the protocol, being resistant to commonly assumed attacks, requires little
computation and provides privacy protection and authentication. Nevertheless,
we propose two traceability attacks and an impersonation attack, in which the
revealing of secret information (i.e., secret key and static identifier) shared
between the tag and the reader is unnecessary. Moreover, we review all basic
assumptions on which the design of the protocol resides, and show how many of
them are incorrect and are contrary to the common assumptions in RFID systems.
