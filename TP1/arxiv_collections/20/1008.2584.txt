We experimentally assess the capabilities of an active, open-loop technique
for drag reduction in turbulent wall flows recently introduced by Quadrio et
al. [J. Fluid Mech., v.627, 161, (2009)]. The technique consists in generating
streamwise-modulated waves of spanwise velocity at the wall, that travel in the
streamwise direction.
  A proof-of-principle experiment has been devised to measure the reduction of
turbulent friction in a pipe flow, in which the wall is subdivided into thin
slabs that rotate independently in the azimuthal direction. Different speeds of
nearby slabs provide, although in a discrete setting, the desired streamwise
variation of transverse velocity.
  Our experiment confirms the available DNS results, and in particular
demonstrates the possibility of achieving large reductions of friction in the
turbulent regime. Reductions up to 33% are obtained for slowly
forward-traveling waves; backward-traveling waves invariably yield drag
reduction, whereas a substantial drop of drag reduction occurs for waves
traveling forward with a phase speed comparable to the convection speed of
near-wall turbulent structures.
  A Fourier analysis is employed to show that the first harmonics introduced by
the discrete spatial waveform that approximates the sinusoidal wave are
responsible for significant effects that are indeed observed in the
experimental measurements. Practical issues related to the physical
implementation of this control scheme and its energetic efficiency are briefly
discussed.
