We examine spectral properties of the SDSS quasar J093201.60+031858.7, in
particular the presence of strong blue peaks in the Balmer emission lines
offset from the narrow lines by approximately 4200 km/s. Asymmetry in the broad
central component of the Hbeta line indicates the presence of a double-peaked
emitter. However, the strength and sharpness of the blue Hbeta and blue Hgamma
peaks make this quasar spectrum unique amongst double-peaked emitters
identified from SDSS spectra. We fit a disk model to the Hbeta line and compare
this object with other unusual double-peaked quasar spectra, particularly
candidate binary supermassive black holes (SMBHs). Under the binary SMBH
scenario, we test the applicability of a model in which a second SMBH may
produce the strong blue peak in the Balmer lines of a double-peaked emitter. If
there were only one SMBH, a circular, Keplerian disk model fit would be
insufficient, indicating some sort of asymmetry is required to produce the
strength of the blue peak. In either case, understanding the nature of the
complex line emission in this object will aid in further discrimination between
a single SMBH with a complex accretion disk and the actual case of a binary
SMBH.
