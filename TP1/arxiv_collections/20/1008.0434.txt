We present a method of filter diagonalization for shell-model calculations.
This method is based on the Sakurai and Sugiura (SS) method, but extended with
help of the shifted complex orthogonal conjugate gradient (COCG) method. A
salient feature of this method is that it can calculate eigenvalues and
eigenstates in a given energy interval. We show that this method can be an
alternative to the Lanczos method for calculating ground and excited states, as
well as spectral strength functions. With an application to the $M$-scheme
shell-model calculations we demonstrate that several inherent problems in the
widely-used Lanczos method can be removed or reduced.
