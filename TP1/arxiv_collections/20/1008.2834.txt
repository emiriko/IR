We investigate the run-up of a shock wave from inside to the surface of a
perfect fluid star in equilibrium and bounded by vacuum. Near the surface we
approximate the fluid motion as plane-symmetric and the gravitational field as
constant. We consider the "hot" equation of state $P=(\Gamma-1)\rho e$ and its
"cold" (fixed entropy, barotropic) form $P=K_0\rho^\Gamma$ (the latter does not
allow for shock heating). We find numerically that the evolution of generic
initial data approaches universal similarity solutions sufficiently near the
surface, and we construct these similarity solutions explicitly. The two
equations of state show very different behaviour, because shock heating becomes
the dominant effect when it is allowed. In the barotropic case, the fluid
velocity behind the shock approaches a constant value, while the density behind
the shock approaches a power law in space, as the shock approaches the surface.
In the hot case with shock heating,the density jumps by a constant factor
through the shock, while the sound speed and fluid velocity behind the shock
diverge in a whiplash effect. We tabulate the similarity exponents as a
function of the equation of state parameter $\Gamma$and the stratification
index $n_*$.
