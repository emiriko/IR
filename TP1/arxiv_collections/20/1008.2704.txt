G54.1+0.3 is a Crab-like pulsar wind nebula (PWN) with the highest
$\gamma$-ray to X-ray luminosity ratio among all the nebulae driven by young
rotation-powered pulsars. We model the spectral evolution of the PWN and find
it difficult to match the observed multi-band data with leptons alone using
reasonable model parameters. In lepton-hadron hybrid model instead, TeV photons
come mainly from $\pi^0$ decay in proton-proton interaction and the observed
photon spectrum can be well reproduced. The newly discovered infrared loop and
molecular cloud in or closely around the PWN can work as the target for the
bombardment of the PWN protons.
