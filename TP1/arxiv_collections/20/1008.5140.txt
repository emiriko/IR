Given a Poisson process on a bounded interval, its random geometric graph is
the graph whose vertices are the points of the Poisson process and edges exist
between two points if and only if their distance is less than a fixed given
threshold. We compute explicitly the distribution of the number of connected
components of this graph. The proof relies on inverting some Laplace
transforms.
