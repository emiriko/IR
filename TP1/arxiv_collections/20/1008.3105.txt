The production of K_short mesons in pp collisions at a centre-of-mass energy
of 0.9 TeV is studied with the LHCb detector at the Large Hadron Collider. The
luminosity of the analysed sample is determined using a novel technique,
involving measurements of the beam currents, sizes and positions, and is found
to be 6.8 +/- 1.0 microbarn^-1. The differential prompt K_short production
cross-section is measured as a function of the K_short transverse momentum and
rapidity in the region 0 < pT < 1.6 GeV/c and 2.5 < y < 4.0. The data are found
to be in reasonable agreement with previous measurements and generator
expectations.
