Motivated by the work [Phys. Rev. Lett. 89, 220404 (2002)] for detecting the
vacuum-induced Berry phases with two-mode Jaynes-Cummings models (JCMs), we
show here that, for a parameter-dependent single-mode JCM, certain atom-field
states also acquire the photon-number-dependent Berry phases after the
parameter slowly changed and eventually returned to its initial value. This
geometric effect related to the field quantization still exists, even the filed
is kept in its vacuum state. Specifically, a feasible Ramsey interference
experiment with cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) system is designed to
detect the vacuum-induced Berry phase.
