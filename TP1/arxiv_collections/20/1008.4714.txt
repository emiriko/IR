The spin pumping efficiency of lateral standing spin wave modes in a
rectangular YIG/Pt sample has been investigated by means of the inverse
spin-Hall effect (ISHE). The standing spin waves drive spin pumping, the
generation of spin currents from magnetization precession, into the Pt layer
which is converted into a detectable voltage due to the ISHE. We discovered
that the spin pumping efficiency is significantly higher for lateral standing
surface spin waves rather than for volume spin wave modes. The results suggest
that the use of higher-mode surface spin waves allows for the fabrication of an
efficient spin-current injector.
