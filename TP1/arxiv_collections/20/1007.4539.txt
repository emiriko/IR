The cosmic microwave background radiation defines a preferred cosmic rest
frame, and inflationary cosmological theories predict that the microwave
background temperature fluctuations should be statistically isotropic in this
rest frame. For observers moving with respect to the rest frame, the
temperature fluctuations will no longer be isotropic, due to the preferred
direction of motion. The most prominent effect is a dipole temperature
variation, which has long been observed with an amplitude of a part in a
thousand of the mean temperature. An observer's velocity with respect to the
rest frame will also induce changes in the angular correlation function and
creation of non-zero off-diagonal correlations between multipole moments. We
calculate both of these effects, which are part-in-a-thousand corrections to
the rest frame power spectrum and correlation function. Both should be
detectable in future full-sky microwave maps from the Planck satellite. These
signals will constrain cosmological models in which the cosmic dipole arises
partly from large-scale isocurvature perturbations, as suggested by recent
observations.
