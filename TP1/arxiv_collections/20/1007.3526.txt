We present a search for f_J(2220) production in radiative J/psi -> gamma
f_J(2220) decays using 460 fb-1 of data collected with the BABAR detector at
the SLAC PEP-II e+e- collider. The f_J(2220) is searched for in the decays to
K+K- and KsKs. No evidence of this resonance is observed, and 90% confidence
level upper limits on the product of the branching fractions for J/psi -> gamma
f_J(2220), f_J(2220) -> K+K- and J/psi -> gamma f_J(2220), f_J(2220) -> KsKs as
a function of spin and helicity are set at the level of 10-5. These values are
below the central values reported by the Mark III experiment.
