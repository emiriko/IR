This paper gives a brief overview of the present and expected future limits
on physics beyond the Standard Model (SM) from neutron beta decay, which is
described by two parameters only within the SM. Since more than two observables
are accessible, the problem is over-determined. Thus, precise measurements of
correlations in neutron decay can be used to study the SM as well to search for
evidence of possible extensions to it. Of particular interest in this context
are the search for right-handed currents or for scalar and tensor interactions.
Precision measurements of neutron decay observables address important open
questions of particle physics and cosmology, and are generally complementary to
direct searches for new physics beyond the SM in high-energy physics. Free
neutron decay is therefore a very active field, with a number of new
measurements underway worldwide. We present the impact of recent developments.
