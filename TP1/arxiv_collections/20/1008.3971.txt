We establish an hitherto hidden connection between zero modes and instantons
in the context of the Kraichanan model for passive scalar turbulent advection,
that relies on the hypothesis that the production of strong gradients of the
scalar is associated with Bose-like condensation of Lagrangian particles. It
opens the way to the computation of scaling exponents of the N-th order
structure functions of the scalar by techniques borrowed from many-body theory.
To lowest order of approximation, scaling exponents are found to increase
asymptotically as log N in two dimensions.
