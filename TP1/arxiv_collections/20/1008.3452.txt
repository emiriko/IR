In almost all of the currently working circuits, especially in analog
circuits implementing signal processing applications, basic arithmetic
operations such as multiplication, addition, subtraction and division are
performed on values which are represented by voltages or currents. However, in
this paper, we propose a new and simple method for performing analog arithmetic
operations which in this scheme, signals are represented and stored through a
memristance of the newly found circuit element, i.e. memristor, instead of
voltage or current. Some of these operators such as divider and multiplier are
much simpler and faster than their equivalent voltage-based circuits and they
require less chip area. In addition, a new circuit is designed for programming
the memristance of the memristor with predetermined analog value. Presented
simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and the accuracy of the
proposed circuits.
