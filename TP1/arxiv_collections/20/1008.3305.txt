This paper presents an efficient program for checking Mendelian consistency
in a pedigree. Since pedigrees may contain incomplete and/or erroneous
information, geneticists need to pre-process them before performing linkage
analysis. Removing superfluous genotypes that do not respect the Mendelian
inheritance laws can speed up the linkage analysis. We have described in a
formal way the Mendelian consistency problem and algorithms known in
literature. The formalization helped to polish the algorithms and to find
efficient data structures. The performance of the tool has been tested on a
wide range of benchmarks. The results are promising if compared to other
programs that treat Mendelian consistency.
