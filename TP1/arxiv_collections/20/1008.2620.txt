Liberal evolution of interacting binaries has been proposed previously by
several authors in order to meet various observed binary characteristics better
than conservative evolution does. Since Algols are eclipsing binaries the
distribution of their orbital periods is precisely known. The distribution of
their mass ratios contains however more uncertainties. We try to reproduce
these two distributions theoretically using a liberal scenario in which the
gainer star can lose mass into interstellar space as a consequence of its rapid
rotation and the energy of a hot spot. In a recent paper (Van Rensbergen et al.
2010, A&A) we calculated the liberal evolution of binaries with a B-type
primary at birth where mass transfer starts during core hydrogen burning of the
donor. In this paper we include the cases where mass transfer starts during
hydrogen shell burning and it is our aim to reproduce the observed
distributions of the system parameters of Algol-type semi-detached systems. Our
calculations reveal the amount of time that an Algol binary lives with a well
defined value of mass ratio and orbital period. We use these data to simulate
the distribution of mass ratios and orbital periods of Algols. Binaries with a
late B-type initial primary hardly lose any mass whereas those with an early B
primary evolve in a non-conservative way. Conservative binary evolution
predicts only ~ 12 % of Algols with a mass ratio q above 0.4. This value is
raised up to ~ 17 % using our scenario of liberal evolution, which is still far
below the ~ 45 % that is observed. Observed orbital periods of Algol binaries
larger than one day are faithfully reproduced by our liberal scenario. Mass
ratios are reproduced better than with conservative evolution, but the
resemblance is still poor.
