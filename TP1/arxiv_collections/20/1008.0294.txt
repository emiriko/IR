The backbending phenomenon in $^{48}$Cr has been investigated using the
recently developed Projected Configuration Interaction (PCI) method, in which
the deformed intrinsic states are directly associated with shell model (SM)
wavefunctions. Two previous explanations, (i) $K=0$ band crossing, and (ii)
$K=2$ band crossing have been reinvestigated using PCI, and it was found that
both explanations can successfully reproduce the experimental backbending. The
PCI wavefunctions in the pictures of $K=0$ band crossing and $K=2$ band
crossing are highly overlapped. We conclude that there are no unique intrinsic
states associated with the yrast states after backbending in $^{48}$Cr.
