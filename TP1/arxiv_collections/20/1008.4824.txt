FTIR spectra of mineral waters of Slavyanovskaya, Aqua Montana, Bad
Harzburger and Christinen with time from first contact of water with open air
were analysed. The kinetic of spectral changes of Slavyanovskaya mineral water
in the regions of stretch, deformation and intermolecular vibrations was
measured. The spectral changes do not correlate with chemical contamination of
mineral water and degassing process. The observed spectral changes could be due
to different structure of mineral water in liquid state, which is destroyed
after air contact. The observed spectral behaviour of Slavyanovskaya is
correlated with the catalytic activity of mineral water, which was saved
without contact with air. The characteristic time of spectral dependence (669
seconds) is close to the characteristic time of catalytic activity loss (600
seconds) of mineral water at air contact. The spectra results support the
medical studies that show the activity of mineral water near spring, and the
loosing activity of water after long time storing.
