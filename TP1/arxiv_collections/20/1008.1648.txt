This paper is a continuation of our research work on state complexity of
combined operations. Motivated by applications, we study the state complexities
of two particular combined operations: catenation combined with star and
catenation combined with reversal. We show that the state complexities of both
of these combined operations are considerably less than the compositions of the
state complexities of their individual participating operations.
