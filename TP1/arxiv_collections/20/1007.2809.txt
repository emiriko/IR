We consider the evolution in full general relativity of a family of linearly
unstable isolated spherical neutron stars under the effects of very small,
perturbations as induced by the truncation error. Using a simple ideal-fluid
equation of state we find that this system exhibits a type-I critical
behaviour, thus confirming the conclusions reached by Liebling et al. [1] for
rotating magnetized stars. Exploiting the relative simplicity of our system, we
are able carry out a more in-depth study providing solid evidences of the
criticality of this phenomenon and also to give a simple interpretation of the
putative critical solution as a spherical solution with the unstable mode being
the fundamental F-mode. Hence for any choice of the polytropic constant, the
critical solution will distinguish the set of subcritical models migrating to
the stable branch of the models of equilibrium from the set of subcritical
models collapsing to a black hole. Finally, we study how the dynamics changes
when the numerically perturbation is replaced by a finite-size, resolution
independent velocity perturbation and show that in such cases a nearly-critical
solution can be changed into either a sub or supercritical. The work reported
here also lays the basis for the analysis carried in a companion paper, where
the critical behaviour in the the head-on collision of two neutron stars is
instead considered [2].
