In this research paper we describe semantic oriented information engineering
and knowledge management based solution towards E-Learning systems. We also try
to justify the importance of proposed solution with respect to the E-Learning
Approaches .i.e., Behavior, Objectivism, Cognitive and Construction. Moreover
we briefly describe E-Learning, information engineering, knowledge management
and some old and newly available technologies supporting development of
E-Learning Systems in this research paper.
