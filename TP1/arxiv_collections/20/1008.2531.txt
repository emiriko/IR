Three-dimensional numerical simulations have been used to study the
scattering of a surface-gravity wave packet by vertical magnetic flux tubes,
with radii from 200 km to 3 Mm, embedded in stratified polytropic atmosphere.
The scattered wave was found to consist primarily of m=0 (axisymmetric) and m=1
modes. It was found that the ratio of the amplitude of these two modes is
strongly dependant on the radius of the flux tube: The kink mode is the
dominant mode excited in tubes with a small radius while the sausage mode is
dominant for large tubes. Simulations of this type provide a simple, efficient
and robust way to start understanding the seismic signature of flux tubes,
which have recently began to be observed.
