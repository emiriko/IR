Answering a question of T. Cochrane and C. Pinner, we prove that for any
{\epsilon}>0, sufficiently large prime number p and an arbitrary multiplicative
subgroup R of the field Z/pZ, p^{\epsilon} < |R| < p^{2/3-{\epsilon}} the
following holds |R + R|, |R - R| > |R|^{3/2+{\delta}}, where {\delta}>0 depends
on {\epsilon} only.
