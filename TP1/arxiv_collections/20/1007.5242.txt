Knowledge of the population of radio sources in the range ~2-200 GHz is
important for understanding their effects on measurements of the Cosmic
Microwave Background power spectrum. We report measurements of the 30 GHz flux
densities of 605 radio sources from the Combined Radio All-sky Targeted
Eight-GHz Survey (CRATES), which have been made with the One Centimetre
Receiver Array prototype (OCRA-p) on the Torun 32-m telescope. The flux
densities of sources that were also observed by WMAP and previous OCRA surveys
are in broad agreement with those reported here, however a number of sources
display intrinsic variability. We find a good correlation between the 30 GHz
and Fermi gamma-ray flux densities for common sources. We examine the radio
spectra of all observed sources and report a number of Gigahertz-peaked and
inverted spectrum sources. These measurements will be useful for comparison to
those from the Low Frequency Instrument of the Planck satellite, which will
make some of its most sensitive observations in the region covered here.
