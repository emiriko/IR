We present a full diagrammatic computation of the one-loop corrections from
the neutrino/sneutrino sector to the renormalized neutral CP-even Higgs boson
self-energies and the lightest Higgs boson mass, Mh, within the context of the
so-called MSSM-seesaw scenario. This consists of the Minimal Supersymmetric
Standard Model with the addition of massive right handed Majorana neutrinos and
their supersymmetric partners, and where the seesaw mechanism is used for the
lightest neutrino mass generation. We explore the dependence on all the
parameters involved, with particular emphasis in the role played by the heavy
Majorana scale. We restrict ourselves to the case of one generation of
neutrinos/sneutrinos. For the numerical part of the study, we consider a very
wide range of values for all the parameters involved. We find sizeable
corrections to Mh, which are negative in the region where the Majorana scale is
large (10^{13}-10^{15} GeV) and the lightest neutrino mass is within a range
inspired by data (0.1-1 eV). For some regions of the MSSM-seesaw parameter
space, the corrections to Mh are substantially larger than the anticipated
Large Hadron Collider precision.
