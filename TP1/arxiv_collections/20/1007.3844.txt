Rare-earth metal filled skutterudites RPt4Ge12 with R=La-Nd, and Eu exhibit a
variety of different ground states, e.g., conventional and unconventional
superconductivity in LaPt4Ge12 and PrPt4Ge12, respectively, and intermediate
valence behavior in CePt4Ge12. In this work we investigate the magnetic state
of NdPt4Ge12 and EuPt4Ge12 by specific heat, dc-susceptibility and
magnetization. NdPt4Ge12 shows two magnetic phase transitions at T_N1=0.67 K
and T_N2=0.58 K, while EuPt4Ge12 displays a complex magnetic phase diagram
below the magnetic ordering temperature of 1.78 K. The specific heat indicates
that in NdPt4Ge12 the crystalline electric field (CEF) ground state of the Nd3+
is a quartet and that, as expected, in EuPt4Ge12 the Eu2+ state is fully
degenerate.
