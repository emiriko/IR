New high resolution spectra of the short period (P~1.76 days) young detached
binary LT CMa are reported for the first time. By combining the results from
the analysis of new radial velocity curves and published light curves, we
determine values for the masses, radii and temperatures as follows: M_1= 5.59
(0.20) M_o, R_1=3.56 (0.07) R_o and T_eff1= 17000 (500) K for the primary and
M_2=3.36 (0.14) M_o, R_2= 2.04 (0.05) R_o and T_eff2= 13140 (800) K for the
secondary. Static absorbtion features apart from those coming from the close
binary components are detected in the several spectral regions. If these
absorbtion features are from a third star, as the light curve solutions
support, its radial velocity is measured to be RV_3=70(8) km s^-1. The orbit of
the binary system is proved to be eccentric (e=0.059) and thus the apsidal
motion exists. The estimated linear advance in longitude of periastron
corresponds to an apsidal motion of U=694+/-5 yr for the system. The average
internal structure constant log k_2,obs=-2.53 of LT CMa is found smaller than
its theoretical value of log k_2,theo=-2.22 suggesting the stars would have
more central concentration in mass. The photometric distance of LT CMa
(d=535+/-45 pc) is found to be much smaller than the distance of CMa OB1
association (1150 pc) which rules out membership. A comparison with current
stellar evolution models for solar metallicity indicates that LT CMa (35 Myr)
is much older than the CMa OB1 association (3 Myr), confirming that LT CMa is
not a member of CMa OB1. The kinematical and dynamical analysis indicate LT CMa
is orbiting the Galaxy in a circular orbit and belongs to the young thin-disk
population.
