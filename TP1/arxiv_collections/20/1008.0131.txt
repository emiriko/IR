Lepto-nuclear colliders offer unique experimental opportunities to probe QCD
in an extended medium. Of the many possibilities, three experiments are
described here that are clearly feasible and of high scientific importance.
First, a direct measurement of the saturation scale is possible using the
broadening of the transverse momentum distribution of hadrons produced in
semi-inclusive DIS. This connection to saturation physics will provide a
quantitative measure of the degree to which this fundamental QCD phenomenon is
occurring, and has important consequences in other high-energy scattering
studies. Second, the measurement of quark energy loss is feasible, either as a
direct measurement at a lower-energy EIC, or as an indirect measurement using
hadron attenuation at higher energies. Such a measurement will offer the first
experimental validation of the energy independence of this process, which is a
consequence of the QCD analog of the LPM effect in QED. The third experiment is
to determine the mechanisms of hadronization using the nucleus as a spatial
analyzer, intercomparing hadron attenuation for nuclei of a range of sizes. The
extended reach of the EIC in energy will allow probes of these mechanisms in
the crucial high-z region for the heaviest nuclei, and will permit study of
hadronization in heavy quark meson and baryon systems.
