(Abridged) We trace the interaction processes of galaxies at intermediate
redshift by measuring the irregularity of their ionized gas kinematics, and
investigate these irregularities as a function of the environment (cluster
versus field) and of morphological type (spiral versus irregular). Our sample
consists of 92 distant galaxies. 16 cluster (z~0.3 and z~0.5) and 29 field
galaxies (mean z=0.44) of these have velocity fields with sufficient signal to
be analyzed. We find that the fraction of galaxies that have irregular gas
kinematics is remarkably similar in galaxy clusters and in the field at
intermediate redshifts. The distribution of the field and cluster galaxies in
(ir)regularity parameters space is also similar. On the other hand galaxies
with small central concentration of light, that we see in the field sample, are
absent in the cluster sample. We find that field galaxies at intermediate
redshifts have more irregular velocity fields as well as more clumpy and less
centrally concentrated light distributions than their local counterparts.
Comparison with a SINS sample of 11 z ~ 2 galaxies shows that these distant
galaxies have more irregular gas kinematics than our intermediate redshift
cluster and field sample. We do not find a dependence of the irregularities in
gas kinematics on morphological type. We find that two different indicators of
star formation correlate with irregularity in the gas kinematics. More
irregular gas kinematics, also more clumpy and less centrally concentrated
light distributions of spiral field galaxies at intermediate redshifts in
comparison to their local counterparts indicate that these galaxies are
probably still in the process of building their disks via mechanisms such as
accretion and mergers. On the other hand, they have less irregular gas
kinematics compared to galaxies at z ~ 2.
