We consider the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with a general nonlinearity.
In dimension higher than 2, this equation admits travelling wave solutions with
a fixed profile which is not the ground state. This kind of profiles are called
excited states. In this paper, we construct solutions to NLS behaving like a
sum of N excited states which spread up quickly as time grows (which we call
multi-solitons). We also show that if the flow around one of these excited
states is linearly unstable, then the multi-soliton is not unique, and is
unstable.
