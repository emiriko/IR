We study the off-equilibrium dynamics of the infinite dimensional Bose
Hubbard Model after a quantum quench. The dynamics can be analyzed exactly by
mapping it to an effective Newtonian evolution. For integer filling, we find a
dynamical transition separating regimes of small and large quantum quenches
starting from the superfluid state. This transition is very similar to the one
found for the fermionic Hubbard model by mean field approximations.
