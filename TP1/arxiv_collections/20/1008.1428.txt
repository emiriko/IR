One-electron 3+1 and 2+1 Dirac equations are used to calculate the motion of
a relativistic electron in a vacuum in the presence of an external magnetic
field. First, calculations are carried on an operator level and exact
analytical results are obtained for the electron trajectories which contain
both intraband frequency components, identified as the cyclotron motion, as
well as interband frequency components, identified as the trembling motion
(Zitterbewegung, ZB). Next, time-dependent Heisenberg operators are used for
the same problem to compute average values of electron position and velocity
employing Gaussian wave packets. It is shown that the presence of a magnetic
field and the resulting quantization of the energy spectrum has pronounced
effects on the electron Zitterbewegung: it introduces intraband frequency
components into the motion, influences all the frequencies and makes the motion
stationary (not decaying in time) in case of the 2+1 Dirac equation. Finally,
simulations of the 2+1 Dirac equation and the resulting electron ZB in the
presence of a magnetic field are proposed and described employing trapped ions
and laser excitations. Using simulation parameters achieved in recent
experiments of Gerritsma and coworkers we show that the effects of the
simulated magnetic field on ZB are considerable and can certainly be observed.
