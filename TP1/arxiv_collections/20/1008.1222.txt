We present methods to construct interesting surfaces of general type via
$\mathbb{Q}$-Gorenstein smoothing of a singular surface obtained from an
elliptic surface. By applying our methods to special Enriques surfaces, we
construct new examples of a minimal surface of general type with $p_g=0$,
$\pi_1=\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$, and $K^2\le 4$.
