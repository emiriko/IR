Let S_n(321) (respectively, S_n(132)) denote the set of all permutations of
{1,2,...,n} that avoid the pattern 321 (respectively, the pattern 132).
Elizalde and Pak gave a bijection Theta from S_n(321) to S_n(132) that
preserves the numbers of fixed points and excedances for each element of
S_n(321), and commutes with the operation of taking inverses. Bloom and
Saracino proved that another bijection Gamma from S_n(321) to S_n(132),
introduced by Robertson, has the same properties, and they later gave a
pictorial reformulation of Gamma that made these results more transparent. Here
we give a pictorial reformulation of Theta, from which it follows that,
although the original definitions of Theta and Gamma are very different, these
two bijections are in fact related to each other in a very simple way, by using
inversion, reversal, and complementation.
