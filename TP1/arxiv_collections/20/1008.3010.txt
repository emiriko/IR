The results of highly accurate calculations are presented for all twenty-two
known bound $S(L = 0)-, P(L = 1)-, D(L = 2)-$ and $F(L = 3)-$states in the six
three-body muonic molecular ions $pp\mu, pd\mu, pt\mu, dd\mu, dt\mu$ and
$tt\mu$. A number of bound state properties of these muonic molecular ions have
been determined numerically to high accuracy. The dependence of the total
energies of these muonic molecules upon particle masses is considered. We also
discuss the current status of muon-catalysis of nuclear fusion reactions.
