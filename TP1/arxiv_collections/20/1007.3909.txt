Positronium, the electron-positron bound state, is described to a good
approximation by pure QED. The states of positronium have definite values of C
and P. Consequently, positronium is an attractive system for the investigation
of possible violations of the discrete symmetries in the leptonic sector. We
discuss signals for CP and CPT violation in the decay of spin-polarized
orthopositronium and show where such correlations might arise in the context of
the Standard-Model Extension.
