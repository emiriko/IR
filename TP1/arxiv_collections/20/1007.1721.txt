The influence of decoherence and bonding on the linear conductance of single
double-stranded DNA molecules is examined by fitting a phenomenological
statistical model developed recently (EPJB {\bf 68}, 237 (2009)) to
experimental results. The DNA molecule itself is described by a tight binding
ladder model with parameters obtained from published ab initio calculations
(J.Am.Chem.Soc. {\bf 127}, 14894 (2005)). The good agreement with the
experiments on sequence and length dependence gives a hint on the nature of
conduction in DNA and at the same time provides a crucial test of the model.
