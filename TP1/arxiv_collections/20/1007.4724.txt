Estimating link capacity in a wireless network is a complex task because the
available capacity at a link is a function of not only the current arrival rate
at that link, but also of the arrival rate at links which interfere with that
link as well as of the nature of interference between these links. Models which
accurately characterize this dependence are either too computationally complex
to be useful or lack accuracy. Further, they have a high implementation
overhead and make restrictive assumptions, which makes them inapplicable to
real networks.
  In this paper, we propose CapEst, a general, simple yet accurate,
measurement-based approach to estimating link capacity in a wireless network.
To be computationally light, CapEst allows inaccuracy in estimation; however,
using measurements, it can correct this inaccuracy in an iterative fashion and
converge to the correct estimate. Our evaluation shows that CapEst always
converged to within 5% of the correct value in less than 18 iterations. CapEst
is model-independent, hence, is applicable to any MAC/PHY layer and works with
auto-rate adaptation. Moreover, it has a low implementation overhead, can be
used with any application which requires an estimate of residual capacity on a
wireless link and can be implemented completely at the network layer without
any support from the underlying chipset.
