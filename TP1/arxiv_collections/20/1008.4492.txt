A different formulation of the effective interaction hyperspherical harmonics
(EIHH) method, suitable for non-local potentials, is presented. The EIHH method
for local interactions is first shortly reviewed to point out the problems of
an extension to non-local potentials. A viable solution is proposed and, as an
application, results on the ground-state properties of 4- and 6-nucleon systems
are presented. One finds a substantial acceleration in the convergence rate of
the hyperspherical harmonics series. Perspectives for an application to
scattering cross sections, via the Lorentz transform method are discussed.
