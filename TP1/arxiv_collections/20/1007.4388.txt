The probabilistic model of keys generation of QKD systems is proposed. The
model includes all phases of keys generation starting from photons generation
to states detection taking characteristics of fiber-optics components into
account. The paper describes the tree of events of QKD systems. Equations are
found for estimation of the effectiveness of the process of sifted keys
generation as well as for bit-error probability and for the rate of private
keys generation.
