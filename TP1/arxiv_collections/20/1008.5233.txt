We demonstrate using graphene sheets as a novel mass standard in the scanning
transmission electron microscopy (STEM) based mass spectrometry. Here,
free-standing graphene sheets are investigated by STEM. The discrete number of
graphene layers enables an accurate calibration of STEM intensity, as performed
over an extended thickness and with single atomic layer sensitivity. This leads
to the direct and accurate measurement of the electron mean free path. As an
application, we gain the insight of carbon nanoparticles of complex structure.
