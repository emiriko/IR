The occurrence of a bounce in the FRW cosmology requires modifications of
General Relativity. An example of such a modification is the recently proposed
Horava-Lifshitz theory of gravity, which includes a "dark radiation" term with
a negative coefficient in the analog of the Friedmann equation. A modification
of the HL gravity, relaxing the "detailed balance" condition, brings additional
terms to the equations of motion, corresponding to stiff matter. This paper
presents comparison of the phase structure of the original and modified Horava
cosmology. Special attention is paid to the analysis of a wide range of
bouncing solution, appearing in both versions of the Horava theory.
