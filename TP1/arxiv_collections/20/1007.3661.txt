Polar codes, introduced by Arikan, achieve symmetric capacity of any discrete
memoryless channels under low encoding and decoding complexity. Recently,
non-binary polar codes have been investigated. In this paper, we calculate
error probability of non-binary polar codes constructed on the basis of
Reed-Solomon matrices by numerical simulations. It is confirmed that 4-ary
polar codes have significantly better performance than binary polar codes on
binary-input AWGN channel. We also discuss an interpretation of polar codes in
terms of algebraic geometry codes, and further show that polar codes using
Hermitian codes have asymptotically good performance.
