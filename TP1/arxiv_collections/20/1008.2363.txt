In the last few years there has been renewed interest in the classical
control problem of de Finetti for the case that underlying source of randomness
is a spectrally negative Levy process. In particular a significant step forward
is made in an article of Loeffen where it is shown that a natural and very
general condition on the underlying Levy process which allows one to proceed
with the analysis of the associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation is that
its Levy measure is absolutely continuous, having completely monotone density.
In this paper we consider de Finetti's control problem but now with the
restriction that control strategies are absolutely continuous with respect to
Lebesgue measure. This problem has been considered by Asmussen and Taksar,
Jeanblanc and Shiryaev and Boguslavskaya in the diffusive case and Gerber and
Shiu for the case of a Cramer-Lundberg process with exponentially distributed
jumps. We show the robustness of the condition that the underlying Levy measure
has a completely monotone density and establish an explicit optimal strategy
for this case that envelopes the aforementioned existing results. The explicit
optimal strategy in question is the so-called refraction strategy.
