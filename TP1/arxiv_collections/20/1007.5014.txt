We study the electron correlation effects in the calculations of isotope
shifts in Na and Mg+ using the relativistic coupled-cluster method. The trends
of the correlation effects are explicitly discussed and comparison of the
present results with the previously reported results are given. We also present
the fine structure constant variation coefficients for many states in the above
systems. From these results, it is possible to find out suitable transition
lines those can be used as anchor and probe lines in finding possible variation
in the fine structure constant.
