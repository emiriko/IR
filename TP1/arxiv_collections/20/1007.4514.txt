We present a simple quantum theory for the pulsed light generated by a
synchronously pumped optical parametric oscillator (SPOPO) in the degenerate
case where the signal and idler trains of pulses coincide, below threshold and
neglecting all dispersion effects. Our main goal is to precise in the obtained
quantum effects, which ones are identical to the c.w. case and which ones are
specific to the SPOPO. We demonstrate in particular that the temporal
correlations have interesting peculiarities: the quantum fluctuations at
different times within the same pulse turn out to be totally not correlated,
whereas they are correlated between nearby pulses at times that are placed in
the same position relative to the centre of the pulses. The number of
significantly correlated pulses is of the order of cavity finesse. We show also
that there is perfect squeezing at noise frequencies multiple of the pulse
repetition frequency when one approaches the threshold from below on the signal
field quadrature measured by a balanced homodyne detection with a local
oscillator of very short duration compared to the SPOPO pulse length.
