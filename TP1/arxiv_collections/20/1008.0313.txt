It seems to be a widely accepted opinion that the types of accretion disks
(or flows) generally realized in the nuclei of radio galaxies and in further
lower mass-accretion rate nuclei are inner, hot, optically thin, radiatively
inefficient accretion flows (RIAFs) surrounded by outer, cool, optically thick,
standard type accretion disks. However, observational evidence for the
existence of such outer cool disks in these nuclei is rather poor. Instead,
recent observations sometimes suggest the existence of inner cool disks of
non-standard type, which develop in the region very close to their central
black holes. Taking NGC 4261 as a typical example of such light eating nuclei,
for which both flux data ranging from radio to X-ray and data for the
counterjet occultation are available, we examine the plausibility of such a
picture for the accretion states as mentioned above, based on model
predictions. It is shown that the explanation of the gap seen in the counterjet
emission in terms of the free-free absorption by an outer standard disk is
unrealistic, and moreover, the existence itself of such an outer standard disk
seems very implausible. Instead, the model of RIAF in an ordered magnetic field
(so called resistive RIAF model) can well serve to explain the emission gap in
terms of the synchrotron absorption, as well as to reproduce the observed
features of the overall spectral energy distribution (SED). This model also
predicts that the RIAF state starts directly from an interstellar hot gas phase
at around the Bondi radius and terminates at the inner edge whose radius is
about 100 times the Schwartzschild radii. Therefore, there is a good
possibility for a cool disk to develop within this innermost region.
