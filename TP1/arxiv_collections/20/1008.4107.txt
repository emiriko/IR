With an expected ten-fold increase in luminosity in S-LHC, the radiation
environment in the tracker volumes will be considerably harsher for
silicon-based detectors than the already harsh LHC environment. Since 2006, a
group of CMS institutes, using a modified CMS DAQ system, has been exploring
the use of Magnetic Czochralski silicon as a detector element for the strip
tracker layers in S-LHC experiments. Both p+/n-/n+ and n+/p-/p+ sensors have
been characterized, irradiated with proton and neutron sources, assembled into
modules, and tested in a CERN beamline. There have been three beam studies to
date and results from these suggest that both p+/n-/n+ and n+/p-/p+ Magnetic
Czochralski silicon are sufficiently radiation hard for the $R>25$ cm regions
of S-LHC tracker volumes. The group has also explored the use of forward
biasing for heavily irradiated detectors, and although this mode requires
sensor temperatures less than -50\,$^\circ$C, the charge collection efficiency
appears to be promising.
