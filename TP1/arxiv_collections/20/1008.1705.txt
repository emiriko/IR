We study the classical and quantum dynamics of periodically kicked particles
placed initially within an open double-barrier structure. This system does not
obey the Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM) theorem and displays chaotic dynamics.
The phase space features induced by non-KAM nature of the system leads to
dynamical features such as the non-equilibrium steady state, classically
induced saturation of energy growth and momentum filtering. We also comment on
the experimental feasibility of this system as well as its relevance in the
context of current interest in classically induced localization and chaotic
ratchets.
