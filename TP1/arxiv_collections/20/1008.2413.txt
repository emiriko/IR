Quantum measurement problem is still unconsensus since it has existed many
years and inspired a large of literature in physics and philosophy. We show it
can be subsumed into the quantum theory if we extend the Feynman path integral
by considering the relativistic effect of Feynman paths. According to this
extended theory, we deduce not only the Klein-Gordon equation, but also the
wave-function-collapse equation. It is showing that the stochastic and
instantaneous collapse of the quantum measurement is due to the "potential
noise" of the apparatus or environment and "inner correlation" of wave function
respectively. Therefore, the definite-status of the macroscopic matter is due
to itself and this does not disobey the quantum mechanics. This work will give
a new recognition for the measurement problem.
