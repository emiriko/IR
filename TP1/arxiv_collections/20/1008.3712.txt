An unexpected feature of Titan's atmosphere is the strong depletion in
primordial noble gases revealed by the Gas Chromatograph Mass Spectrometer
aboard the Huygens probe during its descent on 2005 January 14. Although
several plausible explanations have already been formulated, no definitive
response to this issue has been yet found. Here, we investigate the possible
sequestration of these noble gases in the liquid contained in lakes and wet
terrains on Titan and the consequences for their atmospheric abundances.
Considering the atmosphere and the liquid existing on the soil as a whole
system, we compute the abundance of each noble gas relative to nitrogen. To do
so, we make the assumption of thermodynamic equilibrium between the liquid and
the atmosphere, the abundances of the different constituents being determined
via {\bf } regular solution theory. We find that xenon's atmospheric depletion
can be explained by its dissolution at ambient temperature in the liquid
presumably present on Titan's soil. In the cases of argon and krypton, we find
that the fractions incorporated in the liquid are negligible, implying that an
alternative mechanism must be invoked to explain their atmospheric depletion.
