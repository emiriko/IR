Despite the tremendous success of BitTorrent, its swarming system suffers
from a fundamental limitation: lower or no availability of unpopular contents.
Recently, Menasche et al. has shown that bundling is a promising solution to
mitigate this availability problem; it improves the availability and reduces
download times for unpopular contents by combining multiple files into a single
swarm. There also have been studies on bundling strategies and performance
issues in bundled swarms. In spite of the recent surge of interest in the
benefits of and strategies for bundling, there are still little empirical
grounding for understanding, describing, and modeling it. This is the first
empirical study that measures and analyzes how prevalent contents bundling is
in BitTorrent and how peers access the bundled contents, in comparison to the
other non-bundled (i.e., single-filed) ones. To our surprise, we found that
around 70% of BitTorrent swarms contain multiple files, which indicate that
bundling has become widespread for contents sharing. We also show that the
amount of bytes shared in bundled swarms is estimated to be around 85% out of
all the BitTorrent contents logged in our datasets. Inspired from our findings,
we raise and discuss three important research questions in the field of file
sharing systems as well as future contents-oriented networking: i) bundling
strategies, ii) bundling-aware sharing systems in BitTorrent, and iii)
implications on content-oriented networking.
