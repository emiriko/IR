We compute the equilibrium crystal structure and phase stability of iron at
the alpha(bcc)-gamma(fcc) phase transition as a function of temperature, by
employing a combination of ab initio methods for calculating electronic band
structures and dynamical mean-field theory. The magnetic correlation energy is
found to be an essential driving force behind the alpha-gamma structural phase
transition in paramagnetic iron.
