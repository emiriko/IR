Renewal-anomalous-heterogeneous files are solved. A simple file is made of
Brownian hard spheres that diffuse stochastically in an effective 1D channel.
Generally, Brownian files are heterogeneous: the spheres' diffusion
coefficients are distributed and the initial spheres' density is non-uniform.
In renewal-anomalous files, the distribution of waiting times for individual
jumps is exponential as in Brownian files, yet obeys: {\psi}_{\alpha}
(t)~t^(-1-{\alpha}), 0<{\alpha}<1. The file is renewal as all the particles
attempt to jump at the same time. It is shown that the mean square displacement
(MSD) in a renewal-anomalous-heterogeneous file, <r^2>, obeys,
<r^2>~[<r^2>_{nrml}]^{\alpha}, where <r^2 >_{nrml} is the MSD in the
corresponding Brownian file. This scaling is an outcome of an exact relation
(derived here) connecting probability density functions of Brownian files and
renewal-anomalous files. It is also shown that non-renewal-anomalous files are
slower than the corresponding renewal ones.
