We derive the density functional for the ground-state energy of a
two-dimensional, spin-polarized gas of neutral fermionic atoms with
magnetic-dipole interaction, in the Thomas-Fermi-Dirac approximation. For many
atoms in a harmonic trap, we give analytical solutions for the single-particle
spatial density and the ground-state energy, in dependence on the interaction
strength, and we discuss the weak-interaction limit that is relevant for
experiments. We then lift the restriction of full spin polarization and account
for a time-independent inhomogeneous external magnetic field. The field
strength necessary to ensure full spin polarization is derived.
