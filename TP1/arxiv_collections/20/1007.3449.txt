Plasma kinetics of molecular hydrogen in the electrical discharge in
Ar/CH3OH/H2O mixture is theoretically investigated for the first time. It is
researched the dependence of [H2] on the breakdown field, the discharge power,
solution compound and the argon pumping rate through the interelectrode gap.
The highest hydrogen concentration is reached with the 20% methanol fraction in
the solution. It is shown that [H2] grows as the linear function of the
discharge power and decreases with the gas volume velocity increase.
