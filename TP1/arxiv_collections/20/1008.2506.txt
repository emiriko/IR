We construct an SU(4) spectral divisor and its factorization of types (3,1)
and (2,2) based on the construction proposed in [1]. We calculate the chiral
spectra of flipped SU(5) GUTs by using the spectral divisor construction. The
results agree with those from the analysis of semi-local spectral covers. Our
computations provide an example for the validity of the spectral divisor
construction and suggest that the standard heterotic formulae are applicable to
the case of F-theory on an elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau fourfold with no
heterotic dual.
