Tunneling conductance of a clean normal metal/d-wave superconductor junction
is studied by using the extended Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk formalism. We show
that the conductance is significantly affected by the interface spin-orbit
coupling of the Rashba type, which is inevitably present due to the asymmetry
of the junction.
