We present a new software pipeline -- PyMorph -- for automated estimation of
structural parameters of galaxies. Both parametric fits through a two
dimensional bulge disk decomposition as well as structural parameter
measurements like concentration, asymmetry etc. are supported. The pipeline is
designed to be easy to use yet flexible; individual software modules can be
replaced with ease. A find-and-fit mode is available so that all galaxies in a
image can be measured with a simple command. A parallel version of the Pymorph
pipeline runs on computer clusters and a Virtual Observatory compatible web
enabled interface is under development.
