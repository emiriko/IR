We report on a narrow linewidth laser diode system that is stabilized using
both optical and electronic feedback to a spectral hole in cryogenic Tm:YAG.
The laser system exhibits very low phase noise. The spectrum of the beat signal
between two lasers, over millisecond timescales, is either Fourier limited or
limited by the -111dBc/Hz noise floor. The resulting laser is well suited to
quantum optics and sensing applications involving rare earth ion dopants.
