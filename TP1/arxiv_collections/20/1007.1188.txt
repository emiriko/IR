Using a multi-resolution technique, we analyze large in-plane fracture fronts
moving slowly between two sintered Plexiglas plates. We find that the roughness
of the front exhibits two distinct regimes separated by a crossover length
scale $\delta^*$. Below $\delta^*$, we observe a multi-affine regime and the
measured roughness exponent $\zeta_{\parallel}^{-} = 0.60\pm 0.05$ is in
agreement with the coalescence model. Above $\delta^*$, the fronts are
mono-affine, characterized by a roughness exponent $\zeta_{\parallel}^{+} =
0.35\pm0.05$, consistent with the fluctuating line model. We relate the
crossover length scale to fluctuations in fracture toughness and the stress
intensity factor.
