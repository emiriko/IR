A key result of hydrogravitational dynamics cosmology relevant to
astrobiology is the early formation of vast numbers of hot primordial-gas
planets in million-solar-mass clumps as the dark matter of galaxies and the
hosts of first life. Photon viscous forces in the expanding universe of the
turbulent big bang prevent fragmentations of the plasma for mass scales smaller
than protogalaxies. At the plasma to gas transition 300,000 years after the big
bang, the 10^7 decrease in kinematic viscosity {\nu} explains why ~3x10^7
planets are observed to exist per star in typical galaxies like the Milky Way,
not eight or nine. Stars form by a binary accretional cascade from Earth-mass
primordial planets to progressively larger masses that collect and recycle the
stardust chemicals of life produced when stars overeat and explode. The
astonishing complexity of molecular biology observed on Earth is possible to
explain only if enormous numbers of primordial planets and their fragments have
hosted the formation and wide scattering of the seeds of life virtually from
the beginning of time. Geochemical and biological evidence suggests that life
on Earth appears at the earliest moment it can survive, in highly evolved forms
with complexity requiring a time scale in excess of the age of the galaxy. This
is quite impossible within standard cold-dark-matter cosmology where planets
are relatively recent, rare and cold, completely lacking mechanisms for
intergalactic transport of life forms.
