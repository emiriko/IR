Low-temperature thermodynamics of the classical frustrated ferromagnetic spin
chain is studied. Using transfer-matrix method we found the behavior of the
correlation function and zero-field susceptibility at the ferromagnetic-helical
transition point. It is shown that the critical exponent for the susceptibility
is changed from 2 to 4/3 at the transition point.
