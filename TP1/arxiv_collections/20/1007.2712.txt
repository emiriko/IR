We have developed a Multi-Pixel Photon Counter (MPPC) for the neutrino
detectors of T2K experiment. About 64,000 MPPCs have been produced and tested
in about a year. In order to characterize a large number of MPPCs, we have
developed a system that simultaneously measures 64 MPPCs with various bias
voltage and temperature. The performance of MPPCs are found to satisfy the
requirement of T2K experiment. In this paper, we present the performance of
17,686 MPPCs measured at Kyoto University.
