Muon spin rotation and relaxation measurements have been carried out on the
unconventional antiferromagnet Yb_3Pt_4. Oscillations are observed below T_N =
2.22(1) K, consistent with the antiferromagnetic (AFM) Neel temperature
observed in bulk experiments. In agreement with neutron diffraction experiments
the oscillation frequency omega_ mu(T) follows a S = 1/2 mean-field temperature
dependence, yielding a quasistatic local field 1.71(2) kOe at T = 0. A crude
estimate gives an ordered moment of ~0.66 mu_B at T = 0, comparable to 0.81
mu_B from neutron diffraction. As T approaches T_N from above the dynamic
relaxation rate lambda_d exhibits no critical slowing down, consistent with a
mean-field transition. In the AFM phase a T-linear fit to lambda_d(T),
appropriate to a Fermi liquid, yields highly enhanced values of lambda_d/T and
the Korringa constant K_ mu^2 T/lambda_d, with K_ mu the estimated muon Knight
shift. A strong suppression of lambda_d by applied field is observed in the AFM
phase. These properties are consistent with the observed large
Sommerfeld-Wilson and Kadowaki-Woods ratios in Yb_3Pt_4 (although the data do
not discriminate between Fermi-liquid and non-Fermi-liquid states), and suggest
strong enhancement of q ~ 0 spin correlations between large-Fermi-volume band
quasiparticles in the AFM phase of Yb_3Pt_4.
