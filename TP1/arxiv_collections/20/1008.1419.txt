The fearures of the correlation method used in time-of-flight spectrometry of
ultracold neutrons are analyzed. The time-of-flight spectrometer for the energy
range of ultracold neutrons is described, and results of its testing by
measuring spectra of neutrons passing through interference filters are
presented.
