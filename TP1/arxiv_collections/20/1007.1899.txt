We investigate imaging of the spatial spin distribution of atoms in optical
lattices using non-resonant light scattering. We demonstrate how scattering
spatially correlated light from the atoms can result in spin state images with
enhanced spatial resolution. Furthermore, we show how using spatially
correlated light can lead to direct measurement of the spatial correlations of
the atomic spin distribution.
