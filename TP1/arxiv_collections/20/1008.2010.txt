We present a thorough $^{77}$Se NMR study of a single crystal of the
magnetoelectric compound Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$. The temperature dependence of the
local electronic moments extracted from the NMR data is fully consistent with a
magnetic phase transition from the high-T paramagnetic phase to a low-T
ferrimagnetic state with 3/4 of the Cu$^{2+}$ ions aligned parallel and 1/4
aligned antiparallel to the applied field of 14.09 T. The transition to this
3up-1down magnetic state is not accompanied by any splitting of the NMR lines
or any abrupt modification in their broadening, hence there is no observable
reduction of the crystalline symmetry from its high-T cubic \textit{P}2$_1$3
space group. These results are in agreement with high resolution x-ray
diffraction and magnetization data on powder samples reported previously by Bos
{\it et al.} [Phys. Rev. B, {\bf 78}, 094416 (2008)]. We also develop a mean
field theory description of the problem based on a microscopic spin Hamiltonian
with one antiferromagnetic ($J_\text{afm}\simeq 68$ K) and one ferromagnetic
($J_\text{fm}\simeq -50$ K) nearest-neighbor exchange interaction.
