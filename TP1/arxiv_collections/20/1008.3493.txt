Measurements of the cross sections for charged current deep inelastic
scattering in e+p collisions with a longitudinally polarised positron beam are
presented. The measurements are based on a data sample with an integrated
luminosity of 132 pb^-1 collected with the ZEUS detector at HERA at a
centre-of-mass energy of 318 GeV. The total cross section is presented at
positive and negative values of the longitudinal polarisation of the positron
beams. The single-differential cross-sections ds/dQ^2, ds/dx and ds/dy are
presented for Q^2 > 200 GeV^2. The reduced cross-section is presented in the
kinematic range 200 < Q^2 < 60,000 GeV^2 and 0.006 < x < 0.562. The
measurements agree well with the predictions of the Standard Model. The results
are used to determine a lower limit on the mass of a hypothetical right-handed
W boson.
