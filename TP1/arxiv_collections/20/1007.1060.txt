The Brans-Dicke model with a variable cosmological term ($BD\Lambda$) has
been investigated with use of the coupling constant of $\omega=10^4$.
Parameters inherent in this model are constrained from comparison between Big
Bang nucleosynthesis and the observed abundances. Furthermore, the magnitude
redshift ($m-z$) relations are studied for $BD\Lambda$ with and without another
constant cosmological term in a flat universe. Observational data of Type Ia
Supernovae are used in the redshift range of $0.01<z<2$. It is found that our
model with energy density of the constant cosmological term with the value of
0.7 can explain the SNIa observations, though the model parameters are
insensitive to the $m-z$ relation.
