We consider a class of linear differential operators acting on vector-valued
function spaces with general coupled boundary conditions. Unlike in the more
usual case of so-called quantum graphs, the boundary conditions can be
nonlinear. After introducing a suitable Lyapunov function we prove
well-posedness and invariance results for the corresponding nonlinear diffusion
problem.
