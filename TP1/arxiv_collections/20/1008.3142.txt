We examine the non-exit probability of a multidimensional Brownian motion
from a growing truncated Weyl chamber. Different regimes are identified
according to the growth speed, ranging from polynomial decay over
stretched-exponential to exponential decay. Furthermore we derive associated
large deviation principles for the empirical measure of the properly rescaled
and transformed Brownian motion as the dimension grows to infinity. Our main
tool is an explicit eigenvalue expansion for the transition probabilities
before exiting the truncated Weyl chamber.
