In neuroimaging, a large number of correlated tests are routinely performed
to detect active voxels in single-subject experiments or to detect regions that
differ between individuals belonging to different groups. In order to bound the
probability of a false discovery of pair-wise differences, a Bonferroni or
other correction for multiplicity is necessary. These corrections greatly
reduce the power of the comparisons which means that small signals
(differences) remain hidden and therefore have been more or less successful
depending on the application. We introduce a method that improves the power of
a family of correlated statistical tests by reducing their number in an orderly
fashion using our a-priori understanding of the problem . The tests are grouped
by blocks that respect the data structure and only one or a few tests per group
are performed. For each block we construct an appropriate summary statistic
that characterizes a meaningful feature of the block. The comparisons are based
on these summary statistics by a block-wise approach. We contrast this method
with the one based on the individual measures in terms of power. Finally, we
apply the method to compare brain connectivity matrices. Although the method is
used in this study on the particular case of imaging, the proposed strategy can
be applied to a large variety of problems that involves multiple comparisons
when the tests can be grouped according to attributes that depend on the
specific problem. Keywords and phrases: Multiple comparisons ; Family-wise
