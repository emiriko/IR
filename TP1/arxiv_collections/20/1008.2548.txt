We show that quasi-long-range (QLR) pair correlations that decay
asymptotically with scaling $r^{-(d+1)}$ in $d$-dimensional Euclidean space
$\mathbb{R}^d$, trademarks of certain quantum systems and cosmological
structures, are a universal signature of maximally random jammed (MRJ)
hard-particle packings. We introduce a novel hyperuniformity descriptor in MRJ
packings by studying local-volume-fraction fluctuations and show that
infinite-wavelength fluctuations vanish even for packings with size- and
shape-distributions. Special void statistics induce hyperuniformity and QLR
pair correlations.
