The BPS bound is formulated in light-cone superspace for the N = 4
superYang-Mills theory. As a consequence of the superalgebra all momenta are
shown to be expressed as a quadratic form in the relevant supertransformations,
and these forms are used to derive the light-cone superspace BPS equations.
Finally, the superfield expressions are expanded out to component form, and the
Wu-Yang Monopole boosted to the infinite momentum frame is shown to be a
solution.
