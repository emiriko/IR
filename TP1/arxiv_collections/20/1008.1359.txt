It is shown that the nucleotide sequences in DNA molecules have
cluster-scaling properties (discovered for the first time in turbulent
processes: Sreenivasan and Bershadskii, 2006, J. Stat. Phys., 125, 1141-1153.).
These properties are relevant to both types of nucleotide pair-bases
interactions: hydrogen bonds and stacking interactions. It is shown that taking
into account the cluster-scaling properties can help to improve heterogeneous
models of the DNA dynamics. Two human genes: BRCA2 and NRXN1, have been
considered as examples.
