The paper deals with "quantization" and "second quantization" of
phenomenological thermodynamics with respect to the Boltzmann's constant. It is
suggested to perceive the quasithermodynamic parameter (corresponding to the
Boltzmann's constant) as a mathematical analogue of the semiclassical parameter
(corresponding to the Planck's constant), and to introduce a new concept of a
"thermocorpuscle" (a thermodynamic analogue of a particle where the coordinates
are replaced by the nonequilibrium thermodynamic forces and the momenta are
replaced by the corresponding flows). The semiclassical quantization of
phenomenological thermodynamic Lagrangian manifolds yields a new system of
equations for the quasithermodynamic fluctuations along a curve of evolution of
a nonequilibrium physical system. This leads to a quasithermodynamic analogue
of Bell's inequalities and their violation is a new effect that can be tested
experimentally. The generating function of the quasithermodynamic fluctuations
(the nonequilibrium analogue of a partition function) is interpreted as an
expectation value of a second quantized operator expressed via the density of
thermocorpuscles. An analogue of the BBGKY chain of equations defines a
deformation of the fluctuations by an interaction between the thermocorpuscles.
In place of an interaction parameter in mechanics (the "external" Planck's
constant), one introduces the "external" Boltzmann's constant for an asymptotic
expansion of the thermodynamic collision integral.
