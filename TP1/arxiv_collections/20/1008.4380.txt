In this paper we show that a recent hydrodynamical model of superfluid
turbulence describes vortex density waves and their effects on the speed of
high-frequency second sound. In this frequency regime, the vortex dynamics is
not purely diffusive, as for low frequencies, but exhibits ondulatory features,
whose influence on the second sound is here explored.
