We present six new transits of the hot Jupiter OGLE-TR-113b observed with
MagIC on the Magellan Telescopes between January 2007 and May 2009. We update
the system parameters and revise the planetary radius to R_p=1.084 pm 0.029
R_J, where the error is dominated by stellar radius uncertainties. The new
transit midtimes reveal no transit timing variations from a constant ephemeris
of greater than 13 pm 28 seconds over two years, placing an upper limit of 1-2
M_Earth on the mass of any perturber in a 1:2 or 2:1 mean-motion resonance with
OGLE-TR-113b. Combining the new transit epochs with five epochs published
between 2002 and 2006, we find hints that the orbital period of the planet may
not be constant, with the best fit indicating a decrease of dP/dt=-60 pm 15
milliseconds per year. If real, this change in period could result from either
a long-period (more than 8 years) timing variation due to a massive external
perturber, or more intriguingly from the orbital decay of the planet. The
detection of a changing period is still tentative and requires additional
observations, but if confirmed it would enable direct tests of tidal stability
and dynamical models of close-in planets.
