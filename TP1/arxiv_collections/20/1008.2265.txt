We study the conductivity of a graphene strip taking into account
electrostatically-induced charge accumulation on its edges. Using a local
dependency of the conductivity on the carrier concentration we find that the
electrostatic size effect in doped graphene strip of the width of 0.5 - 3 $%
\mu $m can result in a significant (about 40%) enhancement of the effective
conductivity in comparison to the infinitely wide samples. This effect should
be taken into account both in the device simulation as well as for verification
of scattering mechanisms in graphene.
