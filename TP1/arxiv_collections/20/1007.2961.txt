We present Lya luminosity function (LF), clustering measurements, and Lya
line profiles based on the largest sample, to date, of 207 Lya emitters (LAEs)
at z=6.6 on the 1-deg^2 sky of Subaru/XMM-Newton Deep Survey (SXDS) field. Our
z=6.6 Lya LF including cosmic variance estimates yields the best-fit Schechter
parameters of phi*=8.5 +3.0/-2.2 x10^(-4) Mpc^(-3) and L*(Lya)=4.4 +/-0.6
x10^42 erg s^(-1) with a fixed alpha=-1.5, and indicates a decrease from z=5.7
at the >~90% confidence level. However, this decrease is not large, only =~30%
in Lya luminosity, which is too small to be identified in the previous studies.
A clustering signal of z=6.6 LAEs is detected for the first time. We obtain the
correlation length of r_0=2-5 h^(-1) Mpc and bias of b=3-6, and find no
significant boost of clustering amplitude by reionization at z=6.6. The average
hosting dark halo mass inferred from clustering is 10^10-10^11 Mo, and duty
cycle of LAE population is roughly ~1% albeit with large uncertainties. The
average of our high-quality Keck/DEIMOS spectra shows an FWHM velocity width of
251 +/-16 km s^(-1). We find no large evolution of Lya line profile from z=5.7
to 6.6, and no anti-correlation between Lya luminosity and line width at z=6.6.
The combination of various reionization models and our observational results
about the LF, clustering, and line profile indicates that there would exist a
small decrease of IGM's Lya transmission owing to reionization, but that the
hydrogen IGM is not highly neutral at z=6.6. Our neutral-hydrogen fraction
constraint implies that the major reionization process took place at z>~7.
