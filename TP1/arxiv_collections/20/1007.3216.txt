In the high-transition-temperature (high-Tc) superconductors the pseudogap
phase becomes predominant when the density of doped holes is reduced1. Within
this phase it has been unclear which electronic symmetries (if any) are broken,
what the identity of any associated order parameter might be, and which
microscopic electronic degrees of freedom are active. Here we report the
determination of a quantitative order parameter representing intra-unit-cell
nematicity: the breaking of rotational symmetry by the electronic structure
within CuO2 unit cell. We analyze spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunneling
microscope images of the intra-unit-cell states in underdoped
Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+{\delta} and, using two independent evaluation techniques, find
evidence for electronic nematicity of the states close to the pseudogap energy.
Moreover, we demonstrate directly that these phenomena arise from electronic
differences at the two oxygen sites within each unit cell. If the
characteristics of the pseudogap seen here and by other techniques all have the
same microscopic origin, this phase involves weak magnetic states at the O
sites that break 90o -rotational symmetry within every CuO2 unit cell.
