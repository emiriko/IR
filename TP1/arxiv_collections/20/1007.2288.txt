In this talk we cover two threads regarding the 4th generation: on CP
violation, from Earth up to the Heavens, i.e. from accelerator-based
experimental studies, towards baryon asymmetry of the Universe; and on direct
search bounds on $m_{t'}$ and $m_{b'}$, towards the possibility of electroweak
symmetry breaking through large Yukawa couplings. Prospects and discussions are
presented.
