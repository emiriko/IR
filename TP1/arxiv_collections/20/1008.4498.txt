I discuss a few selected topics related to the reconstruction of the mass of
the top quark at hadron colliders. In particular, the relation between the
measured top mass and theoretical definitions, such as the pole or MSbar mass,
is debated. I will also summarize recent studies on the Monte Carlo uncertainty
due to the fragmentation of bottom quarks in top decays.
