We propose a procedure to fully reconstruct the time-dependent coefficients
of convolutionless non-Markovian dissipative generators via a finite number of
experimental measurements. By combining a tomography based approach with a
proper data sampling, our proposal allows to relate the time-dependent
coefficients governing the dissipative evolution of a quantum system to
experimentally accessible quantities. The proposed scheme not only provides a
way to retrieve full information about potentially unknown dissipative
coefficients but also, most valuably, can be employed as a reliable consistency
test for the approximations involved in the theoretical derivation of a given
non-Markovian convolutionless master equation.
