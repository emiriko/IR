With a spectral type of T10, UGPS J072227.51-054031.2 is one of the coolest
objects known to date in the solar neighborhood. Multiple systems are
relatively common among early and mid-T dwarfs. We search for faint and close
companions around UGPSJ072227.51-054031.2. We have obtained high spatial
resolution images in the H and Ks bands using adaptive optics at the Very Large
Telescope. With a Strehl ratio in the range 10-15%, the final images allow us
to rule out the presence of a companion brighter than H<19.4mag at separation
larger than 50mas, and H<21.4mag at separation larger than 0.1".
