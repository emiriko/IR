We study a model for two lasers that are mutually coupled opto-electronically
by modulating the pump of one laser with the intensity deviations from the
steady-state output of the other. Such a model is analogous to the equations
describing the spread of certain diseases such as dengue epidemics in human
populations coupled by migration, transportation, etc. In this report we
consider the possibility of both in-phase (complete) and anti-phase (inverse)
synchronization between the above-mentioned laser models. Depending on the
coupling rates between the systems a transition from the in-phase (complete)
synchronization to the anti-phase (inverse) synchronization might occur. The
results are important for the disruption of the spread of the certain
infectious diseases in human populations.
