The statistics of records for a time series generated by a continuous time
random walk is studied, and found to be independent of the details of the jump
length distribution, as long as the latter is continuous and symmetric.
However, the statistics depend crucially on the nature of the waiting time
distribution. The probability of finding M records within a given time duration
t, for large t, has a scaling form, and the exact scaling function is obtained
in terms of the one-sided Levy stable law. The mean of the ages of the records,
defined as <t/M>, differs from t/<M>. The asymptotic behaviour of the shortest
and the longest ages of the records are also studied.
