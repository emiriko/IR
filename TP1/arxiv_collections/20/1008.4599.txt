The more massive counterparts of T Tauri stars, Herbig Ae/Be stars, are known
to vary in a complex way with no variability mechanism clearly identified. We
attempt to characterize the optical variability of HD~37806 (MWC 120) on time
scales ranging between minutes and several years. A continuous, one-minute
resolution, 21 day-long sequence of MOST (Microvariability & Oscillations of
STars) satellite observations has been analyzed using wavelet, scalegram and
dispersion analysis tools. The MOST data have been augmented by sparse
observations over 9 seasons from ASAS (All Sky Automated Survey), by previously
non-analyzed ESO (European Southern Observatory) data partly covering 3 seasons
and by archival measurements dating back half a century ago. Mutually
superimposed flares or accretion instabilities grow in size from about 0.0003
of the mean flux on a time scale of minutes to a peak-to-peak range of <~0.05
on a time scale of a few years. The resulting variability has properties of
stochastic "red" noise, whose self-similar characteristics are very similar to
those observed in cataclysmic binary stars, but with much longer characteristic
time scales of hours to days (rather than minutes) and with amplitudes which
appear to cease growing in size on time scales of tens of years. In addition to
chaotic brightness variations combined with stochastic noise, the MOST data
show a weakly defined cyclic signal with a period of about 1.5 days, which may
correspond to the rotation of the star.
