The two main components of the closest star system, {\alpha}-Centauri AB(RA
14h39m, Dec-60o50', J2000.0) is indubitbaly one of the most studied visual
double stars. This paper presents the results of our recalculation of orbital
and physical parameters of the system using Thiele-van den Bos method, based on
observational data from year 1900 to 2002. Despite some significant
discrepancies, in general our results confirmed previous results of orbital
parameter determinations using different method.
