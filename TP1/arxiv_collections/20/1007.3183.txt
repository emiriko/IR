We present a non-null annotations inferencer for the Java bytecode language.
We previously proposed an analysis to infer non-null annotations and proved it
soundness and completeness with respect to a state of the art type system. This
paper proposes extensions to our former analysis in order to deal with the Java
bytecode language. We have implemented both analyses and compared their
behaviour on several benchmarks. The results show a substantial improvement in
the precision and, despite being a whole-program analysis, production
applications can be analyzed within minutes.
