We wish to study an application of Stueckelberg's relativistic quantum theory
in the framework of general relativity. We study the form of the wave equation
of a massive body in the presence of a Schwarzschild gravitational field. We
treat the mathematical behavior of the wavefunction also around and beyond the
horizon (r=2M). Classically, within the horizon, the time component of the
metric becomes spacelike and distance from the origin singularity becomes
timelike, suggesting an inevitable propagation of all matter within the horizon
to a total collapse at r=0. However, the quantum description of the wave
function provides a different understanding of the behavior of matter within
the horizon. We find that a test particle can almost never be found at the
origin and is more probable to be found at the horizon. Matter outside the
horizon has a very small wave length and therefore interference effects can be
found only on a very small atomic scale. However, within the horizon, matter
becomes totally "tachionic" and is potentially "spread" over all space. Small
location uncertainties on the atomic scale become large around the horizon, and
different mass components of the wave function can therefore interfere on a
stellar scale. This interference phenomenon, where the probability of finding
matter decreases as a function of the distance from the horizon, appears as an
effective gravitational repulsion.
