The CALICE Collaboration is developing and commissioning a technological
prototype of a hadronic sandwich calorimeter with approximately 2500
scintillating plates, individually read out by multi-pixel silicon
photomultipliers. The new prototype for the AHCAL aims to demonstrate the
feasibility to build a calorimeter with fully integrated electronics meeting
the constraints of a real detector for the International Linear Collider. The
concept of the prototype, as well as the first results obtained in the on going
test-beam campaign at DESY are reported here.
