We analyze a model of active Brownian particles with non-linear friction and
velocity coupling in one spatial dimension. The model exhibits two modes of
motion observed in biological swarms: A disordered phase with vanishing mean
velocity and an ordered phase with finite mean velocity. Starting from the
microscopic Langevin equations, we derive mean-field equations of the
collective dynamics. We identify the fixed points of the mean-field equations
corresponding to the two modes and analyze their stability with respect to the
model parameters. Finally, we compare our analytical findings with numerical
simulations of the microscopic model.
