Using Monte Carlo simulations, we determine the phase diagram of a diffusive
two-temperature XY model. When the two temperatures are equal the system
becomes the equilibrium XY model with the continuous Kosterlitz-Thouless (KT)
vortex-antivortex unbinding phase transition. When the two temperatures are
unequal the system is driven by an energy flow through the system from the
higher temperature heat-bath to the lower temperature one and reaches a
far-from-equilibrium steady state. We show that the nonequilibrium phase
diagram contains three phases: A homogenous disordered phase and two phases
with long range, spin-wave order. Two critical lines, representing continuous
phase transitions from a homogenous disordered phase to two phases of long
range order, meet at the equilibrium the KT point. The shape of the
nonequilibrium critical lines as they approach the KT point is described by a
crossover exponent of phi = 2.52 \pm 0.05. Finally, we suggest that the
transition between the two phases with long-range order is first-order, making
the KT-point where all three phases meet a bicritical point.
