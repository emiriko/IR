Discussing the recent MINOS data on muon anti-neutrino disappearance and the
MiniBooNE data on muon anti-neutrino to electron anti-neutrino oscillation, we
show that the while the respective best fits are inconsistent with each other,
significant overlap of allowed regions does exist. Assuming only three neutrino
species, the data indicates a discrepancy of mass levels and mixing angles
between the neutrino and the antineutrino sectors. We show that the existing
data can be reconciled with a model of explicit CPT violation in the neutrino
sector and estimate the magnitude of the required violation.
