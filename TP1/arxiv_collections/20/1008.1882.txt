We investigate the low-temperature magneto-transport properties of individual
Ge/Si core/shell nanowires. Negative magneto-conductance was observed, which is
a signature of one-dimensional weak antilocalization of holes in the presence
of strong spin-orbit coupling. The temperature and back gate dependences of
phase coherence length, spin-orbit relaxation time, and background conductance
were studied. Specifically, we show the spin-orbit coupling strength can be
modulated by more than five folds with an external electric field. These
results suggest the Ge/Si nanowire system possesses strong and tunable
spin-orbit interactions and may serve as a candidate for spintronics
applications.
