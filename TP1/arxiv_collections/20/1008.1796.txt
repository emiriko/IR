A light Higgs boson is preferred by $M_W$ and $m_t$ measurements. A complex
scalar singlet addition to the Standard Model allows a better fit to these
measurements through a new light singlet dominated state. It then predicts a
light Dark Matter (DM) particle that can explain the signals of DM scattering
from nuclei in the CoGeNT and DAMA/LIBRA experiments. Annihilations of this DM
in the galactic halo, $AA\rightarrow b\bar{b}, c\bar{c}, \tau^+\tau^-$, lead to
gamma rays that naturally improve a fit to the Fermi Large Area Telescope data
in the central galactic regions. The associated light neutral Higgs boson may
also be discovered at the Large Hadron Collider.
