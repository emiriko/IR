In this paper I determine the general form of the physical and mathematical
restrictions that arise on the interactions of gravity and scalar fields in the
2T field theory setting, in d+2 dimensions, as well as in the emerging shadows
in d dimensions. These constraints on scalar fields follow from an underlying
Sp(2,R) gauge symmetry in phase space. Determining these general constraints
provides a basis for the construction of 2T supergravity, as well as physical
applications in 1T-field theory, that are discussed briefly here, and more
detail elsewhere. In particular, no scale models that lead to a vanishing
cosmological constant at the classical level emerge naturally in this setting.
