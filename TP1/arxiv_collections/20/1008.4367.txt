Supernova remnants are thought to be the dominant source of Galactic cosmic
rays. This requires that at least 5% of the available energy is transferred to
cosmic rays, implying a high cosmic-ray pressure downstream of supernova
remnant shocks. Recently, it has been shown that the downstream temperature in
some remnants is low compared to the measured shock velocities, implying that
additional pressure support by accelerated particles is present.
  Here we use a two-fluid thermodynamic approach to derive the relation between
post-shock fractional cosmic-ray pressure and post-shock temperature, assuming
no additional heating beyond adiabatic heating in the shock precursor and with
all non-adiabatic heating occurring at the subshock. The derived relations show
that a high fractional cosmic-ray pressure is only possible, if a substantial
fraction of the incoming energy flux escapes from the system. Recently a shock
velocity and a downstream proton temperature were measured for a shock in the
supernova remnant RCW 86. We apply the two-fluid solutions to these
measurements and find that the the downstream fractional cosmic-ray pressure is
at least 50% with a cosmic-ray energy flux escape of at least 20%. In general,
in order to have 5% of the supernova energy go into accelerating cosmic rays,
on average the post-shock cosmic-ray pressure needs to be 30% for an effective
cosmic-ray adiabatic index of 4/3.
