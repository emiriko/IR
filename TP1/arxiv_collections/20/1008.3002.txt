All current techniques for showing that a number field has an infinite
p-class field tower depend on one of various forms of the Golod-Shafarevich
inequality. Such techniques can also be used to restrict the types of p-groups
which can occur as Galois groups of finite p-class field towers. In the case
that the base field is a quadratic imaginary number field, the theory
culminates in showing that a finite such group must be of one of three possible
presentation types. By keeping track of the error terms arising in standard
proofs of Golod-Shafarevich type inequalities, we prove a Golod-Shafarevich
equality for analytic pro-p-groups. As an application, we further work of
Skopin, showing that groups of the third of the three types mentioned above are
necessarily tremendously large.
