We study the non-Markovian entanglement dynamics of two qubits in a common
squeezed bath. We see remarkable difference between the non-Markovian
entanglement dynamics with its Markovian counterpart. We show that a
non-Markovian decoherence free state is also decoherence free in the Markovian
regime, but all the Markovian decoherence free states are not necessarily
decoherence free in the non-Markovian domain. We extend our calculation from
squeezed vacuum bath to squeezed thermal bath, where we see the effect of
finite bath temperatures on the entanglement dynamics.
