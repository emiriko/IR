In this paper we perform the 1/N expansion of the colored three dimensional
Boulatov tensor model. As in matrix models, we obtain a systematic topological
expansion, with more and more complicated topologies suppressed by higher and
higher powers of N. We compute the first orders of the expansion and prove that
only graphs corresponding to three spheres S^3 contribute to the leading order
in the large N limit.
