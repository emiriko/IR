The Yao-Yao partition theorem states that given a probability measure on an
affine space of dimension n having a density which is continuous and bounded
away from 0, it is possible to partition the space into 2^n regions of equal
measure in such a way that every affine hyperplane avoids at least one of the
regions. We give a constructive proof of this result and extend it to slightly
more general measures.
