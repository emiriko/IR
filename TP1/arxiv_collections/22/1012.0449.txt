We present a panchromatic study of luminosity functions (LFs) and stellar
mass functions (SMFs) of galaxies in the core of the Shapley supercluster at
z=0.048, in order to investigate how the dense environment affects the galaxy
properties, such as star formation (SF) or stellar masses. We find that while
faint-end slopes of optical and NIR LFs steepen with decreasing density, no
environment effect is found in the slope of the SMFs. This suggests that
mechanisms transforming galaxies in different environments are mainly related
to the quench of SF rather than to mass-loss. The Near-UV (NUV) and Far-UV
(FUV) LFs obtained have steeper faint-end slopes than the local field
population, while the 24$\mu$m and 70$\mu$m galaxy LFs for the Shapley
supercluster have shapes fully consistent with those obtained for the local
field galaxy population. This apparent lack of environmental dependence for the
infrared (IR) LFs suggests that the bulk of the star-forming galaxies that make
up the observed cluster IR LF have been recently accreted from the field and
have yet to have their SF activity significantly affected by the cluster
environment.
