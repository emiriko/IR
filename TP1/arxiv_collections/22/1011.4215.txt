We have identified the optical counterpart of the ULX source P13 in the
nearby spiral galaxy NGC 7793. The object is a V ~ 20.5 mag star, ten times
brighter than any other established counterpart of a ULX in nearby galaxies.
Medium resolution optical spectroscopy carried out in 2008 and 2009 with the
ESO-VLT reveals the presence of narrow high order Balmer, HeI and MgII
absorption lines indicating a late B type supergiant companion star with mass
between 10 and 20 Msol. Stellar H beta and HeII 4686 emission lines are also
seen superposed on the photospheric spectrum. We detect different patterns of
radial velocity variations from the emission and absorption lines over a time
interval of one month. The velocity of the high order Balmer absorption lines
changes by ~ 100 km/s while the H beta and HeI 4686 emission components vary by
about the same amount but with a different phasing. Assuming that the observed
velocity changes trace the motion of the mass-donor star and of the X-ray
source implies a mass of the accreting black hole in the range of 3 to 100 Msol
with a most probable value of ~ 10 to 20 Msol. We expect an orbital period in
the range of 20 to 40 days based on the low density of the supergiant star. P13
is likely in a short-lived, and thus rare high X-ray luminosity evolutionary
state associated with the ascension of the donor star onto the supergiant
stage.
