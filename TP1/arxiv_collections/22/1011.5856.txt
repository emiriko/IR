We discuss the possibility of finding scenarios, within type IIB string
theory compactified on Calabi-Yau orientifolds with fluxes, for realizing gauge
mediated supersymmetry breaking. We find that while in principle such scenarios
are not ruled out, in practice it is hard to get acceptable constructions,
since typically, supersymmetry breaking cannot be separated from the
stabilization of the light modulus.
