he colour fields, created by static sources belonging to different SU(3)
representations, from the 3 to the 27, are computed in quenched SU(3) lattice
QCD, in a 24^3 x 48 lattice at beta=6.2 and a=0.07261(85) fm. We utilize the
technique of generalized Wilson Loops to localize the sources, correlated with
plaquettes to measure the respective colour fields. We investigate the Casimir
scaling of the fields, measured in the static potentials by Bali. We also study
the coherence length, comparing with the dual Ginzburg-Landau approach. With
the penetration and coherence lengths we determined the Ginzburg-Landau
dimensionless parameter, this result is consistent with a type II
superconductor picture, and with an effective dual gluon mass of 0.905 +- 0.163
GeV.
