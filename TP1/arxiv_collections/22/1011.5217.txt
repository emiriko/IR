We analyze the inelastic electron-electron scattering in undoped graphene
within the Keldysh diagrammatic approach. We demonstrate that finite
temperature strongly affects the screening properties of graphene, which, in
turn, influences the inelastic scattering rates as compared to the
zero-temperature case. Focussing on the clean regime, we calculate the quantum
scattering rate which is relevant for dephasing of interference processes. We
identify an hierarchy of regimes arising due to the interplay of a plasmon
enhancement of the scattering and finite-temperature screening of the
interaction. We further address the energy relaxation and transport scattering
rates in graphene. We find a non-monotonic energy dependence of the inelastic
relaxation rates in clean graphene which is attributed to the resonant
excitation of plasmons. Finally, we discuss the temperature dependence of the
conductivity at the Dirac point in the presence of both interaction and
disorder. Our results complement the kinetic-equation and hydrodynamic
approaches for the collision-limited conductivity of clean graphene and can be
generalized to the treatment of physics of inelastic processes in strongly
non-equilibrium setups.
