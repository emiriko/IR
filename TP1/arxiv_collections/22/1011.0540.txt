The nonlinear dynamics of coupled electrostatic upper-hybrid (UH) and Alfven
waves (AWs) is revisited in a magnetized electron-ion plasma with charged dust
impurities. A pair of nonlinear equations that describe the interaction of UH
wave envelopes (including the relativistic electron mass increase) and the
density as well as the compressional magnetic field perturbations associated
with the AWs is solved numerically to show that many coherent solitary patterns
can be excited and saturated due to modulational instability of unstable UH
waves. The evolution of these solitary patterns is also shown to appear in the
states of spatiotemporal coherence, temporal as well as spatiotemporal chaos
due to collision and fusion among the patterns in stochastic motion.
Furthermore, these spatiotemporal features are demonstrated by the analysis of
wavelet power spectra. It is found that a redistribution of wave energy takes
place to higher harmonic modes with small wavelengths which, in turn, results
into the onset of Alfvenic turbulence in dusty magnetoplasmas. Such a scenario
can occur in the vicinity of Saturn's magnetosphere as many electrostatic
solitary structures have been observed there by the Cassini spacecraft.
