We confront soft Pomeron and gluon saturation models with the first LHC data
on inclusive hadron production. We claim that while the first type of models
are not able to describe some part of the LHC data, the Colour-Glass-Condensate
(gluon saturation) approach gives an adequate description of the data. Here, we
compare our published predictions with the recently available 7 TeV data. We
firmly believe that if further experimental measurements confirm that the gluon
saturation works, it will be a major discovery.
