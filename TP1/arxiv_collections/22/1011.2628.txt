Shor's factoring algorithm illustrates the potential power of quantum
computation. Here we present and numerically investigate a proposal for a
compiled version of such an algorithm based on a quantum-wire network
exploiting the potentialities of fully coherent electron transport assisted by
the surface acoustic waves. Specifically, a non standard approach is used to
implement, in a simple form, the quantum circuits of the modular exponentiation
execution for the simplest instance of the Shor's algorithm, that is the
factorization of $N$=15. The numerical procedure is based on a time-dependent
solution of the multi-particle Schr\"odinger equation. The near-ideal algorithm
performance and the large estimated fidelity indicate the efficiency of the
protocol implemented, which also results to be almost unsensitive to small
destabilizing effects during quantum computation.
