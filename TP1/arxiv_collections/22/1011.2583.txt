We present a theoretical study of spontaneous imbibition in a slit pore using
a lattice-gas model and a dynamic mean-field theory. Emphasis is put on the
influence of the precursor films on the speed of the imbibition front due to
liquid mass conservation. This work is dedicated to Bob Evans for his 65th
birthday in recognition of his seminal contributions to the theory of fluids in
confining geometries.
