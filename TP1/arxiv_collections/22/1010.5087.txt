The microscopic dynamics and aging of a soft thermosensitive suspension was
investigated by looking at the thermal fluctuations of tracers in the
suspension. Below and above the glass transition, the dense microgel particles
suspension was found to develop an heterogeneous dynamics, featured by a non
Gaussian Probability Distribution Function (PDF) of the probes' displacements,
with an exponential tail. We show that non Gaussian shapes are a characteristic
of the ensemble-averaged PDF, while local PDF remain Gaussian. This shows that
the scenario behind the non Gaussian van Hove functions is a spatially
heterogeneous dynamics, characterized by a spatial distribution of locally
homogeneous dynamical environments through the sample, on the considered time
scales. We characterize these statistical distributions of dynamical
environments, in the liquid, supercooled, and glass states, and show that it
can explain the observed exponential tail of the van Hove functions observed in
the concentrated states. The intensity of spatial heterogeneities was found to
amplify with increasing volume fraction. In the aging regime, it tends to
increase as the glass gets more arrested.
