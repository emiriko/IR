Charmed mesons in dense matter are studied within a unitary coupled-channel
approach which takes into account Pauli-blocking effects and meson
self-energies in a self-consistent manner. We obtain the open-charm meson
spectral functions in this dense medium, and discuss their implications on
hidden charm and charm scalar resonances and on the formation of D-mesic
nuclei.
