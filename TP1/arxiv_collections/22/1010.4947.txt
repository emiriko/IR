A new simplified approach for teaching electromagnetism is presented using
the formalism of geometric algebra (GA) which does not require vector calculus
or tensor index notation, thus producing a much more accessible presentation
for students. The four-dimensional spacetime proposed is completely symmetrical
between the space and time dimensions, thus fulfilling Minkowski's original
vision. In order to improve student reception we also focus on forces and the
conservation of energy and momentum, which take a very simple form in GA, so
that students can easily build on established intuitions in using these laws
developed from studying Newtonian mechanics. The potential formulation is also
integrated into the presentation that allows an alternate solution path, as
well as an introduction to the Lagrangian approach. Several problems are solved
throughout the text to make the implementation clear. We extend previous
treatment of this area, through including the potential formulation, the
conservation of energy and momentum, the generalization for magnetic monopoles,
as well as simplifying previously reported results through eliminating the need
for the spacetime metric.
