KPD 1930+2752 is a short-period pulsating subdwarf B (sdB) star. It is also
an ellipsoidal variable with a known binary period just over two hours. The
companion is most likely a white dwarf and the total mass of the system is
close to the Chandresakhar limit. In this paper we report the results of Whole
Earth Telescope (WET) photometric observations during 2003 and a smaller
multisite campaign from 2002. From 355 hours of WET data, we detect 68
pulsation frequencies and suggest an additional 13 frequencies within a crowded
and complex temporal spectrum between 3065 and 6343 $\mu$Hz (periods between
326 and 157 s). We examine pulsation properties including phase and amplitude
stability in an attempt to understand the nature of the pulsation mechanism. We
examine a stochastic mechanism by comparing amplitude variations with simulated
stochastic data. We also use the binary nature of KPD 1930+2752 for identifying
pulsation modes via multiplet structure and a tidally-induced pulsation
geometry. Our results indicate a complicated pulsation structure that includes
short-period ($\approx 16$ h) amplitude variability, rotationally split modes,
tidally-induced modes, and some pulsations which are geometrically limited on
the sdB star.
