We describe the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) polarization experiment
called Polarbear. This experiment will use the dedicated Huan Tran Telescope
equipped with a powerful 1,200-bolometer array receiver to map the CMB
polarization with unprecedented accuracy. We summarize the experiment, its
goals, and current status.
