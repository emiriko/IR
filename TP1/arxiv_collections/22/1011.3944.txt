This paper introduces a novel method for compact representation of sets of
n-dimensional binary sequences in a form of compact triplets structures (CTS),
supposing both logic and arithmetic interpretations of data. Suitable
illustration of CTS application is the unique graph-combinatorial model for the
classic intractable 3-Satisfiability problem and a polynomial algorithm for the
model synthesis. The method used for Boolean formulas analysis and
classification by means of the model is defined as a bijective mapping
principle for sets of components of discordant structures to a basic set. The
statistic computer-aided experiment showed efficiency of the algorithm in a
large scale of problem dimension parameters, including those that make
enumeration procedures of no use. The formulated principle expands resources of
constructive approach to investigation of intractable problems.
