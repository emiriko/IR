It is anticipated from hierarchical clustering theory that there are scaling
relationships between halos over a wide range of mass. Observationally it can
be difficult to identify the markers that characterize these relationships
because of the small numbers of visible probes and confusion from contaminants
in projection. Nonetheless, in favorable circumstances it is possible to
identify a very useful marker: the radius of the caustic at second turnaround.
In a few favorable circumstances it is possible to identify the radius of first
turnaround, or zero velocity surface about a collapsed region. It will be shown
that specifically the radius of second turnaround scales as anticipated over
three orders of magnitude in mass from 10^12 to 10^15 M_sun. Halos are
characterized by zones of dispersed velocities within the second turnaround
caustic and zones of infall between the first and second turnaround radii. The
inner zone is populated in the majority by gas poor morphologies and the outer
zone is populated in the majority by gas rich morphologies. The numbers of
dwarfs within the inner zone is roughly constant per unit halo mass.
