I review some recent advances in foundational research at Pavia QUIT group.
The general idea is that there is only Quantum Theory without quantization
rules, and the whole Physics---including space-time and relativity--is emergent
from the quantum-information processing. And since Quantum Theory itself is
axiomatized solely on informational principles, the whole Physics must be
reformulated in information-theoretical terms: this is the "It from Bit of J.
A. Wheeler. The review is divided into four parts: a) the informational
axiomatization of Quantum Theory; b) how space-time and relativistic covariance
emerge from quantum computation; c) what is the information-theoretical meaning
of inertial mass and of $\hbar$, and how the quantum field emerges; d) an
observational consequence of the new quantum field theory: a mass-dependent
refraction index of vacuum. I will conclude with the research lines that will
follow in the immediate future.
