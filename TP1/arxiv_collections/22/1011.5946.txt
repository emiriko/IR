Recent experimental data have revealed large mirror energy differences (MED)
between high-spin states in the mirror nuclei 67Se and 67As, the heaviest pair
where MED have been determined so far. The MED are generally attributed to the
isospin symmetry breaking caused by the Coulomb force and by the isospin
nonconserving part of the nucleon-nucleon residual interaction. The different
contributions of the various terms have been extensively studied in the fp
shell. By employing large-scale shell model calculations, we show that the
inclusion of the g9/2 orbit causes interference between the electromagnetic
spin-orbit and the Coulomb monopole radial terms at high spin. The large MED
are attributed to the aligned proton pair excitations from the p3/2 and f5/2
orbits to the g9/2 orbit. The relation of the MED to deformation is discussed.
