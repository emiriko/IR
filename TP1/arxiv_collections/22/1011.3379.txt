We describe the processes obtained by time reversal of a class of stationary
jump-diffusion processes that model the dynamics of genetic variation in
populations subject to repeated bottlenecks. Assuming that only one lineage
survives each bottleneck, the forward process is a diffusion on [0,1] that
jumps to the boundary before diffusing back into the interior. We show that the
behavior of the time-reversed process depends on whether the boundaries are
accessible to the diffusive motion of the forward process. If a boundary point
is inaccessible to the forward diffusion, then time reversal leads to a
jump-diffusion that jumps immediately into the interior whenever it arrives at
that point. If, instead, a boundary point is accessible, then the jumps off of
that point are governed by a weighted local time of the time-reversed process.
