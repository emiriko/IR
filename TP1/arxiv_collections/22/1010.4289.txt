Magnesium diboride has many intriguing characteristics, including its
relatively high critical temperature and two-band nature. Most prior studies of
MgB2 thin film Josephson junctions have been conducted above 2 Kelvin. We
report results of sub-1 Kelvin experiments of MgB2/insulator/Pb junctions whose
a-b plane is exposed for electron tunneling. By measuring differential
conductance at low temperature, new details in the structure of the sigma- and
pi-band gaps are observed in this data, consistent with theoretical
predictions.
