We present a preliminary spectroscopic analysis of the binary system V577Oph,
observed during the summer of 2007 on the 2.6m NOT telescope on La Palma. We
have obtained time series spectroscopic observations, which show clear binary
motion as well as radial velocity variations due to pulsation in the primary
star. By modelling the radial velocities we determine a full orbital solution
of the system, which yields M_A sin^3 i = 1.562 +/- 0.012 M_solar and M_B sin^3
i = 1.461 +/- 0.020 M_solar. An estimate of inclination from photometry yields
a primary mass of 1.6 M_solar. Using this derived mass, and the known pulsation
frequency we can impose a lower limit of 1 Gyr on the age of the system, and
constrain the parameters of the oscillation mode. We show that with further
analysis of the spectra (extracting the atmospheric parameters), tighter
constraints could be imposed on the age, metallicity and the mode parameters.
This work emphasizes the power that a single pulsation frequency can have for
constraining stellar parameters in an eclipsing binary system.
