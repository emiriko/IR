Two nanosized PrF3 samples were synthesized using two different procedures.
The X-ray and HRTEM experiments showed high crystallinity of synthesized
sample. Comparison of enhanced 141Pr NMR spectra of microsized (45 $\mu$m) and
nanosized PrF3 powder is presented. Experimental data on spin kinetics of 3He
in contact with PrF3 nanoparticles at T = 1.5 K are reported.
