The CeFeAsO and CeFePO iron pnictide compounds were studied via electrical
transport measurements under high-pressure. In CeFeAsO polycrystals, the
magnetic phases involving the Fe and Ce ions coexist up to 15 GPa, with no
signs of pressure-induced superconductivity up to 50 GPa. For the CeFePO single
crystals, pressure stabilizes the Kondo screening of the Ce 4f-electron
magnetic moments.
