Despite rapid advances in experimental cell biology, the in vivo behavior of
hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) cannot be directly observed and measured.
Previously we modeled feline hematopoiesis using a two-compartment hidden
Markov process that had birth and emigration events in the first compartment.
Here we perform Bayesian statistical inference on models which contain two
additional events in the first compartment in order to determine if HSC fate
decisions are linked to cell division or occur independently. Pareto Optimal
Model Assessment approach is used to cross check the estimates from Bayesian
inference. Our results show that HSC must divide symmetrically (i.e., produce
two HSC daughter cells) in order to maintain hematopoiesis. We then demonstrate
that the augmented model that adds asymmetric division events provides a better
fit to the competitive transplantation data, and we thus provide evidence that
HSC fate determination in vivo occurs both in association with cell division
and at a separate point in time. Last we show that assuming each cat has a
unique set of parameters leads to either a significant decrease or a
nonsignificant increase in model fit, suggesting that the kinetic parameters
for HSC are not unique attributes of individual animals, but shared within a
species.
