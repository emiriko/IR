The electroweak model, which lepton sector correspond to the contracted gauge
group $ SU(2;j)\times U(1), j \rightarrow 0 $, whereas boson and quark sectors
are standard one, is suggested. This model describe in a natural manner why
neutrinos so rarely interact with matter, as well as why neutrinos
cross-section increase with the energy. Dimensionfull parameter of the model is
interpreted as neutrino energy. Dimensionless contraction parameter $j$ for low
energy is connected with the Fermi constant of weak interactions and is
approximated as $j^2\approx 10^{-5}$.
