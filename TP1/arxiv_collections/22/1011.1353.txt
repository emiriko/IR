We describe and test a method known in the literature as low mode averaging
to improve Euclidean two-point functions in lattice QCD using the low-lying
eigenmodes of the Wilson-Dirac operator D. The contribution from the low modes
is averaged over all positions of the quark sources while the contribution from
high modes is calculated in the traditional way using one source point per
lattice. We apply this method to different baryon and meson two-point functions
and we compare the improvements using the eigenmodes of the non-hermitian
operator D and the eigenmodes of the hermitian operator Q=gamma5 D. The
convergence strongly depends on the parity of the states.
