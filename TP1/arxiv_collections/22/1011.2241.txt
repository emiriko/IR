We show that an interacting spin-0 field on a de Sitter space background will
break the underlying de Sitter symmetry. This is done first for a (1+1) de
Sitter space where a boson-fermion correspondence permits us to solve certain
interacting theories by transforming them into free ones of opposite
statistics. A massless boson interacting by a sine-Gordon potential is shown to
be equivalent to a free massive fermion with the mass depending on the de
Sitter time thus breaking the symmetry explicitly. We then show that for larger
dimensions and any boson potential, to one loop, an anomaly develops and the
currents generating the de Sitter transformations are not conserved.
