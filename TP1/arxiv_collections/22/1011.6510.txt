Based on the observation of the long-lived isotopes 261Rg and 265Rg (Z = 111,
t(1/2) >= 10^(8) y) in natural Au, an experiment was performed to enrich Rg in
99.999% Au. 16 mg of Au were heated in vacuum for two weeks at a temperature of
1127 deg. C (63 deg. C above the melting point of Au). The content of 197Au and
261Rg in the residue was studied with high resolution inductively coupled
plasma-sector field mass spectrometry (ICP-SFMS). The residue of Au was
3x10^(-6) of its original quantity. The recovery of Rg was a few percent. The
abundance of Rg compared to Au in the enriched solution was about 2x10^(-6),
which is a three to four orders of magnitude enrichment. It is concluded that
the evaporation rate of Rg from an Au matrix in vacuum at 63 deg. C above the
Au melting point is lower than that of Au. This experiment reinforces our first
observation of Rg in a terrestrial material. As before it is concluded that a
long-lived isomeric state exists in 261Rg and that it probably belongs to a new
class of isomeric states, namely high spin super- or hyperdeformed isomeric
states.
