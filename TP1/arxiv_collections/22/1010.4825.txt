In this paper we report new radio-continuum detection of an extragalactic PN:
SMC SMP 24. We show the radio-continuum image of this PN and present the
measured radio data. The newly reduced radio observations are consistent with
the multi-wavelength data and derived parameters found in the literature. SMC
SMP 24 appear to be a young and compact PN, optically thick at frequencies
below 2 GHz.
