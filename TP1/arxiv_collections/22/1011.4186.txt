In this note we show that the restriction of the cotangent bundle
$\Omega_{\mathbb P}^2$ of the projective plane to a Fermat curve $C$ of degree
$d$ in characteristic $p \equiv -1 \mod 2d$ is, up to tensoration with a
certain line bundle, isomorphic to its Frobenius pull-back. This leads to a
Frobenius periodicity $F^*({\mathcal E}) \cong {\mathcal E} $ on the Fermat
curve of degree 2d, where ${\mathcal E}= {\rm Syz}(U^2,V^2,W^2)(3)$.
