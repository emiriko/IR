Using Yang and Yang's particle-hole description, we present a thorough
derivation of the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz equations for a general
$SU(\kappa)$ fermionic system in one-dimension for both the repulsive and
attractive regimes under the presence of an external magnetic field. These
equations are derived from Sutherland's Bethe ansatz equations by using the
spin-string hypothesis. The Bethe ansatz root patterns for the attractive case
are discussed in detail. The relationship between the various phases of the
magnetic phase diagrams and the external magnetic fields is given for the
attractive case. We also give a quantitative description of the ground state
energies for both strongly repulsive and strongly attractive regimes.
