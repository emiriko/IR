Differential astrometry measurements from the Palomar High-precision
Astrometric Search for Exoplanet Systems have been combined with lower
precision single-aperture measurements covering a much longer timespan (from
eyepiece measurements, speckle interferometry, and adaptive optics) to
determine improved visual orbits for 20 binary stars. In some cases, radial
velocity observations exist to constrain the full three-dimensional orbit and
determine component masses. The visual orbit of one of these binaries---alpha
Com (HD 114378)---shows that the system is likely to have eclipses, despite its
very long period of 26 years. The next eclipse is predicted to be within a week
of 2015 January 24.
