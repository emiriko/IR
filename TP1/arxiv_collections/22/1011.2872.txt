Some examples of translation invariant site percolation processes on the
$\Z^2$ lattice are constructed, the most far-reaching example being one that
satisfies uniform finite energy (meaning that the probability that a site is
open given the status of all others is bounded away from $0$ and $1$) and
exhibits a.s. the coexistence of an infinite open cluster and an infinite
closed cluster. Essentially the same example shows that coexistence is possible
between an infinite open cluster and an infinite closed cluster that are both
robust under i.i.d. thinning.
