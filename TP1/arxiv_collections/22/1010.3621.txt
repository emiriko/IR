We study the dynamics of the classical and quantum mechanical scattering of a
wave packet from an oscillating barrier. Our main focus is on the dependence of
the transmission coefficient on the initial energy of the wave packet for a
wide range of oscillation frequencies. The behavior of the quantum transmission
coefficient is affected by tunneling phenomena, resonances and kinematic
effects emanating from the time dependence of the potential. We show that when
kinematic effects dominate (mainly in intermediate frequencies), classical
mechanics provides very good approximation of quantum results. Moreover, in the
frequency region of optimal agreement between classical and quantum
transmission coefficient, the transmission threshold, i.e. the energy above
which the transmission coefficient becomes larger than a specific small
threshold value, is found to exhibit a minimum. We also consider the form of
the transmitted wave packet and we find that for low values of the frequency
the incoming classical and quantum wave packet can be split into a train of
well separated coherent pulses, a phenomenon which can admit purely classical
kinematic interpretation.
