The Asteroseismic Modeling Portal (AMP) provides a web-based interface for
astronomers to run and view simulations that derive the properties of Sun-like
stars from observations of their pulsation frequencies. In this paper, we
describe the architecture and implementation of AMP, highlighting the
lightweight design principles and tools used to produce a functional
fully-custom web-based science application in less than a year. Targeted as a
TeraGrid science gateway, AMP's architecture and implementation are intended to
simplify its orchestration of TeraGrid computational resources. AMP's web-based
interface was developed as a traditional standalone database-backed web
application using the Python-based Django web development framework, allowing
us to leverage the Django framework's capabilities while cleanly separating the
user interface development from the grid interface development. We have found
this combination of tools flexible and effective for rapid gateway development
and deployment.
