A modular method was suggested before to recover a band limited signal from
the sample and hold and linearly interpolated (or, in general, an
nth-order-hold) version of the regular samples. In this paper a novel approach
for compensating the distortion of any interpolation based on modular method
has been proposed. In this method the performance of the modular method is
optimized by adding only some simply calculated coefficients. This approach
causes drastic improvement in terms of SNRs with fewer modules compared to the
classical modular method. Simulation results clearly confirm the improvement of
the proposed method and also its superior robustness against additive noise.
