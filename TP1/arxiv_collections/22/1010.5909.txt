We present a Monte Carlo renormalisation group study of the SU(2) gauge
theory with two Dirac fermions in the adjoint representation. Using the two
lattice matching technique recently advocated and exploited in
[arXiv:0907.0919], we measure the running of the coupling and the anomalous
mass dimension.
