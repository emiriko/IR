We investigate "instantaneous interquark potential", an interesting
gauge-dependent quantity defined from the spatial correlator $<\mathrm{Tr}
[U_4^\dagger(s)U_4(s')]>$ of the temporal link-variable $U_4$, in detail in
generalized Landau gauge using SU(3) quenched lattice QCD. While the
instantaneous potential has no linear part in the Landau gauge, in the Coulomb
gauge, it is expressed by the Coulomb plus linear potential, where the slope is
2-3 times larger than the physical string tension, and the lowest energy state
is considered to be a gluon-chain state. Using the generalized Landau gauge, we
find that the instantaneous potential can be continuously described between the
Landau and the Coulomb gauges, and it approximately reproduces the physical
interquark potential in a specific intermediate gauge, which we call
"$\lambda_C$-gauge". This $\lambda_C$-gauge is expected to provide a
quark-potential-model picture, where dynamical gluons do not appear. We also
investigate $T$-length terminated Polyakov-line correlator and its
corresponding "finite-time potential" in generalized Landau gauge.
