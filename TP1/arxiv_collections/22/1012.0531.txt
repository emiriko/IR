We examine the use of string diagrams and the mathematics of category theory
in the description of quantum states by tensor networks. This approach lead to
a unification of several ideas, as well as several results and methods that
have not previously appeared in either side of the literature. Our approach
enabled the development of a tensor network framework allowing a solution to
the quantum decomposition problem which has several appealing features.
Specifically, given an n-body quantum state S, we present a new and general
method to factor S into a tensor network of clearly defined building blocks. We
use the solution to expose a previously unknown and large class of quantum
states which we prove can be sampled efficiently and exactly. This general
framework of categorical tensor network states, where a combination of generic
and algebraically defined tensors appear, enhances the theory of tensor network
states.
