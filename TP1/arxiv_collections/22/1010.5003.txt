We have, for the first time, compiled a nearly complete census of planetary
nebulae (PNe) centred on the Sun. Our goal is the generation of an unbiased
volume-limited sample, in order to answer some long-standing statistical
questions regarding the overall population of Galactic disk PNe and their
central stars. Much improved discrimination of classical PNe from their mimics
is now possible based on the wide variety of high-quality multiwavelength data
sets that are now available. However, we note that evidence is increasing that
PNe are heterogeneous, and probably derived from multiple evolutionary
scenarios. We give some preliminary data on the relative frequencies of
different types of PNe in the local Galactic disk.
