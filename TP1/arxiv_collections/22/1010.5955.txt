We investigate the problems of ghosts and stability in the framework of
asymptotical safe theory of gravity in the Minkowski background. Within one
loop corrections, we obtain explicitly the constraints on the coupling
parameters. Applying them to the coupling constant recently-obtained at the
fixed point, we find that the corresponding theory is both ghost-free and
stable. Our results can be easily generalized to high order corrections.
