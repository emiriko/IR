Self-Consistent RPA is extended in a way so that it is compatable with a
variational ansatz for the ground state wave function as a fermionic many-body
vacuum. Employing the usual equation of motion technique, we arrive at extended
RPA equations of the Self Consistent RPA structure. In principle the Pauli
principle is, therefore, fully respected. However, the correlation functions
entering the RPA matrix can only be obtained from a systematic expansion in
powers of some combinations of RPA amplitudes. We demonstrate for a model case
that this expansion may converge rapidly.
