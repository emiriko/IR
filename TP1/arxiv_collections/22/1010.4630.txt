In this letter we suggest the generalization of $k_T$-factorization formula
for inclusive gluon production for the dense-dense parton system scattering. It
turnes out that the soft gluon production with transverse momentum $p_T$ is
suppressed by additional Sudakov-like factor that depends on $p^2_T/Q^2_s$
ratio in a good agreement with the first numerical calculation in Colour Glass
Condensate approach by J.P. Blaizot, T. Lappi and Y. Mehtar-Tan.
