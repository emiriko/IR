A Condorcet domain (CD) is a collection of linear orders on a set of
candidates satisfying the following property: for any choice of preferences of
voters from this collection, a simple majority rule does not yield cycles. We
propose a method of constructing "large" CDs by use of rhombus tiling diagrams
and explain that this method unifies several constructions of CDs known
earlier. Finally, we show that three conjectures on the maximal sizes of those
CDs are, in fact, equivalent and provide a counterexample to them.
