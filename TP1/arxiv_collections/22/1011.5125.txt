Sodium iridium(V) oxide, NaIrO3, was synthesized by a high pressure solid
state method and recovered to ambient conditions. It is found to be
isostructural with CaIrO3, the much-studied structural analogue of the
high-pressure post-perovskite phase of MgSiO3. Among the oxide
post-perovskites, NaIrO3 is the first example with a pentavalent cation. The
structure consists of layers of corner- and edge-sharing IrO6 octahedra
separated by layers of NaO8 bicapped trigonal prisms. NaIrO3 shows no magnetic
ordering and resistivity measurements show non-metallic behavior. The crystal
structure, electrical and magnetic properties are discussed and compared to
known post-perovskites and pentavalent perovskite metal oxides.
