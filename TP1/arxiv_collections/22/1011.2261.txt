We review several models of glassy systems where the randomness is self
generated, i.e. already an infinitesimal amount of disorder is sufficient to
cause a transition to a non-ergodic, glassy state. We discuss the application
of the replica formalism developed for the spin glass systems to study the
glass transition in uniformly frustrated many-body systems. Here a localization
in configuration space emerges leading to an entropy crisis of the system.
Using a combination of density functional theory and Landau theory of the
glassy state, we first analyze the mean field glass transition within the
saddle point approximation. We go beyond the saddle point approximation by
considering the energy fluctuations around the saddle point and evaluate the
barrier height distribution.
