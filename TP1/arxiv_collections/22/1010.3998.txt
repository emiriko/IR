We present results from global, three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)
simulations of the solar wind/magnetosphere interaction. These MHD simulations
are used to study ultra low frequency (ULF) pulsations in the Earth's
magnetosphere driven by shear instabilities at the flanks of the magnetopause.
We drive the simulations with idealized, constant solar wind input parameters,
ensuring that any discrete ULF pulsations generated in the simulation
magnetosphere are not due to fluctuations in the solar wind. The simulations
presented in this study are driven by purely southward interplanetary magnetic
field (IMF) conditions, changing only the solar wind driving velocity while
holding all of the other solar wind input parameters constant. We find surface
waves near the dawn and dusk flank magnetopause and show that these waves are
generated by the Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability. We also find that two KH
modes are generated near the magnetopause boundary. One mode, the magnetopause
KH mode, propagates tailward along the magnetopause boundary. The other mode,
the inner KH mode, propagates tailward along the inner edge of the boundary
layer (IEBL). We find large vortical structures associated with the inner KH
mode that are centered on the IEBL. The phase velocities, wavelengths, and
frequencies of the two KH modes are computed. The KH waves are found to be
fairly monochromatic with well defined wavelengths. In addition, the inner and
magnetopause KH modes are coupled and lead to a coupled oscillation of the
low-latitude boundary layer. The boundary layer thickness, $d$, is computed and
we find maximum wave growth for $kd$ = 0.5--1.0, where $k$ is the wave number,
consistent with the linear theory of the KH instability. We comment briefly on
the effectiveness of these KH waves in the energization and transport of
radiation belt electrons.
