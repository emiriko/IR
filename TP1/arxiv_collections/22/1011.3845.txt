The recently discovered universal thermodynamic behaviour of dilute, strongly
interacting Fermi gases also implies a universal structure in the many-body
pair-correlation function at short distances, as quantified by the contact
${\cal I}$. This quantity is an excellent indicator of the presence of strong
correlations in these systems, which provide a highly accessible physical model
for other strongly correlated quantum fluids. Here we theoretically calculate
the temperature dependence of this universal contact for a Fermi gas in free
space and in a harmonic trap. At high temperatures above the Fermi degeneracy
temperature, $T\gtrsim T_{F}$, we obtain a reliable non-perturbative quantum
virial expansion up to third order. At low temperatures we compare different
approximate strong coupling theories. These make different predictions, which
need to be tested either by future experiments or advanced quantum Monte Carlo
simulations. We conjecture that in the universal unitarity limit, the contact
or correlation decreases monotonically with increasing temperature, unless the
temperature is significantly lower than the critical temperature, $T\ll
T_{c}\sim0.2T_{F}$. We also discuss briefly how to measure the universal
contact either in homogeneous or harmonically trapped Fermi gases.
