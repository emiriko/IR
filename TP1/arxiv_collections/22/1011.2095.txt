This study aims at understanding the nature of measured data on the rapidity
spectra of some heavy baryons [$\Lambda$, $\Lambda$bar, $\Xi^-$ & $\Xi$bar$^+$]
produced in the nuclear collisions at some modestly high energies. Furthermore,
our objective is also to build up a comprehensive and consistent methodology to
analyze the data on this specific observable which has a very important place
in the domain of High Energy Physics (HEP). On an overall basis, our target
here attains a moderate degree of success even for production of such rare
secondaries. In addition to this, the limitations of such an approach have also
been pointed out.
