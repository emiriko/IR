We analyze the effect of the electron-electron interaction on the resistivity
of a metal near a Pomeranchuk quantum phase transition (QPT). We show that
Umklapp processes are not effective near a QPT, and one must consider both
interactions and disorder to obtain finite and T dependent resistivity. By
power counting, the correction to the residual resistivity at low T scales as
AT^{(D+2)/3} near a Z=3 QPT. We show, however, that A=0 for a simply connected,
convex Fermi surface in 2D, due to hidden integrability of the electron motion.
We argue that A >0 in a two-band (s-d) model and propose this model as an
explanation for the observed T^{(D+2)/3} behavior.
