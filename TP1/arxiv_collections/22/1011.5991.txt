We present a detailed study of the kinematic and physical properties of the
ionized gas in multiple knots of the blue compact dwarf galaxy Haro 15. Using
echelle and long slit spectroscopy data, obtained with different instruments at
Las Campanas Observatory, we study the internal kinematic and physical
conditions (electron density and temperature), ionic and total chemical
abundances of several atoms, reddening and ionization structure. Applying
direct and empirical methods for abundance determination, we perform a
comparative analysis between these regions and in their different components.
On the other hand, our echelle spectra show complex kinematics in several
conspicuous knots within the galaxy. To perform an in-depth 2D spectroscopic
study we complete this work with high spatial and spectral resolution
spectroscopy using the Integral Field Unit mode on the Gemini Multi-Object
Spectrograph instrument at the Gemini South telescope. With these data we are
able to resolve the complex kinematical structure within star forming knots in
Haro 15 galaxy.
