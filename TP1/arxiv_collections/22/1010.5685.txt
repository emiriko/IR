Photometric data from the literature is combined with triaxial mass models to
derive variation in the intrinsic shapes of the light distribution of
elliptical galaxies NGC 720, 2768 and 3605. The inferred shape variation in
given by a Bayesian probability distribution, assuming a uniform prior. The
likelihood of obtaining the data is calculated by using ensemble of triaxial
models. We apply the method to infer the shape variation of a galaxy, using the
ellipticities and the difference in the position angles at two suitably chosen
points from the profiles of the photometric data. Best constrained shape
parameters are found to be the short to long axial ratios at small and large
radii, and the absolute values of the triaxiallity difference between these
radii.
