In this paper we propose a copula contagion mixture model for correlated
default times. The model includes the well known factor, copula, and contagion
models as its special cases. The key advantage of such a model is that we can
study the interaction of different models and their pricing impact.
Specifically, we model the marginal default times to follow some contagion
intensity processes coupled with copula dependence structure. We apply the
total hazard construction method to generate ordered default times and
numerically compare the pricing impact of different models on basket CDSs and
CDOs in the presence of exponential decay and counterparty risk.
