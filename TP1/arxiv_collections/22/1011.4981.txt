The effective quantum pseudospin-1/2 model for interacting rare-earth
magnetic moments, which are locally described with atomic doublets, is studied
theoretically for magnetic pyrochlore oxides. It is derived microscopically for
localized Pr^{3+} 4f moments in Pr_2TM_2O_7 (TM = Zr, Sn, Hf, and Ir) by
starting from the atomic non-Kramers magnetic doublets and performing the
strong-coupling perturbation expansion of the virtual electron transfer between
the Pr 4f and O 2p electrons. The most generic form of the nearest-neighbor
anisotropic superexchange pseudospin-1/2 Hamiltonian is also constructed from
the symmetry properties, which is applicable to Kramers ions Nd^{3+}, Sm^{3+},
and Yb^{3+} potentially showing large quantum effects. The effective model is
then studied by means of a classical mean-field theory and the exact
diagonalization on a single tetrahedron and on a 16-site cluster. These
calculations reveal appreciable quantum fluctuations leading to quantum phase
transitions to a quadrupolar state as a melting of spin ice for the Pr^{3+}
case. The model also shows a formation of cooperative quadrupole moment and
pseudospin chirality on tetrahedrons. A sign of a singlet quantum spin ice is
also found in a finite region in the space of coupling constants. The relevance
to the experiments is discussed.
