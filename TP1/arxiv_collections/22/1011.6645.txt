We report the remarkably robust ferroelectric state in the multiferroic
compound Mn$_{1-x}$Zn$_x$WO$_4$. The substitution of the magnetic Mn$^{2+}$
with nonmagnetic Zn$^{2+}$ reduces the magnetic exchange and provides control
of the various magnetic and multiferroic states of MnWO$_4$. Only 5 % of Zn
substitution results in a complete suppression of the frustrated collinear
(paraelectric) low temperature phase. The helical magnetic and ferroelectric
phase develops as the ground state. The multiferroic state is stable up to a
high level of substitution of more than 50 %. The magnetic, thermodynamic, and
dielectric properties as well as the ferroelectric polarization of single
crystals of Mn$_{1-x}$Zn$_x$WO$_4$ are studied for different substitutions up
to x=0.5. The magnetic phases have been identified in single crystal neutron
scattering experiments. The ferroelectric polarization scales with the neutron
intensity of the incommensurate peak of the helical phase.
