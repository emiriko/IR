The {\alpha}-formalism is a common way to parametrize the common envelope
interaction between a giant star and a more compact companion. The {\alpha}
parameter describes the fraction of orbital energy released by the companion
that is available to eject the giant star's envelope. By using new, detailed
stellar evolutionary calculations we derive a user-friendly prescription for
the {\lambda} parameter and an improved approximation for the envelope binding
energy, thus revising the {\alpha} equation. We then determine {\alpha} both
from simulations and observations in a self consistent manner. By using our own
stellar structure models as well as population considerations to reconstruct
the primary's parameters at the time of the common envelope interaction, we
gain a deeper understanding of the uncertainties. We find that systems with
very low values of q (the ratio of the companion's mass to the mass of the
primary at the time of the common envelope interaction) have higher values of
{\alpha}. A fit to the data suggests that lower mass companions are left at
comparable or larger orbital separations to more massive companions. We
conjecture that lower mass companions take longer than a stellar dynamical time
to spiral in to the giant's core, and that this is key to allowing the giant to
use its own thermal energy to help unbind its envelope. As a result, although
systems with light companions might not have enough orbital energy to unbind
the common envelope, they might stimulate a stellar reaction that results in
the common envelope ejection.
