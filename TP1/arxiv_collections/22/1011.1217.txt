Electron and nuclear spins have been employed in many of the early
demonstrations of quantum technology (QT). However applications in real world
QT are limited by the difficulty of measuring single spins. Here we show that
it is possible to rapidly and robustly amplify a spin state using a lattice of
ancillary spins. The model we employ corresponds to an extremely simple
experimental system: a homogenous Ising-coupled spin lattice in one, two or
three dimensions, driven by a continuous microwave field. We establish that the
process can operate at finite temperature (imperfect initial polarisation) and
under the effects of various forms of decoherence.
