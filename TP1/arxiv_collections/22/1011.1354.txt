In integrable one-dimensional quantum systems an infinite set of local
conserved quantities exists which can prevent a current from decaying
completely. For cases like the spin current in the XXZ model at zero magnetic
field or the charge current in the attractive Hubbard model at half filling,
however, the current operator does not have overlap with any of the local
conserved quantities. We show that in these situations transport at finite
temperatures is dominated by a diffusive contribution with the Drude weight
being either small or even zero. For the XXZ model we discuss in detail the
relation between our results, the phenomenological theory of spin diffusion,
and measurements of the spin-lattice relaxation rate in spin chain compounds.
Furthermore, we study the Haldane-Shastry model where the current operator is
also orthogonal to the set of conserved quantities associated with
integrability but becomes itself conserved in the thermodynamic limit.
