We show that the use of entangled photons having non-zero orbital angular
momentum (OAM) increases the resolution and sensitivity of angular-displacement
measurements performed using an interferometer. By employing a 4$\times$4
matrix formulation to study the propagation of entangled OAM modes, we analyze
measurement schemes for two and four entangled photons and obtain explicit
expressions for the resolution and sensitivity in these schemes. We find that
the resolution of angular-displacement measurements scales as $Nl$ while the
angular sensitivity increases as $1/(2Nl)$, where $N$ is the number of
entangled photons and $l$ the magnitude of the orbital-angular-momentum mode
index. These results are an improvement over what could be obtained with $N$
non-entangled photons carrying an orbital angular momentum of $l\hbar$ per
photon
