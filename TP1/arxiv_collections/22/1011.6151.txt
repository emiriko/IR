The Hawking temperature for the Barriola-Vilenkin global monopole metric is
shown to be $T_{\mathrm BV}= {\hbar (1-\alpha) ^{2}\over8\pi GM k_{\mathrm
B}}$, where $\alpha$ is the global monopole charge,$M$ the mass of the black
hole, $k_{\mathrm B}$ is the Boltzmann constant and speed of light $c=1$. We
then show that a similar metric can also be obtained for certain $k-$ essence
field configurations in an emergent gravity situation. Therefore, in the
context of Belgiorno {\it et al's} recent demonstration of spontaneous emission
of photons in a gravitational analogue experiment, any future observation of
$T_{\mathrm BV}$ need not necessarily imply the existence of global monopoles.
An alternative implication might as well be a very indirect signature of dark
energy in an emergent gravity scenario. This should lead to effects that may be
detectable in refined and modified versions of Belgiorno {\it et al's}
experiment.
