Lattice measurements of spatial correlation functions of the operators FF and
FF-dual in thermal SU(3) gauge theory have revealed a clear difference between
the two channels at "intermediate" distances, x ~ 1/(pi T). This is at odds
with the AdS/CFT limit which predicts the results to coincide. On the other
hand, an OPE analysis at short distances (x << 1/(pi T)) as well as effective
theory methods at long distances (x >> 1/(pi T)) suggest differences. Here we
study the situation at intermediate distances by determining the time-averaged
spatial correlators through a 2-loop computation. We do find unequal results,
however the numerical disparity is small. Apart from theoretical issues, a
future comparison of our results with time-averaged lattice measurements might
also be of phenomenological interest in that understanding the convergence of
the weak-coupling series at intermediate distances may bear on studies of the
thermal broadening of heavy quarkonium resonances.
