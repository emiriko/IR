Solid substrates can be endued with self-organized regular stripe patterns of
nanoscopic lengthscale by Langmuir-Blodgett transfer of organic monolayers.
Here we consider the effect of periodically prepatterned substrates on this
process of pattern formation. It leads to a time periodic forcing of the
oscillatory behavior at the meniscus. Utilizing higher order synchronization
with this forcing, complex periodic patterns of predefined wavelength can be
created. The dependence of the synchronization on the amplitude and the
wavelength of the wetting contrast is investigated in one and two spatial
dimensions and the resulting patterns are discussed. Furthermore, the effect of
prepatterned substrates on the pattern selection process is investigated.
