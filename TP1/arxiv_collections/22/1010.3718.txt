We present new light curves and spectra for a number of extragalactic optical
transients or "SN impostors" related to giant eruptions of LBVs, and we provide
a comparative discussion of LBV-like giant eruptions known to date. New data
include photometry and spectroscopy of SNe1999bw, 2000ch, 2001ac, 2002bu,
2006bv, and 2010dn. SN2010dn resembles SN2008S and NGC 300-OT, whereas SN2002bu
shows spectral evolution from a normal LBV at early times to a twin of these
cooler transients at late times. SN2008S, NGC300-OT, and SN2010dn appear to be
special cases of a broader eruptive phenomenon where the progenitor star was
enshrouded by dust. Examining the full sample, SN impostors have range of
timescales from a day to decades, potentially suffering multiple eruptions. The
upper end of the luminosity distribution overlaps with the least luminous SNe.
The low end of the luminosity distribution is poorly defined, and a distinction
between various eruptions is not entirely clear. We discuss observational clues
concerning winds or shocks as the relevant mass-loss mechanism, and we evaluate
possible ideas for physical mechanisms. Although examples of these eruptions
are sufficient to illustrate their diversity, their statistical distribution
will benefit greatly from upcoming transient surveys. Based on the distribution
of eruptions, we propose that SN1961V was not a member of this class of
impostors, but was instead a true core-collapse SNIIn preceded by a giant LBV
eruption. (abridged)
