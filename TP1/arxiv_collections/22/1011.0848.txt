We present a systematic study of the high-pressure FeSe phase performed by
means of the first-principle electronic structure calculations. Basing on
available experimental information about the unit cell geometry we calculate
the band structure and characterize the related properties during their
pressure driven evolution. The electronic structure including the hybrid
functional B3LYP or the Hubbard parameter U for the iron d states lead to the
correct semiconducting ground state for the hexagonal stoichiometric FeSe
within the broad pressure range (up to 30 GPa).
