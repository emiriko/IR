These lectures concern the properties of strongly interacting matter at very
high energy density. I begin with the Color Glass Condensate and the Glasma,
matter that controls the earliest times in hadronic collisions. I then describe
the Quark Gluon Plasma, matter produced from the thermalized remnants of the
Glasma. Finally, I describe high density baryonic matter, in particular
Quarkyonic matter. The discussion will be intuitive and based on simple
structural aspects of QCD. There will be some discussion of experimental tests
of these ideas.
