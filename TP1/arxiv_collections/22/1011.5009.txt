Motivated by the study of black attractors in 8D supergravity with 16
supersymmetries, we use the field theory approach and 8D supersymmetry with non
trivial central charges to shed light on the exact duality between heterotic
string on T^2 and type IIA on real connected and compact surfaces {\Sigma}2. We
investigate the two constraints that should be obeyed by {\Sigma}2 and give
their solutions in terms of intersecting 2-cycles as well their classification
using Dynkin diagrams of affine Kac-Moody algebras. It is shown as well that
the moduli space of these dual theories is given by
SO(1,1)x((SO(2,r+2))/(SO(2)xSO(r+2))) where r stands for the rank of the gauge
symmetry G_{r} of the 10D heterotic string on T^2. The remarkable cases
r=-2,-1,0 as well as other features are also investigated.
