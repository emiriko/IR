A brief account of the phenomenon of photon oscillations into sub-eV mass
hidden photons is given and used to estimate the flux and properties of these
hypothetical particles from the Sun. A new generation of dedicated helioscopes,
the Solar Hidden Photon Search (SHIPS) in the Hamburg Observatory amongst them,
will cover a vast region of parameter space.
