We use high-temperature series expansions to obtain thermodynamic properties
of the quantum compass model, and to investigate the phase transition on the
square and simple cubic lattices. On the square lattice we obtain evidence for
a phase transition, consistent with recent Monte Carlo results. On the simple
cubic lattice the same procedure provides no sign of a transition, and we
conjecture that there is no finite temperature transition in this case.
