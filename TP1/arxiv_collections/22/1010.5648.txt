Intertemporal decision making involves choices among options whose effects
occur at different moments. These choices are influenced not only by the effect
of rewards value perception at different moments, but also by the time
perception effect. One of the main difficulties that affect standard
experiments involving intertemporal choices is the simultaneity of both effects
on time discounting. In this paper, we unify the psycophysical laws and
discount value functions using the one-parameter exponential and logaritmic
functions from nonextensive statistical mechanics. Also, we propose to measure
the degree of inconsistency. This quantity allow us to discriminate both
effects of time and value perception on discounting process and, by
integration, obtain other main quantities like impulsivity and discount
functions.
