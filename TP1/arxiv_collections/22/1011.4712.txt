Since the first theoretical proposal by Berezinskii, an odd-frequency
superconductivity has encountered the fundamental problems on its thermodynamic
stability and rigidity of a homogenous state accompanied by unphysical Meissner
effect. Recently, Solenov {\it et al}. [Phys. Rev. B {\bf 79} (2009) 132502.]
have asserted that the path-integral formulation gets rid of the difficulties
leading to a stable homogenous phase with an ordinary Meissner effect. Here, we
show that it is crucial to choose the appropriate saddle-point solution that
minimizes the effective free energy, which was assumed {\it implicitly} in the
work by Solenov and co-workers. We exhibit the path-integral framework for the
odd-frequency superconductivity with general type of pairings, including an
argument on the retarded functions via the analytic continuation to the real
axis.
