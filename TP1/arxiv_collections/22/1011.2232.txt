We analyze our accurate kinematical data for the old clusters in the inner
regions of M31. These velocities are based on high S/N Hectospec data (Caldwell
et al 2010). The data are well suited for analysis of M31's inner regions
because we took particular care to correct for contamination by unresolved
field stars from the disk and bulge in the fibers. The metal poor clusters show
kinematics which are compatible with a pressure-supported spheroid. The
kinematics of metal-rich clusters, however, argue for a disk population. In
particular the innermost region (inside 2 kpc) shows the kinematics of the x2
family of bar periodic orbits, arguing for the existence of an inner Lindblad
resonance in M31.
