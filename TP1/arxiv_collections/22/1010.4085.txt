In this paper, with the Parikh-Wilczek tunnelling framework the positions of
the event horizon of the Vaidya black hole and the Vaidya-Bonner black hole are
calculated respectively. We find that the event horizon and the apparent
horizon of these two black holes correspond respectively to the two turning
points of the Hawking radiation tunnelling barrier. That is, the quantum
ergosphere coincides with the tunnelling barrier. Our calculation also implies
that the Hawking radiation comes from the apparent horizon.
