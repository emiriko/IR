We present zero field muon spin lattice relaxation measurements of a
Dysprosium triangle molecular magnet. The local magnetic fields sensed by the
implanted muons indicate the coexistence of static and dynamic internal
magnetic fields below $T^* ~35$ K. Bulk magnetization and heat capacity
measurements show no indication of magnetic ordering below this temperature. We
attribute the static fields to the slow relaxation of the magnetization in the
ground state of Dy3. The fluctuation time of the dynamic part of the field is
estimated to be ~0.55 $\mu$s at low temperatures
