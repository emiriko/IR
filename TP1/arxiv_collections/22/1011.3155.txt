Crowd synchrony and quorum sensing arise when a large number of dynamical
elements communicate with each other via a common information pool. Previous
evidence in different fields, including chemistry, biology and civil
engineering, has shown that this type of coupling leads to synchronization,
when coupling is instantaneous and the number of coupled elements is large
enough. Here we consider a situation in which the transmission of information
between the system components and the coupling pool is not instantaneous. To
that end, we model a system of semiconductor lasers optically coupled to a
central laser with a delay. Our results show that, even though the lasers are
non-identical due to their distinct optical frequencies, zero-lag
synchronization arises. By changing a system parameter, we can switch between
two different types of synchronization transition. The dependence of the
transition with respect to the delay-coupling parameters is studied.
