It is shown that in the ultra-high energy neutrino interactions the higher
twist corrections brought about by the non-conservation of the top-bottom
current dramatically change the longitudinal structure function, $F_L$. To the
Double Leading Log Approximation simple and numerically accurate formulas for
$F_L$ and $\sigma^{\nu N}$ are derived.
