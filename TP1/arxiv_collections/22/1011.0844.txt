The effects of an intracavity photonic crystal in a multimode optical
parametric oscillator are studied, with a special focus on quantum
fluctuations. The capability to either stimulate or inhibit the spatial
instability, lowering or increasing the parametric threshold, allows to control
the intensity fluctuations and correlations. A significative quantum noise
reduction and an increase of the range of squeezed quadratures are found above
threshold where spatial Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen entanglement and inseparability
are found.
