An overview on the prospects for Higgs Boson searches with the CMS detector
is presented. Projections have been made to estimate the potential to a
possible discovery or exclusion of the Higgs Boson during the run at a center
of mass energy of 7 TeV at the LHC, with a recorded integrated luminosity of
approximately 1 fb-1, conditions expected by the end of 2011
