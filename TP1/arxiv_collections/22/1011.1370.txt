Calculational results are presented for the fine-structure splitting of the
2^3P state of helium and helium-like ions with the nuclear charge Z up to 10.
Theoretical predictions are in agreement with the latest experimental results
for the helium fine-structure intervals as well as with the most of the
experimental data available for light helium-like ions. Comparing the
theoretical value of the 2^3P_0-2^3P_1 interval in helium with the experimental
result [T. Zelevinsky et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 95, 203001 (2005)], we determine
the value of the fine-structure constant \alpha with an accuracy of 31 parts
per billion.
