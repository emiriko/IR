We extend the holomorphic analytic torsion classes of Bismut and K\"ohler to
arbitrary projective morphisms between smooth algebraic complex varieties. To
this end, we propose an axiomatic definition and give a classification of the
theories of generalized holomorphic analytic torsion classes for arbitrary
projective morphisms.
