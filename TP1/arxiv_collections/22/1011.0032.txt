We calculate experimentally relevant properties of trapped fermionic alkaline
earth atoms in an optical lattice, modeled by the SU(N) Hubbard model. Our
calculation is accurate when the temperature is much larger than the tunneling
rate, similar to current regimes in ultracold atom experiments. In addition to
exploring the Mott insulator-metal crossover, we calculate final temperatures
achieved by the standard experimental protocol of adiabatically ramping from a
non-interacting gas, as a function of initial gas temperature and final state
lattice parameters. Of particular experimental interest, we find that
increasing $N$ gives substantially \textit{colder} Mott insulators, up to more
than a factor of five for relevant parameters. This cooling happens for all
$N$, fixing the initial entropy, or for all $N \lsim 20$ (the exact value
depends on dimensionality), fixing the initial temperature.
