Time-dependent visualisations of large-scale direct and large-eddy
simulations (DNS and LES) of a turbulent boundary layer reaching up to
$Re_\theta=4300$ are presented. The focus of the present fluid dynamics video
is on analysing the coherent vortical structures in the boundary layer: It is
clearly shown that hairpin vortices are indeed present in the simulation data,
however they are characteristic remainders of the laminar-turbulent transition
at lower Reynolds numbers. At higher $Re$ (say $Re_\theta>2000$), these
structures are no longer seen as being dominant; the coherence is clearly lost,
both in the near-wall region as well as in the outer layer of the boundary
layer. Note, however, that large-scale streaks in the streamwise velocity,
which have their peak energy at about half the boundary-layer thickness, are
unambiguously observed.
