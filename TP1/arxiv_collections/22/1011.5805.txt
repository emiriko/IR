Measurement of the Higgs coupling to W-bosons is an important test of our
understanding of the electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism. We study the
sensitivity of the International Linear Collider (ILC) to the presence of
anomalous HW+W- couplings using ZH -> nu nu WW* -> nu nu 4j events. Using an
effective Lagrangian approach, we calculate the differential decay rates of the
Higgs boson including the effects of new dimension-5 operators. We present a
Monte Carlo simulation of events at the ILC, using a full detector simulation
based on geant4 and a real event reconstruction chain. Expected constraints on
the anomalous couplings are given.
