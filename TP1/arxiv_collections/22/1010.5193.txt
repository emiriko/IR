We present results of the $Q^{-1}$ and period shift, $\Delta P$, for $^3$He
confined in a 98% nominal open aerogel on a torsion pendulum. The aerogel is
compressed uniaxially by 10% along a direction aligned to the torsion pendulum
axis and was grown within a 400 $\mu$m tall pancake (after compression) similar
to an Andronikashvili geometry. The result is a high $Q$ pendulum able to
resolve $Q^{-1}$ and mass coupling of the impurity-limited $^3$He over the
whole temperature range. After measuring the empty cell background, we filled
the cell above the critical point and observe a temperature dependent period
shift, $\Delta P$, between 100 mK and 3 mK that is 2.9$%$ of the period shift
(after filling) at 100 mK. The $Q^{-1}$ due to the $^3$He decreases by an order
of magnitude between 100 mK and 3 mK at a pressure of $0.14\pm0.03$ bar. We
compare the observable quantities to the corresponding calculated $Q^{-1}$ and
period shift for bulk $^3$He.
