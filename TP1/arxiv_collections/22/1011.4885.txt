Our goal is to assess Gaia's performance on the period recovery of short
period (p < 2 hours) and small amplitude variability. To reach this goal first
we collected the properties of variable stars that fit the requirements
described above. Then we built a database of synthetic light-curves with short
period and low amplitude variability with time sampling that follows the Gaia
nominal scanning law and with noise level corresponding to the expected
photometric precision of Gaia. Finally we performed period search on the
synthetic light-curves to obtain period recovery statistics. This work extends
our previous period recovery studies to short period variable stars which have
non-stationary Fourier spectra.
