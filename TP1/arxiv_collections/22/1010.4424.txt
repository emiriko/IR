The onset and melting of locally staggered charge/orbital correlations is
investigated within a two-orbital correlated electron model with inter-orbital
and inter-site Coulomb interactions. Beyond the critical doping concentration
x_c ~ 0.2, the (pi,pi,pi) staggered orbital order in the ferromagnet is found
to be stabilized at finite temperature. The CE-type orbital correlation
exhibits a sharp onset close to the Curie temperature and rapid thermal
melting, which provides quantitative understanding of the (pi/2,pi/2,0) feature
observed near T_c in neutron scattering experiments. In the zig-zag AF state,
the CE-type orbital correlations are found to be even more readily stabilized,
but only within a narrow doping regime around x=0.5.
