We study three dimensional insulators with inversion symmetry, in which other
point group symmetries, such as time reversal, are generically absent. Their
band topology is found to be classified by the parities of occupied states at
time reversal invariant momenta (TRIM parities), and by three Chern numbers.
The TRIM parities of any insulator must satisfy a constraint: their product
must be +1. The TRIM parities also constrain the Chern numbers modulo two. When
the Chern numbers vanish, a magneto-electric response parameterized by "theta"
is defined and is quantized to theta= 0, 2pi. Its value is entirely determined
by the TRIM parities. These results may be useful in the search for magnetic
topological insulators with large theta. A classification of inversion
symmetric insulators is also given for general dimensions. An alternate
geometrical derivation of our results is obtained by using the entanglement
spectrum of the ground state wave-function.
