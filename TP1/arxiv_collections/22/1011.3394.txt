Dusty Wolf-Rayet stars are few but remarkable in terms of dust production
rates (up to one millionth of solar mass per year). Infrared excesses
associated to mass-loss are found in the sub-types WC8 and WC9. Few WC9d stars
are hosting a "pinwheel" nebula, indirect evidence of a companion star around
the primary. While few other WC9d stars have a dust shell which has been barely
resolved so far, the available angular resolution offered by single telescopes
is insufficient to confirm if they also host "pinwheel" nebulae or not. In this
article, we present the possible detection of such nebula around the star
WR118. We discuss about the potential of interferometry to image more
"pinwheel" nebulae around other WC9d stars.
