We propose a technique for efficient mid-range wireless power transfer
between two coils, by adapting the process of adiabatic passage for a
coherently driven two-state quantum system to the realm of wireless energy
transfer. The proposed technique is shown to be robust to noise, resonant
constraints, and other interferences that exist in the neighborhood of the
coils.
