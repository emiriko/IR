Experimental studies of magnetoresistance in high-mobility wide quantum wells
reveal oscillations which appear with an increase in temperature to 10 K and
whose period is close to that of Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations. The observed
phenomenon is identified as magnetointersubband oscillations caused by the
scattering of electrons between two occupied subbands and the third subband
which becomes occupied as a result of thermal activation. These small-period
oscillations are less sensitive to thermal suppression than the largeperiod
magnetointersubband oscillations caused by the scattering between the first and
the second subbands. Theoretical study, based on consideration of electron
scattering near the edge of the third subband, gives a reasonable explanation
of our experimental findings.
