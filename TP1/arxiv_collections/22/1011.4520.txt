Recently, an analysis of data from the Fermi Gamma Ray Space Telescope has
revealed a flux of gamma rays concentrated around the inner ~0.5 degrees of the
Milky Way, with a spectrum that is sharply peaked at 2-4 GeV. If interpreted as
the products of annihilating dark matter, this signal implies that the dark
matter consists of particles with a mass between 7.3 and 9.2 GeV annihilating
primarily to charged leptons. This mass range is very similar to that required
to accommodate the signals reported by CoGeNT and DAMA/LIBRA. In addition to
gamma rays, the dark matter is predicted to produce energetic electrons and
positrons in the Inner Galaxy, which emit synchrotron photons as a result of
their interaction with the galactic magnetic field. In this letter, we
calculate the flux and spectrum of this synchrotron emission assuming that the
gamma rays from the Galactic Center originate from dark matter, and compare the
results to measurements from the WMAP satellite. We find that a sizable flux of
hard synchrotron emission is predicted in this scenario, and that this can
easily account for the observed intensity, spectrum, and morphology of the
"WMAP Haze".
