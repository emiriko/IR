We present some results about a novel damping mechanism of r-mode
oscillations in neutron stars due to processes that change the number of
protons, neutrons and electrons. Deviations from equilibrium of the number
densities of the various species lead to the appearance in the Euler equations
of the system of a dissipative mechanism, the so-called rocket effect. The
evolution of the r-mode oscillations of a rotating neutron star are influenced
by the rocket effect and we present estimates of the corresponding damping
timescales. In the description of the system we employ a two-fluid model, with
one fluid consisting of all the charged components locked together by the
electromagnetic interaction, while the second fluid consists of superfluid
neutrons. Both components can oscillate however the rocket effect can only
efficiently damp the countermoving r-mode oscillations, with the two fluids
oscillating out of phase. In our analysis we include the mutual friction
dissipative process between the neutron superfluid and the charged component.
We neglect the interaction between the two r-mode oscillations as well as
effects related with the crust of the star. Moreover, we use a simplified model
of neutron star assuming a uniform mass distribution.
