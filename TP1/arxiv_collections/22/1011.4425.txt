We discuss the conditions required for an optimal SASE FEL operation when
bunch compression techniques are exploited to enhance the bunch peak current.
We discuss the case of velocity bunching and magnetic bunch compression. With
the reference to the latter technique we provide a quantitative estimate of the
amount of laser heater power necessary to suppress the micro-bunching
instability without creating any problem to the SASE dynamics
