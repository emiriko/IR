The Sub-keV Atom Reflecting Analyzer (SARA) instrument on the Indian
Chandrayaan-1 spacecraft has produced for the first time an image of a lunar
magnetic anomaly in backscattered hydrogen atoms. The image shows that a
partial void of the solar wind, a mini-magnetosphere, is formed above the
strong magnetic anomaly near the Crisium antipode. The mini-magnetosphere is
360 km across at the surface and is surrounded by a 300-km-thick region of
enhanced plasma flux that results from the solar wind flowing around the
mini-magnetosphere. The mini-magnetosphere is visible only in hydrogen atoms
with energy exceeding 150 eV. Fluxes with energies below 100 eV do not show
corresponding spatial variations. While the high-energy atoms result from the
backscattering process, the origin of the low-energy component is puzzling.
These observations reveal a new class of objects, mini-magnetospheres, and
demonstrate a new observational technique to study airless bodies, imaging in
backscattered neutral atoms.
