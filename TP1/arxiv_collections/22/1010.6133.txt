We have studied the effects of electron correlation on Van Vleck
susceptibility ($\chi_{\rm{VV}}$) in transition metal compounds. A typical
crossover behavior is found for the correlation effect on $\chi_{\rm{VV}}$ as
sweeping spin-orbit interaction, $\lambda$. For a small $\lambda$, orbital
fluctuation plays a dominant role in the correlation enhancement of
$\chi_{\rm{VV}}$; however, the enhancement rate is rather small. In contrast,
for an intermediate $\lambda$, $\chi_{\rm{VV}}$ shows a substantial increase,
accompanied by the development of spin fluctuation. We will discuss the
behavior of $\chi_{\rm{VV}}$ in association with the results of Knight-shift
experiments on Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ and an anomalously large magnetic susceptibility
observed for $5d$ Ir compounds.
