The goal of this article is to come up with interpretation of quantum
phenomena that is both local and deterministic. This is done by the means of
envoking two different metrics, $g_o$ and $g_s$. These two metrics give very
different "speeds of light": $c_o$ and $c_s$, respectively. The $g_o$ and $c_o$
are, respectively, "ordinary" metric and speed of light that we are used to. On
the other hand, $c_s$ is superluminal. In this paper I propose a model in which
newly introduced signals, which are subject to $g_s$, are responsible for key
quantum phenomena.
