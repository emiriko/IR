We use molecular dynamics (MD) to study the kinetics of surface enrichment
(SE) in a stable homogeneous mixture (AB), placed in contact with a surface
which preferentially attracts A. The SE profiles show a characteristic
double-exponential behavior with two length scales: \xi_-, which rapidly
saturates to its equilibrium value, and \xi_+, which diverges as a power-law
with time (\xi_+ \sim t^\theta). We find that hydrodynamic effects result in a
crossover of the growth exponent from \theta \simeq 0.5 to \theta \simeq 1.0.
There is also a corresponding crossover in the growth dynamics of the SE-layer
thickness.
