On the one hand, the explicit Euler scheme fails to converge strongly to the
exact solution of a stochastic differential equation (SDE) with a superlinearly
growing and globally one-sided Lipschitz continuous drift coefficient. On the
other hand, the implicit Euler scheme is known to converge strongly to the
exact solution of such an SDE. Implementations of the implicit Euler scheme,
however, require additional computational effort. In this article we therefore
propose an explicit and easily implementable numerical method for such an SDE
and show that this method converges strongly with the standard order one-half
to the exact solution of the SDE. Simulations reveal that this explicit
strongly convergent numerical scheme is considerably faster than the implicit
Euler scheme.
