We generalize the momentum average approximation to study the properties of
single polarons in models with boson affected hopping, where the fermion-boson
scattering depends explicitly on both the fermion's and the boson's momentum.
As a specific example, we investigate the Edwards fermion-boson model in both
one and two dimensions. In one dimension, this allows us to compare our results
with exact diagonalization results, to validate the accuracy of our
approximation. The generalization to two-dimensional lattices allows us to
calculate the polaron's quasiparticle weight and dispersion throughout the
Brillouin zone and to demonstrate the importance of Trugman loops in generating
a finite effective mass even when the free fermion has an infinite mass.
