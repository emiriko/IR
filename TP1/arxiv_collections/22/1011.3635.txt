The goal of this paper is to show that there are strong relations between
certain Monge-Amp\`ere integrals appearing in holomorphic Morse inequalities,
and asymptotic cohomology estimates for tensor powers of holomorphic line
bundles. Especially, we prove that these relations hold without restriction for
projective surfaces, and in the special case of the volume, i.e. of asymptotic
0-cohomology, for all projective manifolds. These results can be seen as a
partial converse to the Andreotti-Grauert vanishing theorem.
