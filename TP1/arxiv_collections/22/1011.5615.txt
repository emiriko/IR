This paper gives a survey of a diagrammatic approach for fermionic pairing
fluctuations, which are relevant to the BCS-BEC crossover realized with
ultracold Fermi gases. Emphasis will be given to the physical intuition about
the relevant physical processes that can be associated with this approach.
Specific results will be presented for thermodynamic and dynamical quantities,
where a critical comparison with alternative diagrammatic approaches will also
be attempted.
