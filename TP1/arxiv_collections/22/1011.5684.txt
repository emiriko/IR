At total filling factor $\nu_T=1$, interlayer phase coherence in quantum Hall
bilayers can result in a tunneling anomaly resembling the Josephson effect in
the presence of strong fluctuations. The most robust experimental signature of
this effect is a strong enhancement of the tunneling conductance at small
voltages. The height and width of the conductance peak depend strongly on the
area and tunneling amplitude of the samples, applied parallel magnetic field
and temperature. We find that the tunneling experiments are in quantitative
agreement with a theory which treats fluctuations due to meron excitations
phenomenologically and takes tunneling into account perturbatively. We also
discuss the qualitative changes caused by larger tunneling amplitudes, and
provide a possible explanation for recently observed critical currents in
counterflow geometry.
