Underground searches for dark matter involve a complicated interplay of
particle physics, nuclear physics, atomic physics and astrophysics. We attempt
to remove the uncertainties associated with astrophysics by developing the
means to map the observed signal in one experiment directly into a predicted
rate at another. We argue that it is possible to make experimental comparisons
that are completely free of astrophysical uncertainties by focusing on {\em
integral} quantities, such as $g(v_{min})=\int_{v_{min}} dv\, f(v)/v $ and
$\int_{v_{thresh}} dv\, v g(v)$. Direct comparisons are possible when the
$v_{min}$ space probed by different experiments overlap. As examples, we
consider the possible dark matter signals at CoGeNT, DAMA and CRESST-Oxygen. We
find that expected rate from CoGeNT in the XENON10 experiment is higher than
observed, unless scintillation light output is low. Moreover, we determine that
S2-only analyses are constraining, unless the charge yield $Q_y< 2.4 {\, \rm
electrons/keV}$. For DAMA to be consistent with XENON10, we find for
$q_{Na}=0.3$ that the modulation rate must be extremely high ($\gsim 70%$ for
$m_\chi = 7\, \gev$), while for higher quenching factors, it makes an explicit
prediction (0.8 - 0.9 cpd/kg) for the modulation to be observed at CoGeNT.
Finally, we find CDMS-Si, even with a 10 keV threshold, as well as XENON10,
even with low scintillation, would have seen significant rates if the excess
events at CRESST arise from elastic WIMP scattering, making it very unlikely to
be the explanation of this anomaly.
