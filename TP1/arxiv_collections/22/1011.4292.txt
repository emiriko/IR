A supernova (SN) explosion drives stellar debris into the circumstellar
material (CSM) filling a region on a scale of parsecs with X-ray emitting
plasma. The velocities involved in supernova remnants (SNRs), thousands of
km/s, can be directly measured with medium and high-resolution X-ray
spectrometers and add an important dimension to our understanding of the last
stages of the progenitor, the explosion mechanism, and the physics of strong
shocks. After touching on the ingredients of SNR kinematics, I present a
summary of the still-growing measurement results from SNR X-ray observations.
Given the advances in 2D/3D hydrodynamics, data analysis techniques, and
especially X-ray instrumentation, it is clear that our view of SNRs will
continue to deepen in the decades ahead.
