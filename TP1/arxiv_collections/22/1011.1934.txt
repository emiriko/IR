The photon echo quantum memory is based on a controlled rephasing of the
atomic coherence excited by signal light field in the inhomogeneously broadened
resonant line. Here, we propose a novel active mechanism of the atomic
rephasing which provides a perfect retrieval of the stored light field in the
photon echo quantum memory for arbitrary initial inhomogeneous broadening of
the resonant line. It is shown that the rephasing mechanism can exploit all
resonant atoms which maximally increases an optical depth of the resonant
transition that is one of the critical parameters for realization of highly
efficient quantum memory. We also demonstrate that the rephasing mechanism can
be used for various realizations of the photon echo quantum memory that opens a
wide road for its practical realization.
