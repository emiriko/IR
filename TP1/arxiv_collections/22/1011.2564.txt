The aim of this article is to show that the Monge-Kantorovich problem is the
limit of a sequence of entropy minimization problems when a fluctuation
parameter tends down to zero. We prove the convergence of the entropic values
to the optimal transport cost as the fluctuations decrease to zero, and we also
show that the limit points of the entropic minimizers are optimal transport
plans. We investigate the dynamic versions of these problems by considering
random paths and describe the connections between the dynamic and static
problems. The proofs are essentially based on convex and functional analysis.
We also need specific properties of Gamma-convergence which we didn't find in
the literature. Hence we prove these Gamma-convergence results which are
interesting in their own right.
