In Little Higgs models a collective symmetry prevents the Higgs from
acquiring a quadratically divergent mass at one loop. This collective symmetry
is broken by weakly gauged interactions. Terms, like Yukawa couplings, that
display collective symmetry in the bare Lagrangian are generically renormalized
into a sum of terms that do not respect the collective symmetry except possibly
at one renormalization point where the couplings are related so that the
symmetry is restored. We study here the one loop renormalization of a
prototypical example, the Littlest Higgs Model. Some features of the
renormalization of this model are novel, unfamiliar form similar chiral
Lagrangian studies.
