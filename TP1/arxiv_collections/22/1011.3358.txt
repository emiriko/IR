We study CR quadrics satisfying a symmetry property $(\tilde S)$ which is
slightly weaker than the symmetry property $(S)$, recently introduced by W.
Kaup, which requires the existence of an automorphism reversing the gradation
of the Lie algebra of infinitesimal automorphisms of the quadric.
  We characterize quadrics satisfying the $(\tilde S)$ property in terms of
their Levi-Tanaka algebras. In many cases the $(\tilde S)$ property implies the
$(S)$ property; this holds in particular for compact quadrics.
  We also give a new example of a quadric such that the dimension of the
algebra of positive-degree infinitesimal automorphisms is larger than the
dimension of the quadric.
