The effect of self-affine roughness on solid contact is examined with
molecular dynamics and continuum calculations. The contact area and normal and
lateral stiffnesses rise linearly with the applied load, and the load rises
exponentially with decreasing separation between surfaces. Results for a wide
range of roughnesses, system sizes and Poisson ratios can be collapsed using
Persson's contact theory for continuous elastic media. The atomic scale
response at the interface between solids has little affect on the area or
normal stiffness, but can greatly reduce the lateral stiffness. The scaling of
this effect with system size and roughness is discussed.
