The topography of the royal pyramids of the 12th dynasty is investigated in
its historical and chronological context, in order to highlight connections
between the architectural choices, the religious ideas and the traditions
inspiring the reign of the corresponding pharaohs. A close, explicit connection
with the double building projects carried out more than six centuries before by
Snefru at Dahshur and at Meidum-Seila comes out. This connection involved
geometry, perspective and astronomical alignments in the progressive planning
of the pyramidal complexes. In such a context, the architectural choices of the
last great king of the dynasty, Amenemhet III - who built two pyramids, one at
Dahshur and the other at Hawara - appear to be due mostly to symbolic, as
opposed to practical, reasons.
