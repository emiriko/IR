The modification of simplest equation method to look for exact solutions of
nonlinear partial differential equations is presented. Using this method we
obtain exact solutions of generalized Korteweg-de Vries equation with cubic
source and exact solutions of third-order Kudryashov-Sinelshchikov equation
describing nonlinear waves in liquids with gas bubbles.
