A new set of parameters to describe the word frequency behavior of texts is
proposed. The analogy between the word frequency distribution and the
Bose-distribution is suggested and the notion of "temperature" is introduced
for this case. The calculations are made for English, Ukrainian, and the
Guinean Maninka languages. The correlation between in-deep language structure
(the level of analyticity) and the defined parameters is shown to exist.
