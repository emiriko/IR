A brief review on the theoretical status of hadronic charm decays is
presented. We emphasize the analyses based on the diagrammatic approach and the
connection of weak annihilation with final-state rescattering. The topics on
the $D^0$-$\bar D^0$ mixing and the baryonic charm decay $D_s^+\to p\bar n$ are
sketched.
