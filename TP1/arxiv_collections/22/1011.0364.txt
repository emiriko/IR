Inelastic neutron scattering in variable magnetic field and high-field
magnetization measurements, at the milikelvin temperature range, were performed
to gain insight into the low-energy magnetic excitation spectrum and the
field-induced level crossings in the molecular spin cluster \{Cr$_8$\}-cubane.
These complementary techniques provide consistent estimates of the lowest
level-crossing field. The overall features of the experimental data are
explained using an isotropic Heisenberg model, based on three distinct exchange
interactions linking the eight Cr$^{\text{III}}$ paramagnetic centers (spins $s
= 3/2$), that is supplemented with a relatively large molecular magnetic
anisotropy term for the lowest S=1 multiplet. It is noted that the existence of
the anisotropy is clearly evident from the magnetic field dependence of the
excitations in the INS measurements, while the magnetization measurements are
not sensitive to its effects.
