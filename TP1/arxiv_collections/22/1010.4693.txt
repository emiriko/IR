In this letter we experimentally demonstrate second harmonic conversion in
the opaque region of a GaAs cavity with efficiencies of the order of 0.1% at
612nm, using 3ps pump pulses having peak intensities of order of 10MW/cm2. We
show that the conversion efficiency of the inhomogeneous, phase-locked second
harmonic component is a quadratic function of the cavity factor Q.
