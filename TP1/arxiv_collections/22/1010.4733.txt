The role of non-local Coulomb correlations in the honeycomb lattice is
investigated within cluster dynamical mean field theory combined with
finite-temperature exact diagonalization. The paramagnetic semi-metal to
insulator transition is found to be in excellent agreement with finite-size
determinantal Quantum Monte Carlo simulations and with cluster dynamical mean
field calculations based on the continuous-time Quantum Monte Carlo approach.
As expected, the critical Coulomb energy is much lower than within a local or
single-site formulation. Short-range correlations are shown to give rise to a
pseudogap and concomitant non-Fermi-liquid behavior within a narrow range below
the Mott transition.
