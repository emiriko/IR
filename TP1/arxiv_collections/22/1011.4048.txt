We study ballistic transport properties of graphene with a low concentration
of vacancies or adatoms. The conductance of graphene doped to the Dirac point
is found to depend on the relative distribution of impurities among different
sites of the honeycomb lattice labeled in general by six colors. The
conductivity is shown to be sensitive to the crystal orientation if adatom
sites have a preferred color. Our theory is confirmed by numerical simulations
using recursive Green's functions with no adjustable parameters.
