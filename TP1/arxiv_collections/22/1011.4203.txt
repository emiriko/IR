Mobility of band carriers scattered on donors, partially ionized, partially
neutral, is considered in general and calculated for crystals belonging to
AIII-BV group. As neutral impurity we have constructed the hydrogen-like model.
It is shown that dependence of mobility on temperature is determined by
relation between number of ionized and neutral donors and by average energy of
electrons.
