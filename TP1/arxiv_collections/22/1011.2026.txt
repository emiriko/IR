We present a systematic analysis of the X-ray spectra of NGC 1313 X-1 and NGC
1313 X-2, using six years of XMM-Newton observations (17 observations). We
fitted the continuum with a Comptonization model plus a multicolor blackbody
disc, that describes the effects of an accretion disc plus an optically thick
corona. We checked the consistency of this spectral model on the basis of the
variability patterns of its spectral parameters. We found that the two sources
show different spectral states. We tentatively interpret the observed behaviour
of NGC 1313 X-1 within the framework of super-Eddington accretion and that of
NGC 1313 X-2 within the framework of near Eddington accretion. We also
attempted to determine the chemical abundances in the local environment of NGC
1313 X-1 and X-2, analyzing the RGS spectra of the longest observation
available (122 ksec). The results appear to indicate solar metallicity for the
local environment of NGC 1313 X-1 and sub-solar metallicity for NGC 1313 X-2.
