With the energy scales opened up by RHIC and LHC the age of high-pT physics
is upon us. This has created new opportunities and novel mysteries, both of
which will be explored in this thesis. The possibility now exists
experimentally to exploit these high momentum particles to uniquely probe the
unprecedented state of matter produced in heavy ion collisions. At the same
time naive theoretical expectations have been dashed by data.
  The first puzzle we confront is that of the enormous intermediate-pT
azimuthal anisotropy, or v2, of jets observed at RHIC. The second puzzle is the
surprisingly similar suppression of light mesons and nonphotonic electrons,
which precludes perturbative predictions predicated on gluon bremsstrahlung
radiation as the dominant energy loss channel. Near qualitative agreement
results from including collisional energy loss and integrating over the
fluctuating jet pathlengths. Another conjecture for heavy quark energy loss
comes via explicit construction using the AdS/CFT correspondence; the momentum
loss of a hanging dragging string moving through the deconfined plasma leads to
qualitative agreement with heavy quark decay data. We propose a robust test to
experimentally differentiate these two competing ideas: the ratio of charm to
bottom suppression rapidly approaches 1 for pQCD but is independent of momentum
and well below 1 for AdS/CFT. Finally as a warmup problem to calculating the
photon bremsstrahlung associated with jet energy loss we quantify improvements
to the perturbative estimates of the Ter-Mikayelian effect.
