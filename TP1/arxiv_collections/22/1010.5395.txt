We study the effects of decoherence on the entanglement generated by Unruh
effect in noninertial frames by using bit flip, phase damping and depolarizing
channels. It is shown that decoherence strongly influences the initial state
entanglement. The entanglement sudden death can happens irrespective of the
acceleration of the noninertial frame under the action of phase flip and phase
damping channels. It is investigated that an early sudden death happens for
large acceleration under the depolarizing environment. Moreover, the
entanglement increases for a highly decohered phase flip channel.
