We study continuous quantum phase transitions that can occur in bilayer
fractional quantum Hall (FQH) systems as the interlayer tunneling and
interlayer repulsion are tuned. We introduce a slave-particle gauge theory
description of a series of continuous transitions from the (ppq) Abelian
bilayer states to a set of non-Abelian FQH states, which we dub the orbifold
FQH states, of which the Z4 parafermion (Read-Rezayi) state is a special case.
This provides an example in which Z2 electron fractionalization leads to
non-Abelian topological phases. The naive "ideal" wave functions and ideal
Hamiltonians associated with these orbifold states do not in general correspond
to incompressible phases, but instead lie at a nearby critical point. We
discuss this unusual situation from the perspective of the pattern of
zeros/vertex algebra frameworks and discuss implications for the conceptual
foundations of these approaches. Due to the proximity in the phase diagram of
these non-Abelian states to the (ppq) bilayer states, they may be
experimentally relevant, both as candidates for describing the plateaus in
single-layer systems at filling fraction 8/3 and 12/5, and as a way to tune to
non-Abelian states in double-layer or wide quantum wells.
