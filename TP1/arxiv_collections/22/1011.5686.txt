We introduce a perceptron version of the Generalized Random Energy Model, and
prove a quenched Sanov type large deviation principle for the empirical
distribution of the random energies. The dual of the rate function has a
representation through a variational formula which is closely related to the
Parisi variational formula for the SK-model.
