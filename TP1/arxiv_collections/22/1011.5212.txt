This article summarizes the first measurements of inclusive beauty production
cross section in proton-proton collisions at sqrt(s)=7 TeV and central
rapidities. The results are based on different techniques, such as the
identification of semileptonic b-decays into muons and inclusive jet
measurements with secondary vertex tagging. The measurements probe b-quark
production in different regions of transverse momenta. The experimental results
are compared with next-to-leading order QCD predictions and various Monte Carlo
models.
