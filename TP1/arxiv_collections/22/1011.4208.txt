By open neighbourhood of an open subset $\Omega$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$ we mean an
open subset $\Omega'$ of $\mathbb{C}^n$ such that
$\mathbb{R}^n\cap\Omega'=\Omega.$ A well known result of H. Grauert implies
that any open subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$ admits a fundamental system of Stein
open neighbourhoods in $\mathbb{C}^n$. Another way to state this property is to
say that each open subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$ is Stein. We shall prove a similar
result in the subanalytic category, so, under the assumption that $\Omega$ is a
subanalytic relatively compact open subset in a real analytic manifold, we show
that $\Omega$ admits a fundamental system of subanalytic Stein open
neighbourhoods in any of its complexifications.
