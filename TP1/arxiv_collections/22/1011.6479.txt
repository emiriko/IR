Traditionally, the major objective in phase I trials is to identify a
working-dose for subsequent studies, whereas the major endpoint in phase II and
III trials is treatment efficacy. The dose sought is typically referred to as
the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Several statistical methodologies have been
proposed to select the MTD in cancer phase I trials. In this manuscript, we
focus on a Bayesian adaptive design, known as escalation with overdose control
(EWOC). Several aspects of this design are discussed, including large sample
properties of the sequence of doses selected in the trial, choice of prior
distributions, and use of covariates. The methodology is exemplified with
real-life examples of cancer phase I trials. In particular, we show in the
recently completed ABR-217620 (naptumomab estafenatox) trial that omitting an
important predictor of toxicity when dose assignments to cancer patients are
determined results in a high percent of patients experiencing severe side
effects and a significant proportion treated at sub-optimal doses.
