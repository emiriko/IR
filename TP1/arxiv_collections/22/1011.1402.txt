We show that the propagation of a N-photon field in space and time can be
described by a generalized Huygens-Fresnel integral. Using two examples, we
then demonstrate how familiar Fourier optics techniques applied to a N-photon
wave function can be used to engineer the propagation of entanglement and to
design the way the detection of one photon shapes the state of the others.
