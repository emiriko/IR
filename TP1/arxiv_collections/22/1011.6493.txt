We investigate the potential of high-precision astrometry with GAIA for
detection of giant planetary companions to nearby white dwarfs. If one
considers that, to date, no confirmed planets around single white dwarfs are
known, the results from GAIA will be crucial to study the late-stage evolution
of planetary systems and to verify the possibility that 2nd-generation planets
are formed.
