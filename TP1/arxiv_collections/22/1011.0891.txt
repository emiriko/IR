Preliminary experiments have been performed to investigate the effects of
radiative cooling on plasma jets. Thin (3 um - 5 um) conical shells were
irradiated with an intense laser, driving jets with velocities > 100 km/s.
Through use of different target materials - aluminium, copper and gold - the
degree of radiative losses was altered, and their importance for jet
collimation investigated. A number of temporally resoved optical diagnostics
was used, providing information about the jet evolution. Gold jets were seen to
be narrower than those from copper targets, while aluminium targets produced
the least collimated flows.
