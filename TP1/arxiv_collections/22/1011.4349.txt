Let $\{X_t, t \geq 1\}$ be a sequence of identically distributed and pairwise
asymptotically independent random variables with regularly varying tails and
$\{ \Theta_t, t\geq1 \}$ be a sequence of positive random variables independent
of the sequence $\{X_t, t \geq 1\}$. We shall discuss the tail probabilities
and almost sure convergence of $\xinf=\sum_{t=1}^{\infty}\Theta_t X_t^{+}$
(where $X^+=\max\{0,X\}$) and $\max_{1\leq k<\infty} \sum_{t=1}^{k}\Theta_t
X_t$ and provide some sufficient conditions motivated by Denisov and Zwart
(2007) as alternatives to the usual moment conditions. In particular, we
illustrate how the conditions on the slowly varying function involved in the
tail probability of $X_1$ helps to control the tail behavior of the randomly
weighted sums.
  Note that, the above results allow us to choose $X_1, X_2,...$ as independent
and identically distributed positive random variables. If $X_1$ has regularly
varying tail of index $-\alpha$, where $\alpha>0$, and if $\{\Theta_t,t\geq1\}$
is a positive sequence of random variables independent of $\{X_t\}$, then it is
known, which can also be obtained from the sufficient conditions above, that
under some appropriate moment conditions on $\{\Theta_t,t\geq1\}$,
$\xinf=\sum_{t=1}^{\infty}\Theta_t X_t$ converges with probability 1 and has
regularly varying tail of index $-\alpha$. Motivated by the converse problems
in Jacobsen et al. (2009) we ask the question that, if $\xinf$ has regularly
varying tail, then does $X_1$ have regularly varying tail under some
appropriate conditions? We obtain appropriate sufficient moment conditions,
including nonvanishing Mellin transform of $\sum_{t=1}^\infty \Theta_t$ along
some vertical line in the complex plane, so that the above is true. We also
show that the condition on the Mellin transform cannot be dropped.
