Smart grid, equipped with modern communication infrastructures, is subject to
possible cyber attacks. Particularly, false report attacks which replace the
sensor reports with fraud ones may cause the instability of the whole power
grid or even result in a large area blackout. In this paper, a trustiness
system is introduced to the controller, who computes the trustiness of
different sensors by comparing its prediction, obtained from Kalman filtering,
on the system state with the reports from sensor. The trustiness mechanism is
discussed and analyzed for the Linear Quadratic Regulation (LQR) controller.
Numerical simulations show that the trustiness system can effectively combat
the cyber attacks to smart grid.
