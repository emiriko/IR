We study the quantum version of a lattice model whose classical counterpart
captures the physics of structural glasses. We discuss the role of quantum
fluctuations in such systems and in particular their interplay with the
amorphous order developed in the glass phase. We show that quantum fluctuations
might facilitate the formation of the glass at low enough temperature. We also
show that the glass transition becomes a first-order transition between a
superfluid and an insulating glass at very low temperature, and is therefore
accompanied by phase coexistence between superfluid and glassy regions.
