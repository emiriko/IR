We show that local realism applied to states characterized by a single quanta
equally and coherently shared between a number of qubits (so-called W states)
produces predictions incompatible with quantum theory. The origin of this
incompatibility is shown to originate from the destructive interference of
amplitude probabilities associated with nonlocal states, a phenomenon that has
no classical analog.
