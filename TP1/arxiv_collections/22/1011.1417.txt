We correlate simultaneously recorded magnetotransport and spatially resolved
magneto optical Kerr effect (MOKE) data in Co2FeAl Heusler compound thin films
micropatterned into Hall bars. Room temperature MOKE images reveal the
nucleation and propagation of domains in an externally applied magnetic field
and are used to extract a macrospin corresponding to the mean magnetization
direction in the Hall bar. The anisotropic magnetoresistance calculated using
this macrospin is in excellent agreement with magnetoresistance measurements.
This suggests that the magnetotransport in Heusler compounds can be adequately
simulated using simple macrospin models, while the magnetoresistance
contribution due to domain walls is of negligible importance.
