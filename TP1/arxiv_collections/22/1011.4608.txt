The group velocity of a light pulse in photonic band gap material could
considerably deviate from the speed of light in vacuum. Different speeds of a
forward stoke and a pump pulse would enable the Raman compression in metals or
the warm dense matter. A small window of the parameter regime, where the
compression is feasible via the forward Raman scattering, is identified.
