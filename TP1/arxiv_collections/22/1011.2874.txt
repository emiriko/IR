Long-term, uniform series of UBVR observations of T Tauri and Herbig Ae stars
obtained over 20 yr at the Maidanak Observatory as part of the ROTOR program
are analyzed. We find a linear relationship between the characteristic
variability time scale and the bolometric luminosity of the star+disk system:
the higher the luminosity, the slower the brightness variations. This
dependence is valid over a wide range of masses and luminosities, from T Tauri
stars to Herbig Ae stars. On average, the variability time scale is one-quarter
the Keplerian period at the dust-sublimation radius, which is known from
interferometric observations. Some T Tauri stars have periods from 25 to 120
days, which are preserved over several observing seasons. These periods
correspond to Keplerian orbits with semi-major axes from 0.14 to 0.52 AU. The
results obtained provide indirect evidence for the existence of protoplanets in
the gas-dust disks of stars in early stages of their evolution toward the main
sequence.
