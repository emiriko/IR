We investigate the structure of the double Ringel-Hall algebras associated
with cyclic quivers and its connections with quantum loop algebras of
$\mathfrak{gl}_n$, affine quantum Schur algebras and affine Hecke algebras.
This includes their Drinfeld-Jimbo type presentation, affine quantum Schur-Weyl
reciprocity, representations of affine quantum Schur algebras, and connections
with various existing works by Lusztig, Varagnolo-Vasserot, Schiffmann, Hubery,
Chari-Pressley, Frenkel-Mukhin, etc. We will also discuss conjectures on a
realization of Beilinson-Lusztig-MacPherson type and Lusztig type integral
forms for double Ringel-Hall algebras.
