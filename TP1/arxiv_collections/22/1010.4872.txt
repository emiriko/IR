Ferrimagnetic Mn3Ga exhibits a unique combination of low saturation
magnetization (Ms = 0.11 MA m-1) and high perpendicular anisotropy with a
uniaxial anisotropy constant of Ku = 0.89 MJ m-3. Epitaxial c-axis films
exhibit spin polarization as high as 58%, measured using point contact Andreev
reflection. These epitaxial films will be able to support thermally stable
sub-10 nm bits for spin transfer torque memories.
