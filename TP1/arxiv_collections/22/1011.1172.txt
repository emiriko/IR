We study the underlying mathematical properties of various partial order
models of concurrency based on transition systems, Petri nets, and event
structures, and show that the concurrent behaviour of these systems can be
captured in a uniform way by two simple and general dualities of local
behaviour. Such dualities are used to define new mu-calculi and logic games for
the analysis of concurrent systems with partial order semantics. Some results
of this work are: the definition of a number of mu-calculi which, in some
classes of systems, induce the same identifications as some of the best known
bisimulation equivalences for concurrency; and the definition of (infinite)
higher-order logic games for bisimulation and model-checking, where the players
of the games are given (local) monadic second-order power on the sets of
elements they are allowed to play. More specifically, we show that our games
are sound and complete, and therefore, determined; moreover, they are decidable
in the finite case and underpin novel decision procedures for bisimulation and
model-checking. Since these mu-calculi and logic games generalise well-known
fixpoint logics and game-theoretic decision procedures for concurrent systems
with interleaving semantics, the results herein give some of the groundwork for
the design of a logic-based, game-theoretic framework for studying, in a
uniform way, several concurrent systems regardless of whether they have an
interleaving or a partial order semantics.
