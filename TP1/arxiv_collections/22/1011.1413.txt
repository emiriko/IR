In two recent papers the mesoscale model Meso-NH, joint with the
Astro-Meso-NH package, has been validated at Dome C, Antarctica, for the
characterization of the optical turbulence. It has been shown that the
meteorological parameters (temperature and wind speed, from which the optical
turbulence depends on) as well as the Cn2 profiles above Dome C were correctly
statistically reproduced. The three most important derived parameters that
characterize the optical turbulence above the internal antarctic plateau: the
surface layer thickness, the seeing in the free-atmosphere and in the total
atmosphere showed to be in a very good agreement with observations. Validation
of Cn2 has been performed using all the measurements of the optical turbulence
vertical distribution obtained in winter so far. In this paper, in order to
investigate the ability of the model to discriminate between different
turbulence conditions for site testing, we extend the study to two other
potential astronomical sites in Antarctica: Dome A and South Pole, which we
expect to be characterized by different turbulence conditions. The optical
turbulence has been calculated above these two sites for the same 15 nights
studied for Dome C and a comparison between the three sites has been performed.
