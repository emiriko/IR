We establish a lower bound for the representation dimension of all the
classical Hecke algebras of types A, B and D. For all the type A algebras, and
most of the algebras of types B and D, we also establish upper bounds.
Moreover, we establish bounds for the representation dimension of group
algebras of some symmetric groups.
