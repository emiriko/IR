We present photometry of the giant extrasolar planet WASP-4b at 3.6 and 4.5
micron taken with the Infrared Array Camera on board the Spitzer Space
Telescope as part of Spitzer's extended warm mission. We find secondary eclipse
depths of 0.319+/-0.031% and 0.343+/-0.027% for the 3.6 and 4.5 micron bands,
respectively and show model emission spectra and pressure-temperature profiles
for the planetary atmosphere. These eclipse depths are well fit by model
emission spectra with water and other molecules in absorption, similar to those
used for TrES-3 and HD 189733b. Depending on our choice of model, these results
indicate that this planet has either a weak dayside temperature inversion or no
inversion at all. The absence of a strong thermal inversion on this highly
irradiated planet is contrary to the idea that highly irradiated planets are
expected to have inversions, perhaps due the presence of an unknown absorber in
the upper atmosphere. This result might be explained by the modestly enhanced
activity level of WASP-4b's G7V host star, which could increase the amount of
UV flux received by the planet, therefore reducing the abundance of the unknown
stratospheric absorber in the planetary atmosphere as suggested in Knutson et
al. (2010). We also find no evidence for an offset in the timing of the
secondary eclipse and place a 2 sigma upper limit on |ecos(omega)| of 0.0024,
which constrains the range of tidal heating models that could explain this
planet's inflated radius.
