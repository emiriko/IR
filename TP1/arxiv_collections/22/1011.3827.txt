We describe a physics simulation software framework, MAGE, that is based on
the GEANT4 simulation toolkit. MAGE is used to simulate the response of
ultra-low radioactive background radiation detectors to ionizing radiation,
specifically the MAJORANA and GERDA neutrinoless double-beta decay experiments.
MAJORANA and GERDA use high-purity germanium detectors to search for the
neutrinoless double-beta decay of 76Ge, and MAGE is jointly developed between
these two collaborations. The MAGE framework contains the geometry models of
common objects, prototypes, test stands, and the actual experiments. It also
implements customized event generators, GEANT4 physics lists, and output
formats. All of these features are available as class libraries that are
typically compiled into a single executable. The user selects the particular
experimental setup implementation at run-time via macros. The combination of
all these common classes into one framework reduces duplication of efforts,
eases comparison between simulated data and experiment, and simplifies the
addition of new detectors to be simulated. This paper focuses on the software
framework, custom event generators, and physics lists.
