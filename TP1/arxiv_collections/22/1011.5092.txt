We present a light curve model of the symbiotic nova PU Vul (Nova Vulpeculae
1979) that shows a long-lasted flat peak with no spectral indication of wind
mass-loss before decline. Our quasi-evolution models consisting of a series of
static solutions explain both the optical flat peak and ultraviolet (UV) light
curve simultaneously. The white dwarf mass is estimated to be ~0.6 Mo. We also
provide a new determination of the reddening, E(B-V) = 0.43 +/- 0.05, from UV
spectral analysis. Theoretical light curve fitting of UV 1455 A provides the
distance of d=3.8 +/- 0.7 kpc.
