We propose to increase the superconducting transition temperature Tc of
strongly correlated materials by designing heterostructures which exhibit a
high pairing energy as a result of magnetic fluctuations. More precisely,
applying an effective theory of the doped Mott insulator, we envisage a bilayer
Hubbard system where both layers exhibit prominent intralayer (intraband)
d-wave superconducting correlations. Introducing a finite asymmetry between the
hole densities of the two layers such that one layer becomes slightly more
underdoped and the other more overdoped, we evidence a visible enhancement of
Tc compared to the optimally doped isolated layer. Using the bonding and
antibonding band basis, we show that the mechanism behind this enhancement of
Tc is the interband pairing correlation mediated by the hole asymmetry which
strives to decrease the paramagnetic nodal contribution to the superfluid
stiffness. For two identical layers, Tc remains comparable to that of the
isolated layer until moderate values of the interlayer single-particle
tunneling term. These heterostructures shed new light on fundamental questions
related to superconductivity.
