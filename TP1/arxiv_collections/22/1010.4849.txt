We investigate here the Central Limit Theorem of the Increment Ratio
Statistic of a multifractional Brownian motion, leading to a CLT for the time
varying Hurst index. The proofs are quite simple relying on Breuer-Major
theorems and an original freezing of time strategy. A simulation study shows
the goodness of fit of this estimator.
