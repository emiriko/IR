We start with the QCD sum rules which are originally based on the idea that
it is the power-like corrections to the parton model which are related to the
confinement. The naive use of the Operator Product Expansion ensures that there
is a 'gap' in the powers of $\Lambda_{QCD}$ which miss the quadratic terms and
start with the quartic term, proportional to the gluon condensate,
$<(G_{\mu\nu}^a)^2>$. We review how this hypothesis stood against various
checks through the last three decades and how it was modified through inclusion
of the missing link, that is quadratic corrections. In field theoretic language
the quadratic corrections are dual to long perturbative series. In the dual
description, the quadratic corrections are conveniently parameterized in terms
of the metric in extra dimensions. We emphasize that the dual models do not
incorporate the so called infrared renormalon.
