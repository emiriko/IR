To improve the presentation we modified the title and used the framework of
perturbation modeling of long-term dynamics so as to present the
Lorentz-Abraham-Dirac equation as the lowest order, asymptotic differential
relation for the velocity of a charged point-like mass. We formulated two
propositions and added two references.
