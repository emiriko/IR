A multi-relational graph maintains two or more relations over a vertex set.
This article defines an algebra for traversing such graphs that is based on an
$n$-ary relational algebra, a concatenative single-relational path algebra, and
a tensor-based multi-relational algebra. The presented algebra provides a
monoid, automata, and formal language theoretic foundation for the construction
of a multi-relational graph traversal engine.
