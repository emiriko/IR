We study striped morphologies induced by magnetic impurities in d-wave
superconductors (DSCs) near optimal doping by self-consistently solving the
Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations based on the $t-t^{\prime }-U-V$ model. For the
single impurity case, it is found that the stable ground state is a modulated
checkerboard pattern. For the two-impurity case, the stripe-like structures in
order parameters are induced due to the impurity-pinning effect. The
modulations of DSC and charge orders share the same period of four lattice
constants (4$a$), which is half the period of modulations in the coexisting
spin order. Interestingly, when three or more impurities are inserted, the
impurities could induce more complex striped morphologies due to quantum
interference. Further experiments of magnetic impurity substitution in DSCs are
expected to check these results.
