The reduced-density-matrix method is an promising candidate for the next
generation electronic structure calculation method; it is equivalent to solve
the Schr\"odinger equation for the ground state. The number of variables is the
same as a four electron system and constant regardless of the electrons in the
system. Thus many researchers have been dreaming of a much simpler method for
quantum mechanics. In this chapter, we give a overview of the reduced-density
matrix method; details of the theories, methods, history, and some new
computational results. Typically, the results are comparable to the CCSD(T)
which is a sophisticated traditional approach in quantum chemistry.
