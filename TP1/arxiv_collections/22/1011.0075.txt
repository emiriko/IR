Chameleon scalar field is a new model, which introduced to provide a
mechanism for exhibiting accelerating universe. Chameleon field has several
interesting aspects, such as field dependence on the local matter density. For
this model we introduce a new kind of potential which has run away form and
satisfies chameleon constraints. The results are acceptable in comparison with
the other potentials which studied up to now.
