We consider the asymptotic behaviour of finite energy solutions to the
one-dimensional defocusing nonlinear wave equation $-u_{tt} + u_{xx} =
|u|^{p-1} u$, where $p > 1$. Standard energy methods guarantee global
existence, but do not directly say much about the behaviour of $u(t)$ as $t \to
\infty$. Note that in contrast to higher-dimensional settings, solutions to the
linear equation $-u_{tt} + u_{xx} = 0$ do not exhibit decay, thus apparently
ruling out perturbative methods for understanding such solutions. Nevertheless,
we will show that solutions for the nonlinear equation behave differently from
the linear equation, and more specifically that we have the average $L^\infty$
decay $\lim_{T \to +\infty} \frac{1}{T} \int_0^T \|u(t)\|_{L^\infty_x(\R)}\ dt
= 0$, in sharp contrast to the linear case. An unusual ingredient in our
arguments is the classical Radamacher differentiation theorem that asserts that
Lipschitz functions are almost everywhere differentiable.
