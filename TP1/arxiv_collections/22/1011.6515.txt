In molecular reactions at the microscopic level the appearance of resonances
has an important influence on the reactivity. It is important to predict when a
bound state transitions into a resonance and how these transitions depend on
various system parameters such as internuclear distances. The dynamics of such
systems are described by the time-independent Schr\"odinger equation and the
resonances are modeled by poles of the S-matrix. Using numerical continuation
methods and bifurcation theory, techniques which find their roots in the study
of dynamical systems, we are able to develop efficient and robust methods to
study the transitions of bound states into resonances. By applying Keller's
Pseudo-Arclength continuation, we can minimize the numerical complexity of our
algorithm. As continuation methods generally assume smooth and well-behaving
functions and the S-matrix is neither, special care has been taken to ensure
accurate results. We have successfully applied our approach in a number of
model problems involving the radial Schr\"odinger equation.
