Entangled inputs can enhance the capacity of quantum channels, this being one
of the consequences of the celebrated result showing the non-additivity of
several quantities relevant for quantum information science. In this work, we
answer the converse question (whether entangled inputs can ever render noisy
quantum channels have maximum capacity) to the negative: No sophisticated
entangled input of any quantum channel can ever enhance the capacity to the
maximum possible value; a result that holds true for all channels both for the
classical as well as the quantum capacity. This result can hence be seen as a
bound as to how "non-additive quantum information can be". As a main result, we
find first practical and remarkably simple computable single-shot bounds to
capacities, related to entanglement measures. As examples, we discuss the qubit
amplitude damping and identify the first meaningful bound for its classical
capacity.
