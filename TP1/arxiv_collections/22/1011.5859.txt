Invariant operator-valued tensor fields on Lie groups are considered. These
define classical tensor fields on Lie groups by evaluating them on a quantum
state. This particular construction, applied on the local unitary group
U(n)xU(n), may establish a method for the identification of entanglement
monotone candidates by deriving invariant functions from tensors being by
construction invariant under local unitary transformations. In particular, for
n=2, we recover the purity and a concurrence related function (Wootters 1998)
as a sum of inner products of symmetric and anti-symmetric parts of the
considered tensor fields. Moreover, we identify a distinguished entanglement
monotone candidate by using a non-linear realization of the Lie algebra of
SU(2)xSU(2). The functional dependence between the latter quantity and the
concurrence is illustrated for a subclass of mixed states parametrized by two
variables.
