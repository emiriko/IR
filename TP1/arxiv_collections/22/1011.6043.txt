Airflow simulation results depend on a good prediction of near wall
turbulence. In this paper a comparative study between different near wall
treatments is presented. It is applied to two test cases: (1) the first
concerns the fully developed plane channel flow (i.e. the flow between two
infinitely large plates). Simulation results are compared to direct numerical
simulation (DNS) data of Moser et al. (1999) for $Re\tau$ = 590 (where $Re\tau$
denotes the friction Reynolds number defined by friction velocity $u\tau$,
kinematics viscosity $v$ and the channel half-width $\delta$); (2) the second
case is a benchmark test for room air distribution (Nielsen, 1990). Simulation
results are compared to experimental data obtained with laser-doppler
anemometry. Simulations were performed with the aid of the commercial CFD code
Fluent (2005). Near wall treatments available in Fluent were tested: Standard
Wall Functions, Non Equilibrium Wall Function and Enhanced Wall Treatment. In
each case, suitable meshes with adequate position for the first near-wall node
are needed. Results of near-wall mean streamwise velocity U+ and turbulent
kinetic energy k+ profiles are presented, variables with the superscript of +
are those non dimensional by the wall friction velocity $u\tau$ and the
kinematic viscosity {\nu}.
