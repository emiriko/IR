Using computer simulations we investigate the homogeneous crystal nucleation
in suspensions of colloidal hard dumbbells. The free energy barriers are
determined by Monte Carlo simulations using the umbrella sampling technique. We
calculate the nucleation rates for the plastic crystal and the aperiodic
crystal phase using the kinetic prefactor as determined from event driven
molecular dynamics simulations. We find good agreement with the nucleation
rates determined from spontaneous nucleation events observed in event driven
molecular dynamics simulations within error bars of one order of magnitude. We
study the effect of aspect ratio of the dumbbells on the nucleation of plastic
and aperiodic crystal phases and we also determine the structure of the
critical nuclei. Moreover, we find that the nucleation of the aligned CP1
crystal phase is strongly suppressed by a high free energy barrier at low
supersaturations and slow dynamics at high supersaturations.
