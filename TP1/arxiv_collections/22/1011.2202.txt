We consider four-dimensional U(1)^4 gauged supergravity, and obtain
asymptotically AdS_4, non-extremal, charged, rotating black holes with one
non-zero U(1) charge. The thermodynamic quantities are computed. We obtain a
generalization that includes a NUT parameter. The general solution has a
discrete symmetry involving inversion of the rotation parameter, and has a
string frame metric that admits a rank-2 Killing-Stackel tensor.
