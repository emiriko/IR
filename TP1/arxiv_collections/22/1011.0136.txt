Kripke Structures and Labelled Transition Systems are the two most prominent
semantic models used in concurrency theory. Both models are commonly believed
to be equi-expressive. One can find many ad-hoc embeddings of one of these
models into the other. We build upon the seminal work of De Nicola and
Vaandrager that firmly established the correspondence between stuttering
equivalence in Kripke Structures and divergence-sensitive branching
bisimulation in Labelled Transition Systems. We show that their embeddings can
also be used for a range of other equivalences of interest, such as strong
bisimilarity, simulation equivalence, and trace equivalence. Furthermore, we
extend the results by De Nicola and Vaandrager by showing that there are
additional translations that allow one to use minimisation techniques in one
semantic domain to obtain minimal representatives in the other semantic domain
for these equivalences.
