We present results of five years of optical (UBVRI) observations of the
very-high-energy gamma-ray blazar 1ES 1011+496 at the MDM Observatory. We
calibrated UBVRI magnitudes of five comparison stars in the field of the
object. Most of our observations were done during moderately faint states of
1ES 1011+496 with R > 15.0. The light curves exhibit moderate, closely
correlated variability in all optical wavebands on time scales of a few days. A
cross-correlation analysis between optical bands does not show significant
evidence for time lags. We find a positive correlation (Pearson's r = 0.57;
probability of non-correlation P(>r) ~ 4e-8) between the R-band magnitude and
the B - R color index, indicating a bluer-when-brighter trend. Snap-shot
optical spectral energy distributions (SEDs) exhibit a peak within the optical
regime, typically between the V and B bands. We find a strong (r = 0.78;
probability of non-correlation P (>r) ~ 1e-15) positive correlation between the
peak flux and the peak frequency, best fit by a relation $\nu F_{\nu}^{\rm pk}
\propto \nu_{\rm pk}^k$ with k = 2.05 +/- 0.17. Such a correlation is
consistent with the optical (synchrotron) variability of 1ES 1011+496 being
primarily driven by changes in the magnetic field.
