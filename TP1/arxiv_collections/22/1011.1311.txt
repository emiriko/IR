Ab-initio, self-consistent electronic energy bands of zinc blende CdS are
reported within the local density functional approximation (LDA). Our first
principle, non-relativistic and ground state calculations employed a local
density potential and the linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO). Within
the framework of the Bagayoko, Zhao, and Williams (BZW) method, we solved
self-consistently both the Kohn-Sham equation and the equation giving the
ground state density in terms of the wave functions of the occupied states. Our
calculated, direct band gap of 2.39 eV, at the point, is in accord with
experiment. Our calculation reproduced the peaks in the conduction and valence
bands density of states, within experimental uncertainties. The calculated
electron effective mass agrees with experimental findings.
