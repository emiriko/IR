We report on our recent calculation of the inclusive direct photo- and
hadroproduction of the J/psi meson at next-to-leading order within the
factorization formalism of nonrelativistic QCD. We fit the color-octet (CO)
long-distance matrix elements <O^(J/psi)(1S0[8])>, <O^(J/psi)(3S1[8])> and
<O^(J/psi)(3P0[8])> to the transverse momentum (p_T) distributions measured by
CDF at Fermilab Tevatron and by H1 at DESY HERA and show that they also
successfully describe the p_T distributions from PHENIX at BNL RHIC and CMS at
the CERN LHC as well as the photon-proton c.m. energy and (with worse
agreement) the inelasticity distributions from H1. In all experiments, the CO
processes are shown to be indispensable.
