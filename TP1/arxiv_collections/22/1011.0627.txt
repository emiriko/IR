We demonstrate second and third harmonic generation from a GaP substrate
500{\mu}m thick. The second harmonic field is tuned at the absorption resonance
at 335nm, and the third harmonic signal is tuned at 223nm, in a range where the
dielectric function is negative. These results show that a phase locking
mechanism that triggers transparency at the harmonic wavelengths persists
regardless of the dispersive properties of the medium, and that the fields
propagate hundreds of microns without being absorbed even when the harmonics
are tuned to portions of the spectrum that display metallic behavior.
