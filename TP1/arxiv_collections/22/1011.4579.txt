We construct a set of criteria detecting genuine multipartite entanglement in
arbitrary dimensional multipartite systems. These criteria are optimally suited
for detecting multipartite entanglement in n-qubit Dicke states with
m-excitations. In a detailed analysis we show that the criteria are also more
robust to noise than any other criterion known so far, especially with
increasing system size. Furthermore it is shown that the number of required
local observables scales only polynomially with size, thus making the criteria
experimentally feasible.
