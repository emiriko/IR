Viscous fingering is a well-known hydrodynamic instability that sets in when
a less viscous fluid displaces a more viscous fluid. When the two fluids are
miscible, viscous fingering introduces disorder in the velocity field and
exerts a fundamental control on the rate at which the fluids mix. We present a
fluid dynamics video of the mixing process in a viscously unstable flow,
generated from a high-resolution numerical simulation using a computational
strategy that is stable for arbitrary viscosity ratios. We develop a
two-equation dynamic model of concentration variance and mean dissipation rate
to quantify the degree of mixing in such a displacement process. The model
reproduces accurately the evolution of these two quantities as observed in
high-resolution numerical simulations and captures the nontrivial interplay
between channeling and creation of interfacial area as a result of viscous
fingering.
