We report on numerical simulations of the two-dimensional Blume-Capel
ferromagnet embedded in the triangular lattice. The model is studied in both
its first- and second-order phase transition regime for several values of the
crystal field via a sophisticated two-stage numerical strategy using the
Wang-Landau algorithm. Using classical finite-size scaling techniques we
estimate with high accuracy phase-transition temperatures, thermal, and
magnetic critical exponents and we give an approximation of the phase diagram
of the model.
