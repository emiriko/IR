We estimated the dynamical surface mass density (Sigma) at the solar
Galactocentric distance between 2 and 4 kpc from the Galactic plane, as
inferred from the observed kinematics of the thick disk. We find Sigma(z=2
kpc)=57.6+-5.8 Mo pc^-2, and it shows only a tiny increase in the z-range
considered by our investigation. We compared our results with the expectations
for the visible mass, adopting the most recent estimates in the literature for
contributions of the Galactic stellar disk and interstellar medium, and
proposed models of the dark matter distribution. Our results match the
expectation for the visible mass alone, never differing from it by more than
0.8 $Mo pc^-2 at any z, and thus we find little evidence for any dark
component. We assume that the dark halo could be undetectable with our method,
but the dark disk, recently proposed as a natural expectation of the LambdaCDM
models, should be detected. Given the good agreement with the visible mass
alone, models including a dark disk are less likely, but within errors its
existence cannot be excluded. In any case, these results put constraints on its
properties: thinner models (scale height lower than 4 kpc) reconcile better
with our results and, for any scale height, the lower-density models are
preferred. We believe that successfully predicting the stellar thick disk
properties and a dark disk in agreement with our observations could be a
challenging theoretical task.
