Recently, Bendersky \emph{et al.} developed a method to complete the task of
characterizing an arbitrary $\chi$ matrix element in a scalable way, Phys. Rev.
Lett. Vol. \textbf{100}, 190403(2008), where an auxiliary system was needed. In
present work, we shall show that the same task can also be completed within the
scheme of standard quantum process tomography (SQPT) where there is no
requirement for ancilla. Our method depends on two observations: With the
elaborately chosen operators basis, the SQPT may have an economical form where
a single run of experiment, in which we measure the expectation value of a
chosen operator in the outport of the quantum channel with a known input, is
sufficient to characterize a selected $\chi$ matrix element; With the progress
recently achieved in quantum entanglement detection, we also find that the
number of the experimental settings to realize the experiment for the selected
$\chi$ matrix element does not exceed 2N for the N-qubits system. For practice,
our scheme can be applied for the cases where the controlled two-body
interaction is neither available nor desirable.
