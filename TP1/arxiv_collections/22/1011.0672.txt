We propose a counting dimension for subsets of Z and prove that, under
certain conditions on two such subsets E and F, for Lebesgue almost every real
\lambda\ the counting dimension of E+[\lambda F] is at least the minimum
between 1 and the sum of the counting dimensions of E and F. Furthermore, if
the sum of the counting dimensions of E and F is larger than 1, then E+[\lambda
F] has positive upper Banach density for Lebesgue almost every \lambda. The
result has direct consequences when E,F are arithmetic sets, e.g. the integer
values of a polynomial with integer coefficients.
