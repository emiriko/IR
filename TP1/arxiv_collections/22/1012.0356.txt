We show how the shared information between the past and future---the excess
entropy---derives from the components of directional information stored in the
present---the predictive and retrodictive causal states. A detailed proof
allows us to highlight a number of the subtle problems in estimation and
analysis that impede accurate calculation of the excess entropy.
