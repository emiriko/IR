We report results of the performance test of GPUs obtained using the
conjugate gradient (CG) algorithm for staggered fermions on the MILC fine
lattice ($28^3 \times 96$). We use GPUs of nVIDIA GTX 295 model for the test.
When we turn off the MPI communication and use only a single GPU, the
performance is 35 giga flops in double precision, which corresponds to 47% of
the peak. When we turn on the MPI communication and use multi-GPUs, the
performance is reduced down to 12.3 giga flops. The data transfer through the
infiniband network and PCI-E bus I/O is a main bottle neck. We suggest two
potential solutions of how to optimize the data transfer.
