Recently there has been great interest in Glycol-Water chemistry and
solubility and temperature dependent phase dynamics. The Glycol-Water
biochemistry of interactions is present in plant biology and chemistry, is of
great interest to chemical engineers and biochemists as it is a paradigm of
Carbon-Hydrogen Water organic chemistry. There is an interest moreover in
formulating a simpler theory and computation model for the Glycol-Water
interaction and phase dynamics, that is not fully quantum mechanical yet has
the high accuracy available from a fully quantum mechanical theory of phase
transitions of fluids and Fermi systems. Along these lines of research interest
we have derived a Lennard-Jones -like theory of interacting molecules-Water in
a dissolved adducts of Glycol-Water system interacting by Hydrogen bonds whose
validity is supported at the scale of interactions by other independent
molecular dynamics investigations that utilize force fields dependent on their
experimental fittings to the Lennard-Jones potential and where we have relaxed
or generalized the potential to arbitrary and possibly fractional powers. The
theory then is a semi-classical theory as the repulsion of particles is
incorporated in the Lennard-Jones -like potential's energy required to bring
two molecules together, a repulsion of sorts. We derive distributions for the
molecular species that are exactly solved, and are derived from maximum
entropy, here the semi-classical analogue of the Hamiltonian superposition of
quantum phase theory of fluids. We also derive the similar statistics from the
microscopic SDEs stochastic differential dynamics equations, verifying the
macroscopic state function entropic-thermodynamic derivation.
