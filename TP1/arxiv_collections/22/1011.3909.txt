We lay out an experiment to realize time-reversal invariant topological
insulators in alkali atomic gases. We introduce an original method to
synthesize a gauge field in the near-field of an atom-chip, which effectively
mimics the effects of spin-orbit coupling and produces quantum spin-Hall
states. We also propose a feasible scheme to engineer sharp boundaries where
the hallmark edge states are localized. Our multi-band system has a large
parameter space exhibiting a variety of quantum phase transitions between
topological and normal insulating phases. Due to their remarkable versatility,
cold-atom systems are ideally suited to realize topological states of matter
and drive the development of topological quantum computing.
