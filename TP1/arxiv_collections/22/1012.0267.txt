We analyze the LSND, KARMEN and MiniBooNE data on short-baseline antinu_mu ->
antinu_e oscillations and the data on short-baseline antinu_e disappearance
obtained in the Bugey-3 and CHOOZ reactor experiments in the framework of 3+1
antineutrino mixing, taking into account the MINOS observation of long-baseline
antinu_mu disappearance and the KamLAND observation of very-long-baseline
antinu_e disappearance. We show that the fit of the data implies that the
short-baseline disappearance of antinu_mu is relatively large. We obtain a
prediction of an effective amplitude sin^2 2 theta_{mu mu} >~ 0.1 for
short-baseline antinu_mu disappearance generated by 0.2 <~ Delta m^2 <~ 1 eV^2,
which could be measured in future experiments.
