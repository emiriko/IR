The paper studies solutions of ODEs killed on the domain boundary and their
first exit times from the domain. Some regularity is obtained in the form of
estimates of L_2-norm for functionals on solutions and the first exit times.
Some regularity properties for the density of solutions killed on the boundary
is also studied for the case of random initial conditions.
