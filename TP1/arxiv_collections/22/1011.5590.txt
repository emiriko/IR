A study of the evolution of two-mode squeezing, entanglement and intensity of
the cavity radiation of a two-photon correlated emission laser initially seeded
with a thermal light is presented. The dependence of the degree of two-mode
squeezing and entanglement on the intensity of the thermal light and time is
found to have more or less a similar nature, although the actual values differ
specially in the early stages of the process and when the atoms are initially
prepared in nearly 50:50 probability to be in the upper and lower energy
levels. Particularly, seeding the cavity turns out to spoil the nonclassical
features significantly in the vicinity of $t=0$. It is also shown that the mean
photon number in a wider time span has a dip when mode $b$ is seeded, but a
peak when mode $a$ is seeded. Moreover, this study asserts that the effect of
the seeded light on the nonclassical features and intensity of the cavity
radiation is eroded with time by the pertinent emission-absorption mechanism
which can be taken as an encouraging sign in practical utilization of this
quantum system as a source of bright entangled light.
