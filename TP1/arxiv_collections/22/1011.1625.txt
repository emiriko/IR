Goedel's completeness theorem is concerned with provability, while Girard's
theorem in ludics (as well as full completeness theorems in game semantics) are
concerned with proofs. Our purpose is to look for a connection between these
two disciplines. Following a previous work [3], we consider an extension of the
original ludics with contraction and universal nondeterminism, which play dual
roles, in order to capture a polarized fragment of linear logic and thus a
constructive variant of classical propositional logic. We then prove a
completeness theorem for proofs in this extended setting: for any behaviour
(formula) A and any design (proof attempt) P, either P is a proof of A or there
is a model M of the orthogonal of A which defeats P. Compared with proofs of
full completeness in game semantics, ours exhibits a striking similarity with
proofs of Goedel's completeness, in that it explicitly constructs a
countermodel essentially using Koenig's lemma, proceeds by induction on
formulas, and implies an analogue of Loewenheim-Skolem theorem.
