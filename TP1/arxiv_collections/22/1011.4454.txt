We propose a new deterministic numerical scheme, based on the discontinuous
Galerkin method, for solving the Boltzamnn equation for rarefied gases. The new
scheme guarantees the conservation of the mass, momentum and energy. We avoid
any stochastic procedures in the treatment of the collision operator of the
Boltzmamn equation.
