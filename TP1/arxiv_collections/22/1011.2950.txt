The geometric motivic Poincar\'e series of a germ $(S,0)$ of complex
algebraic variety takes into account the classes in the Grothendieck ring of
the jets of arcs through $(S,0)$. Denef and Loeser proved that this series has
a rational form. We give an explicit description of this invariant when $(S,0)$
is an irreducible germ of quasi-ordinary hypersurface singularity in terms of
the Newton polyhedra of the logarithmic jacobian ideals. These ideals are
determined by the characteristic monomials of a quasi-ordinary branch
parametrizing $(S,0)$.
