The observation of new suppressed Bs decays, Bs-> J/Psi K* (892)0 and
Bs->J/Psi Ks, and the measurement of their branching ratios are presented. This
measurement is based on an integrated luminosity of 5.9 fb-1 of CDF data
collected by a dedicated di-muon trigger. A cut based optimization is carried
out for the observation of Bs -> J/Psi K*, while a neural network is used for
the Bs->J/Psi Ks. In addition to the observation of the new decay modes, the
ratios of branching fractions to the reference B0 decays are measured.
