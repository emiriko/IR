We consider the motion of tachyons (faster-than-light particles) in the
framework of General Relativity. An important feature is the large contribution
of low energy tachyons to the energy-momentum tensor. We also calculate the
gravitational field produced by tachyons in particular geometric arrangements;
and it appears that there could be self-cohering bundles of such matter. This
leads us to suggest that such theoretical ideas might be relevant to major
problems (dark matter and dark energy) in current cosmological models.
