Parity-violating (PV) elastic electron-proton scattering measures Q-weak for
the proton, $Q_W^p$. To extract $Q_W^p$ from data, all radiative corrections
must be well-known. Recently, disagreement on the gamma-Z box contribution to
$Q_W^p$ has prompted the need for further analysis of this term. Here, we
support one choice of a debated factor, go beyond the previously assumed
equality of electromagnetic and gamma-Z structure functions, and find an
analytic result for one of the gamma-Z box integrals. Our numerical evaluation
of the gamma-Z box is in agreement within errors with previous reports, albeit
somewhat larger in central value, and is within the uncertainty requirements of
current experiments.
