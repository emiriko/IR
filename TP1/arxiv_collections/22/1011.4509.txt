Short baseline oscillations of neutrinos (nue and nuebar) due to
active-sterile (a-s) mixing can be observed explicitly using MeV neutrino beams
and existing/planned neutrino detectors. The typical baseline/energy (L/E) of
this approach allows flavor survival waves to be observed in the spatial
distribution of events inside the detector itself. Single/multiple oscillations
can be tested using a variety of sources of nue and nuebar matched to Cerenkov
(C), liquid scintillator (LS) and LENS (In-LS) detectors. Distinct tags for nue
(from In) and nuebar (from p in the LS) in LENS allow access to nue and nuebar
for probing (a-s) mixing, CPT symmetry and in a new way, limits on lepton
number violation (LNV) via wrong helicity neutrino reactions comparable to
limits for neutrinoless double beta decay via right handed currents.
