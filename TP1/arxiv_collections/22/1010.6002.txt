We study the wall-crossing phenomena of D4-D2-D0 bound states with two units
of D4-brane charge on the resolved conifold. We identify the walls of marginal
stability and evaluate the discrete changes of the BPS indices by using the
Kontsevich-Soibelman wall-crossing formula. In particular, we find that the
field theories on D4-branes in two large radius limits are properly connected
by the wall-crossings involving the flop transition of the conifold. We also
find that in one of the large radius limits there are stable bound states of
two D4-D2-D0 fragments.
