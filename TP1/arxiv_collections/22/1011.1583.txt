The quantum reprojection method within the standard adiabatic
Born-Oppenheimer approach is derived for multielectron collision systems. The
method takes nonvanishing asymptotic nonadiabatic couplings into account and
distinguishes asymptotic currents in molecular state and in atomic state
channels, leading to physically consistent and reliable results. The method is
demonstrated for the example of low-energy inelastic Li+Na collisions, for
which the conventional application of the standard adiabatic Born-Oppenheimer
approach fails and leads to paradoxes such as infinite inelastic cross
sections.
