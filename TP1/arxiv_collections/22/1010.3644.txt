In the present paper, the pasta phase is studied at finite temperatures
within a Thomas-Fermi (TF) approach. Relativistic mean field models, both with
constant and density-dependent couplings, are used to describe this frustrated
system. We compare the present results with previous ones obtained within a
phase-coexistence description and conclude that the TF approximation gives rise
to a richer inner pasta phase structure and the homogeneous matter appears at
higher densities. Finally, the transition density calculated within TF is
compared with the results for this quantity obtained with other methods.
