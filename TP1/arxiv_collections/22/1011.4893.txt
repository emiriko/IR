We investigate the low-temperature thermodynamics of the unitary Fermi gas by
introducing a model based on the zero-temperature spectra of both bosonic
collective modes and fermonic single-particle excitations. We calculate the
Helmholtz free energy and from it we obtain the entropy, the internal energy
and the chemical potential as a function of the temperature. By using these
quantities and the Landau's expression for the superfluid density we determine
analytically the superfluid fraction, the critical temperature, the first sound
velocity and the second sound velocity. We compare our analytical results with
other theoretical predictions and experimental data of ultracold atoms and
dilute neutron matter.
