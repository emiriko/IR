Most of dwarf spheroidal galaxies in the Local Group were probably formed via
environmental processes like the tidal interaction with the Milky Way. We study
this process via N-body simulations of dwarf galaxies evolving on seven
different orbits around the Galaxy. The dwarf galaxy is initially composed of a
rotating stellar disk and a dark matter halo. Due to the action of tidal forces
it loses mass and the disk gradually transforms into a spheroid while stellar
motions become increasingly random. We measure the characteristic scale-length
of the dwarf, its maximum circular velocity, mass, shape and kinematics as a
function of the integrated tidal force along the orbit. The final properties of
the evolved dwarfs are remarkably similar if the total tidal force they
experienced was the same, independently of the actual size and eccentricity of
the orbit.
