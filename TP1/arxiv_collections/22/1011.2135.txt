We study dynamics of a membrane and its matrix regularisation. We present the
matrix regularisation for a membrane propagating in a curved space-time
geometry in the presence of an arbitrary 3-form field. In the matrix
regularisation, we then study the dynamics of D-particles. We show how the
Riemann curvature of the target space-time geometry, or any other form fields
can polarise the D-Particles, cause entanglement among them and create fuzzy
solutions. We review the fuzzy sphere and we present fuzzy hyperbolic and
ellipsoid solutions.
