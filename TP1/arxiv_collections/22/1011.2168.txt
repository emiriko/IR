We study the Z_5-orbifolding of the CHL string theory by explicitly
constructing the modular form tilde{Phi}_2 generating the degeneracies of the
1/4-BPS states in the theory. Since the additive seed for the sum form is a
weak Jacobi form in this case, a mismatch is found between the modular forms
generated from the additive lift and the product form derived from threshold
corrections. We also construct the BKM Lie superalgebra, tilde{G}_5,
corresponding to the modular form tilde{Delta}_1 (Z) = tilde{Phi}_2 (Z)^{1/2}
which happens to be a hyperbolic algebra. This is the first occurrence of a
hyperbolic BKM Lie superalgebra. We also study the walls of marginal stability
of this theory in detail, and extend the arithmetic structure found by Cheng
and Dabholkar for the N=1,2,3 orbifoldings to the N=4,5 and 6 models, all of
which have an infinite number of walls in the fundamental domain. We find that
analogous to the Stern-Brocot tree, which generated the intercepts of the walls
on the real line, the intercepts for the N >3 cases are generated by linear
recurrence relations. Using the correspondence between the walls of marginal
stability and the walls of the Weyl chamber of the corresponding BKM Lie
superalgebra, we propose the Cartan matrices for the BKM Lie superalgebras
corresponding to the N=5 and 6 models.
