We present the results of a survey of young intermediate mass stars (age
$<$~5 Myr, 1.5 $<M_{\star} \leq $ 15 $M_{\odot}$) in the W5 massive star
forming region. We use combined optical, near-infrared and {\it Spitzer} Space
Telescope photometry and optical spectroscopy to define a sample of stars of
spectral type A and B and examine their infrared excess properties. We find
objects with infrared excesses characteristic of optically thick disks, i.e.
Herbig AeBe stars. These stars are rare: $<$1.5% of the entire spectroscopic
sample of A and B stars, and absent among stars more massive than 2.4
$M_\odot$. 7.5% of the A and B stars possess infrared excesses in a variety of
morphologies that suggest their disks are in some transitional phase between an
initial, optically thick accretion state and later evolutionary states. We
identify four morphological classes based on the wavelength dependence of the
observed excess emission above theoretical photospheric levels: (a) the
optically thick disks; (b) disks with an optically thin excess over the
wavelength range 2 to 24 $\micron$, similar to that shown by Classical Be
stars; (c) disks that are optically thin in their inner regions based on their
infrared excess at 2-8 $\micron$ and optically thick in their outer regions
based on the magnitude of the observed excess emission at 24 $\micron$; (d)
disks that exhibit empty inner regions (no excess emission at $\lambda$ $\leq$
8 $\micron$) and some measurable excess emission at 24 $\micron$. A sub-class
of disks exhibit no significant excess emission at $\lambda \leq$ 5.8
$\micron$, have excess emission only in the {\it Spitzer} 8 $\micron$ band and
no detection at 24 $\micron$. We discuss these spectral energy distribution
(SED) types, suggest physical models for disks exhibiting these emission
patterns and additional observations to test these theories.
