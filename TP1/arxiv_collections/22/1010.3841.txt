We investigate structure and kinematics of the second generation of stars
(SG) formed from gaseous ejecta of the first generation of stars (FG) in
forming globular clusters (GCs). We consider that SG can be formed from gaseous
ejecta from AGB stars of FG with the initial total mass of 10^6-10^8 M_sun to
explain the present masses of the Galactic GCs. Our 3D hydrodynamical
simulations with star formation show that SG formed in the central regions of
FG can have a significant amount of rotation (V/sigma ~0.8-2.5). The rotational
amplitude of SG can depend strongly on the initial kinematics of FG. We thus
propose that some GCs composed of FG and SG had a significant amount of
rotation when they were formed. We also suggest that although later long-term
(~10 Gyr) dynamical evolution of stars can smooth out the initial structural
and kinematical differences between FG and SG to a large extent, initial
flattened structures and rotational kinematics of SG can be imprinted on shapes
and internal rotation of the present GCs. We discuss these results in terms of
internal rotation observed in the Galactic GCs.
