The phases of the life cycle of an industrial product can be described as a
network of business processes. Products and informational materials are both
raw materials and results of these processes. Modeling using generic model is a
solution to integrate and value the enterprise and experts knowledge. Only a
standardization approach involving several areas such as product modeling,
process modeling, resource modeling and knowledge engineering can help build a
retrieval system more efficient and profitable. The
Functional-Behavior-Structure approach is mix with the Product Process
resources view in a global FBS-PPRE generic model.
