The Anglo-Australian Planet Search has now accumulated 12 years of
radial-velocity data with long-term instrumental precision better than 3 m/s.
In this paper, we expand on earlier simulation work, to probe the frequency of
near-circular, long-period gas-giant planets residing at orbital distances of
3-6 AU -- the so-called "Jupiter analogs." We present the first comprehensive
analysis of the frequency of these objects based on radial-velocity data. We
find that 3.3% of stars in our sample host Jupiter analogs; detailed,
star-by-star simulations show that no more than 37% of stars host a giant
planet between 3-6 AU.
