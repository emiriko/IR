We formulate Fradkin-Vasiliev type theory of massless higher spin fields in
AdS(5). The corresponding action functional describes cubic order approximation
to gravitational interactions of bosonic mixed-symmetry fields of a particular
"hook" symmetry type and totally symmetric bosonic and fermionic fields.
