A new core hypothesis on laughter is presented. It has been built by putting
together ideas from several disciplines: neurodynamics, evolutionary
neurobiology, paleoanthropology, social networks, and communication studies.
The hypothesis contributes to ascertain the evolutionary origins of human
laughter in connection with its cognitive emotional signaling functions. The
new behavioral and neurodynamic tenets introduced about this unusual sound
feature of our species justify the ubiquitous presence it has in social
interactions and along the life cycle of the individual. Laughter, far from
being a curious evolutionary relic or a rather trivial innate behavior, should
be considered as a highly efficient tool for inter-individual problem solving
and for maintenance of social bonds.
