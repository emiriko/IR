Recent developments in quantum technology mean that is it now possible to
manipulate systems and measure fermion fields (e.g. reservoirs of electrons) at
the quantum level. This progress has motivated some recent work on filtering
theory for quantum systems driven by fermion fields by Korotkov, Milburn and
others. The purpose of this paper is to develop fermion filtering theory using
the fermion quantum stochastic calculus. We explain that this approach has
close connections to the classical filtering theory that is a fundamental part
of the systems and control theory that has developed over the past 50 years.
