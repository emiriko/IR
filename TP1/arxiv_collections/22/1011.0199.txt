is a Hybrid Monte-Carlo program that simulates lattice QCD with dynamical
Wilson fermions. It is one of the main production programs of the QCDSF
collaboration. The program can simulate 2 and 2 + 1 fermion flavours with pure,
clover improved, and stout smeared fat link Wilson fermions as well as standard
plaquette, and an improved (rectangle) gauge action. The single flavour is
simulated with the Rational Hybrid Monte-Carlo algorithm.
