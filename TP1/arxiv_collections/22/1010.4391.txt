We study voltage response of nano-bridge based DC-SQUID fabricated on a
Si\_{3}N\_{4} membrane. Such a configuration may help in reducing 1/f noise,
which originates from substrate fluctuating defects. We find that the poor
thermal coupling between the DC-SQUID and the substrate leads to strong
hysteretic response of the SQUID, even though it is biased by an alternating
current. In addition, when the DC-SQUID is biased near a threshold of
spontaneous oscillations, the measured voltage has an intermittent pattern,
which depends on the applied magnetic flux through the SQUID.
