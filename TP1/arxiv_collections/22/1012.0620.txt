In this paper, we investigate the topological Hubbard model - the spinful
Haldane model with on-site interaction on honeycomb lattice with spin rotation
symmetry by using slave-rotor approach and find that chiral spin liquid exists
in such a correlated electron system of the intermediate coupling region. By
considering the anyon nature of excitations, chiral spin liquid may be the
ground state of the topological Hubbard model. The low energy physics is
basically determined by its Chern-Simons gauge theory.
