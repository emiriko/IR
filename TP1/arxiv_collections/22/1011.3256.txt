In this paper two intensive problems faced during software application's
analysis and development process arose by the software industry are briefly
conversed i.e. identification of fault proneness and increase in rate of
variability in the source code of traditional and product line applications. To
contribute in the field of software application analysis and development, and
to mitigate the aforementioned hurdles, a measurement analysis based approach
is discussed in this paper. Furthermore, a prototype is developed based on the
concepts of discussed approach i.e. analyzing preprocessed source code
characteristics, identifying additional level of complexities using several
procedural and object oriented source code measures and visualizing obtained
results in different diagrams e.g. bar charts, file maps and graphs etc.
Developed prototype is discussed in detail in this paper and validated by means
of an experiment as well.
