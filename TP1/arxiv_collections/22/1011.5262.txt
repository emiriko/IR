The definition of QCD vacuum is an important issue in the description of
hadronic properties. Recent researches on the vacuum condensates have resulted
in the suggestion of in-hadron condensates which can be taken as a paradigm
shift concerning the viewpoints on the QCD vacuum. In this Letter, we will try
to define the in-hadron regions and to classify the hadronic and multiquark
states. Topological classifications are naturally introduced and by considering
nonlocal measure we can estimate the variations of dimension 2 condensate $<
A_{\mu}^2 >$. The calculational techniques can be easily applied to multiquark
states and are expected to be applied to the more complex nuclear states.
