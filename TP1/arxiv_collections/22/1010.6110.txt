In this paper we present experimental data of ultrasonic velocity and
attenuation obtained in a high purity crystalline sample of cooper hydrogenated
by gaseous charge. The sample is oriented in the <111> crystallographic
direction and aged for this work in three stages between 64 and 97 days. The
results indicate that the hydrogen is mainly segregated at the dislocation
core, inhibiting the Hydrogen Snoek-K\"oster relaxations verified at earlier
aging stages. Despite of this, a contribution to viscosity in the kink-chain
resonance is provided by the mobile hydrogen in the dislocations core by its
side movement along the dislocation line. At temperatures at which the hydrogen
begins to freeze in the lattice the geometrical kinks find a gradual increase
on the hindering of their movements along dislocation lines, becoming immobile
when the hydrogen is completely frozen in the crystal, anchoring the
dislocations in short loops. Although the viscosity associated with the mobile
hydrogen is removed, the resonance associated with geometrical kinks is not
completely cancelled. The interaction hydrogen-dislocation can be fully
described in terms of kinks in dislocations.
