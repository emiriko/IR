We evaluate the effect of a supersonic relative velocity between the baryons
and dark matter on the thermal and density evolution of the first gas clouds at
z < 50. Through a series of cosmological simulations, initialized at z=100 with
a range of relative streaming velocities and minihalo formation redshifts, we
find that the typical streaming velocities will have little effect on the gas
evolution. Once the collapse begins, the subsequent evolution of the gas will
be nearly indistinguishable from the case of no streaming, and star formation
will still proceed in the same way, with no change in the characteristic Pop
III stellar masses. Reionization is expected to be dominated by halo masses of
> 10^8 M_sun, for which the expected effect of streaming is negligible.
