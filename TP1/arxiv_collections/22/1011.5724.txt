The low-lying even-parity states of the nucleon are explored in lattice QCD
using the PACS-CS collaboration 2+1-flavor dynamical-QCD gauge-field
configurations made available through the International Lattice Datagrid
(ILDG). The established correlation-matrix approach is used, in which various
fermion source and sink smearings are utilized to provide an effective basis of
interpolating fields to span the space of low-lying energy eigenstates. Of
particular interest is the nature of the first excited state of the nucleon,
the $N{1/2}^{+}$ Roper resonance of $P_{11}$ pion-nucleon scattering. The Roper
state of the present analysis approaches the physical mass, displaying
significant chiral curvature at the lightest quark mass. These full QCD
results, providing the world's first insight into the nucleon mass spectrum in
the light-quark regime, are significantly different from those of quenched QCD
and provide interesting insights into the dynamics of QCD.
