Doped Mott insulators have been shown to have a strong propensity to form
patterns of holes and spins often referred to as stripes. In copper-oxides,
doping also gives rise to the pseudogap state, which transforms into a high
temperature superconductor with sufficient doping or by reducing the
temperature. A long standing question has been the interplay between pseudogap,
which is generic to all hole-doped cuprates, and stripes, whose static form
occurs in only one family of cuprates over a narrow range of the phase diagram.
Here we examine the spatial reorganization of electronic states with the onset
of the pseudogap state at T* in the high-temperature superconductor
Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x using spectroscopic mapping with the scanning tunneling
microscope (STM). We find that the onset of the pseudogap phase coincides with
the appearance of electronic patterns that have the predicted characteristics
of fluctuating stripes. As expected, the stripe patterns are strongest when the
hole concentration in the CuO2 planes is close to 1/8 (per Cu). While
demonstrating that the fluctuating stripes emerge with the onset of the
pseudogap state and occur over a large part of the cuprate phase diagram, our
experiments indicate that they are a consequence of pseudogap behavior rather
than its cause.
