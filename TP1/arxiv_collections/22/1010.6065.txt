We consider the quantum radiation of scalar particles from a surface wave
excited on a plane surface of a mirror. It is assumed that the field obeys
Dirichlet condition on the boundary of the mirror. In both cases of running and
standing surface waves the expression is given for the spectral-angular
distribution of the number of the radiated quanta.
