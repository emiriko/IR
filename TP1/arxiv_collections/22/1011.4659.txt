The trace of a function of a Schrodinger operator minus the same for the
Laplacian can be expressed in terms of the determinant of its scattering
matrix. The naive formula for this determinant is divergent. Using a dispersion
relation, we find another expression for it which is convergent, but needs one
piece of information beyond the scattering matrix. Except for this `anomaly',
we can express the Casimir energy of a compact body in terms of its optical
scattering matrix, without assuming any rotational symmetry for its shape.
