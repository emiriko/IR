We simulate a Kepler-like observation of a theoretical exoplanet population
and we show that the observed orbital period distribution of the Kepler giant
planet candidates is best matched by an average stellar specific dissipation
function Q_* in the interval 10^6 ~< Q_* ~< 10^7. In that situation, the few
super-Earths that are driven to orbital periods P < 1 day by dynamical
interactions in multiple-planet systems will survive tidal disruption for a
significant fraction of the main-sequence lifetimes of their stellar hosts.
Consequently, though these very-hot super-Earths are not characteristic of the
overall super-Earth population, their substantial transit probability implies
that they should be significant contributors to the full super-Earth population
uncovered by Kepler. As a result, the CoRoT-7 system may be the first
representative of a population of very-hot super-Earths that we suggest should
be found in multiple-planet systems preferentially orbiting the
least-dissipative stellar hosts in the Kepler sample.
