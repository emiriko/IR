Chaotic communications based on semiconductor lasers have aroused great
research interest since 1990s. Physical-layer encryption using chaotic lasers
is an alternative to transmit message rapidly and confidentially. There are
some practical devices and setups for optical chaotic communications, which are
intuitively considered to be secure. However, there is lack of a set of
security evaluation rules for these communication setups. According to the
recent literature, we summarize several criteria for optical chaotic
communications to evaluate the security and point out some methods to enhance
the security. These criteria and suggested rules are very helpful in designing
secure communication systems using chaotic lasers. Finally we propose some
possible hot topics on security analysis of optical chaotic communications in
future.
