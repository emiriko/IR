The aim of this paper is to propose an alternative method to solve a Fault
Tolerant Control problem. The model is a linear system affected by a
disturbance term: this represents a large class of technological faulty
processes. The goal is to make the system able to tolerate the undesired
perturbation, i.e., to remove or at least reduce its negative effects; such a
task is performed in three steps: the detection of the fault, its
identification and the consequent process recovery. When the disturbance
function is known to be \emph{quantized} over a finite number of levels, the
detection can be successfully executed by a recursive \emph{decoding}
algorithm, arising from Information and Coding Theory and suitably adapted to
the control framework. This technique is analyzed and tested in a flight
control issue; both theoretical considerations and simulations are reported.
