The metastable vapor-liquid coexistence of short-range attractive fluids
hinders the formation of crystal nuclei, which in turn makes difficult the
progress of the system towards its vapor-solid ground state. In this letter we
show that crystal growth can be assisted by imposing temperature fluctuations.
By so doing the obtained solid is nearly a fcc monocrystal in contrast with the
extreme polycrystalline structure obtained at low temperatures. The study is
carried out by combining the replica exchange Monte Carlo method and the
standard slab technique. The obtained results suggest a pathway for growing
coherent crystals from the metastable liquid. This is particularly relevant for
the crystallization of globular proteins.
