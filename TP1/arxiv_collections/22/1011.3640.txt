Exact solutions for the generalized nonlinear Schr\"odinger (NLS) equation
with inhomogeneous complex linear and nonlinear potentials are found. We have
found localized and periodic solutions for a wide class of localized and
periodic modulations in the space of complex potentials and nonlinearity
coefficients. Examples of stable and unstable solutions are given. We also
demonstrated numerically the existence of stable dissipative breathers in the
presence of an additional parabolic trap.
