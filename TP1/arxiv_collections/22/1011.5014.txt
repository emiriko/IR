The effect of an electric field on spin precession in In0.5Ga0.5As/GaAs
self-assembled quantum dots is calculated using multiband real-space
envelope-function theory. The dependence of the Lande' g tensor on electric
fields should permit high-frequency g tensor modulation resonance, as well as
direct, nonresonant electric-field control of the hole spin. Subharmonic
resonances have also been found in g tensor modulation resonance of the holes,
due to the strong quadratic dependence of components of the hole g tensor on
the electric field.
