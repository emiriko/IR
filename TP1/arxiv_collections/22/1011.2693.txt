We calculate the complete next-to-leading-order (NLO) QCD corrections
(including SUSY QCD corrections) to the inclusive total cross sections of the
associated production processes $pp\rightarrow A^{0}\gamma+X$ in the minimal
supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC).
Our results show that the enhancement of the total cross sections from the NLO
QCD corrections can reach $15%\sim20%$ for 200 GeV$<m_{A}<500$ GeV and
$\tan\beta=50$. The scale dependence of the total cross section is improved by
the NLO corrections, which is less than 5%. We also show the Monte Carlo
simulation results for the $\tau^{+}\tau^{-}+\gamma$ signature including the
complete NLO QCD effects, and find an observable signature above the standard
model (SM) background for a normal luminosity of 100 fb$^{-1}$ at the LHC.
