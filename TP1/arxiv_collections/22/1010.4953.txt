In this paper we focus on some aspects related to modeling and formal
verification of embedded systems. Many models have been proposed to represent
embedded systems. These models encompass a broad range of styles,
characteristics, and application domains and include the extensions of finite
state machines, data flow graphs, communication processes and Petri nets. In
this report, we have used a PRES+ model (Petri net based Representation for
Embedded Systems) as an extension of classical Petri net model that captures
concurrency, timing behaviour of embedded systems; it allows systems to be
representative in different levels of abstraction and improves expressiveness
by allowing the token to carry information. Modeling using PRES+, as discussed
above, may be convenient for specifying the input behaviour because it supports
concurrency. However, there is no equivalence checking method reported in the
literature for PRES+ models to the best of our knowledge. In contrast,
equivalence checking of FSMD models exist. As a first step, therefore, we seek
to devise an algorithm to translate PRES+ models to FSMD models and we seek to
hand execute our algorithm on a real life example and we have to translate two
versions of PRES+ models to FSMD models. Then using existing equivalence
checker we have checked the equivalence between two FSMD models.
