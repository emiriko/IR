We report preliminary results for the magnetic moments of negative-parity
baryons extracted from mass shifts in the presence of static external magnetic
fields. The calculations are done on $24^3\times 48$ quenched lattices using
standard Wilson actions, with $\beta$=6.0 and pion mass down to about 520 MeV,
and 1000 configurations. Reasonable signals for the negative-parity states are
observed and the sign of their magnetic moments is established. The results are
compared to model calculations.
