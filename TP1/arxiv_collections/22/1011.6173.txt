Anisotropic D-dimensional polymerized phantom membranes are investigated
within a nonperturbative renormalization group (NPRG) framework. One focuses on
the transition between a high-temperature, crumpled, phase and a
low-temperature, tubular, phase where the membrane is flat along one direction
and crumpled along the other ones. While the upper critical dimension - Duc=5/2
- is close to D=2 the weak-coupling perturbative approach is qualitatively and
quantitatively wrong. We show that our approach is free of the problems
encountered within the perturbative framework and provides physically
meaningful critical quantities.
