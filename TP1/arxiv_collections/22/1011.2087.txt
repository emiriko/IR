Mass spectrometry provides a high-throughput way to identify proteins in
biological samples. In a typical experiment, proteins in a sample are first
broken into their constituent peptides. The resulting mixture of peptides is
then subjected to mass spectrometry, which generates thousands of spectra, each
characteristic of its generating peptide. Here we consider the problem of
inferring, from these spectra, which proteins and peptides are present in the
sample. We develop a statistical approach to the problem, based on a nested
mixture model. In contrast to commonly used two-stage approaches, this model
provides a one-stage solution that simultaneously identifies which proteins are
present, and which peptides are correctly identified. In this way our model
incorporates the evidence feedback between proteins and their constituent
peptides. Using simulated data and a yeast data set, we compare and contrast
our method with existing widely used approaches (PeptideProphet/ProteinProphet)
and with a recently published new approach, HSM. For peptide identification,
our single-stage approach yields consistently more accurate results. For
protein identification the methods have similar accuracy in most settings,
although we exhibit some scenarios in which the existing methods perform
poorly.
