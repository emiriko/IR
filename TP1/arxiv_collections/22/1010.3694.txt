We present complete experimental characterisation of the temporal shape of an
intense ultrashort 200-TW laser pulse driving a laser wakefield. The phase of
the pulse was uniquely measured using (second order) frequency resolved optical
gating (FROG). The pulses are asymmetrically compressed, and exhibit a positive
chirp consistent with the expected asymmetric self-phase modulation due to
photon acceleration/deceleration in a relativistic plasma wave. The measured
pulse duration decreases linearly with increasing length and density of the
plasma, in quantitative agreement with the intensity dependent group velocity
variation in the plasma wave.
