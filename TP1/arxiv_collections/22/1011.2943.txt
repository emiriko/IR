It is demonstrated based on continuum mechanics modeling and simulation that
it is possible to obtain polycrystalline ceramic ferroelectric materials which
beggars single crystals in electromechanical properties. The local
inhomogeneities at the ferroelectric domain-scale level due to spontaneous
polarization and the underlying anisotropy are taken into consideration in the
framework of mathematical homogenization of physical properties in
ferroelectric materials. The intrinsic randomness of the spatial distribution
of polarization is shown to be judiciously employed for the design of better
polycrystalline ferroelectrics. The noncollinear rotation of the net
polarization-vectors embedded in crystallites of the ceramic ferroelectrics is
demonstrated to play the key role in the enhancement of physical properties.
