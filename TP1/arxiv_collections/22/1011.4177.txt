The possibility of oscillations in the differential elastic cross section of
hadron scattering at small momentum transfer is studied. It is shown that
string-like quark potentials at large distances can lead to such small
oscillations, and an analysis of the experimental data at small $|t|$ allows
the determination of the parameters of the potential.
