Since the detection of the asymptotic properties of the dipole gravity modes
in the Sun, the quest to find individual gravity modes has continued. An
extensive and deeper analysis of 14 years of continuous GOLF/SoHO observational
data, unveils the presence of a pattern of peaks that could be interpreted as
individual dipole gravity modes in the frequency range between 60 and 140
microHz, with amplitudes compatible with the latest theoretical predictions. By
collapsing the power spectrum we have obtained a quite constant splitting for
these patterns in comparison to regions where no g modes were expected.
Moreover, the same technique applied to simultaneous VIRGO/SoHO data unveils
some common signals between the power spectra of both instruments. Thus, we are
able to identify and characterize individual g modes with their central
frequencies, amplitudes and splittings allowing to do seismic inversions of the
rotation profile inside the solar core. These results open a new light on the
physics and dynamics of the solar deep core.
