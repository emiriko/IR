Applying the Horsk\'y-Mitskievitch conjecture to the empty space solutions of
Morgan and Morgan due to the gravitational field of a finite disk, we have
obtained the corresponding solutions of the Einstein-Maxwell equations. The
resulting expressions are simply written in terms of oblate spheroidal
coordinates and the solutions represent fields due to magnetized static thin
disk of finite extension. Now, although the solutions are not asymptotically
flat, the masses of the disks are finite and the energy-momentum tensor agrees
with the energy conditions. Furthermore, the magnetic field and the circular
velocity show an acceptable physical behavior.
