Neutron stars can have, in some phases of their life, extremely strong
magnetic fields, up to 10^15-10^16 G. These objects, named magnetars, could be
powerful sources of gravitational waves, since their magnetic field could
determine large deformations. We discuss the structure of the magnetic field of
magnetars, and the deformation induced by this field. Finally, we discuss the
perspective of detection of the gravitational waves emitted by these stars.
