B[e] stars are among the most peculiar objects in the sky. This spectral
type, characterised by allowed and forbidden emission lines, and a large
infrared excess, does not represent an homogenous class of objects, but
instead, a mix of stellar bodies seen in all evolutionary status. Among them,
one can find Herbig stars, planetary nebulae central stars, interacting
binaries, supermassive stars, and even "unclassified" B[e] stars: systems
sharing properties of several of the above. Interferometry, by resolving the
innermost regions of these stellar systems, enables us to reveal the true
nature of these peculiar stars among the peculiar B[e] stars.
