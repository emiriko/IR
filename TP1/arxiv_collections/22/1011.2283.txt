We show by example that there is a Cayley graph, having two invariant random
subgraphs X and Y, such that there exists a monotone coupling between them in
the sense that $X\subset Y$, although no such coupling can be invariant. Here,
"invariant" means that the distribution is invariant under group
multiplications.
