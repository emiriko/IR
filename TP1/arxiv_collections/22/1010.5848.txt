WW scattering is an important process to study electroweak symmetry breaking
in the Standard Model at the LHC, in which the Higgs mechanism or other new
physics processes must intervene to preserve the unitarity of the process below
1 TeV. This channel is expected to be one of the most sensitive to determine
whether the Higgs boson exists. In this paper, the final state with two same
sign Ws is studied, with a simulated sample corresponding to the integrated
luminosity of 60 fb$^{-1}$ in pp collision at $\sqrt{s}=$10 TeV. Two
observables, the invariant mass of $\mu\mu$ from W decays and the azimuthal
angle difference between the two $\mu$s, are utilized to distinguish the Higgs
boson existence scenario from the Higgs boson absence scenario. A good signal
significance for the two cases can be achieved. If we define the separation
power of the analysis as the distance, in the log-likelihood plane, of
pseudo-experiments outcomes in the two cases, with the total statistics
expected from the ATLAS and CMS experiments at the nominal centre-of-mass
energy of 14 TeV, the separation power will be at the level of 4 $\sigma$.
