We present solutions of the Dirac equation with spin symmetry for vector and
scalar modified P\"oschl-Teller potential within framework of an approximation
of the centrifugal term. The relativistic energy spectrum is obtained using the
Nikiforov-Uvarov method and the two-component spinor wavefunctions are obtain
are in terms of the Jacobi polynomials. It is found that there exist only
positive-energy states for bound states under spin symmetry, and the energy
levels increase with the dimension and the potential range parameter $\alpha$.
