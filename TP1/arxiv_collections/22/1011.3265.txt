We calculate the longitudinal ($\sigma_{xx}$) and Hall ($\sigma_{xy}$)
optical conductivities for two-dimensional metals with thermally disordered
antiferromagnetism using a generalization of an approximation introduced by
Lee, Rice and Anderson for the self energy. The conductivities are calculated
from the Kubo formula, with current vertex function treated in a conserving
approximation satisfying the Ward identity. In order to obtain a finite DC
limit, we introduce phenomenologically impurity scattering, with relaxation
time $\tau$. $\sigma_{xx}(\Omega)$ satisfies the $f$-sum rule. For the
infinitely peaked spin correlation function, $\chi(\mathbf{q})\propto
\delta(\mathbf{q}-\mathbf{Q})$, we recover the expressions for the
conductivities in the mean-field theory of the ordered state. When the spin
correlation length $\xi$ is large but finite, both $\sigma_{xx}$ and
$\sigma_{xy}$ show behaviors characteristic of the state with long-range order.
The calculation runs into difficulty for $\Omega\lesssim 1/\tau$. The
difficulties are traced to an inaccurate treatment of the very low energy
density of states within the Lee-Rice-Anderson approximation. The results for
$\sigma_{xx}(\Omega)$ and $\sigma_{xy}(\Omega)$ are qualitatively consistent
with data on electron-doped cuprates when $\Omega>1/\tau$.
