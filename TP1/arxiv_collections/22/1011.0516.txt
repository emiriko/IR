We measure the renormalized coupling in the Twisted Polyakov loop scheme for
SU(3) gauge theory coupled with $N_f=12$ fundamental fermions. To find the
infrared fixed point of this theory, we focus on the step scaling function for
the renormalized coupling. We take the continuum limit using the linear
function of $(a/L)^2$ and a constant fit function. We find that there is a
sizeable systematic error due to the choice of the continuum extrapolation
function in the low energy region. We will give some directions to reduce the
systematic errors.
