It is shown that a tensor-to-scalar ratio close to r = 0.03, which can be
observed by Planck, is realized in supersymmetric hybrid inflation models with
TeV-scale soft supersymmetry breaking terms. This extends our previous
analysis, which also found r <~ 0.03 but employed intermediate scale soft
terms. Other cosmological observables such as the scalar spectral index are in
good agreement with the WMAP data.
