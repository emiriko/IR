A connection is made between the exact eigen states of the BCS Hamiltonian
and the predictions made by the Tamm-Dancoff Approximation. This connection is
made by means of a parametrised algebra, which gives the exact quasi-spin
algebra in one limit of the parameter and the Heisenberg-Weyl algebra in the
other. Using this algebra to construct the Bethe Ansatz solution of the BCS
Hamiltonian, we obtain parametrised Richardson-Gaudin equations, leading to the
secular equation of the Tamm-Dancoff Approximation in the bosonic limit. An
example is discussed in depth.
