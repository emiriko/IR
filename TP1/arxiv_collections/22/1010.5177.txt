Inspired in the work of Erich Joos which appreciated the role played by
matter in making the decoherence of the gravitational field, we developed an
alternative way of treating the former problem. Besides this, we used the
alternative approach to examine the decoherence of the electric field performed
by the conduction electrons in metals. As a counterpoint, we studied the
coherence of the electric color field inside nucleons, which renders the strong
field a totally quantum character.
