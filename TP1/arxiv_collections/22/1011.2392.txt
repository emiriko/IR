Vector Schwinger model is reinvestigated with the mass like term for gauge
field. Phase space structure has been determined in this situation. It has been
found that mass of the gauge boson acquires a generalized expression with the
bare coupling constant and the parameters involved in the masslike terms for
the gauge field which is in contrast with the result of a recent publication on
this issue.
