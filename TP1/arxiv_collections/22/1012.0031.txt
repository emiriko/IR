We propose using graphene electrodes with hydrogenated edges for solid-state
nanopore-based DNA sequencing, and perform molecular dynamics simulations in
conjunction with electronic transport calculations to explore the potential
merits of this idea. The results of our investigation show that, compared to
the unhydrogenated system, edge-hydrogenated graphene electrodes facilitate the
temporary formation of H-bonds with suitable atomic sites in the translocating
DNA molecule. As a consequence, the average conductivity is drastically raised
by about 3 orders of magnitude while exhibiting significantly reduced
statistical variance. We have furthermore investigated how these results are
affected when the distance between opposing electrodes is varied and have
identified two regimes: for narrow electrode separation, the mere hindrance due
to the presence of protruding hydrogen atoms in the nanopore is deemed more
important, while for wider electrode separation, the formation of H-bonds
becomes the dominant effect. Based on these findings, we conclude that
hydrogenation of graphene electrode edges represents a promising approach to
reduce the translocation speed of DNA through the nanopore and substantially
improve the accuracy of the measurement process for whole-genome sequencing.
