A quantum network is constructed via maximum entangled coherent states. The
possibility of using this network to achieve communication between
multi-participants is investigated. We showed that the probability of
teleported unknown state successfully, depends on the size the used network. As
the numbers of participants increases, the successful probability does not
depend on the intensity of the field. The problem of implementing quantum
teleportation protocol via a noise quantum network is discussed. We show one
can send information perfectly with small values of the field intensity and
larger values of the noise strength. The successful probability of this
suggested protocol increases abruptly for larger values of the noise strength
and gradually for small values. We show that for small size of the used quantum
network, the fidelity of the teleported state decreases smoothly, while it
decreases abruptly for larger size of network.
