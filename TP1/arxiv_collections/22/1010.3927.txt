We localize a previously established nonlocal BRST invariance of the
Gribov-Zwanziger (GZ) action by the introduction of additional fields. We
obtain a modified GZ action with a corresponding local BRST invariance. We show
that correlation functions of the original elementary GZ fields do not change
upon evaluation with the modified partition function. We discuss that for
vanishing Gribov mass, we are brought back to the original Yang-Mills theory
with standard BRST invariance.
