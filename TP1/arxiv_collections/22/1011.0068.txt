In this article we discuss a series of models introduced by Barashenkov,
Oxtoby and Pelinovsky to describe some discrete approximations to the \phi^4
theory which preserve travelling kink solutions. We show, by applying the
multiple scale test that they have some integrability properties as they pass
the A_1 and A_2 conditions. However they are not integrable as they fail the
A_3 conditions.
