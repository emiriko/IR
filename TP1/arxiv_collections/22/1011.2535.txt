Technicolor and other theories of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking
invoke chiral symmetry breaking triggered by strong gauge-dynamics, analogous
to that found in QCD, to explain the observed W, Z, and fermion masses. In this
talk we describe why a realistic theory of dynamical electroweak symmetry
breaking must, relative to QCD, produce an enhanced fermion condensate. We
quantify the degree to which the technicolor condensate must be enhanced in
order to yield the observed quark masses, and still be consistent with
phenomenological constraints on flavor-changing neutral-currents. Lattice
studies of technicolor and related theories provide the only way to demonstrate
that such enhancements are possible and, hopefully, to discover viable
candidate models. We comment briefly on the current status of non-perturbative
investigations of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking, and provide a
"wish-list" of phenomenologically-relevant properties that are important to
calculate in these theories
