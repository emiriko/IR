Forward-backward asymmetry $A_{\rm FB}$ is an essential observable to study
the nature of coupling in the standard model and physics beyond the standard
model, as shown at LEP and Tevatron. As a proton-proton collider, the LHC does
not have the preferred direction contrary to her counterpart, namely, LEP and
Tevatron. Therefore $A_{\rm FB}$ is not applicable at the LHC. However for the
proton the momentum of valence quark is usually larger than that of the sea
quark. Utilizing this feature we have defined a so-called one-side
forward-backward asymmetry $A_{\rm OFB}$ for the top quark pair production at
LHC in the previous work. In this paper we extend our studies to the charged
leptons and bottom quarks as the final states. Our numerical results show that
at the LHC $A_{\rm OFB}$ can be utilized to study the nature of the couplings
once enough events are collected.
