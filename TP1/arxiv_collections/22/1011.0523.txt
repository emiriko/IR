We extend the Hopf algebra description of a simple quantum system given
previously, to a more elaborate Hopf algebra, which is rich enough to encompass
that related to a description of perturbative quantum field theory (pQFT). This
provides a {\em mathematical} route from an algebraic description of
non-relativistic, non-field theoretic quantum statistical mechanics to one of
relativistic quantum field theory. Such a description necessarily involves
treating the algebra of polyzeta functions, extensions of the Riemann Zeta
function, since these occur naturally in pQFT. This provides a link between
physics, algebra and number theory. As a by-product of this approach, we are
led to indicate {\it inter alia} a basis for concluding that the Euler gamma
constant $\gamma$ may be rational.
