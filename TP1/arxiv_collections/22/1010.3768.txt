We report a direct lattice calculation of the $K$ to $\pi\pi$ decay matrix
elements for both $\Delta I=1/2$ and $3/2$ channels on 2+1 flavor, domain wall
fermion, $16^3\times32$ lattices with zero $\pi\pi$ relative momentum and
$m_\pi=420$ MeV. All $K^0$ to $\pi\pi$ contractions are carefully listed and
calculated. The decay into the isospin zero $\pi\pi$ final state, which
receives contributions from the disconnected graphs, is very difficult to
calculate, but a clear signal in the similar disconnected $\pi\pi$ correlator
can be seen. Preliminary results, some with large errors, will be presented for
the various contributions to the renormalized weak matrix elements $A_0$ and
$A_2$. We obtain Re$(A_0)$ with $25%$ error in the case of zero momentum on
shell decay, and find a factor of 6 enhancement for the $\Delta I=1/2$ rule in
the $420$ MeV pion system.
