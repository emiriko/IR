Nonlocal Lotka-Volterra models have the property that solutions concentrate
as Dirac masses in the limit of small diffusion. Is it possible to describe the
dynamics of the limiting concentration points and of the weights of the Dirac
masses? What is the long time asymptotics of these Dirac masses? Can several
Dirac masses co-exist? We will explain how these questions relate to the
so-called "constrained Hamilton-Jacobi equation" and how a form of canonical
equation can be established. This equation has been established assuming
smoothness. Here we build a framework where smooth solutions exist and thus the
full theory can be developed rigorously. We also show that our form of
canonical equation comes with a structure of gradient flow. Numerical
simulations show that the trajectories can exhibit unexpected dynamics well
explained by this equation. Our motivation comes from population adaptive
evolution a branch of mathematical ecology which models darwinian evolution.
