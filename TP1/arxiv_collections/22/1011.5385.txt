We explore the use of templated self-assembly to facilitate the formation of
complex target structures made from patchy particles. First, we consider the
templating of high-symmetry shell structures around a spherical core particle.
We find that nucleation around the core particle can inhibit aggregate
formation, a process which often hinders self-assembly. In particular, this new
assembly pathway allows dodecahedral shells to form readily, whereas these
structures never form in the absence of the template. Secondly, we consider the
self-assembly of multi-shell structures, where the central icosahedral core is
known to form readily on its own, and which could then template the growth of
further layers. We are able to find conditions under which two- and three-shell
structures successfully assemble, illustrating the power of the templating
approach.
