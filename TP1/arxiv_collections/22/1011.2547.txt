We prepared polycrystalline SmFeAsO1-xFx (Sm1111) bulk samples by sintering
and hot isostatic pressing (HIP) in order to study the effects of phase purity
and relative density on the intergranular current density. Sintered and HIPped
Sm1111 samples are denser with fewer impurity phases, such as SmOF and the
grain boundary wetting phase, FeAs. We found quite complex magnetization
behavior due to variations of both the inter and intragranular current
densities. Removing porosity and reducing second phase content enhanced the
intergranular current density, but HIPping reduced Tc and the intragranular
current density, due to loss of fluorine and reduction of Tc. We believe that
the HIPped samples are amongst the purest polycrystalline 1111 samples yet
made. However, their intergranular current densities are still small, providing
further evidence that polycrystalline pnictides, like polycrystalline cuprates,
are intrinsically granular.
