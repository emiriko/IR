Despite the 300% systematic theoretical uncertainty associated with
extracting qhat using current energy loss models due to the collinear
approximation, and despite the uncertainties in the initial geometry and
corrections due to the fluctuations in the initial overlap of a heavy ion
collision, a simultaneous description of high-pT pi^0 RAA and v2 is not
possible with current pQCD-based energy loss models. However a good description
of out-of-plane RAA as a function of centrality is possible. Alternatively,
energy loss models based on AdS/CFT give a better qualitative description of
pi^0 and non-photonic electron RAA as well as high-pT ratios of antiprotons to
pi^- production than those based on pQCD.
