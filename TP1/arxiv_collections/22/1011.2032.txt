Let $T$ be an arbitrary operator bounded from $L^{p_0}(w)$ into $L^{p_0,
\infty}(w)$ for every weight $w$ in the Muckenhoupt class $A_{p_0}$. It is
proved in this article that the distribution function of $Tf$ with respect to
any weight $u$ can be essentially majorized by the distribution function of
$Mf$ with respect to $u$ (plus an integral term easy to control). As a
consequence, well-known extrapolation results, including results in a
multilinear setting, can be obtained with very simple proofs. New applications
in extrapolation for two-weight problems and estimates on rearrangement
invariant spaces are established too.
