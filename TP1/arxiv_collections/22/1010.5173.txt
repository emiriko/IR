We consider the nonlinear Schrodinger equation with cubic (focusing or
defocusing) nonlinearity on the multidimensional torus. For special small
initial data containing only five modes, we exhibit a countable set of time
layers in which arbitrarily large modes are created. The proof relies on a
reduction to multiphase weakly nonlinear geometric optics, and on the study of
a particular two-dimensional discrete dynamical system.
