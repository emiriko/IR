We propose a method for nano-scale characterization of long range magnetic
order in diluted magnetic systems to clarify the origins of the room
temperature ferromagnetism. The GaN:Mn thin films are grown by metal-organic
chemical vapor deposition with the concentration of Ga-substitutional Mn up to
3.8%. Atomic force microscope (AFM) and magnetic force microscope (MFM)
characterizations are performed on etched artificial microstructures and
natural dislocation pits. Numerical simulations and theoretical analysis on the
AFM and MFM data have confirmed the formation of long range magnetic order and
ruled out the possibility that nano-clusters contributed to the ferromagnetism.
We suggest that delocalized electrons might play a role in the establishment of
this long range magnetic order.
