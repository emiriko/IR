With continuously increasing intensities, modern laser systems can become a
valuable tool for the search for axions and axion-like particles. As
conventional setups of axion searches cannot easily accommodate the usage of a
high-intensity laser system, we propose a novel, purely laser-based setup in
which the occurrence of a frequency shift is an observable for the axion-photon
interaction.
