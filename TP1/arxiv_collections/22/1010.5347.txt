We present an overview of a few spectroscopic diagnostics of massive stars.
We explore the following wavelength ranges: UV (1000 to 2000 A), optical
(4000--7000 A) and near-infrared (mainly H and K bands). The diagnostics we
highlight are available in O and Wolf-Rayet stars as well as in B supergiants.
We focus on the following parameters: effective temperature, gravity, surface
abundances, luminosity, mass loss rate, terminal velocity, wind clumping,
rotation/macroturbulence and surface magnetic field.
