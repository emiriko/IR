The metallicity gradient and the stellar distribution within the Local Group
dwarf galaxy NGC 6822 has been studied photometrically using asymptotic branch
stars (AGB). In order to study the stellar and metallicity distribution, the
carbon- and oxygen-rich AGB stars have been isolated using deep high-quality
near-infrared UKIRT photometry. The ratio between them, the C/M ratio, has been
used to derive the [Fe/H] abundance within the galaxy. The [Fe/H] abundance and
stellar distribution were analysed as a function of galactic radius. A mean C/M
ratio of 0.288 +/- 0.014 has been found which corresponds to an iron abundance
of [Fe/H] =-1.14 +/-0.08 dex, with variations in the north and south, as well
as at larger galactocentric distances. Variations in the magnitude of the tip
of the red giant branch has also been detected.
