We report a preliminary measurement of the CP violating asymmetry in
D0->pi+pi- using approximately 215,000 decays reconstructed in about 5.94/fb of
CDF data. We use the strong D*+->D0pi+ decay ("D* tag") to identify the flavor
of the charmed meson at production time and exploit CP-conserving strong c-cbar
pair-production in p-pbar collisions. Higher statistic samples of
Cabibbo-favored D0->K-pi+ decays with and without D* tag are used to highly
suppress systematic uncertainties due to detector effects. The result is the
world's most precise measurement to date.
