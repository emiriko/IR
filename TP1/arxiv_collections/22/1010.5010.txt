Investigation of crystallization in an 5BDSR amorphous alloy by system
Fe-Cu-Nb-Si-B under the influence of an incoherent optical radiation generated
by gas discharge flash-lamp using X-ray diffraction scattering. It is shown
that depending on the magnitude of the input power to the flash-lamp of
structure of the alloy varies widely after radiation: a change in the
short-range order during retaining the amorphous structure or the formation of
several crystalline phases with different quantitative content in the alloy.
Conditions are found for the formation of the nanocrystalline structure.
Analysis in terms of the Kolmogorov-Johnson-Mehl-Avrami kinetics showed that
the mechanism of primary crystallization under flash irradiation is associated
with a well-known for finemet-type alloys: rapid nucleation, followed by growth
slowing of nanocrystalline phase alpha-Fe(Si) with the D03 structure.
