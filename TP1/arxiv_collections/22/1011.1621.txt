Incorporating dynamic contact networks and delayed awareness into a contagion
model with memory, we study the spreading patterns of infectious diseases in
connected populations. It is found that the spread of an infectious disease is
not only related to the past exposures of an individual to the infected but
also to the time scales of risk perception reflected in the social network
adaptation. The epidemic threshold $p_{c}$ is found to decrease with the rise
of the time scale parameter s and the memory length T, they satisfy the
equation $p_{c} =\frac{1}{T}+ \frac{\omega T}{<k>a^s(1-e^{-\omega T^2/a^s})}$.
Both the lifetime of the epidemic and the topological property of the evolved
network are considered. The standard deviation $\sigma_{d}$ of the degree
distribution increases with the rise of the absorbing time $t_{c}$, a power-law
relation $\sigma_{d}=mt_{c}^\gamma$ is found.
