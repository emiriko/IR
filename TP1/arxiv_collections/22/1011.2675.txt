We investigate the asteroseismology of two solar-like targets as observed
with the CoRoT satellite, with particular attention paid to the mode fitting.
HD 181420 and HD 49933 are typical CoRoT solar-like targets (156 and 60-day
runs). The low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of about 3-10 prevents us from
unambiguously identifying the individual oscillation modes. In particular,
convergence problems appear at the edges of the oscillation spectrum. HD 181420

problems appear at the edges of the oscillation spectrum. We apply a Bayesian
approach to the analysis of these data. We compare the global fitting of the
power spectra of this time series, obtained by the classical maximum likelihood
(MLE) and the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimators. We examine the impact of
the choice of the priors upon the fitted parameters. We also propose to reduce
the number of free parameters in the fitting, by replacing the individual
estimate of mode height associated with each overtone by a continuous function
of frequency (Gaussian profile). The MAP appears as a powerful tool to
constrain the global fits, but it must be used carefully and only with reliable
priors. The mode width of the stars increases with the frequency over all the
oscillation spectrum.
