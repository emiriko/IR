We describe a Bethe ansatz based method to derive, starting from a multiple
integral representation, the long-distance asymptotic behavior at finite
temperature of the density-density correlation function in the interacting
one-dimensional Bose gas. We compute the correlation lengths in terms of
solutions of non-linear integral equations of the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz
type. Finally, we establish a connection between the results obtained in our
approach with the correlation lengths stemming from the quantum transfer matrix
method.
