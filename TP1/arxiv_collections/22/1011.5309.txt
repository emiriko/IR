A measure of quantum correlation defined from an information-theoretic
perspective, namely, quantum discord, is applied to study the time-evolved
nonequilibrium state of the infinite anisotropic quantum XY spin chain in a
transverse time-dependent field. In particular, we probe whether the collapse
and revival of nearest-neighbor entanglement of the state seen with a varying
initial applied field strength, at a fixed evolution time, may be predicted
from the behavior of the quantum correlation measure. For this quantum
many-body system, realizable with currently available technology, we find that
the revival of entanglement of the evolved state occurs if there is an increase
in quantum discord in the vicinity of entanglement collapse.
