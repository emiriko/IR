Based on numerical simulations, we show that higher-order nonlinear indices
(up to $n_8$ and $n_{10}$, respectively) of air and argon have a dominant
contribution to both focusing and defocusing in the self-guiding of ultrashort
laser pulses over most of the spectrum. Plasma generation and filamentation are
therefore decoupled. As a consequence, ultraviolet wavelength may not be the
optimal wavelengths for applications requiring to maximize ionization.
