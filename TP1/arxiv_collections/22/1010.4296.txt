We present results of recent observations and theoretical modeling of data
from black holes accreting at very low luminosities (L/L_Edd ~ 10^{-8}). We
discuss our newly developed time-dependent model for episodic ejection of
relativistic plasma within a jet framework, and a successful application of
this model to describe the origin of radio flares seen in Sgr A*, the Galactic
center black hole. Both the observed time lags and size-frequency relationships
are reproduced well by the model. We also discuss results from new Spitzer data
of the stellar black hole X-ray binary system A0620-00. Complemented by long
term SMARTS monitoring, these observations indicate that once the contribution
from the accretion disk and the donor star are properly included, the residual
mid-IR spectral energy distribution of A0620-00 is quite flat and consistent
with a non-thermal origin. The results above suggest that a significant
fraction of the observed spectral energy distribution originating near black
holes accreting at low luminosities could result from a mildly relativistic
outflow. The fact that these outflows are seen in both stellar-mass black holes
as well as in supermassive black holes at the heart of AGNs strengthens our
expectation that accretion and jet physics scales with mass.
