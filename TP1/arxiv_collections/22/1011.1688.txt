We demonstrate the first 1550 nm correlated photon-pair source in an
integrated glass platform-a chalcogenide As2S3 waveguide. A measured pair
coincidence rate of 80 per second was achieved using 57 mW of continuous-wave
pump. The coincidence to accidental ratio was shown to be limited by
spontaneous Raman scattering effects that are expected to be mitigated by using
a pulsed pump source.
