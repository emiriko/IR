We study the structure of the revivals in an integrable quantum many-body
system, the transverse field XY spin chain, after a quantum quench. The time
evolutions of the Loschmidt echo, the magnetization, and the single spin
entanglement entropy are calculated. We find that the revival times for all of
these observables are given by integer multiples of T_rev \sim L / v_max where
L is the linear size of the system and v_max is the maximal group velocity of
quasiparticles. This revival structure is universal in the sense that it does
not depend on the initial state and the size of the quench. Applying
non-integrable perturbations to the XY model, we observe that the revivals are
robust against such perturbations: they are still visible at time scales much
larger than the quasiparticle lifetime. We therefore propose a generic
connection between the revival structure and the locality of the dynamics,
where the quasiparticle speed v_max generalizes into the Lieb$-$Robinson speed
v_LR.
