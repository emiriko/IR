In this study the determinant of the average quadratic error matrix is used
as the measure of state estimation efficiency. This quantity is easily
computable in some cases, so it gives us a reasonable tool to find optimal
measurement setup for different quantum tomography problems. We present
numerous applications for a single qubit when von Neumann measurements or a
single POVM is used and a part of the parameters of the state is given. Under
some restriction the optimality is found for $n$-level system as well. The
optimal measurements have some complementary relation to each other or to the
known datas, moreover, symmetric informationally complete systems appear, the
conditional version seems to be new.
