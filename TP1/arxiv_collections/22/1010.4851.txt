This study derives geometric, variational discretizations of continuum
theories arising in fluid dynamics, magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), and the
dynamics of complex fluids. A central role in these discretizations is played
by the geometric formulation of fluid dynamics, which views solutions to the
governing equations for perfect fluid flow as geodesics on the group of
volume-preserving diffeomorphisms of the fluid domain. Inspired by this
framework, we construct a finite-dimensional approximation to the
diffeomorphism group and its Lie algebra, thereby permitting a variational
temporal discretization of geodesics on the spatially discretized
diffeomorphism group. The extension to MHD and complex fluid flow is then made
through an appeal to the theory of Euler-Poincar\'{e} systems with advection,
which provides a generalization of the variational formulation of ideal fluid
flow to fluids with one or more advected parameters. Upon deriving a family of
structured integrators for these systems, we test their performance via a
numerical implementation of the update schemes on a cartesian grid. Among the
hallmarks of these new numerical methods are exact preservation of momenta
arising from symmetries, automatic satisfaction of solenoidal constraints on
vector fields, good long-term energy behavior, robustness with respect to the
spatial and temporal resolution of the discretization, and applicability to
irregular meshes.
