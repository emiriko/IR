The structural properties of graphs are usually characterized in terms of
invariants, which are functions of graphs that do not depend on the labeling of
the nodes. In this paper we study convex graph invariants, which are graph
invariants that are convex functions of the adjacency matrix of a graph. Some
examples include functions of a graph such as the maximum degree, the MAXCUT
value (and its semidefinite relaxation), and spectral invariants such as the
sum of the $k$ largest eigenvalues. Such functions can be used to construct
convex sets that impose various structural constraints on graphs, and thus
provide a unified framework for solving a number of interesting graph problems
via convex optimization. We give a representation of all convex graph
invariants in terms of certain elementary invariants, and describe methods to
compute or approximate convex graph invariants tractably. We also compare
convex and non-convex invariants, and discuss connections to robust
optimization. Finally we use convex graph invariants to provide efficient
convex programming solutions to graph problems such as the deconvolution of the
composition of two graphs into the individual components, hypothesis testing
between graph families, and the generation of graphs with certain desired
structural properties.
