In the present paper we are concerned with the possible values of Seshadri
constants. While in general every positive rational number appears as the local
Seshadri constant of some ample line bundle, we point out that for adjoint line
bundles there are explicit lower bounds depending only on the dimension of the
underlying variety. In the surface case, where the optimal lower bound is 1/2,
we characterize all possible values in the range between 1/2 and 1 -- there are
surprisingly few. As expected, one obtains even more restrictive results for
the Seshadri constants of adjoints of very ample line bundles. Our description
of the border case in this situation makes use of adjunction-theoretical
results on surfaces. Finally, we study Seshadri constants of adjoint line
bundles in the multi-point setting.
