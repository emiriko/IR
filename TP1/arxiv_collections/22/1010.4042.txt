The electron self-energy (self-mass) is calculated on the basis of the model
of quantum field theory with maximal mass M, developed by V.G.Kadyshevsky et
al. within the pseudo-Hermitian quantum electrodynamics in the second order of
the perturbation theory. In theory, there is the natural cut-off of large
transmitted momentum in intermediate states because of presence of the
universal mass M. As a result, the electron self-mass is finite and depends on
the transmitted maximum momentum. Two interpretations of the obtained results
are possible at defined M and A. The first interpretation allows confirming
quantitatively the old concept of elementary particle mass sources defined by
interaction of particles with self-gauge fields. The second interpretation
results in the possibility not to renormalize the mass (at least in the second
order of perturbation theory) owing to the zero mass operator.
