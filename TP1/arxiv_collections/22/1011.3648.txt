Let $C$ be a smooth plane curve. A point $P$ in the projective plane is said
to be Galois with respect to $C$ if the function field extension induced from
the point projection from $P$ is Galois. We denote by $\delta(C)$ (resp.
$\delta'(C)$) the number of Galois points contained in $C$ (resp. in $\mathbb
P^2 \setminus C$). In this article, we determine the numbers $\delta(C)$ and
$\delta'(C)$ in any remaining open cases. Summarizing results obtained by now,
we will have a complete classification theorem of smooth plane curves by the
number $\delta(C)$ or $\delta'(C)$. In particular, we give new
characterizations of Fermat curve and Klein quartic curve by the number
$\delta'(C)$.
