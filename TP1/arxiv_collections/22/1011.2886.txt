We consider the nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation $(-\Delta +V(x))u =
\Gamma(x) |u|^{p-1}u$, $x\in \R^n$ with $V(x) = V_1(x)
\chi_{\{x_1>0\}}(x)+V_2(x) \chi_{\{x_1<0\}}(x)$ and $\Gamma(x) = \Gamma_1(x)
\chi_{\{x_1>0\}}(x)+\Gamma_2(x) \chi_{\{x_1<0\}}(x)$ and with $V_1, V_2,
\Gamma_1, \Gamma_2$ periodic in each coordinate direction. This problem
describes the interface of two periodic media, e.g. photonic crystals. We study
the existence of ground state $H^1$ solutions (surface gap soliton ground
states) for $0<\min \sigma(-\Delta +V)$. Using a concentration compactness
argument, we provide an abstract criterion for the existence based on ground
state energies of each periodic problem (with $V\equiv V_1, \Gamma\equiv
\Gamma_1$ and $V\equiv V_2, \Gamma\equiv \Gamma_2$) as well as a more practical
criterion based on ground states themselves. Examples of interfaces satisfying
these criteria are provided. In 1D it is shown that, surprisingly, the criteria
can be reduced to conditions on the linear Bloch waves of the operators
$-\tfrac{d^2}{dx^2} +V_1(x)$ and $-\tfrac{d^2}{dx^2} +V_2(x)$.
