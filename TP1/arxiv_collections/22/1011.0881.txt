The merits of searching for \eta -mesic nuclei by use of the (\pi, N)
reaction at J-PARC is discussed, by comparison with an old experiment with the
same reaction at BNL in 1980's. The importance of a pilot experiment using
deuterium target is also stressed for a better understanding of the background
which should exist even after the coincidence of the decay particles of \eta
-mesic nuclei.
