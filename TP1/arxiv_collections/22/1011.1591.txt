Necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of limits of the form
{equation*} \lim_{(x,y)\rightarrow (a,b)}\frac{f(x,y)}{g(x,y)} {equation*} are
given, under the hipothesis that $f$ and $g$ are real analytic functions near
the point $(a,b)$, and $g$ has an isolated zero at $(a,b)$. An algorithm
(implemented in MAPLE 12) is also provided. This algorithm determines the
existence of the limit, and computes it in case it exists. It is shown to be
more powerful than the one found in the latest versions of MAPLE. The main
tools used throughout are Hensel's Lemma and the theory of Puiseux series.
