In this work we study the radiative decay of dynamically generated
$J^P=\oh^-$ charm baryons into the ground state $J^P=\oh^+$ baryons. Since
different theoretical interpretations of these baryonic resonances, and in
particular of the $\Lambda_c(2595)$, give different predictions, a precise
experimental measurement of these decays would be an important step for
understanding their nature.
