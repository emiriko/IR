In this paper, we will present a general formalism for constructing the
nonlinear charge coherent states which in special case lead to the standard
charge coher- ent states. The suQ(1;1) algebra as a nonlinear deformed algebra
realization of the introduced states is established. In addition, the
corresponding even and odd nonlinear charge coherent states have been also
introduced. The formalism has the potentiality to be applied to systems either
with known "nonlinearity function" f(n) or solvable quantum system with known
"discrete non-degenerate spectrum" en. As some physical appearances, a few
known physical systems in the two mentioned cat- egories have been considered.
Finally, since the construction of nonclassical states is a central topic of
quantum optics, nonclassical features and quantum statisti- cal properties of
the introduced states have been investigated by evaluating single- and two-mode
squeezing, su(1;1)-squeezing, Mandel parameter and antibunching effect (via
g-correlation function) as well as some of their generalized forms we have
introduced in the present paper.
