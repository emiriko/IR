In this paper, we propose a distributed Alamouti space-time code (DASTC) for
two-way relay networks employing a single amplify-and-forward (AF) relay. We
first derive closed-form expressions for the approximated average sum-rate of
the proposed DASTC scheme. Our analysis is validated by a comparison against
the results of Monte-Carlo simulations. Numerical results verify the
effectiveness of our proposed scheme over the conventional DASTC with one-way
communication.
