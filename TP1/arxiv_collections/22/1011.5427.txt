We calculate the free energy, spatial string tension and Polyakov loop of the
gluon plasma using the dilaton potential of Ref. arXiv:0911.0627[hep-ph] in the
dilaton-gravity theory of AdS/QCD. The free energy is computed from the Black
Hole solutions of the Einstein equations in two ways: first, from the
Bekenstein-Hawking proportionality of the entropy with the area of the horizon,
and secondly from the Page-Hawking computation of the free energy. The finite
temperature behaviour of the spatial string tension and Polyakov loop follow
from the corresponding string theory in AdS_5. Comparison with lattice data is
made.
