Two finely segmented and very compact calorimeters are foreseen for the
instrumentation of the very forward region of the ILC and the CLIC detectors; a
luminometer to measure the rate of low angle Bhabha scattering events with a
precision better than $10^{-3}$ and, at lower polar angles, a detector for fast
luminosity estimate. Both devices will improve the hermeticity of the detector
in searches for new particles. Due to the expected high occupancy, fast
front-end electronics is needed. The calorimeter closest to the beampipe will
be hit by a large amount of beamstrahlung remnants, so that radiation hard
sensors are required. Results on the performance of the sensor and readout
electronics prototypes are summarized.
