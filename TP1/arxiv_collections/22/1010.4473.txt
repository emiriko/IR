Exploiting electro-optic effects in liquid crystals, we achieved real-time
control of the retardation of liquid- crystal-based $q$-plates through an
externally applied voltage. The newly conceived electro-optic $q$-plates can be
operated as electrically driven converters of photon spin into orbital angular
momentum, enabling a variation of the orbital angular momentum probabilities of
the output photons over a time scale of milliseconds.
