While sources of magnetic fields - magnetic monopoles - have so far proven
elusive as elementary particles, several scenarios have been proposed recently
in condensed matter physics of emergent quasiparticles resembling monopoles. A
particularly simple proposition pertains to spin ice on the highly frustrated
pyrochlore lattice. The spin ice state is argued to be well-described by
networks of aligned dipoles resembling solenoidal tubes - classical, and
observable, versions of a Dirac string. Where these tubes end, the resulting
defect looks like a magnetic monopole. We demonstrate, by diffuse neutron
scattering, the presence of such strings in the spin-ice Dy2Ti2O7. This is
achieved by applying a symmetry-breaking magnetic field with which we can
manipulate density and orientation of the strings. In turn, heat capacity is
described by a gas of magnetic monopoles interacting via a magnetic Coulomb
interaction.
