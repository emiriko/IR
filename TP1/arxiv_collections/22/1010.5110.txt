I present two calculations of the holographic Weyl anomalies induced by
Chern-Simons gravity theories alternative to the ones presented in the
literature. The calculations presented here rest on the extension from
Chern-Simons to Transgression forms as lagrangians, motivated by gauge
invariance, which automatically yields the boundary terms suitable to
regularize the theory. The procedure followed here sheds light in the structure
of Chern-Simons gravities and their regularization.
