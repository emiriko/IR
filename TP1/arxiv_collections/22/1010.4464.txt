Vortex-based spin-torque oscillators can be made from extended spin valves
connected to an electrical nanocontact. We study the implementation of
frequency shift keying modulation in these oscillators. Upon a square
modulation of the current in the 10 MHz range, the vortex frequency follows the
current command, with easy identification of the two swapping frequencies in
the spectral measurements. The frequency distribution of the output power can
be accounted for by convolution transformations of the dc current vortex
waveform, and the current modulation. Modeling indicates that the frequency
transitions are phase coherent and last less than 25 ns. Complementing the
multi-octave tunability and first-class agility, the capability of frequency
shift keying modulation is an additional milestone for the implementation of
vortex-based oscillators in RF circuit.
