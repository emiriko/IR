The atom-by-atom characterization of quantum gases requires the development
of novel measurement techniques. One particularly promising new technique
demonstrated in recent experiments uses strong fluorescent laser scattering
from neutral atoms confined in a short-period optical lattice to measure the
position of individual atoms in the sample. A crucial condition for the
measurements is that atomic hopping between lattice sites must be strongly
suppressed despite substantial photon recoil heating. This article models
three-dimensional polarization gradient cooling of atoms trapped within a
far-detuned optical lattice. The atomic dynamics are simulated using a hybrid
Monte Carlo and master equation analysis in order to predict the frequency of
processes which give rise to degradation or loss of the fluorescent signal
during measurements. It is shown, consistent with the experimental results,
that there exists a wide parameter range in which the lifetime of
strongly-fluorescing isolated lattice-trapped atoms is limited by background
gas collisions rather than radiative processes. In these cases the total number
of scattered photons can be as large as 10^8 per atom. The performance of the
technique is related to relevant experimental parameters.
