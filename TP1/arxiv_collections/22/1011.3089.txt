A novel lattice approach is presented for studying systems comprising a large
number of interacting nonrelativistic fermions. The construction is ideally
suited for numerical study of fermions near unitarity--a strongly coupled
regime corresponding to the two-particle s-wave scattering phase shift delta_0
= pi/2. Such systems may be achieved experimentally with trapped atoms, and
provide a starting point for an effective field theory description of nuclear
physics. We discuss the construction of our lattice theory, which allows us to
study systems of up to (but by no means limited to) 38 fermions with high
accuracy and modest computational resources, and offer an overview of several
applications of the technique. A more detailed discussion of applications and
simulation results will be described in companion proceedings by A. N. N. and
J-W. L.
