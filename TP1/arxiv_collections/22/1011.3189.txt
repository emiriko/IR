The Peirce quincuncial projection is a mapping of the surface of a sphere to
the interior of a square. It is a conformal map except for four points on the
equator. These points of non-conformality cause significant artifacts in
photographic applications. In this paper, we propose an algorithm and
user-interface to mitigate these artifacts. Moreover, in order to facilitate an
interactive user-interface, we present a fast algorithm for calculating the
Peirce quincuncial projection of spherical imagery. We then promote the Peirce
quincuncial projection as a viable alternative to the more popular
stereographic projection in some scenarios.
