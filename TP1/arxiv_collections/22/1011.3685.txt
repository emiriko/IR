This paper deals with multidimensional dynamic risk measures induced by
conditional $g$-expectations. A notion of multidimensional $g$-expectation is
proposed to provide a multidimensional version of nonlinear expectations. By a
technical result on explicit expressions for the comparison theorem, uniqueness
theorem and viability on a rectangle of solutions to multidimensional backward
stochastic differential equations, some necessary and sufficient conditions are
given for the constancy, monotonicity, positivity, homogeneity and
translatability properties of multidimensional conditional $g$-expectations and
multidimensional dynamic risk measures; we prove that a multidimensional
dynamic $g$-risk measure is nonincreasingly convex if and only if the generator
$g$ satisfies a quasi-monotone increasingly convex condition. A general dual
representation is given for the multidimensional dynamic convex $g$-risk
measure in which the penalty term is expressed more precisely. It is shown that
model uncertainty leads to the convexity of risk measures. As to applications,
we show how this multidimensional approach can be applied to measure the
insolvency risk of a firm with interacted subsidiaries; optimal risk sharing
for $\protect\gamma $-tolerant $g$-risk measures is investigated. Insurance
$g$-risk measure and other ways to induce $g$-risk measures are also studied at
the end of the paper.
