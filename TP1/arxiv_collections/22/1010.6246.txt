We consider the problem of homogenizing the Maxwell equations for periodic
composites. The analysis is based on Bloch-Floquet theory. We calculate
explicitly the reflection coefficient for a half-space, and derive and
implement a computationally-efficient continued-fraction expansion for the
effective permittivity. Our results are illustrated by numerical computations
for the case of two-dimensional systems. The homogenization theory of this
paper is designed to predict various physically-measurable quantities rather
than to simply approximate certain coefficients in a PDE.
