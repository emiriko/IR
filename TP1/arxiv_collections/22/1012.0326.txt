This paper is an attempt to incorporate the idea of spiking neural P systems
as an early seed into the area of Operating System Design, regarding their
capability to solve some classical computer science problems. It is reflecting
the power of such systems to simulate well known parallel computational models,
like logic gates, arithmetic operation, and sorting. In these devices, the time
(when the neurons fire and/or spike) plays an essential role. For instance, the
result of a computation is the time between the moments when a specified neuron
spikes. Seen as number computing devices, SN P systems are shown to be
computationally complete, and with such capabilities, arithmetic operations,
logic, and timing, some first steps could be taken towards an OS design.
