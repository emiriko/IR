The magnetic and multiferroic phase diagram of Mn$_{0.85}$Co$_{0.15}$WO$_4$
single crystals is investigated by means of magnetic, heat capacity,
dielectric, polarization, and neutron scattering experiments. Three magnetic
phase transitions are detected through distinct anomalies in all physical
quantities. The ferroelectric polarization is observed only along the b-axis
below 10 K but not along the a-axis as recently suggested. The magnetic phases
studied by neutron scattering are very complex. Up to four different magnetic
structures, partially coexisting at certain temperature ranges, have been
identified. Upon decreasing temperature two commensurate phases (AF4, AF1) are
followed by an incommensurate phase (AF5) and a second incommensurate phase
(AF2) is detected as a minor phase. The ferroelectric polarization is possibly
associated with both (AF2 and AF5) phases.
