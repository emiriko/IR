The COMPASS fixed-target experiment at CERN SPS is dedicated to the study of
hadron structure and dynamics. In the physics programme using hadron beams, the
focus is on the detection of new states, in particular the search for $J^{PC}$
exotic states and glueballs. After a short pilot run in 2004 (190 GeV/c
negative pion beam, lead target), we started our hadron spectroscopy programme
in 2008 by collecting an unprecedented statistics with a negative hadron beam
(190 GeV/c) on a liquid hydrogen target. A similar amount of data with positive
hadron beam (190 GeV/c) has been taken in 2009, as well as some additional data
with negative beam on nuclear targets. The spectrometer features a large
angular acceptance and high momentum resolution and also good coverage by
electromagnetic calorimetry, crucial for the detection of final states
involving $\pi^0$ or $\eta$. A first important result is the observation of a
significant $J^{PC}$ spin exotic signal consistent with the disputed
$\pi_1(1600)$ in the pilot run data. This result was recently published. We
present an overview of the status of various ongoing analyses on the 2008/09
data.
