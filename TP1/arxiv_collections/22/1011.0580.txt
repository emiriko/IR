Ramsey theory for words over a finite alphabet was unified in the work of
Carlson and Furstenberg-Katznelson. Carlson, in the same work, outlined a
method to extend the theory for words over an infinite alphabet, but subject to
a fixed dominating principle, proving in particular an Ellentuck version, and a
corresponding Ramsey theorem for k=1. In the present work we develop in a
systematic way a Ramsey theory for words (in fact for {\omega}-Z*-located
words) over a doubly infinite alphabet extending Carlson's approach (to
countable ordinals and Schreier-type families), and we apply this theory,
exploiting the Budak-Isik-Pym representation, to obtain a partition theory for
the set of rational numbers. Furthermore, we show that the theory can be used
to obtain partition theorems for arbitrary semigroups, stronger than known
ones.
