Optimum implementation of non-conventional wells allows us to increase
considerably hydrocarbon recovery. By considering the high drilling cost and
the potential improvement in well productivity, well placement decision is an
important issue in field development. Considering complex reservoir geology and
high reservoir heterogeneities, stochastic optimization methods are the most
suitable approaches for optimum well placement. This paper proposes an
optimization methodology to determine optimal well location and trajectory
based upon the Covariance Matrix Adaptation - Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) which
is a variant of Evolution Strategies recognized as one of the most powerful
derivative-free optimizers for continuous optimization. To improve the
optimization procedure, two new techniques are investigated: (1). Adaptive
penalization with rejection is developed to handle well placement constraints.
(2). A meta-model, based on locally weighted regression, is incorporated into
CMA-ES using an approximate ranking procedure. Therefore, we can reduce the
number of reservoir simulations, which are computationally expensive. Several
examples are presented. Our new approach is compared with a Genetic Algorithm
incorporating the Genocop III technique. It is shown that our approach
outperforms the genetic algorithm: it leads in general to both a higher NPV and
a significant reduction of the number of reservoir simulations.
