A canonical signature of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) is
the presence of a neutral Higgs boson with mass bounded from above by about 135
GeV and Standard Model (SM)-like couplings to the electroweak gauge bosons. In
this note we investigate the reach of the Tevatron collider for the MSSM Higgs
sector parameter space associated with a variety of high-scale minimal models
of supersymmetry (SUSY)-breaking, including the Constrained MSSM (CMSSM),
minimal Gauge Mediated SUSY-breaking (mGMSB), and minimal Anomaly Mediated
SUSY-breaking (mAMSB). We find that the Tevatron can provide strong constraints
on these models via Higgs boson searches. Considering a simple projection for
the efficiency improvements in the Tevatron analyses, we find that with an
integrated luminosity of 16 fb^-1 per detector and an efficiency improvement of
20% compared to the present situation, these models could be probed essentially
over their entire ranges of validity. With 40% analysis improvements and 16
fb^-1, our projection shows that evidence at the 3-sigma level for the light
Higgs boson could be expected in extended regions of parameter space.
