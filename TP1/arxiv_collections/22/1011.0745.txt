In addition to the narrow spin-one resonances $\rho_T$, $\omega_T$ and $a_T$
occurring in low-scale technicolor, there will be relatively narrow scalars in
the mass range 200 to 600--700 GeV. We study the lightest isoscalar state,
$\sigma_T$. In several important respects it is like a heavy Higgs boson with a
small vev. It may be discovered with high luminosity at the LHC where it is
produced via weak boson fusion and likely has substantial $W^+ W^-$ and
$Z^0Z^0$ decay modes.
