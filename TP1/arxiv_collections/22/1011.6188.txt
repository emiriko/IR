In the Standard Model, custodial symmetry is violated by the hypercharge U(1)
gauge interactions and the Yukawa couplings, while being preserved by the Higgs
scalar potential. In the two-Higgs doublet model (2HDM), the generic scalar
potential introduces new sources of custodial symmetry breaking. We obtain a
basis-independent expression for the constraints that impose custodial symmetry
on the 2HDM scalar potential. These constraints impose CP-conservation on the
scalar potential and vacuum, and in addition add one extra constraint on the
scalar potential parameters. We clarify the mass degeneracies of the 2HDM that
arise as a consequence of the custodial symmetry. We also provide a computation
of the "oblique" parameters (S, T, and U) for the most general CP-violating
2HDM in the basis-independent formalism. We demonstrate that the 2HDM
contributions to T and U vanish in the custodial symmetry limit, as expected.
Using the experimental bounds on S and T from precision electroweak data, we
examine the resulting constraints on the general 2HDM parameter space.
