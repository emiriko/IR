Quantum Action Principle formulated earlier is used as a ground for a
probabilistic interpretation of one-particle relativistic quantum mechanics. In
this new approach the probability "flows" in the Minkowsky space being
dependent on an inner time parameter which we interpret as a particle life
time. The life time is determined as a function of observable parameters of the
real experiment by means of an additional condition of stationarity for the
quantum action.
