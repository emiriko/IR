The high sensitivity of the Fermi-LAT (Large Area Telescope) offers the first
opportunity to study faint and extended GeV sources such as pulsar wind nebulae
(PWNe). After one year of observation the LAT detected and identified three
pulsar wind nebulae: the Crab Nebula, Vela-X and the PWN inside MSH 15-52. In
the meantime, the list of LAT detected pulsars increased steadily. These
pulsars are characterized by high energy loss rates from ~3 \times 10^{33} erg
s$^{-1}$ to 5 \times 10$^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and are therefore likely to power a
PWN. This paper summarizes the search for PWNe in the off-pulse windows of 54
LAT-detected pulsars using 16 months of survey observations. Ten sources show
significant emission, seven of these likely being of magnetospheric origin. The
detection of significant emission in the off-pulse interval offers new
constraints on the gamma-ray emitting regions in pulsar magnetospheres. The
three other sources with significant emission are the Crab Nebula, Vela-X and a
new pulsar wind nebula candidate associated with the LAT pulsar PSR J1023-5746,
coincident with the TeV source HESS J1023-575. We further explore the
association between the H.E.S.S. and the Fermi source by modeling its spectral
energy distribution. Flux upper limits derived for the 44 remaining sources are
used to provide new constraints on famous PWNe that have been detected at keV
and/or TeV energies.
