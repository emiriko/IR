We present an evaluation of the quark mass renormalization factor for Nf=2+1
QCD. The Schroedinger functional scheme is employed as the intermediate scheme
to carry out non-perturbative running from the low energy to deep in the high
energy perturbative region. The regularization independent step scaling
function of the quark mass is obtained in the continuum limit. Renormalization
factors for the pseudo scalar density and the axial vector current are also
evaluated for the same action and the bare couplings as two recent large scale
Nf=2+1 simulations; previous work of the CP-PACS/JLQCD collaboration, which
covered the up-down quark mass range heavier than m_pi=500 MeV and that of
PACS-CS collaboration on the physical point using the reweighting technique.
