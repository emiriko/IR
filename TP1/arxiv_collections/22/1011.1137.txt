Several late-type stars present activity cycles similar to that of the Sun.
However, these cycles have been mostly studied in F to K stars. Due to their
small intrinsic brightness, M dwarfs are not usually the targets of long-term
observational studies of stellar activity, and their long-term variability is
generally not known. In this work, we study the long-term activity of two M
dwarf stars: Gl 229 A (M1/2) and Gl 752 A (M2.5). We employ medium resolution
echelle spectra obtained at the 2.15 m telescope at the Argentinian observatory
CASLEO between the years 2000 and 2010 and photometric observations obtained
from the ASAS database. We analyzed Ca \II K line-core fluxes and the mean V
magnitude with the Lomb-Scargle periodogram, and we obtain possible activity
cycles of $\sim$4 yr and $\sim$7 yr for Gl 229 A and Gl 752 A respectively.
