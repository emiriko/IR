We report on some recent developments in understanding the nature of the
low-lying mesonic resonances $f_0(1370)$, $f_0(1710)$, $f_2(1270)$,
$f_2'(1525)$, and $K_2^*(1430)$. In particular we show that these five
resonances can be dynamically generated from vector meson--vector meson
interaction in a coupled-channel unitary approach, which utilizes the
phenomenologically very successful hidden-gauge Lagrangians to produce the
interaction kernel between two vector mesons, which is then unitarized by the
Bethe-Salpeter-equation method. The data on the strong decay branching ratios,
total decay widths, and radiative decay widths of these five states, and on
related $J/\psi$ decay processes can all be well described by such an approach.
We also make predictions, compare them with the results of earlier studies, and
highlight observables that if measured can be used to distinguish different
pictures of these resonances.
