We present physical results obtained from simulations using 2+1 flavors of
domain wall quarks and the Iwasaki gauge action at two values of the lattice
spacing $a$, ($a^{-1}$=\,1.73\,(3)\,GeV and $a^{-1}$=\,2.28\,(3)\,GeV). On the
coarser lattice, with $24^3\times 64\times 16$ points, the analysis of ref.[1]
is extended to approximately twice the number of configurations. The ensembles
on the finer $32^3\times 64\times 16$ lattice are new. We explain how we use
lattice data obtained at several values of the lattice spacing and for a range
of quark masses in combined continuum-chiral fits in order to obtain results in
the continuum limit and at physical quark masses. We implement this procedure
at two lattice spacings, with unitary pion masses in the approximate range
290--420\,MeV (225--420\,MeV for partially quenched pions). We use the masses
of the $\pi$ and $K$ mesons and the $\Omega$ baryon to determine the physical
quark masses and the values of the lattice spacing. While our data are
consistent with the predictions of NLO SU(2) chiral perturbation theory, they
are also consistent with a simple analytic ansatz leading to an inherent
uncertainty in how best to perform the chiral extrapolation that we are
reluctant to reduce with model-dependent assumptions about higher order
corrections. Our main results include $f_\pi=124(2)_{\rm stat}(5)_{\rm
syst}$\,MeV, $f_K/f_\pi=1.204(7)(25)$ where $f_K$ is the kaon decay constant,
$m_s^{\bar{\textrm{MS}}}(2\,\textrm{GeV})=(96.2\pm 2.7)$\,MeV and
$m_{ud}^{\bar{\textrm{MS}}}(2\,\textrm{GeV})=(3.59\pm 0.21)$\,MeV\,
($m_s/m_{ud}=26.8\pm 1.4$) where $m_s$ and $m_{ud}$ are the mass of the
strange-quark and the average of the up and down quark masses respectively,
$[\Sigma^{\msbar}(2 {\rm GeV})]^{1/3} = 256(6)\; {\rm MeV}$, where $\Sigma$ is
the chiral condensate, the Sommer scale $r_0=0.487(9)$\,fm and
$r_1=0.333(9)$\,fm.
