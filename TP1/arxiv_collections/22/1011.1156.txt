We propose a technique to initialize an electron spin in a semiconductor
quantum dot with a single short optical pulse. It relies on the fast depletion
of the initial spin state followed by a preferential, Purcell-accelerated
desexcitation towards the desired state thanks to a micropillar cavity. We
theoretically discuss the limits on initialization rate and fidelity, and
derive the pulse area for optimal initialization. We show that spin
initialization is possible using a single optical pulse down to a few tens of
picoseconds wide.
