In this paper, we study slowly rotating black hole solutions in Lovelock
gravity (n=3). These exact slowly rotating black hole solutions are obtained in
uncharged and charged cases, respectively. Up to the linear order of the
rotating parameter a, the mass, Hawking temperature and entropy of the
uncharged black holes get no corrections from rotation. In charged case, we
compute magnetic dipole moment and gyromagnetic ratio of the black holes. It is
shown that the gyromagnetic ratio keeps invariant after introducing the
Gauss-Bonnet and third order Lovelock interactions.
