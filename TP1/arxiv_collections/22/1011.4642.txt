We investigate the St\"{u}ckelberg oscillations of a spin-1 Bose-Einstein
condensate subject to a spatially inhomogeneous transverse magnetic field and a
periodic longitudinal field. We show that the time-domain St\"{u}ckelberg
oscillations result in interference fringes in the density profiles of all spin
components due to the spatial inhomogeneity of the transverse field. This
phenomenon represents the Landau-Zener-St\"{u}ckelberg interference in the
space-domain. Since the magnetic dipole-dipole interaction between spin-1 atoms
induces an inhomogeneous effective magnetic field, interference fringes also
appear if a dipolar spinor condensate is driven periodically. We also point out
some potential applications of this spatial Landau-Zener-St\"{u}kelberg
interference.
