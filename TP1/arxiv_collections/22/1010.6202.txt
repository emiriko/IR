We consider the problem of bandwidth selection by cross-validation from a
sequential point of view in a nonparametric regression model. Having in mind
that in applications one often aims at estimation, prediction and change
detection simultaneously, we investigate that approach for sequential kernel
smoothers in order to base these tasks on a single statistic. We provide
uniform weak laws of large numbers and weak consistency results for the
cross-validated bandwidth. Extensions to weakly dependent error terms are
discussed as well. The errors may be {\alpha}-mixing or L2-near epoch
dependent, which guarantees that the uniform convergence of the cross
validation sum and the consistency of the cross-validated bandwidth hold true
for a large class of time series. The method is illustrated by analyzing
photovoltaic data.
