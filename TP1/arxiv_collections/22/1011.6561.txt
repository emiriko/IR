We study the dependence on various parameters of the exceptional set in
Vojta's conjecture. In particular, by making use of certain elliptic surfaces,
we answer in the negative the often-raised question of whether Vojta's
conjecture holds when extended to all algebraic points (that is, if the
conjecture holds without fixing a bound on the degree of the algebraic points).
