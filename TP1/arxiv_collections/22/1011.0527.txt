In Ciphertext Policy Attribute based Encryption scheme, the encryptor can fix
the policy, who can decrypt the encrypted message. The policy can be formed
with the help of attributes. In CP-ABE, access policy is sent along with the
ciphertext. We propose a method in which the access policy need not be sent
along with the ciphertext, by which we are able to preserve the privacy of the
encryptor. The proposed construction is provably secure under Decision Bilinear
Diffe-Hellman assumption.
