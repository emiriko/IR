We study multistrange hadrons produced in NA49 and STAR experiments at center
of mass energies varying from \sqrt{s_{NN}} = 7.61 GeV to 200 GeV. We show that
the yields of {\Xi}, {\Xi}-bar and {\phi} can help to constrain the physical
conditions present in the hot dense fireball source of these multistrange
hadrons created in heavy ion collision. We address the question of chemical
equilibrium of individual quark flavors before and after hadronization and
offer a few predictions for LHC.
