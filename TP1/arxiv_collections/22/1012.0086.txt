The recently published PHENIX data of direct photons at low pt from Au+Au
collisions at the BNL relativestic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) energy 200 GeV
have attracted a lot of theoretic interest. Here I review our theoretical
calculation which successfully reproduces the measured pt spectra of direct
photons from Au+Au at different centralities over a wide pt range, in order to
show a close relation between hadronic observables and those of direct photons.
