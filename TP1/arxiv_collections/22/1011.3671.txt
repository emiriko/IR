We discuss the recent paper by Inan and Ugurlu [Inan I.E., Ugurlu Y.,
Exp-function method for the exact solutions of fifth order KdV equation and
modified Burgers equation, Appl. Math. Comp. 217 (2010) 1294 -- 1299]. We
demonstrate that all exact solutions of fifth order KdV equation and modified
Burgers equation by Inan and Ugurlu are trivial solutions that are reduced to
constants. Moreover, we show exact solutions of the fifth -- order equation
studied by Inan and Ugurlu cannot be found by the Exp-function method.
