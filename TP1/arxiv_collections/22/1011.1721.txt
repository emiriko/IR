Recent BNL and Jlab data provided new evidence on two nucleon correlations
(2NC) in nuclei. The data confirm the validity of the convolution model,
describing the spectral function (SF) of a correlated pair moving in the mean
field with high and low relative and center-of-mass (cm) momenta, respectively.
The model is built assuming that the wave function (WF) of a nucleus A,
describing a configuration where the cm momentum of a correlated pair is low
and its relative momentum is high, factorizes into the product of the two-body
WF and that of the A-2 system. Such a factorization has been shown to occur in
nuclear matter (NM). Here it is shown that few-body systems exhibit
factorization, which seems to be therefore a general property, to be reproduced
also in studies of the WF of finite nuclei.
