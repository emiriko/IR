Planets orbiting post-common envelope binaries provide fundamental
information on planet formation and evolution, especially for the yet nearly
unexplored class of circumbinary planets. We searched for such planets in \odp,
an eclipsing short-period binary, which shows long-term eclipse-time
variations. Using published, reanalysed, and new mid-eclipse times of the white
dwarf in DP\,Leo, obtained between 1979 and 2010, we find agreement with the
light-travel-time effect produced by a third body in an elliptical orbit. In
particular, the measured binary period in 2009/2010 and the implied radial
velocity coincide with the values predicted for the motion of the binary and
the third body around the common center of mass. The orbital period, semi-major
axis, and eccentricity of the third body are P_c = 28.0 +/- 2.0 yrs, a_c = 8.2
+/- 0.4 AU, and e_c = 0.39 +/- 0.13. Its mass of M_c sin(i_c) = 6.1 +/- 0.5 M_J
qualifies it as a giant planet. It formed either as a first generation object
in a protoplanetary disk around the original binary or as a second generation
object in a disk formed in the common envelope shed by the progenitor of the
white dwarf. Even a third generation origin in matter lost from the present
accreting binary can not be entirely excluded. We searched for, but found no
evidence for a fourth body.
