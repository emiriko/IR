The CoRoT and Kepler satellites have provided thousands of red-giant
oscillation spectra. The analysis of these spectra requires efficient methods
for identifying all eigenmode parameters. The assumption of new scaling laws
allows us to construct a theoretical oscillation pattern. We then obtain a
highly precise determination of the large separation by correlating the
observed patterns with this reference. We demonstrate that this pattern is
universal and are able to unambiguously assign the eigenmode radial orders and
angular degrees. This solves one of the current outstanding problems of
asteroseismology hence allowing precise theoretical investigation of red-giant
interiors.
