A long-range soliton interaction is discussed whereby two or more dark
solitons interact in an inhomogeneous atomic condensate, modifying their
respective dynamics via the exchange of sound waves without ever coming into
direct contact. An idealized double well geometry is shown to yield perfect
energy transfer and complete periodic identity reversal of the two solitons.
Two experimentally relevant geometries are analyzed which should enable the
observation of this long-range interaction.
