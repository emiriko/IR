In Ref. [1] (by J. Alexandre) a minimal extension of (3+1)-dimensional
Quantum Electrodynamics has been proposed, which includes Lorentz-Violation
(LV) in the form of higher-(spatial)-derivative isotropic terms in the gauge
sector, suppressed by a mass scale $M$. The model can lead to dynamical mass
generation for charged fermions. In this article I elaborate further on this
idea and I attempt to connect it to specific quantum-gravity models, inspired
from string/brane theory. Specifically, in the first part of the article, I
comment briefly on the gauge dependence of the dynamical mass generation in the
approximations of [1], and I propose a possible avenue for obtaining the true
gauge-parameter-independent value of the mass by means of Pinch Technique
argumentations. In the second part of the work I embed the LV QED model into
multibrane world scenarios with a view to provide a geometrical way of
enhancing the dynamical mass to phenomenologically realistic values by means of
bulk warp metric factors, in an (inverse) Randall-Sundrum hierarchy. Finally in
the third part of this note, I demonstrate that such Lorentz Violating QED
models may represent parts of a low-energy effective action (of
Finsler-Born-Infeld type) of open strings propagating in quantum D0-particle
stochastic space-time foam backgrounds, which are viewed as consistent quantum
gravity configurations.
