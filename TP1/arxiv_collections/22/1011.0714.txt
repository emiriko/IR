Without assuming necessary conditions for observers such as galaxies or
entropy production, we show that the causal patch measure predicts the
coincidence of vacuum energy and present matter density. Their common scale,
and thus the enormous size of the visible universe, has its origin in the
number of metastable vacua in the landscape.
