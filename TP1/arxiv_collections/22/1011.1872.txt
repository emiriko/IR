We present the main results on the energy spectrum and composition of the
highest energy cosmic rays of energy exceeding 10$^{18}$ eV obtained by the
High Resolution Fly's Eye and the Southern Auger Observatory. The current
results are somewhat contradictory and raise interesting questions about the
origin and character of these particles.
