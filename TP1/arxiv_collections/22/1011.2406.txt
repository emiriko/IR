We investigate the interaction of a fluctuating alpha-effect with large-scale
shear in a simple nonlinear 1-dimensional dynamo wave model. We firstly extend
the calculations of Proctor (2007, MNRAS, 41, L39-L42) to include spatial
variation of the fluctuations, and find that there can be a mechanism for
magnetic field generation, even when the mean alpha is zero, provided the
spatiotemporal spectrum of the fluctuations has an appropriate form. We
investigate mean-field dynamo action when the new term arising from the
fluctuations is non-zero, and present results concerning the stability and
frequency of the solutions and parity selection in the nonlinear regime. The
relation between the asymptotic theory and explicit simulation of a traditional
mean-field model with a fluctuating function for the alpha-effect term is
discussed.
