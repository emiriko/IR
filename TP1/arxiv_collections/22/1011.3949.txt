First-principles modeling of a GeO2/Ge(001) interface reveals that sixfold
GeO2, which is derived from cristobalite and is different from rutile,
dramatically reduces the lattice mismatch at the interface and is much more
stable than the conventional fourfold interface. Since the grain boundary
between fourfold and sixfold GeO2 is unstable, the sixfold GeO2 forms a large
grain at the interface. On the contrary, a comparative study with SiO2
demonstrates that SiO2 maintains a fourfold structure. The sixfold GeO2/Ge
interface is shown to be a consequence of the ground-state phase of GeO2. In
addition, the electronic structure calculation reveals that sixfold GeO2 at the
interface shifts the valence band maximum far from the interface toward the
conduction band.
