This paper presents an overview of scanning-gate microscopy applied to the
imaging of electron transport through buried semiconductor nanostructures.
After a brief description of the technique and of its possible artifacts, we
give a summary of some of its most instructive achievements found in the
literature and we present an updated review of our own research. It focuses on
the imaging of GaInAs-based quantum rings both in the low magnetic field
Aharonov-Bohm regime and in the high-field quantum Hall regime. In all of the
given examples, we emphasize how a local-probe approach is able to shed new, or
complementary, light on transport phenomena which are usually studied by means
of macroscopic conductance measurements.
