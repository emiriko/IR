We analyse new spectra of the multiple system SZ Cam because previous studies
found different values of the primary radial velocity amplitude. The older
solutions of light curves also have different ratios of secondary to primary
luminosity as inferred from the observed equivalent widths of spectral lines.
We therefore reanalyse the light curves of the eclipsing pair. Only the light
curve derived by Wesselink has a solution that agrees with the observed
equivalent width ratio. The resulting parameters of the binary are discussed.
Masses of $M_1=16.6$ and $M_2=11.9$ M$_{\odot}$, and radii $R_1=9.4$ and
$R_2=5.4$ R$_{\odot}$ are derived. We point out that radial velocities measured
with the CCF method can be misleading when the method is applied to multiple
systems with complex line blends. New radial velocities are also obtained for
the visual component ADS 2984 A (HD 25639).
