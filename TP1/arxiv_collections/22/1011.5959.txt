We report the first experimental demonstration of combined spatial and
temporal control of light trajectories through opaque media. This control is
achieved by solely manipulating spatial degrees of freedom of the incident
wavefront. As an application, we demonstrate that the present approach is
capable to form bandwidth-limited ultrashort pulses from the otherwise randomly
transmitted light with a controllable interaction time of the pulses with the
medium. Our approach provides a new tool for fundamental studies of light
propagation in complex media and has potential for applications for coherent
control, sensing and imaging in nano- and biophotonics.
