We prove that in the limit $m_b, m_c\to\infty$ with $m_c/m_b$ fixed,
factorization holds at order $\alpha_s$ for the decay
$\Lambda_b^0\to\Lambda_c^+\pi^-$. This proof is done in the infinite-momentum
frame in which the momenta of $\pi$, $\Lambda_c$, and $\Lambda_b$ go to
infinity. Our result is renormalization scale and scheme independent at
$\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s)$. This is the same as QCD factorization for $B \to D
\pi$.
