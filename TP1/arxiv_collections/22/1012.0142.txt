We report a statistical analysis over more than eight thousand songs.
Specifically, we investigate the probability distribution of the normalized
sound amplitudes. Our findings seems to suggest a universal form of
distribution which presents a good agreement with a one-parameter stretched
Gaussian. We also argue that this parameter can give information on music
complexity, and consequently it goes towards classifying songs as well as music
genres. Additionally, we present statistical evidences that correlation aspects
of the songs are directly related with the non-Gaussian nature of their sound
amplitude distributions.
