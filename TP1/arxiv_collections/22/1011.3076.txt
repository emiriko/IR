It has previously been shown that the excess of events reported by the CoGeNT
collaboration could be generated by elastically scattering dark matter
particles with a mass of approximately 5-15 GeV. This mass range is very
similar to that required to generate the annual modulation observed by
DAMA/LIBRA and the gamma rays from the region surrounding the Galactic Center
identified within the data of the Fermi Gamma Ray Space Telescope. To
confidently conclude that CoGeNT's excess is the result of dark matter,
however, further data will likely be needed. In this paper, we make projections
for the first full year of CoGeNT data, and for its planned upgrade. Not only
will this body of data more accurately constrain the spectrum of nuclear recoil
events, and corresponding dark matter parameter space, but will also make it
possible to identify seasonal variations in the rate. In particular, if the
CoGeNT excess is the product of dark matter, then one year of CoGeNT data will
likely reveal an annual modulation with a significance of 2-3$\sigma$. The
planned CoGeNT upgrade will not only detect such an annual modulation with high
significance, but will be capable of measuring the energy spectrum of the
modulation amplitude. These measurements will be essential to irrefutably
confirming a dark matter origin of these events.
