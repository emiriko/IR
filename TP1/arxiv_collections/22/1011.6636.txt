We introduce the notion of ideal triangle in the Bruhat-Tits building
associated to a split group -- it is analogous to the usual notion of triangle,
but one vertex is "at infinity" in a certain direction. We prove that the
algebraic variety of based ideal triangles with prescribed side-lengths is
naturally isomorphic to a suitable variety of genuine triangles. From theorems
pertaining to genuine triangles, we deduce saturation theorems related to
branching to Levi subgroups and to the constant term homomorphisms.
