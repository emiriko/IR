The nova outburst experienced in 2010 by the symbiotic binary Mira V407 Cyg
has been extensively studied at optical and infrared wavelengths with both
photometric and spectroscopic observations. This outburst, reminiscent of
similar events displayed by RS Oph, can be described as a very fast He/N nova
erupting while being deeply embedded in the dense wind of its cool giant
companion. The hard radiation from the initial thermonuclear flash ionizes and
excites the wind of the Mira over great distances (recombination is observed on
a time scale of 4 days). The nova ejecta is found to progressively decelerate
with time as it expands into the Mira wind. This is deduced from line widths
which change from a FWHM of 2760 km/s on day +2.3 to 200 km/s on day +196. The
wind of the Mira is massive and extended enough for an outer neutral and
unperturbed region to survive at all outburst phases.
