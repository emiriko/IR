The detection of mechanical vibrations near the quantum limit is a formidable
challenge since the displacement becomes vanishingly small when the number of
phonon quanta tends towards zero. An interesting setup for on-chip
nanomechanical resonators is that of coupling them to electrical microwave
cavities for detection and manipulation. Here we show how to achieve a large
cavity coupling energy of up to (2 \pi) 1 MHz/nm for metallic beam resonators
at tens of MHz. We used focused ion beam (FIB) cutting to produce uniform slits
down to 10 nm, separating patterned resonators from their gate electrodes, in
suspended aluminum films. We measured the thermomechanical vibrations down to a
temperature of 25 mK, and we obtained a low number of about twenty phonons at
the equilibrium bath temperature. The mechanical properties of Al were
excellent after FIB cutting and we recorded a quality factor of Q ~ 3 x 10^5
for a 67 MHz resonator at a temperature of 25 mK. Between 0.2K and 2K we find
that the dissipation is linearly proportional to the temperature.
