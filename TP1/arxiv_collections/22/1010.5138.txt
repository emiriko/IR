We show experimentally the successful use of colloidal lithography for the
fabrication of negative index metamaterials in the near-infrared wavelength
range. In particular, we investigated a specific implementation of the widely
studied double fishnet metamaterials, consisting of a gold-silica-gold layer
stack perforated by a hexagonal array of round holes. Tuning of the hole
diameter allows us to tailor these self-assembled metamaterials both as single-
({\epsilon} < 0) and double ({\epsilon} < 0 and {\mu} < 0) negative
metamaterials.
