The recently developed model of three-dimensional angular momentum projection
plus generator coordinate method on top of triaxial relativistic mean-field
states has been applied to study the low-lying states of $^{30}$Mg. The effects
of triaxiality on the low-energy spectra and E0 and E2 transitions are
examined.
