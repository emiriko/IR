We investigate the evolution of the galaxy population since redshift 2 with a
focus on the colour bimodality and mass density of the red sequence. We obtain
precise and reliable photometric redshifts up to z=2 by supplementing the
optical survey COMBO-17 with observations in four near-infrared bands on 0.2
square degrees of the COMBO-17 A901-field. Our results are based on an
H-band-selected catalogue of 10692 galaxies complete to H=21.7. We measure the
rest-frame colour (U_280-V) of each galaxy, which across the redshift range of
our interest requires no extrapolation and is robust against moderate redshift
errors by staying clear of the 4000A-break. We measure the colour-magnitude
relation of the red sequence as a function of lookback time from the peak in a
colour error-weighted histogram, and thus trace the galaxy bimodality out to
z~1.65. The (U_280-V) of the red sequence is found to evolve almost linearly
with lookback time. At high redshift, we find massive galaxies in both the red
and the blue population. Red-sequence galaxies with log M_*/M_sun>11 increase
in mass density by a factor of ~4 from z~2 to 1 and remain nearly constant at
z<1. However, some galaxies as massive as log M_*/M_sun=11.5 are already in
place at z~2.
