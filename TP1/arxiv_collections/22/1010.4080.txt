We show ~10x polariton-enhanced infrared reflectivity of epitaxial graphene
on 4H-SiC, in SiC's restrahlen band (8-10um). By fitting measurements to
theory, we extract the thickness, N, in monolayers (ML), momentum scattering
time, Fermi level position of graphene and estimate carrier mobility. By
showing that 1/root(ns), the carrier concentration/ML, we argue that scattering
is dominated by short-range interactions at the SiC/graphene interface.
Polariton formation finds application in near-field optical devices such as
superlenses.
