We have conducted a 3-month program of simultaneous optical, soft and hard
X-ray monitoring of the LMXB 4U1636-536/V801 Ara using the SMARTS 1.3m
telescope and archival RXTE/ASM and Swift/XRT data. 4U1636-536 has been
exhibiting a large amplitude, quasi-periodic variability since 2002 when its
X-ray flux dramatically declined by roughly an order of magnitude. We confirmed
that the anti-correlation between soft (2-12 keV) and hard (> 20 keV) X-rays,
first investigated by Shih et al. (2005), is not an isolated event but a
fundamental characteristic of this source's variability properties. However,
the variability itself is neither strictly stable nor changing on an even
longer characteristic timescale. We also demonstrate that the optical
counterpart varies on the same timescale, and is correlated with the soft, and
not the hard, X-rays. This clearly shows that X-ray reprocessing in LMXB discs
is mainly driven by soft X-rays. The X-ray spectra in different epochs of the
variability revealed a change of spectral characteristics which resemble the
state change of black hole X-ray binaries. All the evidence suggests that
4U1636-536 is frequently (~monthly) undergoing X-ray state transitions, a
characteristic feature of X-ray novae with their wide range of luminosities
associated with outburst events. In its current behavioural mode, this makes
4U1636-536 an ideal target for investigating the details of state changes in
luminous X-ray binaries.
