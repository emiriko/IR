Alternative partial Boolean structures, implicit in the discussion of
classical representability of sets of quantum mechanical predictions, are
characterized, with definite general conclusions on the equivalence of the
approaches going back to Bell and Kochen-Specker. An algebraic approach is
presented, allowing for a discussion of partial classical extension, amounting
to reduction of the number of contexts, classical representability arising as a
special case. As a result, known techniques are generalized and some of the
associated computational difficulties overcome. The implications on the
discussion of Boole-Bell inequalities are indicated.
