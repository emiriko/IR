We prove that, assuming the F-conjecture, the log canonical model of the pair
$(\bar{M}_{0,n}, \sum a_i \psi_i)$ is the Hassett's moduli space of weighted
pointed stable rational curves without any modification of weight coefficients.
For the boundary weight cases, we prove that the birational model is the GIT
quotient of the product of the projective lines. This is a generalization of
Simpson's theorem for symmetric weight cases.
