IGR J17511-3057 is the second X-ray transient accreting millisecond pulsar
discovered by INTEGRAL. It was in outburst for about a month from September 13,
2009. The broad-band average spectrum is well described by thermal
Comptonization with an electron temperature of kT_e ~ 25 keV, soft seed photons
of kT_bb ~ 0.6 keV, and Thomson optical depth \tau_T ~ 2 in a slab geometry.
During the outburst the spectrum stays remarkably stable with plasma and soft
seed photon temperatures and scattering optical depth being constant within
errors. We fitted the outburst profile with the exponential model, and using
the disk instability model we inferred the outer disk radius to be (4.8 - 5.4)
\times 1010 cm. The INTEGRAL and RXTE data reveal the X-ray pulsation at a
period of 4.08 milliseconds up to ~ 120 keV. The pulsed fraction is shown to
decrease from ~22% at 3 keV to a constant pulsed fraction of ~17-18% between
7-30 keV, and then to decrease again down to ~13% at 60 keV. The nearly
sinusoidal pulses show soft lags monotonically increasing with energy to about
0.2 ms at 10-20 keV similar to those observed in other accreting pulsars. The
short burst profiles indicate hydrogen-poor material at ignition, which
suggests either that the accreted material is hydrogen-deficient, or that the
CNO metallicity is up to a factor of 2 times solar. However, the variation of
burst recurrence time as a function of m (inferred from the X-ray flux) is much
smaller than predicted by helium-ignition models.
