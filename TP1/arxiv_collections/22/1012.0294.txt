Let $X_1,..., X_N\in\R^n$ be independent centered random vectors with
log-concave distribution and with the identity as covariance matrix. We show
that with overwhelming probability at least $1 - 3 \exp(-c\sqrt{n}\r)$ one has
$
  \sup_{x\in S^{n-1}} \Big|\frac{1/N}\sum_{i=1}^N (|<X_i, x>|^2 - \E|<X_i,
x>|^2\r)\Big|
  \leq C \sqrt{\frac{n/N}},$ where $C$ is an absolute positive constant. This
result is valid in a more general framework when the linear forms
$(<X_i,x>)_{i\leq N, x\in S^{n-1}}$ and the Euclidean norms $(|X_i|/\sqrt
n)_{i\leq N}$ exhibit uniformly a sub-exponential decay. As a consequence, if
$A$ denotes the random matrix with columns $(X_i)$, then with overwhelming
probability, the extremal singular values $\lambda_{\rm min}$ and $\lambda_{\rm
max}$ of $AA^\top$ satisfy the inequalities $ 1 - C\sqrt{{n/N}} \le
{\lambda_{\rm min}/N} \le \frac{\lambda_{\rm max}/N} \le 1 + C\sqrt{{n/N}} $
which is a quantitative version of Bai-Yin theorem \cite{BY} known for random
matrices with i.i.d. entries.
