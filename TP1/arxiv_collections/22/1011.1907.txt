The effects of atomic diffusion on internal and surface abundances of A and F
pre-main-sequence stars with mass loss are studied in order to determine at
what age the effects materialize, as well as to further understand the
processes at play in HAeBe and young ApBp stars. Self-consistent stellar
evolution models of 1.5 to 2.8Msun with atomic diffusion (including radiative
accelerations) for all species within the OPAL opacity database were computed
and compared to observations of HAeBe stars. Atomic diffusion in the presence
of weak mass loss can explain the observed abundance anomalies of
pre-main-sequence stars, as well as the presence of binary systems with metal
rich primaries and chemically normal secondaries such as V380 Ori and HD72106.
This is in contrast to turbulence models which do not allow for abundance
anomalies to develop on the pre-main-sequence. The age at which anomalies can
appear depends on stellar mass. For A and F stars, the effects of atomic
diffusion can modify both the internal and surface abundances before the onset
of the MS. The appearance of important surface abundance anomalies on the
pre-main-sequence does not require mass loss, though the mass loss rate affects
their amplitude. Observational tests are suggested to decipher the effects of
mass loss from those of turbulent mixing. If abundance anomalies are confirmed
in pre-main-sequence stars they would severely limit the role of turbulence in
these stars.
