We address in detail the issue of possible resonances in the massive modes on
a brane without reflection symmetry. After identifying a set of solvability
conditions, we show explicitly how the modes of the asymmetric case can be
traced back to the modes of the symmetric RS-2 scenario. The possible
occurrence of resonances is revisited and discussed by finding analytical
solutions. We find that the resonant behavior is very mild even for strong
asymmetries, and moreover it occurs only for very large masses, so that its
effects on the Newtonian potential are exponentially suppressed.
