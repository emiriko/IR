We present pre- and post-outburst observations of the new FU Orionis-like
young stellar object PTF 10qpf (also known as LkHa 188-G4 and HBC 722). Prior
to this outburst, LkHa 188-G4 was classified as a classical T Tauri star on the
basis of its optical emission-line spectrum superposed on a K8-type
photosphere, and its photometric variability. The mid-infrared spectral index
of LkHa 188-G4 indicates a Class II-type object. LkHa 188-G4 exhibited a steady
rise by ~1 mag over ~11 months starting in Aug. 2009, before a subsequent more
abrupt rise of > 3 mag on a time scale of ~2 months. Observations taken during
the eruption exhibit the defining characteristics of FU Orionis variables: (i)
an increase in brightness by > 4 mag, (ii) a bright optical/near-infrared
reflection nebula appeared, (iii) optical spectra are consistent with a G
supergiant and dominated by absorption lines, the only exception being Halpha
which is characterized by a P Cygni profile, (iv) near-infrared spectra
resemble those of late K--M giants/supergiants with enhanced absorption seen in
the molecular bands of CO and H_2O, and (v) outflow signatures in H and He are
seen in the form of blueshifted absorption profiles. LkHa 188-G4 is the first
member of the FU Orionis-like class with a well-sampled optical to mid-infrared
spectral energy distribution in the pre-outburst phase. The association of the
PTF 10qpf outburst with the previously identified classical T Tauri star LkHa
188-G4 (HBC 722) provides strong evidence that FU Orionis-like eruptions
represent periods of enhanced disk accretion and outflow, likely triggered by
instabilities in the disk. The early identification of PTF 10qpf as an FU
Orionis-like variable will enable detailed photometric and spectroscopic
observations during its post-outburst evolution for comparison with other known
outbursting objects.
