The energetic electromagnetic eruptions observed during the prompt phase of
gamma-ray bursts are attributed to synchrotron emissions. The internal shocks
moving through the ultrarelativistic jet, which is ejected by an imploding
supermassive star, are the likely source of this radiation. Synchrotron
emissions at the observed strength require the simultaneous presence of
powerful magnetic fields and highly relativistic electrons. We explore with one
and three-dimensional relativistic particle-in-cell simulations the transition
layer of a shock, that evolves out of the collision of two plasma clouds at a
speed 0.9c and in the presence of a quasi-parallel magnetic field. The cloud
densities vary by a factor of 10. The number densities of ions and electrons in
each cloud, which have the mass ratio 250, are equal. The peak Lorentz factor
of the electrons is determined in the 1D simulation, as well as the orientation
and the strength of the magnetic field at the boundary of the two colliding
clouds. The relativistic masses of the electrons and ions close to the shock
transition layer are comparable as in previous work. The 3D simulation shows
rapid and strong plasma filamentation behind the transient precursor. The
magnetic field component orthogonal to the initial field direction is amplified
in both simulations to values that exceed those expected from the shock
compression by over an order of magnitude. The forming shock is
quasi-perpendicular due to this amplification. The simultaneous presence of
highly relativistic electrons and strong magnetic fields will give rise to
significant synchrotron emissions.
