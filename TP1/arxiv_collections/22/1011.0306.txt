Semantic Web is, without a doubt, gaining momentum in both industry and
academia. The word "Semantic" refers to "meaning" - a semantic web is a web of
meaning. In this fast changing and result oriented practical world, gone are
the days where an individual had to struggle for finding information on the
Internet where knowledge management was the major issue. The semantic web has a
vision of linking, integrating and analysing data from various data sources and
forming a new information stream, hence a web of databases connected with each
other and machines interacting with other machines to yield results which are
user oriented and accurate. With the emergence of Semantic Web framework the
na\"ive approach of searching information on the syntactic web is clich\'e.
This paper proposes an optimised semantic searching of keywords exemplified by
simulation an ontology of Indian universities with a proposed algorithm which
ramifies the effective semantic retrieval of information which is easy to
access and time saving.
