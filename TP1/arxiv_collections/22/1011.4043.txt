Uniform probability distributions on $\ell_p$ balls and spheres have been
studied extensively and are known to behave like product measures in high
dimensions. In this note we consider the uniform distribution on the
intersection of a simplex and a sphere. Certain new and interesting features,
such as phase transitions and localization phenomena emerge.
