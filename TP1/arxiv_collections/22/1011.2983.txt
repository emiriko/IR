The radiative instability of a beam moving in a photonic crystal of finite
dimensions is studied. The dispersion equation is obtained. The law $\Gamma\sim
\rho ^{1/\left( {s + 3} \right)}$ is shown to be valid and caused by the mixing
of the electromagnetic field modes in the finite volume due to the periodic
disturbance from the photonic crystal.
