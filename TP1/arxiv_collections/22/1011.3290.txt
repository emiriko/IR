In the first purpose, we concentrate on the theory of quantum integrable
systems underlying the Connes-Kreimer approach. We introduce a new family of
Hamiltonian systems depended on the perturbative renormalization process in
renormalizable theories. It is observed that the renormalization group can
determine an infinite dimensional integrable system such that this fact
provides a link between this proposed class of motion integrals and
renormalization flow. Moreover, with help of the integral renormalization
theorems, we study motion integrals underlying Bogoliubv character and BCH
series to obtain a new family of fixed point equations. In the second goal, we
consider the combinatorics of Connes-Marcolli approach to provide a Hall rooted
tree type reformulation from one particular object in this theory namely,
universal Hopf algebra of renormalization $H_{\mathbb{U}}$. As the
consequences, interesting relations between this Hopf algebra and some
well-known combinatorial Hopf algebras are obtained and also, one can make a
new Hall polynomial representation from universal singular frame such that
based on the universal nature of this special loop, one can expect a Hall tree
type scattering formula for physical information such as counterterms. In the
third aim, with attention to the given rooted tree version of $H_{\mathbb{U}}$
and by applying the Connes-Marcolli's universal investigation, we discover a
new geometric explanation from Dyson-Schwinger equations.
