We prove a generalization of the van Leeuwen theorem towards quantum
electrodynamics, providing the formal foundations of a time-dependent Kohn-Sham
construction for coupled quantized matter and electromagnetic fields. Thereby
we circumvent the symmetry-causality problems associated with the
action-functional approach to Kohn-Sham systems. We show that the effective
external four-potential and four-current of the Kohn-Sham system are uniquely
defined and that the effective four-current takes a very simple form. Further
we rederive the Runge-Gross theorem for quantum electrodynamics.
