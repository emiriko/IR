SrTiO$_3$ is a promising $n$-type oxide semiconductor for thermoelectric
energy conversion. Epitaxial thin films of SrTiO$_3$ doped with both La and
oxygen vacancies have been synthesized by pulsed laser deposition (PLD). The
thermoelectric and galvanomagnetic properties of these films have been
characterized at temperatures ranging from 300 K to 900 K and are typical of a
doped semiconductor. Thermopower values of double-doped films are comparable to
previous studies of La doped single crystals at similar carrier concentrations.
The highest thermoelectric figure of merit ($ZT$) was measured to be 0.28 at
873 K at a carrier concentration of $2.5\times10^{21}$ cm$^{-3}$.
