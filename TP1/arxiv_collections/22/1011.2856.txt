The temperature dependent dc resistivity of the quasi-one-dimensional organic
salts (TMTTF)2X ( X = PF6, AsF6, SbF6; BF4, ClO4, ReO4) has been measured in
all three crystal directions in order to investigate anisotropy, localization
effects, charge and anion ordering phenomena at low temperatures. For all
compounds and directions we extract the transport mechanisms in different
regimes. The data are thoroughly analyzed, related to structural properties,
and extensively discussed in view of previous studies and latest theories. It
becomes apparent that the anions have a severe influence on the physical
properties of the TMTTF salts.
