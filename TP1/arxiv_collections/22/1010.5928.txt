IR absorption spectroscopy of hemoglobin was performed using an IR optical
parametric oscillator laser and a commercial atomic force microscope in a novel
experimental arrangement based on the use of a bottom-up excitation alignment.
This experimental approach enables detection of protein samples with a
resolution that is much higher than that of standard IR spectroscopy. Presented
here are AFM based IR absorption spectra of micron sized hemoglobin features
