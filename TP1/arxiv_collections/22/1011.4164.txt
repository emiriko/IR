A relation between a class of stationary points of the energy landscape of
continuous spin models on a lattice and the configurations of a Ising model
defined on the same lattice suggests an approximate expression for the
microcanonical density of states. Based on this approximation we conjecture
that if a O(n) model with ferromagnetic interactions on a lattice has a phase
transition, its critical energy density is equal to that of the n = 1 case,
i.e., a system of Ising spins with the same interactions. The conjecture holds
true in the case of long-range interactions. For nearest-neighbor interactions,
numerical results are consistent with the conjecture for n=2 and n=3 in three
dimensions. For n=2 in two dimensions (XY model) the conjecture yields a
prediction for the critical energy of the Berezinskij-Kosterlitz-Thouless
transition, which would be equal to that of the two-dimensional Ising model. We
discuss available numerical data in this respect.
