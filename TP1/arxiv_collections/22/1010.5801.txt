SONYC - Substellar Objects in Nearby Young Clusters - is a survey program to
investigate the frequency and properties of brown dwarfs down to masses below
the Deuterium burning limit in nearby star forming regions. In this second
paper, we present results on the ~1 Myr old cluster Rho Ophiuchi, combining our
own deep optical and near-infrared imaging using Subaru with photometry from
the 2-Micron All Sky Survey and the Spitzer Space Telescope. Of the candidates
selected from iJKs photometry, we have confirmed three -- including a new brown
dwarf with a mass close to the Deuterium limit -- as likely cluster members
through low-resolution infrared spectroscopy. We also identify 27 sub-stellar
candidates with mid-infrared excess consistent with disk emission, of which 16
are new and 11 are previously spectroscopically confirmed brown dwarfs. The
high and variable extinction makes it difficult to obtain the complete
sub-stellar population in this region. However, current data suggest that its
ratio of low-mass stars to brown dwarfs in similar to those reported for
several other clusters, though higher than what was found for NGC 1333 in
Scholz et al. 2009.
