We make a first approach to the representation theory of the wedge product of
coalgebras by means of the description of its valued Gabriel quiver. Then we
define semiprime coalgebras and study its category of comodules by the use of
localization techniques. In particular, we prove that, whether its Gabriel
quiver is locally finite, any monomial semiprime fc-tame coalgebra is string.
We also prove a weaker version of Eisenbud-Griffith theorem, namely, any
hereditary semiprime strictly quasi-finite coalgebra is serial.
