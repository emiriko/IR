Suppose that p > 5 is a rational prime. Starting from a well-known p-adic
analytic family of ordinary elliptic cusp forms of level p due to Hida, we
construct a certain p-adic analytic family of holomorphic Siegel cusp forms of
arbitrary even genus and of level p associated with Hida's p-adic analytic
family via the Duke-Imamoglu lifting provided by Ikeda. Moreover, we also give
a similar results for the Siegel Eisenstein series of even genus with trivial
Nebentypus.
