Thin films of the half doped manganite Pr0.5Ca0.5MnO3 were grown on (100)
oriented MgO substrates by pulsed laser deposition technique. In order to study
the effect of strain on the magnetic field induced charge order melting, films
of different thicknesses were prepared and their properties were studied by
x-ray diffraction, electrical resistivity and magnetoresistance measurements. A
field induced charge order melting is observed for films with very small
thicknesses. The charge order transition temperature and the magnetic filed
induced charge order melting are observed to depend on the nature of strain
that is experienced by the film.
