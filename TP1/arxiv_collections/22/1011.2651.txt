We construct normed spaces of real-valued functions with controlled growth on
possibly infinite-dimensional state spaces such that semigroups of positive,
bounded operators $(P_t)_{t\ge 0}$ thereon with $\lim_{t\to 0+}P_t f(x)=f(x)$
are in fact strongly continuous. This result applies to prove optimal rates of
convergence of splitting schemes for stochastic (partial) differential
equations with linearly growing characteristics and for sets of functions with
controlled growth. Applications are general Da Prato-Zabczyk type equations and
the HJM equations from interest rate theory.
