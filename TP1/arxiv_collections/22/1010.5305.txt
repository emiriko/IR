The small solar power sail demonstrator "IKAROS" is a Japanese engineering
verification spacecraft launched by H-IIA rocket on May 21, 2010 at JAXA
Tanegashima Space Center. IKAROS has a huge sail with 20 m in diameter which is
made of thin polyimide membrane. This sail converts the solar
radiation-pressure into the propulsion force of IKAROS and accelerates the
spacecraft. The Gamma-Ray Burst Polarimeter (GAP) aboard IKAROS is the first
polarimeter to observe the gamma-ray polarization of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs)
during the IKAROS cruising phase. GAP is a tinny detector of 3.8 kg in weight
and 17 cm in size with an energy range between 50-300 keV. The GAP detector
also plays a role of the interplanetary network (IPN) to determine the GRB
direction. The detection principle of gamma-ray polarization is the anisotropy
of the Compton scattering. GAP works as the GRB polarimeter with the full
coincidence mode between the central plastic and the surrounding CsI detectors.
GAP is the first instrument, devoted for the observation of gamma-ray
polarization in the astronomical history. In this paper, we present the GAP
detector and its ground and onboard calibrations.
