A measurement of transverse polarisation in pbar-p -> all-neutral final
states would almost certainly determine a complete set of partial wave
amplitudes over the mass range 1910 to 2410 MeV. This should identify all
resonances in this mass range. The experiment is technically straightforward
and cheap by present standards.
