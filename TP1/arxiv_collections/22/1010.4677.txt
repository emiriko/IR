In the present work we consider Friedmann-Robertson-Walker models in the
presence of a stiff matter perfect fluid and a cosmological constant. We write
the superhamiltonian of these models using the Schutz's variational formalism.
We notice that the resulting superhamiltonians have terms that will lead to
factor ordering ambiguities when they are written as operators. In order to
remove these ambiguities, we introduce appropriate coordinate transformations
and prove that these transformations are canonical using the symplectic method.
