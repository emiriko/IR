I review multiwavelength observations of material seen around different types
of evolved massive stars (i.e. red supergiants, yellow hypergiants, luminous
blue variables, B[e] supergiants, and Wolf-Rayet stars), concentrating on
diagnostics of mass, composition, and kinetic energy in both local and distant
examples. Circumstellar material has significant implications for the
evolutionary state of the star, the role of episodic mass loss in stellar
evolution, and the roles of binarity and rotation in shaping the ejecta. This
mass loss determines the type of supernova that results via the stripping of
the star's outer layers, but the circumstellar gas can also profoundly
influence the immediate pre-supernova environment. Dense circumstellar material
can actually change the type of supernova that is seen when it is illuminated
by the supernova or heated by the blast wave. As such, unresolved circumstellar
material illuminated by distant supernovae can provide a way to study mass loss
in massive stars in distant environments.
