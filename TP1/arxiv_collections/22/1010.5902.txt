A compact resonance ionization mass spectrometer is developed using two laser
diodes and a quadrupole mass spectrometer to perform trace element analysis of
potassium. With the help of a narrow linewidth of the laser diode, the isotope
shifts of $^{40}{\rm K}$ and $^{41}{\rm K}$ of the 405 nm line with respect to
$^{39}{\rm K}$, corresponding to the transition of $4\,^2$S$_{1/2}\rightarrow$
$5\,^2$P$^\circ_{1/2}$, are measured to be $207\pm13$ MHz and $451\pm10$ MHz,
respectively, by comparing them to the known hyperfine splitting widths of the
$4\,^2{\rm S}_{1/2}$ ground state of each potassium isotope. The overall
detection efficiency of an order of $\sim10^{-6}$ in our setup indicates the
availability of RIMS to the analysis of the trace metal impurities on or in a
certain material such as the contamination assessment of semiconductor wafers.
