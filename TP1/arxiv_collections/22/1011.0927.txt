This article reports on the long-term frequency stabilty characterisation of
a new type of cryogenic sapphire oscillator using an autonomous pulse-tube
cryocooler as its cold source. This new design enables a relative frequency
stability of better than 4.5e-15 over one day of integration. This represents
to our knowledge the best long-term frequency stability ever obtained with a
signal source based on a macroscopic resonator.
