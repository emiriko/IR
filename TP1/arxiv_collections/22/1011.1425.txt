A numerical method is developed leading to Lyapunov operators to approximate
the solution of two-dimensional Boussinesq equation. It consists of an order
reduction method and a finite difference discretization. It is proved to be
uniquely solvable and analyzed for local truncation error for consistency. The
stability is checked by using Lyapunov criterion and the convergence is
studied. Some numerical implementations are provided at the end of the paper to
validate the theoretical results.
