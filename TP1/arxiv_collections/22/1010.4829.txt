The multiparticle density matrices for degenerate, ideal Fermi gas system in
any dimension are calculated. The results are expressed as a determinant form,
in which a correlation kernel plays a vital role. Interestingly, the
correlation structure of one-dimensional Fermi gas system is essentially
equivalent to that observed for the eigenvalue distribution of random unitary
matrices, and thus to that conjectured for the distribution of the non-trivial
zeros of the Riemann zeta function. Implications of the present findings are
discussed briefly.
