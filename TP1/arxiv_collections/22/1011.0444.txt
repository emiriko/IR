Graphene, a single atomic layer of graphite, first isolated in 2004, has made
a quantum leap in the exploration of the physics of two-dimensional electron
systems. Since the initial report of its discovery, many thousands of papers
have been published, attempting to explain every aspect of the exotic
electronic properties of this system. The graphene euphoria has culminated with
the 2010 Nobel Prize in physics being awarded jointly to Andre Geim and
Konstantin Novoselov of the University of Manchester, UK, "for groundbreaking
experiments regarding the two-dimensional material graphene". But, what are the
properties of graphene, and how was it made? Why it is so exciting for so many
researchers, and why the Nobel Prize?
