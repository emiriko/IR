We use the background field method to extract the polarizability for the
neutral "pion". In our previous study we found that the polarizability for this
system is negative which is believed to be a finite volume artifact. To address
this issue, we carry out simulations for different lattice sizes and we also
look at the influence of the boundary conditions on these results. We find that
for pion masses lower than 400 MeV the polarizability remains negative even on
larger lattices. An infinite volume extrapolation is attempted, but the results
are not conclusive due mainly to a lack of an analytical form for the finite
volume corrections for this system.
