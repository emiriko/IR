A procedure is reported for numerical analysis of false vacuum transition in
a model with multiple scalar fields. It is a refined version of the approach by
Konstandin and Huber. The alteration makes it possible to tackle a class of
problems that was difficult or unsolvable with the original method, i.e. those
with a distant or nonexistent true vacuum. An example with an
unbounded-from-below direction is presented.
