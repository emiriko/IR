In the SO(5) x U(1) gauge-Higgs unification model in the Randall-Sundrum
warped space there results the conservation of the H parity. The H parity is
assigned to all 4D fields including excited modes in Kaluza-Klein towers. The
neutral Higgs boson is the lightest particle of odd H parity, consequently
becoming absolutely stable. Its mass is found to be 70 \sim 135 GeV for the
warp factor z_L = 10^5 \sim 10^{15}.
