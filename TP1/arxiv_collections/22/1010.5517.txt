The interfacial screening charge that arises to compensate electric fields of
dielectric or ferroelectric thin films is now recognized as the most important
factor in determining the capacitance or polarization of ultrathin
ferroelectrics. Here we investigate using aberration-corrected electron
microscopy and density functional theory how interfaces cope with the need to
terminate ferroelectric polarization. In one case, we show evidence for ionic
screening, which has been predicted by theory but never observed. For a
ferroelectric film on an insulating substrate, we found that compensation can
be mediated by interfacial charge generated, for example, by oxygen vacancies.
