Superconducting EuFe2(As0.82P0.18)2 single crystals are investigated by
infrared spectroscopy in a wide frequency range. Below Tc=28K a superconducting
gap forms at 2\Delta_{0} = 9.5 meV = 3.8 k_B T_c causing the reflectivity to
sharply rise to unity at low frequency. In the range of the gap the optical
conductivity can be perfectly described by BCS theory with an $s$-wave gap and
no nodes. From our analysis of the temperature dependent conductivity and
spectral weight at T>T_c, we deduce an increased interband coupling between
hole- and electron-sheets on the Fermi surface when $T$ approaches T_c.
