Longitudinal oscillations of bunched beams in synchrotrons have been analyzed
by accelerator physicists for decades, and a closed theory is well-known [1].
The first modes of oscillation are the coherent dipole mode, quadrupole mode,
and sextupole mode. Of course, these modes of oscillation are included in the
general theory, but for developing RF control systems, it is useful to work
with simplified models. Therefore, several specific models are analyzed in the
paper at hand. They are useful for the design of closed-loop control systems in
order to reach an optimum performance with respect to damping the different
modes of oscillation. This is shown by the comparison of measurement and
simulation results for a specific closed-loop control system.
