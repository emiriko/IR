In Ref.[7],we have dealt with the production of the two color-singlet
$S$-wave $(c\bar{b})$-quarkonium states $B_c(|(c\bar{b})_{\bf 1}[^1S_0]>)$ and
$B^*_c(|(c\bar{b})_{\bf 1}[^3S_1]>)$ through the $Z^0$ boson decays. As an
important sequential work, we make a further discussion on the production of
the more complicated $P$-wave excited $(c\bar{b})$-quarkonium states, i.e.
$|(c\bar{b})_{\bf 1}[^1P_1]>$ and $|(c\bar{b})_{\bf 1}[^3P_J]>$ (with
$J=(1,2,3)$). More over, we also calculate the channel with the two color-octet
quarkonium states $|(c\bar{b})_{\bf 8}[^1S_0]g>$ and $|(c\bar{b})_{\bf
8}[^3S_1]g>$, whose contributions to the decay width maybe at the same order of
magnitude as that of the color-singlet $P$-wave states according to the naive
nonrelativistic quantum chromodynamics scaling rules. The $P$-wave states shall
provide sizable contributions to the $B_c$ production, whose decay width is
about 20% of the total decay width $\Gamma_{Z^0\to B_c}$. After summing up all
the mentioned $(c\bar{b})$-quarkonium states' contributions, we obtain
$\Gamma_{Z^0\to B_c} =235.9^{+352.8}_{-122.0}$ KeV, where the errors are caused
by the main uncertainty sources.
