Jet quenching is one of the major discoveries of the heavy-ion program at
RHIC. While there is a wealth of data from RHIC that will soon be supplemented
with measurements at the LHC, on the theoretical side the situation is less
clear. A thorough understanding of jet quenching is, however, beneficial, as it
is expected that medium-induced modifications of jets allow one to characterise
properties of the QCD matter produced in heavy ion collisions. This talk aims
at summarising the main ideas and concepts of the currently available Monte
Carlo models for jet quenching.
