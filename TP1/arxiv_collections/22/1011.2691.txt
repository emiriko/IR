The spectral characteristics of a fiber Bragg grating (FBG) with a
transversely inhomogeneous refractive index profile, differs con- siderably
from that of a transversely uniform one. Transmission spectra of inhomogeneous
and asymmetric FBGs that have been inscribed with focused ultrashort pulses
with the so-called point-by-point technique are investigated. The cladding mode
resonances of such FBGs can span a full octave in the spectrum and are very
pronounced (deeper than 20dB). Using a coupled-mode approach, we compute the
strength of resonant coupling and find that coupling into cladding modes of
higher azimuthal order is very sensitive to the position of the modification in
the core. Exploiting these properties allows precise control of such
reflections and may lead to many new sensing applications.
