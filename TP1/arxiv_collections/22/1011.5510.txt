We follow and modify the Feshbach-Villars formalism by separating the
Klein-Gordon equation into two coupled time-dependent Schroedinger equations
for particle and antiparticle wave function components with positive
probability densities. We find that the equation of motion for the probability
densities is in the form of relativistic hydrodynamics where various forces
have their classical counterparts, with the additional element of the quantum
stress tensor that depends on the derivatives of the amplitude of the wave
function. We derive the equation of motion for the Wigner function and we find
that its approximate classical weak-field limit coincides with the equation of
motion for the distribution function in the collisionless kinetic theory.
