The jets image modelling of gravitationally lensed sources have been
performed. Several basic models of the lens mass distribution were considered,
in particular, a singular isothermal ellipsoid, an isothermal ellipsoid with
the core, different multi-components models with the galactic disk, halo and
bulge. The obtained jet images were compared as with each other as with results
of observations. A significant dependence of the Hubble constant on the model
parameters was revealed for B0218+357, when the circular structure was took
into account.
