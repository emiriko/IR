There are great demands to design functional devices with isotropic
materials, however the transformation method usually leads to anisotropic
material parameters difficult to be realized in practice. In this letter, we
derive the isotropic transformed material parameters in case of elastodynamic
under local conformal transformation, they are subsequently used to design a
beam bender, a four-beam antenna and an approximate carpet cloak for elastic
wave with isotropic materials, the simulation results validate the derived
transformed material parameters. The obtained materials are isotropic and
greatly simplify subsequent experimental implementation.
