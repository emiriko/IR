The electron-electron pair distribution functions (PDF) of the 2-D electron
fluid (2DEF) in the quantum regime (at T=0) are calculated using a
classical-map-hyper-netted-chain (CHNC) scheme and compared with currently
available Quantum Monte-Carlo (QMC) simulations in the coupling range r_s=1 to
50. We iteratively extract the bridge function of the "equivalent" classical
2-D liquid in the quantum regime. These bridge functions B(r) are relatively
insensitive to spin-polarization effects. The structure of the bridge functions
changes significantly for r_s>6, suggesting the onset of strongly correlated
clusters. The new B(r), appropriate for the long-range Coulomb potential, can
be used to replace the hard-sphere B(r) previously used in these calculations.
They provide accurate classical representations of the QMC-PDFs even at very
strong coupling, and probably at finite-T near T=0.
