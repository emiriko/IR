In semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering of polarized leptons on a
transversely polarized target eight target transverse spin-dependent azimuthal
modulations are allowed. In the QCD parton model half of these asymmetries can
be interpreted within the leading order approach and the other four are
twist-three contributions. The first two leading twist asymmetries extracted by
HERMES and COMPASS experiments are related: one to the transversity
distribution and the Collins effect, the other to the Sivers distribution
function. These results triggered a lot of interest in the past few years and
allowed the first extractions of the transversity and the Sivers distribution
functions of nucleon. The remaining six asymmetries were obtained by the
COMPASS experiment using a 160 GeV/c longitudinally polarized muon beam and
transversely polarized deuteron and proton targets. Here we review preliminary
results from COMPASS proton data of 2007.
