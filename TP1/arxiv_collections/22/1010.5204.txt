We study the possibility of identifying the CP violating phases in the PMNS
mixing matrix in the lepton sector and also that in the CKM mixing matrix in
the quark sector with the phase responsible for the spontaneous CP violation in
the Higgs potential, and some implications. Since the phase in the CKM mixing
matrix is determined by experimental data, the phase in the lepton sector is
therefore also fixed. The mass matrix for neutrinos is constrained leading to
constraints on the Jarlskog CP violating parameter $J$, and the effective mass
$<m_{\beta\beta}>$ for neutrinoless double beta decay. The Yukawa couplings are
also constrained. Different ways of identifying the phases have different
predictions for $\mu \to e e\bar e$ and $\tau \to l_1 l_2 \bar l_3$. Future
experimental data can be used to distinguish different models.
