In recent years, the Similarity Renormalization Group has provided a powerful
and versatile means to soften interactions for ab initio nuclear calculations.
The substantial contribution of both induced and initial three-body forces to
the nuclear interaction has required the consistent evolution of free-space
Hamiltonians in the three-particle space. We present the most recent progress
on this work, extending the calculational capability to the p-shell nuclei and
showing that the hierarchy of induced many-body forces is consistent with
previous estimates. Calculations over a range of the flow parameter for 6Li,
including fully evolved NN+3N interactions, show moderate contributions due to
induced four-body forces and display the same improved convergence properties
as in lighter nuclei. A systematic analysis provides further evidence that the
hierarchy of many-body forces is preserved.
