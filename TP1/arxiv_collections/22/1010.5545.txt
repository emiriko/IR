We consider two important time scales---the Markov and cryptic orders---that
monitor how an observer synchronizes to a finitary stochastic process. We show
how to compute these orders exactly and that they are most efficiently
calculated from the epsilon-machine, a process's minimal unifilar model.
Surprisingly, though the Markov order is a basic concept from stochastic
process theory, it is not a probabilistic property of a process. Rather, it is
a topological property and, moreover, it is not computable from any
finite-state model other than the epsilon-machine. Via an exhaustive survey, we
close by demonstrating that infinite Markov and infinite cryptic orders are a
dominant feature in the space of finite-memory processes. We draw out the roles
played in statistical mechanical spin systems by these two complementary length
scales.
