We present unambiguous evidence from lattice simulations of N_f=3 QCD for two
tricritical points in the (T,m) phase diagram at fixed imaginary \mu/T=i\pi/3
mod. 2\pi/3, one in the light and one in the heavy quark regime. Together with
similar results in the literature for N_f=2 this implies the existence of a
chiral and of a deconfinement tricritical line at those values of imaginary
chemical potentials. These tricritical lines represent the boundaries of the
analytically continued chiral and deconfinement critical surfaces,
respectively, which delimit the parameter space with first order phase
transitions. It is demonstrated that the shape of the deconfinement critical
surface is dictated by tricritical scaling and implies the weakening of the
deconfinement transition with real chemical potential. A qualitatively similar
effect holds for the chiral critical surface.
