We perform a statistical analysis of the peculiar velocity field around dark
matter haloes in numerical simulations. We examine different properties of the
infall of material onto haloes and its relation to central halo shapes and the
shape of the large scale surrounding regions (LSSR). We find that the amplitude
of the infall velocity field along the halo shape minor axis is larger than
that along the major axis. This is consistent for general triaxial haloes, and
for both prolate and oblate systems. We also report a strong anisotropy of the
velocity field along the principal axes of the LSSR. The infall velocity field
around dark matter haloes reaches a maximum value along the direction of the
minor axis of the LSSR, whereas along the direction of its major axis, it
exhibits the smallest velocities. We also analyse the dependence of the matter
velocity field on the local environment. The amplitude of the infall velocity
at high local density regions is larger than at low local density regions. The
velocity field tends to be more laminar along the direction towards the minor
axis of the LSSR, where the mean ratio between flow velocity and velocity
dispersion is of order unity and nearly constant up to scales of 15 Mpc/h. We
also detect anisotropies in the outflowing component of the velocity field,
showing a maximum amplitude along the surrounding LSSR major axis.
