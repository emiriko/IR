A signal of two leptons and missing energy is challenging to analyze at the
Large Hadron Collider (LHC) since it offers only few kinematical handles. This
signature generally arises from pair production of heavy charged particles
which each decay into a lepton and a weakly interacting stable particle. Here
this class of processes is analyzed with minimal model assumptions by
considering all possible combinations of spin 0, 1/2 or 1, and of weak
iso-singlets, -doublets or -triplets for the new particles. Adding to existing
work on mass and spin measurements, two new variables for spin determination
and an asymmetry for the determination of the couplings of the new particles
are introduced. It is shown that these observables allow one to independently
determine the spin and the couplings of the new particles, except for a few
cases that turn out to be indistinguishable at the LHC. These findings are
corroborated by results of an alternative analysis strategy based on an
automated likelihood test.
