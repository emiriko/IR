We report on a local spin valve effect observed unambiguously in lateral
all-semiconductor all-electrical spin injection devices, employing
p+-(Ga,Mn)As/n+-GaAs Esaki diode structures as spin aligning contacts. We
discuss the observed local spin-valve signal as a result of interplay between
spin-transport-related contribution and tunneling anisotropic magnetoresistance
of magnetic contacts. The magnitude of the spin-related magnetoresistance
change is equal to 30 Ohm which is twice the magnitude of the measured
non-local signal.
