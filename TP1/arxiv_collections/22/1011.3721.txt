In the current work, the author present a symbolic algorithm for finding the
determinant of any general nonsingular cyclic heptadiagonal matrices and
inverse of anti-cyclic heptadiagonal matrices. The algorithms are mainly based
on the work presented in [A. A. KARAWIA, A New Algorithm for Inverting General
Cyclic Heptadiagonal Matrices Recursively, arXiv:1011.2306v1 [cs.SC]]. The
symbolic algorithms are suited for implementation using Computer Algebra
Systems (CAS) such as MATLAB, MAPLE and MATHEMATICA. An illustrative example is
given.
