We argue that simpler fermionic contents, responsible for the extension of
the standard model with gauged lepton and baryon charges, can be constructed by
assuming existence of so-called leptoquarks (j,k) with exotic electric charges
q_j=1/2, q_k=-1/2. Some new features in our model are that (i) as the natural
consequences of anomaly cancelation the right-handed neutrinos exist, and the
number of the observed fermion families is equal to the number of the
fundamental colors; (ii) although the lepton and baryon charges are conserved,
the neutrinos can obtain small masses through the type I seesaw mechanism in
similarity to the standard context, and the baryogenesis can be generated in
several cases. They all are natural results due to the spontaneous breaking of
these charges. Some constraints on the new physics via flavor changing and
related phenomenologies such as the stable scalar with anomalous electric
charge and interested processes at colliders are also discussed.
