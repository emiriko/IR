We present our preliminary study of the SU(2) gauge theory with 8 flavors of
fermions in fundamental representation. This theory could be a candidate of the
gauge theory with conformal fixed point. By using Wilson/Polyakov loop in a
finite volume with twisted boundary conditions, we study the renormalization
group flow of the gauge coupling constant. Our calculation gives consistent
result with the perturbative prediction of the running coupling in the weak
coupling region. We investigate a possible signal for conformal behavior in the
strong coupling region.
