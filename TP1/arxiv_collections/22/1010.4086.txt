We developed a parametrization of transmission probability that reliably
captures essential elements of the tunneling process in magnetic tunnel
junctions. The electronic structure of Fe/MgO system is calculated within the
quasiparticle self-consistent GW approximation and used to evaluate
transmission probability across (001) Fe/MgO interface. The transmission has a
peak at +0.12 V, in excellent agreement with recent differential conductance
measurements for electrodes with antiparallel spin. These findings confirm that
the observed current-voltage characteristics are intrinsic to well defined
(001) Fe/MgO interfaces, in contrast to previous predictions based on the local
spin-density approximation, and also that many-body effects are important to
realistically describe electron transport across well defined metal-insulator
interfaces.
