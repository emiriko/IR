We show that (with one possible exception) there exist strongly dense free
subgroups in any semisimple algebraic group over a large enough field. These
are nonabelian free subgroups all of whose subgroups are either cyclic or
Zariski dense. As a consequence, we get new generating results for finite
simple groups of Lie type and a strengthening of a theorem of Borel related to
the Hausdorff-Banach-Tarski paradox. In a sequel to this paper, we use this
result to also establish uniform expansion properties for random Cayley graphs
over finite simple groups of Lie type.
