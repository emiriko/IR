In this work we investigate the nature of 50 overdensities from the catalogue
of Froebrich, Scholz, and Raftery (FSR) projected towards the Galactic
anticentre, in the sector 160{\deg} \leq \ell \leq 200{\deg}. The sample
contains candidates with |b| \leq 20{\deg} classified by FSR as probable open
cluster (OC) and labelled with quality flags 2 and 3. Our main purpose is to
determine the nature of these OC candidates and the fraction of these objects
that are unknown OCs, as well as to derive astrophysical parameters (age,
reddening, distance, core and cluster radii) for the clusters and to
investigate the relationship among parameters. The analysis is based on 2MASS
J, (J-H), and (J-Ks) colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs), and stellar radial
density profiles (RDPs) built with decontamination tools. The tools are a field
star decontamination algorithm, used to uncover the cluster's intrinsic CMD
morphology, and colour-magnitude filters to isolate stars with a high
probability of being cluster members. Out of the 50 objects, 16 (32%) are star
clusters. We show that 9 (18%) overdensities are new OCs (FSR 735, FSR 807, FSR
812, FSR 826, FSR 852, FSR 904, FSR 941, FSR 953, and FSR 955) and 7 (14%) are
previously studied or catalogued OCs (KKC1, FSR 795, Cz 22, FSR 828, FSR 856,
Cz 24, and NGC 2234). These are OCs with ages in the range 5 Myr to 1 Gyr, at
distances from the Sun 1.28 \precnapprox d_Sun(kpc) \precnapprox 5.78 and
Galactocentric distances 8.5 R_GC(kpc) \precnapprox 12.9. We also derive
parameters for the previously analysed OCs Cz 22 and NGC 2234. Five (10%)
candidates are classified as uncertain cases, and the remaining objects are
probable field fluctuations.
