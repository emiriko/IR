This note presents some central limit theorems for the eigenvalue counting
function of Wigner matrices in the form of suitable translations of results by
Gustavsson and O'Rourke on the limiting behavior of eigenvalues inside the bulk
of the semicircle law for Gaussian matrices. The theorems are then extended to
large families of Wigner matrices by the Tao and Vu Four Moment Theorem.
Similar results are developed for covariance matrices.
