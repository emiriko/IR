We consider the most general string configurations on the R_t x S^3 subspace
of AdS_5 xS^5, described by the Neumann-Rosochatius integrable system. Under
some restrictions on the parameters of the solution and in an appropriate
limit, they correspond to small deviation from the known finite-size giant
magnon solutions with one and two angular momenta. Analyzing the finite-size
effect on the dispersion relation, we find that the leading correction is
modified in a way similar to the gamma-deformed case R_t x S^3_gamma. The
subleading correction for a string with one angular momentum is also found. It
depends on the same parameter, which describes the generalization of the
leading correction.
