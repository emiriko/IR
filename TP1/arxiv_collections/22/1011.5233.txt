HgTe/HgCdTe quantum wells with the inverted band structure have been probed
using far infrared magneto-spectroscopy. Realistic calculations of Landau level
diagrams have been performed to identify the observed transitions.
Investigations have been greatly focused on the magnetic field dependence of
the peculiar pair of "zero-mode" Landau levels which characteristically split
from the upper conduction and bottom valence bands, and merge under the applied
magnetic field. The observed avoided crossing of these levels is tentatively
attributed to the bulk inversion asymmetry of zinc blend compounds.
