Predicting nonequilibrium fluctuations requires a knowledge of nonequilibrium
distribution functions. Despite the distributions' fractal character some
theoretical results, "Fluctuation Theorems", reminiscent of but distinct from,
Gibbs' equilibrium statistical mechanics and the Central Limit Theorem, have
been established away from equilibrium and applied to simple models. We
summarize the simplest of these results for a Gaussian-thermostated Galton
Board problem, a field-driven mass point moving through a periodic array of
hard-disk scatterers. The billion-collision trillion-timestep data we analyze
correspond to periodic orbits with up to 793,951,594 collisions and
447,064,397,614 timesteps.
