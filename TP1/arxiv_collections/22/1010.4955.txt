The infrared absorption spectra of ABC-stacking tri- and tetra-layer
graphenes are studied using the density functional theory. It is found that
they exhibit very different characteristic peaks compared with those of
AB-stacking ones, caused by the different stacking sequence and interlayer
coupling. The anisotropy of the spectra with respect to the direction of the
light electric field is significant. The spectra are more sensitive to the
stacking number when the electric field is perpendicular to the graphene plane
due to the interlayer polarization. The high sensitivities make it possible to
identify the stacking sequence and stacking number of samples by comparing
theory and experiment.
