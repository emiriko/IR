We present efficient quantum algorithms for simulating time-dependent
Hamiltonian evolution of general input states using an oracular model of a
quantum computer. Our algorithms use either constant or adaptively chosen time
steps and are significant because they are the first to have time-complexities
that are comparable to the best known methods for simulating time-independent
Hamiltonian evolution, given appropriate smoothness criteria on the Hamiltonian
are satisfied. We provide a thorough cost analysis of these algorithms that
considers discretizion errors in both the time and the representation of the
Hamiltonian. In addition, we provide the first upper bounds for the error in
Lie-Trotter-Suzuki approximations to unitary evolution operators, that use
adaptively chosen time steps.
