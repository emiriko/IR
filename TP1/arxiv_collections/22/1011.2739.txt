We experimentally demonstrate high Quality factor dual-polarized TE-TM
photonic crystal nanobeam cavities. The free-standing nanobeams are fabricated
in a 500 nm thick silicon layer, and are probed using both tapered optical
fiber and free-space resonant scattering set-ups. We measure Q-factors greater
than 10^4 for both TM and TE modes, and observe large fiber transmission drops
(0.3 -- 0.4) at the TM mode resonances.
