The Pfaffian phase of electrons in the proximity of a half-filled Landau
level is understood to be a p+ip superconductor of composite fermions. We
consider the properties of this paired quantum Hall phase when the pairing
scale is small, i.e. in the weak-coupling, BCS, limit, where the coherence
length is much larger than the charge screening length. We find that, as in a
Type I superconductor, the vortices attract so that, upon varying the magnetic
field from its magic value at \nu=5/2, the system exhibits Coulomb frustrated
phase separation. We propose that the weakly and strongly coupled Pfaffian
states exemplify a general dichotomy between Type I and Type II quantum Hall
fluids.
