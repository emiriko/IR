We investigate the star formation history and metallicity of the Local Group
irregular dwarf galaxy WLM using wide-field JHK near-infrared imaging, spanning
a region of approximately 1 sq. degree, obtained with WFCAM on UKIRT. JHK
photometry clearly reveals the tip of the red giant branch, allowing a new
estimate of the distance, and allows ready identification of C-type and M-type
AGB stars. The C/M ratio was used to produce a surface map of the metallicity
distribution which is compared to previous studies. Multi-wavelength spectral
energy distributions (SEDs) were constructed for some AGB stars.
