The supersonic stellar and disk winds possessed by massive young stellar
objects will produce shocks when they collide against the interior of a
pre-existing bipolar cavity (resulting from an earlier phase of jet activity).
The shock heated gas emits thermal X-rays which may be observable by spaceborne
observa- tories such as the Chandra X-ray Observatory. Hydrodynamical models
are used to explore the wind-cavity interaction. Radiative transfer
calculations are performed on the simulation output to produce synthetic X-ray
observations, allowing constraints to be placed on model parameters through
comparisons with observations. The model reveals an intricate interplay between
the inflowing and outflowing material and is successful in reproducing the
observed X-ray count rates from massive young stellar objects.
