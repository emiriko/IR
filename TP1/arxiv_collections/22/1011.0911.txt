Mass preconditioned HMC and DD-HMC are among the most popular algorithms to
simulate Wilson fermions. We present a comparison of the performance of the two
algorithms for realistic quark masses and lattice sizes. In particular, we use
the locally deflated solver of the DD-HMC environment also for the mass
preconditioned simulations.
