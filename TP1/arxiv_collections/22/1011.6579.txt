Let (lambda_d)(p) be the p monomer-dimer entropy on the d-dimensional integer
lattice Z^d, where p in [0,1] is the dimer density. We give upper and lower
bounds for (lambda_d)(p) in terms of expressions involving (lambda_(d-1))(q).
The upper bound is based on a conjecture claiming that the p monomer-dimer
entropy of an infinite subset of Z^d is bounded above by (lambda_d)(p). We
compute the first three terms in the formal asymptotic expansion of
(lambda_d)(p) in powers of 1/d. We prove that the lower asymptotic matching
conjecture is satisfied for (lambda_d)(p).
