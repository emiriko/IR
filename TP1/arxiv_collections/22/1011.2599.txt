We construct a large family of commutative algebras of partial differential
operators invariant under rotations. These algebras are isomorphic extensions
of the algebras of ordinary differential operators introduced by Grunbaum and
Yakimov corresponding to Darboux transformations at one end of the spectrum of
the recurrence operator for the Jacobi polynomials. The construction is based
on a new proof of their results which leads to a more detailed description of
the one-dimensional theory. In particular, our approach establishes a
conjecture by Haine concerning the explicit characterization of the
Krall-Jacobi algebras of ordinary differential operators.
