The upper critical field, the lower critical field and the critical magnetic
field ratio of anisotropic magnetic superconductors are calculated by
Ginzburg-Landau theory analytically. The effect of the Ginzburg-Landau
parameter(\kappa_0), magnetic susceptibility(\chi) and magnetic-to- anisotropic
parameter ratio(\theta) on the critical field ratio are considered. We find
that the value of critical magnetic field ratio with \chi < 0, higher
\kappa_0,and higher \theta case are shown the higher value. And, the
diamagnetic superconductors with highly anisotropic and the ferromagnetic
superconductors are shown the highest and the lowest, respectively.
