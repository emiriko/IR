The anisotropic effective mass of electrons is directly measured using
time-resolved THz- pump/THz-probe techniques in a n-doped InGaAs semiconductor
thin film. A microscopic theory is used to attribute this anisotropy in the THz
probe transmission to the nonparabolicity of the conduction band.
Self-consistent light-matter coupling is shown to contribute significantly to
the THz response.
