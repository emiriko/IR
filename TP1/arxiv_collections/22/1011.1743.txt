We theoretically study the behaviour of a liquid bridge formed between a pair
of rigid and parallel plates. The plates are smooth, they may either be
homogeneous or decorated by circular patches of more hydrophilic domains, and
they are generally not identical. We calculate the mechanical equilibrium
distance of the liquid bridge as a function of liquid volume, contact angle and
radius of the chemical domain. We show that a liquid bridge can be an
equilibrium configuration as long as the sum of the contact angles at the two
walls is larger than $180^\circ$. When comparisons are possible, our results
agree well with recent analytical and molecular dynamics simulation results. We
also derive the effective spring constant of the liquid bridge as it is
perturbed from its equilibrium distance. The spring constant diverges when the
sum of the contact angles is $180^\circ$ and is finite otherwise. The value of
the spring constant decreases with increasing contact angle and volume, and the
rate, at which it decreases, depends strongly on the properties of the two
plates.
