We study the evolution of the dark energy parameter within the scope of a
spatially flat and isotropic Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) model filled with
barotropic fluid and dark energy. To obtain the deterministic solution we
choose the scale factor $a(t) = \sqrt{t e^{t}}$ which yields a time dependent
deceleration parameter (DP). In doing so we consider the case minimally coupled
with dark energy to the perfect fluid as well as direct interaction with it.
