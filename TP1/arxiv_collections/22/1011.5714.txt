Concurrent engineering taking into account product life-cycle factors seems
to be one of the industrial challenges of the next years. Cost estimation and
management are two main strategic tasks that imply the possibility of managing
costs at the earliest stages of product development. This is why it is
indispensable to let people from economics and from industrial engineering
collaborates in order to find the best solution for enterprise progress for
economical factors mastering. The objective of this paper is to present who we
try to adapt costing methods in a PLM and CE point of view to the new
industrial context and configuration in order to give pertinent decision aid
for product and process choices. A very important factor is related to cost
management problems when developing new products. A case study is introduced
that presents how product development actors have referenced elements to
product life-cycle costs and impacts, how they have an idea bout economical
indicators when taking decisions during the progression of the project of
product development.
