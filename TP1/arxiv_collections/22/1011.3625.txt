We construct an effective model for gravity of a central object at large
scales. To leading order in the large radius expansion we find a cosmological
constant, a Rindler acceleration, a term that sets the physical scales and
subleading terms. All these terms are expected from general relativity, except
for the Rindler term. The latter leads to an anomalous acceleration in
geodesics of test-particles.
