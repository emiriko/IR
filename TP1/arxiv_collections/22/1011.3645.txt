We show how to translate recent results on effective Hamiltonians for quantum
systems constrained to a submanifold by a sharply peaked potential to quantum
systems on thin Dirichlet tubes. While the structure of the problem and the
form of the effective Hamiltonian stays the same, the difficulties in the
proofs are different.
