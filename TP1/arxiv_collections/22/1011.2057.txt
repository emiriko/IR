We present a perturbative calculation of the improvement coefficients of
SU(2) gauge theory with adjoint representation Wilson-clover fermions and using
Schrodinger functional boundary conditions. The computation of the boundary
improvement terms is necessary for the full O(a) improvement. With two flavours
of adjoint representation fermions this theory is called Minimal Walking
Technicolor model.
