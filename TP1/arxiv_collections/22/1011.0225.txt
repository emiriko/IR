Nonmagnetic impurity effect was studied on the n-type Fe-based superconductor
BaFe1.87Co0.13As2 (Tc = 25 K) by a successful Zn substitution for Fe up to 7
at.%. Magnetic susceptibility, electrical resistivity, specific heat, and Hall
coefficient measurements indicated that Tc linearly decreases with the Zn
concentration and disappears at 7 at.%. The result is quantitatively comparable
with what was observed for YBCO, while it disagrees with a recent report for
the p-type Ba0.5K0.5Fe2As2. Fragile SC against a nonmagnetic impurity was first
confirmed for the n-type 122 Fe-based superconductor.
