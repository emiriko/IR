In this paper, we consider fully nonlinear integro-differential equations
with possibly nonsymmetric kernels. We are able to find different versions of
Alexandroff-Backelman-Pucci estimate corresponding to the full class
$\cS^{\fL_0}$ of uniformly elliptic nonlinear equations with $1<\sigma<2$
(subcritical case) and to their subclass $\cS^{\fL_0}_{\eta}$ with
$0<\sigma\leq 1$. We show that $\cS^{\fL_0}_{\eta}$ still includes a large
number of nonlinear operators as well as linear operators. And we show a
Harnack inequality, H\"older regularity, and $C^{1,\alpha}$-regularity of the
solutions by obtaining decay estimates of their level sets in each cases.
