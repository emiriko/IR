We review the approach to modeling soft hadron physics observables based on
the Dyson-Schwinger equations of QCD. The focus is on light quark mesons and in
particular the pseudoscalar and vector ground states, their decays and
electromagnetic couplings. We detail the wide variety of observables that can
be correlated by a ladder-rainbow kernel with one infrared parameter fixed to
the chiral quark condensate. A recently proposed novel perspective in which the
quark condensate is contained within hadrons and not the vacuum is mentioned.
The valence quark parton distributions, in the pion and kaon, as measured in
the Drell Yan process, are investigated with the same ladder-rainbow truncation
of the Dyson-Schwinger and Bethe-Salpeter equations.
