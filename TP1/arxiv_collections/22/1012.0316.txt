Motivated by recent experiments on the spin-3/2 frustrated bilayer honeycomb
antiferromagnet Bi$_3$Mn$_4$O$_{12}$(NO$_3$), we study the spin-S Heisenberg
model on the honeycomb lattice with various additional exchange interactions
which frustrate N\'eel order. Using spin wave theory, exact diagonalization,
and bond operator theory, we consider the effects of (i) second-neighbor
exchange, (ii) biquadratic exchange for $S = 3/2$ which leads to an AKLT
valence bond solid, and (iii) bilayer coupling which leads to an interlayer
dimer solid. We show that the resulting paramagnetic states undergo a
transition to N\'eel order beyond a critical magnetic field. We discuss
experimental implications for Bi$_3$Mn$_4$O$_{12}$(NO$_3$).
