We present a program that allows for the computation of tensor products of
irreducible representations of Lie algebras A-G based on the explicit
construction of weight states. This straightforward approach (which is slower
and more memory-consumptive than the standard methods to just calculate
dimensions of the tensor product decomposition) produces Clebsch-Gordan
coefficients that are of interest for instance in discussing symmetry breaking
in model building for grand unified theories. For that purpose, multiple tensor
products have been implemented as well as means for analyzing the resulting
effective operators in particle physics.
