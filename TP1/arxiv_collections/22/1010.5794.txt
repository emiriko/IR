We present period change rates (dP/dt) for 42 RR Lyrae variables in the
globular cluster IC$\,$4499. Despite clear evidence of these period increases
or decreases, the observed period change rates are an order of magnitude larger
than predicted from theoretical models of this cluster. We find there is a
preference for increasing periods, a phenomenon observed in most RR Lyrae stars
in Milky Way globular clusters. The period-change rates as a function of
position in the period-amplitude plane are used to examine possible
evolutionary effects in OoI clusters, OoII clusters, field RR Lyrae stars and
the mixed-population cluster $\omega$~ Centauri. It is found that there is no
correlation between the period change rate and the typical definition of
Oosterhoff groups. If the RR Lyrae period changes correspond with evolutionary
effects, this would be in contrast to the hypothesis that RR Lyrae variables in
OoII systems are evolved HB stars that spent their ZAHB phase on the blue side
of the instability strip. This may suggest that age may not be the primary
explanation for the Oosterhoff types.
