We report on the coherent reflection spectroscopy of a high-quality factor
micropillar, in the strong coupling regime with a single InGaAs annealed
quantum dot. The absolute reflectivity measurement is used to study the
characteristics of our device at low and high excitation power. The strong
coupling is obtained with a g=16 \mueV coupling strength in a 7.3\mum diameter
micropillar, with a cavity spectral width kappa=20.5 \mueV (Q=65 000). The
factor of merit of the strong-coupling regime, 4g/kappa=3, is the current
state-of-the-art for a quantum dot-micropillar system.
