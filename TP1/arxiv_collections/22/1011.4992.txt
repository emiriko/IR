We consider two statistical regularities that were used to explain Omori's
law of the aftershock rate decay: the Levy and Inverse Gaussian (IGD)
distributions. These distributions are thought to describe stress behavior
influenced by various random factors: post-earthquake stress time history is
described by a Brownian motion. Both distributions decay to zero for time
intervals close to zero. But this feature contradicts the high immediate
aftershock level according to Omori's law. We propose that these statistical
distributions are influenced by the power-law stress distribution near the
earthquake focal zone and we derive new distributions as a mixture of power-law
stress with the exponent psi and Levy as well as IGD distributions. Such new
distributions describe the resulting inter-earthquake time intervals and
closely resemble Omori's law. The new Levy distribution has a pure power-law
form with the exponent -(1+psi/2) and the mixed IGD has two exponents: the same
as Levy for small time intervals and -(1+psi) for longer times. For even longer
time intervals this power-law behavior should be replaced by a uniform
seismicity rate corresponding to the long-term tectonic deformation. We compute
these background rates using our former analysis of earthquake size
distribution and its connection to plate tectonics. We analyze several
earthquake catalogs to confirm and illustrate our theoretical results. Finally,
we discuss how the parameters of random stress dynamics can be determined
through a more detailed statistical analysis of earthquake occurrence or by new
laboratory experiments.
