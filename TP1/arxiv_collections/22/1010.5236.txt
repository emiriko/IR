We study the prospects for discriminating between the dark matter (DM) and
pulsar origin of the PAMELA positron excess with the Alpha Magnetic
Spectrometer AMS-02. We simulate the response of AMS-02 to positrons (and
electrons) originating from DM annihilations, and determine the pulsar
parameters (spin-down luminosity, distance and characteristic age) that produce
a satisfactory fit to the mock AMS-02 data. It turns out that it is always
possible to mimic a DM signal with pulsars. Although the fit in some cases
requires values of spin-down luminosity and characteristic age different from
those of known pulsars in the ATNF and Fermi-LAT catalogues, these catalogues
are known to be incomplete, and therefore the pulsar interpretation can hardly
be ruled out. We also show that if the positron excess is due to a single
pulsar, it is always possible to find a DM candidate that provides a good fit
to the mock AMS-02 data. The discrimination between the two scenarios will thus
require a better knowledge of the underlying sources, or complementary data.
