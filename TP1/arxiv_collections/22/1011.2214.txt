In a class of extensions of the minimal supersymmetric standard model with
(B-L)/left-right symmetry that explains the neutrino masses, breaking R-parity
symmetry is an essential and dynamical requirement for successful gauge
symmetry breaking. Two consequences of these models are: (i) a new kind of
R-parity breaking interaction that protects proton stability but adds new
contributions to neutrinoless double beta decay and (ii) an upper bound on the
extra gauge and parity symmetry breaking scale which is within the large hadron
collider (LHC) energy range. We point out that an important prediction of such
theories is a potentially large mixing between the right-handed charged lepton
($e^c$) and the superpartner of the right-handed gauge boson ($\widetilde
W_R^+$), which leads to a brand new class of R-parity violating interactions of
type $\widetilde{\mu^c}^\dagger\nu_\mu^c e^c$ and $\widetilde{d^c}^\dagger\u^c
e^c$. We analyze the relevant constraints on the sparticle mass spectrum and
the LHC signatures for the case with smuon/stau NLSP and gravitino LSP. We note
the "smoking gun" signals for such models to be lepton flavor/number violating
processes: $pp\to \mu^\pm\mu^\pm e^+e^-jj$ (or $\tau^\pm\tau^\pm e^+e^-jj$) and
$pp\to\mu^\pm e^\pm b \bar{b} jj$ (or $\tau^\pm e^\pm b \bar{b} jj$) without
significant missing energy. The predicted multi-lepton final states and the
flavor structure make the model be distinguishable even in the early running of
the LHC.
