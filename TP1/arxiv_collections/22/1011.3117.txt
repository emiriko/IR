Using the bottom-up approach in a holographic setting, we attempt to study
both the transport and thermodynamic properties of a generic system in 3+1
dimensional bulk spacetime. We show the exact 1/T and $T^2$ dependence of the
longitudinal conductivity and Hall angle, as seen experimentally in most
copper-oxide systems, which are believed to be close to quantum critical point.
This particular temperature dependence to conductivities are possible in two
different cases: (1) Background solutions with scale invariant and broken
rotational symmetry, (2) solutions with pseudo-scaling and unbroken rotational
symmetry but only at low density limit. Generically, the study of the transport
properties in a scale invariant background solution, using the probe brane
approach, at high density and at low temperature limit suggests us to consider
only metrics with two exponents. More precisely, the spatial part of the metric
components should not be same i.e., $g_{xx}\neq g_{yy}$. In doing so, we have
generated the above mentioned behavior to conductivity with a very special
behavior to specific heat which at low temperature goes as: $C_V\sim T^3$.
However, if we break the scaling symmetry of the background solution by
including a nontrivial dilaton, axion or both and keep the rotational symmetry
then also we can generate such a behavior to conductivity but only in the low
density regime. As far as we are aware, this particular temperature dependence
to both the conductivity and Hall angle is being shown for the first time using
holography.
