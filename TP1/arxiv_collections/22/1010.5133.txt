Exoplanets with masses similar to that of Earth have recently been discovered
in extrasolar systems. A first order question for understanding their dynamics
is to know whether they possess Earth like liquid metallic cores. However, the
iron melting curve is unknown at conditions corresponding to planets of several
times the Earth's mass (over 1500 GPa for planets with 10 times the Earth's
mass (ME)). In the density-temperature region of the cores of those
super-Earths, we calculate the iron melting curve using first principle
molecular dynamics simulations based on density functional theory. By comparing
this melting curve with the calculated thermal structure of Super Earths, we
show that planets heavier than 2ME, have solid cores, thus precluding the
existence of an internal metallic-core driven magnetic field. The iron melting
curve obtained in this study exhibits a steeper slope than any calculated
planetary adiabatic temperature profile rendering the presence of molten
metallic cores less likely as sizes of terrestrial planets increase.
