The nuclear size effect on the one-loop self energy and vacuum polarization
is evaluated for the 1s, 2s, 3s, 2p_{1/2}, and 2p_{3/2} states of hydrogen-like
ions. The calculation is performed to all orders in the binding nuclear
strength parameter Z\alpha. Detailed comparison is made with previous all-order
calculations and calculations based on the expansion in the parameter Z\alpha.
Extrapolation of the all-order numerical results obtained towards Z=1 provides
results for the radiative nuclear size effect on the hydrogen Lamb shift.
