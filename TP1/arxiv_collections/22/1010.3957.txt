The effect of ionization and recombination processes on the electrical
interactions between a pair of small charged particles in highly collisional
plasmas is discussed. In particular, it is shown that these processes suppress
the long-range attraction between positively charged particles. The condition
corresponding to the vanishing of attraction is derived. The role of the effect
for conditions of existing experiments is estimated.
