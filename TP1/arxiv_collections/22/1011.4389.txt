Multipolar order in complex fluids is described by statistical correlations.
This paper presents a novel dynamical approach, which accounts for microscopic
effects on the order parameter space. Indeed, the order parameter field is
replaced by a statistical distribution function that is carried by the fluid
flow. Inspired by Doi's model of colloidal suspensions, the present theory is
derived from a hybrid moment closure for Yang-Mills Vlasov plasmas. This hybrid
formulation is constructed under the assumption that inertial effects dominate
over dissipative phenomena, so that the total energy is conserved. After
presenting the basic geometric properties of the theory, the effect of
Yang-Mills fields is considered and a direct application is presented to
magnetized fluids with quadrupolar order (spin nematic phases). Hybrid models
are also formulated for complex fluids with symmetry breaking. For the special
case of liquid crystals, the moment method can be applied to the hybrid
formulation to study to the dynamics of cubatic phases.
