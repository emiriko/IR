New grids of Atlas9 models have been calculated using revised convection
parameters and updated opacity-distribution functions, for chemical
compositions intended to be representative of solar, [M/H] = +0.3, +0.5, Large
Magellanic Cloud (LMC), and Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) abundances. The grids
cover T(eff) = 3.5-50kK, from log(g) = 5.0 to the effective Eddington limit.
Limb-darkening coefficients and synthetic photometry are presented in the
UBVRIJHKLM, uvby, ugriz, WFCAM, Hipparcos/Tycho, and Kepler passbands for these
models, and for Castelli's comparable `new-ODF' grids. Flux distributions are
given for the new models. The sensitivity of limb-darkening coefficients to the
adopted physics is illustrated.
