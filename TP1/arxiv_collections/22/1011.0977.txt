A novel metal-coated nanocylinder-cavity architecture fully compatible with
III-V GaInAs technology and benefiting from a broad spectral range enhancement
of the localdensity- of-states is proposed as an integrated source of
non-classical light. Due to a judicious selection of the mode volume, the
cavity combines good collection efficiency (\gg 45%), large Purcell factors
(\gg 15) over a 80-nm spectral range, and a low sensitivity to inevitable
spatial mismatches between the single emitter and the cavity mode. This
represents a decisive step towards the implementation of reliable solid-state
devices for the generation of entangled photon pairs at infrared wavelengths.
