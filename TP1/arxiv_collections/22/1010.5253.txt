Strongly coupled models at the TeV scale often predict one or more neutral
spin-one resonances (Z') which have appreciable branching fractions to
electroweak bosons, namely the Higgs and longitudinal W and Z. These resonances
are usually believed to have multi-TeV mass due to electroweak precision
constraints, placing them on the edge of LHC discovery reach. Searching for
them is made particularly challenging because hadronically decaying electroweak
bosons produced at such high energy will appear very similar to QCD jets. In
this work we revisit the possibility of discovering these resonances at the
LHC, taking advantage of recently developed jet substructure techniques. We
make a systematic investigation of substructure performance for the
identification of highly Lorentz-boosted electroweak bosons, which should also
be applicable to more general new physics searches. We then estimate the
model-independent Z' discovery reach for the most promising final-state
channels, and find significant improvements compared to previous analyses. For
modes involving the Higgs, we focus on a light Higgs decaying to b quarks. We
further highlight several other novelties of these searches. In the case that
vertex-based b-tagging becomes inefficient at high p_T, we explore the utility
of a muon-based b-tag, or no b-tag at all. We also introduce the mode Z' -> Zh
-> (invisible)(bb) as a competitive discovery channel.
