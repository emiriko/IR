Exclusive electroproduction of vector mesons is a crucial way to probe QCD
factorization properties. Such a factorization is up to now only proven, at the
twist 2 level, for a longitudinaly polarized meson. It is crucial to extend our
understanding to the case of transversely polarized vector mesons. As a first
step in this direction, we evaluate the impact factor of the transition gamma*
-> rhoT, which is the relevant part of the amplitude within the
kt-factorization approach valid at large energies, taking into account the
twist 3 contributions, coming both from quark antiquark and from quark
antiquark gluon correlators. We show that a gauge invariant expression is
obtained with the help of QCD equations of motion.
