Photon bremsstrahlung is studied for identifying elastic proton-proton
interactions in the CMS experiment at the LHC. In addition to measurement of
the elastic pp cross section (assuming that the elastic slope is known) the
bremsstrahlung photons will allow evaluation of the total pp cross section,
luminosity and alignment of the Zero Degree Calorimeters (ZDCs).
