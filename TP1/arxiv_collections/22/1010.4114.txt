Periodic incorporation of quantum wells inside a one--dimensional Bragg
structure is shown to enhance coherent coupling of excitons to the
electromagnetic Bloch waves. We demonstrate strong coupling of quantum well
excitons to photonic crystal Bragg modes at the edge of the photonic bandgap,
which gives rise to mixed Bragg polariton eigenstates. The resulting Bragg
polariton branches are in good agreement with the theory and allow
demonstration of Bragg polariton parametric amplification.
