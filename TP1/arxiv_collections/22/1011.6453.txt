Context {Earlier cross-correlation studies for AM Her were performed in
various energy range from optical to X-ray and suggested that it mostly shows a
high level of correlation but on occasion it shows a low level of correlation
or uncorrelation.} Aims {To investigate the degree of correlation between soft
(2-4 keV) and hard (9-20 keV) X-rays, we perform the cross-correlation study of
the X-ray data sets of AM Her obtained with {\it RXTE}.}
  Methods {We cross-correlate the background-subtracted soft and hard X-ray
light curves using the XRONOS program crosscor and fit a model to the obtained
cross-correlation functions.}
  Results {We detect a hard X-ray lag of $192\pm33$ s in a specific section of
energy-dependent light curve, where the soft X-ray (2-4 keV) intensity
decreases but the hard X-ray (9-20 keV) intensity increases. From a spectral
analysis, we find that the X-ray emission temperature increases during the
anti-correlated intensity variation. In two other observations, the
cross-correlation functions show a low level of correlation, which is
consistent with the earlier results performed in a different energy range.}
Conclusions {We report a detection of an anti-correlated hard X-ray lag of
$\sim$190 s from the proto-type polar AM Her. The hard X-ray lag is detected
for the first time in the given energy range, and it is the longest lag among
those reported in magnetic cataclysmic variables. We discuss the implications
of our findings regarding the origin of the hard X-ray lag and the
anti-correlated intensity variation.}
