We study the deeply virtual Compton scattering off a spin-one particle, which
is exemplified by the case of coherent scattering on a deuteron target. We
discuss the role of twist three contributions for restoring the QED gauge
invariance of the amplitude corresponding to this process. We consider both
kinematical and dynamical sources of twist three generalized parton
distributions.
