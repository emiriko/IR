In the first part of the review, I discuss ways of obtaining
Lorentz-Invariance-Violating (LIV) space-time foam in the modern context of
string theory, involving brane world scenarios. The foamy structures are
provided by lower-dimensional background brane defects in a D3-brane Universe,
whose density is a free parameter to be constrained phenomenologically. Such
constraining can be provided by high energy gamma-ray photon tests, including
ultra-high energy/infrared photon-photon scattering. In the second part, I
analyze the currently available data from MAGIC and FERMI Telescopes on delayed
cosmic photon arrivals in this context. It is understood of course that
conventional Astrophysics source effects, which currently are far from being
understood, might be the dominant reason for the observed delayed arrivals. I
also discuss how the stringent constraints from studies of
synchrotron-radiation from distant Nebulae, absence of cosmic birefringence and
non observation of ultra-high-energy cosmic photons can be accommodated within
the aforementioned stringy space-time foam model. I argue that, at least within
the currently available sets of astrophysical data, the stringy foam model can
avoid all theses constraints in a natural range of the string coupling and mass
scale. The key features are: (i) transparency of the foam to electrons and
charged probes in general, (ii) absence of birefringence effects and (iii) a
breakdown of the local effective lagrangian formalism. However, in order to
accommodate, in this theoretical framework, the data of the FERMI satellite on
the delayed arrival of photons from the short intense Gamma Ray Burst GRB
090510, in a way consistent with the findings of the MAGIC telescope, a non
uniform density of brane foam defects must be invoked.
