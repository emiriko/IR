We consider a General Relativistic generalized RW's metric,and find a field
of Universal rotational global centripetal acceleration, numerically coincident
with the value of the Pioneers Anomalous one.Related subjects are also
treated.The rotation defined here is different from older frameworks, because
we propose a Gaussian metric, whose tri-space rotates relative to the time
orthogonal axis, globally.The present solution is "Machian", paralleling our
previous semi-relativistic rotating solution (Berman,2007).
