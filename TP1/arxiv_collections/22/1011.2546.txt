Many researches proposed the use of the noon state as the input state for
phase estimation, which is one topic of quantum metrology. This is because the
input noon state provides the maximum Fisher information at the specific point.
However, the Fisher information does not necessarily give the attainable bound
for estimation error. In this paper, we adopt the local asymptotic mini-max
criterion as well as the mini-max criterion, and show that the maximum Fisher
information does not give the attainable bound for estimation error under these
criteria in the phase estimation. We also propose the optimal input state under
the constraints for photon number of the input state instead of the noon state.
