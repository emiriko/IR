We propose a device in which the spin-polarized AC plasmon mode in the
surface state of a topological insulator nanostructure induces a static spin
accumulation in a resonant, normal metal structure coupled to it. Using a
finite-difference time-domain model, we simulate this spin-pump mechanism with
drift, diffusion, relaxation, and precession in a magnetic field. This
optically-driven system can serve as a DC "spin battery" for spintronic
devices.
