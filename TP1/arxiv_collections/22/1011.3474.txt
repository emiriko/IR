The possibility of distinguishing of scalar field models of dark energy with
different Lagrangians and time variable equation of state parameter by
available observational data is analyzed. The multicomponent cosmological
models with the scalar field with either Klein-Gordon or Dirac-Born-Infeld
Lagrangians as dark energy and the monotonic decreasing and increasing equation
of state parameters are considered. It is concluded that scalar field models of
dark energy with decreasing and increasing EoS parameters should be
distinguishable at the accuracy level of forthcoming observational data. The
Lagrangians of scalar fields could be distinguished by expected observational
data (Planck, SDSS etc.) in the case of decreasing EoS parameter, but are
practically indistinguishable in the case of increasing one.
