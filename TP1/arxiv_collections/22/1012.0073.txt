Reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) extends ordinary MCMC
methods for use in Bayesian multimodel inference. We show that RJMCMC can be
implemented as Gibbs sampling with alternating updates of a model indicator and
a vector-valued "palette" of parameters denoted $\bm \psi$. Like an artist uses
the palette to mix dabs of color for specific needs, we create model-specific
parameters from the set available in $\bm \psi$. This description not only
removes some of the mystery of RJMCMC, but also provides a basis for fitting
models one at a time using ordinary MCMC and computing model weights or Bayes
factors by post-processing the Monte Carlo output. We illustrate our procedure
using several examples.
