This paper concerns hylomorphic solitons, namely stable, solitary waves whose
existence is related to the ratio energy/charge. In theoretical physics, the
name Q-ball refers to a type of hylomorphic solitons or soli- tary waves
relative to the Nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation (NKG). We are interested in the
existence of charged Q-balls, namely Q-balls for the Nonlinear Klein-Gordon
equation coupled with the Maxwell equations (NKGM). In this case the charge
reduces to the electric charge. The main result of this paper establishes that
stable, charged Q-balls exist provided that the interaction between matter and
the gauge field is sufficiently small.
