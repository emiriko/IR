Zn4Sb3 is shown to be entropically stabilized versus decomposition to Zn and
ZnSb though the effects of configurational disorder and phonon free energy.
Single phase stability is predicted for a range of compositions and
temperatures. Retrograde solubility of Zn is predicted on the two-phase
boundary region between Zn4Sb3 and Zn. The complex temperature dependent
solubility can be used to explain the variety of nanoparticle formation
observed in the system: formation of ZnSb on the Sb rich side, Zn on the far Zn
rich side and nano-void formation due to Zn precipitates being reabsorbed at
lower temperatures.
