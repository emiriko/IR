We introduce two models of quasi-discrete optical systems: an array of
waveguides doped by four-level N-type atoms, and a nonlinear checkerboard
pattern, formed by doping with three-level atoms of the {\Lambda}-type. The
dopant atoms are driven by external fields, to induce the effect of the
electromagnetically-induced transparency (EIT). These active systems offer
advantages and addition degrees of freedom, in comparison with ordinary passive
waveguiding systems. In the array of active waveguides, the driving field may
adjust linear and nonlinear propagation regimes for a probe signal. The
nonlinear checkerboard system supports the transmission of stable spatial
solitons and their "fuzzy" counterparts, straight or oblique.
