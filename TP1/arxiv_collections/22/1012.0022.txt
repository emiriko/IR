Using the Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph, we have performed mid-infrared
spectroscopy on the young binary brown dwarf 2MASS J04414489+2301513 (15 AU) in
the Taurus star-forming region. The spectrum exhibits excess continuum emission
that likely arises from a circumstellar disk around the primary. Silicate
emission is not detected in these data, indicating the presence of significant
grain growth. This is one of the few brown dwarf disks at such a young age (~1
Myr) that has been found to lack silicate emission. To quantitatively constrain
the properties of the disk, we have compared the spectral energy distribution
of 2MASS J04414489+2301513 to the predictions of our vertical structure codes
for irradiated accretion disks. Our models suggest that the remaining
atmospheric grains of moderately depleted layers may have grown to a size of
$\gtrsim5$ micron. In addition, our model fits indicate an outer radius of
0.2-0.3 AU for the disk. The small size of this circumprimary disk could be due
to truncation by the secondary. The absence of an outer disk containing a
reservoir of small, primordial grains, combined with a weak turbulent
mechanism, may be responsible for the advanced grain growth in this disk.
