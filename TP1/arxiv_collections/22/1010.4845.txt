The emergence of various technologies has since pushed researchers to develop
new protocols that support high density data transmissions in Wide Area
Networks. Many of these protocols are TCP protocol variants, which have
demonstrated better performance in simulation and several limited network
experiments but have limited practical applications because of implementation
and installation difficulties. On the other hand, users who need to transfer
bulk data (e.g., in grid/cloud computing) usually turn to application level
solutions where these variants do not fair well. Among protocols considered in
the application level solutions are UDP-based protocols, such as UDT (UDP-based
Data Transport Protocol) for cloud /grid computing. Despite the promising
development of protocols like UDT, what remains to be a major challenge that
current and future network designers face is to achieve survivability and
security of data and networks. Our previous research surveyed various security
methodologies which led to the development of a framework for UDT. In this
paper we present lowerlevel security by introducing an Identity Packet (IP) and
Authentication Option (AO) for UDT.
