An effective procedure to determine the optimal parameters appearing in
artificial flockings is proposed in terms of optimization problems. We
numerically examine genetic algorithms (GAs) to determine the optimal set of
parameters such as the weights for three essential interactions in BOIDS by
Reynolds (1987) under `zero-collision' and `no-breaking-up' constraints. As a
fitness function (the energy function) to be maximized by the GA, we choose the
so-called the $\gamma$-value of anisotropy which can be observed empirically in
typical flocks of starling. We confirm that the GA successfully finds the
solution having a large $\gamma$-value leading-up to a strong anisotropy. The
numerical experience shows that the procedure might enable us to make more
realistic and efficient artificial flocking of starling even in our personal
computers. We also evaluate two distinct types of interactions in agents,
namely, metric and topological definitions of interactions. We confirmed that
the topological definition can explain the empirical evidence much better than
the metric definition does.
