We look at the new two-particle correlation function that can provide the
space-time information about the source of two charged pions. This function
clearly reflects the chaotic and incoherent nature of the particle emission
source disturbed by external forces (fields). We argue that such an investiga-
tion could probe the size and the temperature of the expanded source where two
pions are emitted in thermal environment.
