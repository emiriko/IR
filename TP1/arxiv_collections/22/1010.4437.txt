Nonanalyticities of thermodynamic functions are studied by adopting an
approach based on stationary points of the potential energy. For finite
systems, each stationary point is found to cause a nonanalyticity in the
microcanonical entropy, and the functional form of this nonanalytic term is
derived explicitly. With increasing system size, the order of the nonanalytic
term grows, leading to an increasing differentiability of the entropy. It is
found that only "asymptotically flat" stationary points may cause a
nonanalyticity that survives in the thermodynamic limit, and this property is
used to derive an analytic criterion establishing the existence or absence of
phase transitions. We sketch how this result can be employed to analytically
compute transition energies of classical spin models.
