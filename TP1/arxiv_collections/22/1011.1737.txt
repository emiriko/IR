We express a matrix version of the self-induced transparency (SIT) equations
in the bidifferential calculus framework. An infinite family of exact solutions
is then obtained by application of a general result that generates exact
solutions from solutions of a linear system of arbitrary matrix size. A side
result is a solution formula for the sine-Gordon equation.
