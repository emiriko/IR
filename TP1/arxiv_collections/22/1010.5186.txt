There exist three conformers of hydrogenated graphene, referred to as chair-,
boat-, or washboard-graphane. These systems have a perfect two-dimensional
periodicity mapped onto the graphene scaffold, but they are characterized by a
$sp^3$ orbital hybridization, have different crystal symmetry, and otherwise
behave upon loading. By first principles calculations we determine their
structural and phonon properties, as well as we establish their relative
stability. Through continuum elasticity we define a simulation protocol
addressed to measure by a computer experiment their linear and nonlinear
elastic moduli and we actually compute them by first principles. We argue that
all graphane conformers respond to any arbitrarily-oriented extention with a
much smaller lateral contraction than the one calculated for graphene.
Furthermore, we provide evidence that boat-graphane has a small and negative
Poisson ratio along the armchair and zigzag principal directions of the carbon
honeycomb lattice (axially auxetic elastic behavior). Moreover, we show that
chair-graphane admits both softening and hardening hyperelasticity, depending
on the direction of applied load.
