This paper proposes approaches for the analysis of multiple changepoint
models when dependency in the data is modelled through a hierarchical Gaussian
Markov random field. Integrated nested Laplace approximations are used to
approximate data quantities, and an approximate filtering recursions approach
is proposed for savings in compuational cost when detecting changepoints. All
of these methods are simulation free. Analysis of real data demonstrates the
usefulness of the approach in general. The new models which allow for data
dependence are compared with conventional models where data within segments is
assumed independent.
