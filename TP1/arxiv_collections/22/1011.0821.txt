The physics of the initial conditions of heavy ion collisions is dominated by
the nonlinear gluonic interactions of QCD. These lead to the concepts of parton
saturation and the Color Glass Condensate (CGC). We discuss recent progress in
calculating multi-gluon correlations in this framework, prompted by the
observation that these correlations are in fact easier to compute in a dense
system (nucleus-nucleus) than a dilute one (proton-proton).
