We employ the QCD sum rules method for description of nucleons in nuclear
matter. We show that this approach provides a consistent formalism for solving
various problems of nuclear physics. Such nucleon characteristics as the Dirac
effective mass $m^*$ and the vector self-energy $\Sigma_V$ are expressed in
terms of the in-medium values of QCD condensates. The values of these
parameters at saturation density and the dependence on the baryon density and
on the neutron-to-proton density ratio is in agreement with the results,
obtained by conventional nuclear physics method. The contributions to $m^*$ and
$\Sigma_V$ are related to observables and do not require phenomenological
parameters. The scalar interaction is shown to be determined by the
pion--nucleon $\sigma$-term. The nonlinear behavior of the scalar condensate
may appear to provide a possible mechanism of the saturation. The approach
provided reasonable results for renormalization of the axial coupling constant,
for the contribution of the strong interactions to the neutron--proton mass
difference and for the behavior of the structure functions of the in-medium
nucleon. The approach enables to solve the problems which are difficult or
unaccessible for conventional nuclear physics methods. The method provides
guide-lines for building the nuclear forces. The three-body interactions emerge
within the method in a natural way. There rigorous calculation will be possible
in framework of self-consistent calculation in nuclear matter of the scalar
condensate and of the nucleon effective mass $m^*$.
