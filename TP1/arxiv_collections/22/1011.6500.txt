We quantitatively estimate different T-dependences of Hc1 between s wave and
d wave pairings by Eilenberger theory. The T-dependences of Hc1(T) show
quantitative deviation from those in London theory. We also study differences
of Hc1(T) between p+ and p- wave pairing in chiral p wave superconductors.
There, Hc1(T) is lower in p- wave pairing, and shows the same T-dependence as
in s wave pairing.
