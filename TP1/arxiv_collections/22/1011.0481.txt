We describe a new approach for evaluating hadronic correlation functions
which combines Laplacian-Heaviside quark smearing with a stochastic estimator
of quark propagators. This method utilizes noise dilution in a new way to
reduce the variance in correlators. The efficacy of the new algorithm is
demonstrated on a number of systems, including disconnected diagrams and
multi-hadron correlators, on a small lattice where comparisons with the results
obtained with exactly determined quark propagators are possible. On larger
lattice volumes, the use of exact propagators becomes prohibitively expensive,
while the stochastic method is still computationally feasible.
