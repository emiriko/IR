This article describes a method to build syntactical dependencies starting
from the phrase structure parsing process. The goal is to obtain all the
information needed for a detailled semantical analysis. Interaction Grammars
are used for parsing; the saturation of polarities which is the core of this
formalism can be mapped to dependency relation. Formally, graph patterns are
used to express the set of constraints which control dependency creations.
