Dark Matter is one of the most intriguing riddles of modern astrophysics. The
Standard Cosmological Model implies that only 4.5% of the mass-energy of the
Universe is baryonic matter and the remaining 95% is unknown. Of this
remainder, 22% is expected to be Dark Matter - an entity that behaves like
ordinary matter gravitationally but has not been yet observed in particle
physics experiments and is not foreseen by the Standard Particle Model. It is
expected that Dark Matter can be found in halos surrounding galaxies, the Milky
Way among them, and it is hypothesized that it exists in the form of massive,
weakly interacting particles i.e. WIMPs. A large experimental effort is being
conducted to discover these elusive particles either directly, in underground
laboratories, or indirectly, using experiments which search for decay or
annihilation products of such particles in the night sky. This document aims to
give a review of the status and recent results of selected Dark Matter
searches.
