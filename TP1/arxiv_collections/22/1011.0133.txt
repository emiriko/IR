We present the results of BVRI photometry and classification of 53 unusual
asteroids, including 35 near-Earth asteroids (NEAs), 6 high
eccentricity/inclination asteroids, and 12 recently-identified asteroid-pair
candidates. Most of these asteroids were not reportedly classified prior to
this work. For the few asteroids that have been previously studied, the results
are generally in rough agreement. In addition, we merge the results from
several photometric/spectroscopic surveys to create a largest-ever sample with
449 spectrally classified NEAs for statistical analysis. We identify a
"transition point" of the relative number of C/X-like and S-like NEAs at
H~18<=>D~1km with confidence level at ~95% or higher. We find that the
C/X-like:S-like ratio for 18<=H<22 is about two times higher than that of H<18
(0.33+/-0.04 versus 0.17+/-0.02), virtually supporting the hypothesis that
smaller NEAs generally have less weathered surface (therefore, less reddish
appearance) caused by younger collision ages.
