Sharp quantum phase transitions typically require a large system with many
particles. Here we show that for a frustrated fully-connected Ising spin
network represented by trapped atomic ions, the competition between different
spin orders leads to rich phase transitions whose sharpness scales
exponentially with the number of spins. This unusual finite-size scaling
behavior opens up the possibility of observing sharp quantum phase transitions
in a system of just a few trapped ion spins.
