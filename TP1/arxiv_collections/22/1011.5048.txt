We report on recent progress towards single photon sources based on quantum
dot and quantum post nanostructures which are manipulated using surface
acoustic waves. For this concept acoustic charge conveyance in a quantum well
is used to spatially separate electron and hole pairs and transport these in
the plane of the quantum well. When conveyed to the location of a quantum dot
or quantum post these carriers are sequentially captured into the confined
levels. Their radiative decays gives rise to the emission of a train of single
photons. Three different approaches using (i) strain- induced and (ii)
self-assembled quantum dots, and (iii) self-assembled quantum posts are
discussed and their application potential is discussed. First devices and
initial experiments towards the realization of such an acoustically driven
single photon source are presented and remote acoustically triggered injection
into few individual emitters is demonstrated.
