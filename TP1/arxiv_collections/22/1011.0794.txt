The measure on generalized solenoids constructed using filters by Dutkay and
Jorgensen is analyzed further by writing the solenoid as the product of a torus
and a Cantor set. Using this decomposition, key differences are revealed
between solenoid measures associated with classical filters in $\mathbb R^d$
and those associated with filters on inflated fractal sets. In particular, it
is shown that the classical case produces atomic fiber measures, and as a
result supports both suitably defined solenoid MSF wavelets and systems of
imprimitivity for the corresponding wavelet representation of the generalized
Baumslag-Solitar group. In contrast, the fiber measures for filters on inflated
fractal spaces cannot be atomic, and thus can support neither MSF wavelets nor
systems of imprimitivity.
