We present a new method for simulating Markovian jump processes with
time-dependent transitions rates, which avoids the transformation of random
numbers by inverting time integrals over the rates. It relies on constructing a
sequence of random time points from a homogeneous Poisson process, where the
system under investigation attempts to change its state with certain
probabilities. With respect to the underlying master equation the method
corresponds to an exact formal solution in terms of a Dyson series. Different
algorithms can be derived from the method and their power is demonstrated for a
set of interacting two-level systems that are periodically driven by an
external field.
