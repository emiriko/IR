Constructing the reduced density matrix for a system of three massive
spin$-\frac{1}{2}$ particles described by a wave packet with Gaussian momentum
distribution and a spin part in the form of GHZ or W state, the fidelity for
the spin part of the system is investigated from the viewpoint of moving
observers in the jargon of special relativity. Using a numerical approach, it
turns out that by increasing the boost speed, the spin fidelity decreases and
reaches to a non-zero asymptotic value that depends on the momentum
distribution and the amount of momentum entanglement.
