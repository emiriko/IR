High-spin states in the odd-odd nucleus $^{168}$Ta have been populated in the
$^{120}$Sn($^{51}$V,3n) reaction. Two multi-quasiparticle structures have been
extended significantly from spin $\sim{20\hbar}$ to above ${40\hbar}$. As a
result, the first rotational alignment has been fully delineated and a second
band crossing has been observed for the first time in this nucleus.
Configurations for these strongly-coupled rotational bands are proposed based
on signature splitting, $B(M1)/B(E2)$ ratio information, and observed
rotation-alignment behavior. Properties of the observed bands in $^{168}$Ta are
compared to related structures in the neighboring odd-$Z$, odd-$N$, and odd-odd
nuclei and are discussed within the framework of the cranked shell model.
