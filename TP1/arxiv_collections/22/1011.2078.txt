In this paper we propose a new design of LT codes, which decreases the amount
of necessary overhead in comparison to existing designs. The design focuses on
a parameter of the LT decoding process called the ripple size. This parameter
was also a key element in the design proposed in the original work by Luby.
Specifically, Luby argued that an LT code should provide a constant ripple size
during decoding. In this work we show that the ripple size should decrease
during decoding, in order to reduce the necessary overhead. Initially we
motivate this claim by analytical results related to the redundancy within an
LT code. We then propose a new design procedure, which can provide any desired
achievable decreasing ripple size. The new design procedure is evaluated and
compared to the current state of the art through simulations. This reveals a
significant increase in performance with respect to both average overhead and
error probability at any fixed overhead.
