A characterization of the optical turbulence vertical distribution and all
the main integrated astroclimatic parameters derived from the CN2 and the wind
speed profiles above Mt. Graham is presented. The statistic includes
measurements related to 43 nights done with a Generalized Scidar (GS) used in
standard configuration with a vertical resolution of ~1 km on the whole 20-22
km and with the new technique (HVR-GS) in the first kilometer. The latter
achieves a resolution of ~ 20-30 m in this region of the atmosphere.
Measurements done in different periods of the year permit us to provide a
seasonal variation analysis of the CN2. A discretized distribution of the
typical CN2 profiles useful for the Ground Layer Adaptive Optics (GLAO)
simulations is provided and a specific analysis for the LBT Laser Guide Star
system ARGOS case is done including the calculation of the 'gray zones' for J,
H and K bands. Mt. Graham confirms to be an excellent site with median values
of the seeing without dome contribution equal to 0.72", the isoplanatic angle
equal to 2.5" and the wavefront coherence time equal to 4.8 msec. We provide a
cumulative distribution of the percentage of turbulence developed below H*
where H* is included in the (0,1 km) range. We find that 50% of the whole
turbulence develops in the first 80 m from the ground. The turbulence
decreasing rate is very similar to what has been observed above Mauna Kea.
