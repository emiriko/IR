Aims. To determine the credentials of nine candidate intermediate polars in
order to confirm whether or not they are magnetic cataclysmic variables.
  Methods. Frequency analysis of RXTE and XMM data was used to search for
temporal variations which could be associated with the spin period of the
magnetic white dwarf. X-ray spectral analysis was carried out to characterise
the emission and absorption properties of each target.
  Results. The hard X-ray light curve of V2069 Cyg shows a pulse period of
743.2 s, and its spectrum is fit by an absorbed bremsstrahlung model with an
iron line, confirming this to be a genuine intermediate polar. The hard X-ray
light curve of the previously confirmed intermediate polar IGR J00234+6141 is
shown to be consistent with the previous low energy X-ray detection of a 563.5
s pulse period. The likely polar IGR J14536-5522 shows no coherent modulation
at the previously identified period of 3.1 hr, but does exhibit a clear signal
at periods likely to be harmonically related to it. Whilst our RXTE
observations of RX J0153.3+7447, Swift J061223.0+701243.9, V436 Car and DD Cir
are largely too faint to give any definitive results, the observation of IGR
J16167-4957 and V2487 Oph show some characteristics of intermediate polars and
these objects remain good candidates.
  Conclusions. We confirmed one new hard X-ray selected intermediate polar from
our sample, V2069 Cyg.
