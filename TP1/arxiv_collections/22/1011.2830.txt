We present a wide field survey of satellite galaxies in M106 (NGC 4258)
covering a $1.7\degr \times 2\degr$ field around M106 using
Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope/MegaCam. We find 16 satellite galaxy candidates
of M106.
  Eight of these galaxies are found to be dwarf galaxies that are much smaller
and fainter than the remaining galaxies. Four of these galaxies are new
findings. Surface brightness profiles of 15 out of 16 satellite galaxies can be
represented well by an exponential disk profile with varying scale length. We
derive the surface number density distribution of these satellite galaxies. The
central number density profile (d $<100$ kpc) is well fitted by a power-law
with a power index of $-2.1\pm0.5$, similar to the expected power index of
isothermal distribution. The luminosity function of these satellites is
represented well by the Schechter function with a faint end slope of
$-1.19^{+0.03}_{-0.06}$. Integrated photometric properties (total luminosity,
total colour, and disk scale length) and the spatial distribution of these
satellite galaxies are found to be roughly similar to those of the Milky Way
and M31.
