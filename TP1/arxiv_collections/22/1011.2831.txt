When our Sun was young it rotated much more rapidly than now. Observations of
young, rapidly rotating stars indicate that many possess substantial magnetic
activity and strong axisymmetric magnetic fields. We conduct simulations of
dynamo action in rapidly rotating suns with the 3-D MHD anelastic spherical
harmonic (ASH) code to explore the complex coupling between rotation,
convection and magnetism. Here we study dynamo action realized in the bulk of
the convection zone for a system rotating at three times the current solar
rotation rate. We find that substantial organized global-scale magnetic fields
are achieved by dynamo action in this system. Striking wreaths of magnetism are
built in the midst of the convection zone, coexisting with the turbulent
convection. This is a surprise, for it has been widely believed that such
magnetic structures should be disrupted by magnetic buoyancy or turbulent
pumping. Thus, many solar dynamo theories have suggested that a tachocline of
penetration and shear at the base of the convection zone is a crucial
ingredient for organized dynamo action, whereas these simulations do not
include such tachoclines. We examine how these persistent magnetic wreaths are
maintained by dynamo processes and explore whether a classical mean-field
$\alpha$-effect explains the regeneration of poloidal field.
