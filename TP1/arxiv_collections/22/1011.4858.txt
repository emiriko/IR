Since the 1980's it has been becoming increasingly clear that the Solar
System's irregular satellites are collisionally evolved. We derive a general
model for the collisional evolution of an irregular satellite swarm and apply
it to the Solar System and extrasolar planets. Our model reproduces the Solar
System's complement of observed irregulars well, and suggests that the
competition between grain-grain collisions and Poynting-Robertson (PR) drag
helps set the fate of the dust. Because swarm collision rates decrease over
time the main dust sink can change with time, and may help unravel the
accretion history of synchronously rotating regular satellites that show
brightness asymmetries. Some level of dust must be present on AU scales around
the Solar System's giant planets, which we predict may be at detectable levels.
We also predict whether dust produced by extrasolar circumplanetary swarms can
be detected. The coronagraphic instruments on JWST will have the ability to
detect the dust generated by these swarms, which are most detectable around
planets that orbit at tens of AU from the youngest stars. Because the
collisional decay of swarms is relatively insensitive to planet mass, swarms
can be much brighter than their host planets and allow discovery of
Neptune-mass planets that would otherwise remain invisible. This dust may have
already been detected. The observations of the planet Fomalhaut b can be
explained as scattered light from dust produced by the collisional decay of an
irregular satellite swarm around a 10 Earth-mass planet. Such a swarm comprises
about 5 Lunar masses worth of irregular satellites. Finally, we consider what
happens if Fomalhaut b passes through Fomalhaut's main debris ring, which
allows the circumplanetary swarm to be replenished through collisions with ring
planetesimals. (abridged)
