The mean angular momentum associated with the collision of two celestial
objects moving in almost circular heliocentric orbits was studied. The results
of these studies were used to develop models of the formation of binaries at
the stage of rarefied preplanetesimals. The models can explain a greater
fraction of binaries formed at greater distances from the Sun. Sometimes there
could be two centers of contraction inside the rotating preplanetesimal formed
as the result of a collision between two rarefied preplanetesimals. Such
formation of binaries could result in binaries with almost the same masses of
components separated by a large distance. Formation of a disk around the
primary could result because the angular momentum that was obtained by a
rarefied preplanetesimal formed by collision was greater than the critical
angular momentum for a solid body. One or several satellites of the primary
could be formed from the disk.
