We present a new method to describe the kinetics of driven lattice gases with
particle-particle interactions beyond hard-core exclusions. The method is based
on the time-dependent density functional theory for lattice systems and allows
one to set up closed evolution equations for mean site occupation numbers in a
systematic manner. Application of the method to a totally asymmetric site
exclusion process with nearest-neighbor interactions yields predictions for the
current-density relation in the bulk, the phase diagram of non-equilibrium
steady states and the time evolution of density profiles that are in good
agreement with results from kinetic Monte Carlo simulations.
