The standard paradigm for the analysis of genome-wide association studies
involves carrying out association tests at both typed and imputed SNPs. These
methods will not be optimal for detecting the signal of association at SNPs
that are not currently known or in regions where allelic heterogeneity occurs.
We propose a novel association test, complementary to the SNP-based approaches,
that attempts to extract further signals of association by explicitly modeling
and estimating both unknown SNPs and allelic heterogeneity at a locus. At each
site we estimate the genealogy of the case-control sample by taking advantage
of the HapMap haplotypes across the genome. Allelic heterogeneity is modeled by
allowing more than one mutation on the branches of the genealogy. Our use of
Bayesian methods allows us to assess directly the evidence for a causative SNP
not well correlated with known SNPs and for allelic heterogeneity at each
locus. Using simulated data and real data from the WTCCC project, we show that
our method (i) produces a significant boost in signal and accurately identifies
the form of the allelic heterogeneity in regions where it is known to exist,
(ii) can suggest new signals that are not found by testing typed or imputed
SNPs and (iii) can provide more accurate estimates of effect sizes in regions
of association.
