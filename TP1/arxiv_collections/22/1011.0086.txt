The strong coupling constants of heavy baryons with light vector mesons are
calculated in the framework of the light cone QCD sum rules using the most
general form of the interpolating currents for the heavy baryons. It is shown
that the sextet--sextet, sextet--antitriplet and antitriplet--antitriplet
transitions are described by one invariant function for each class of
transitions. The values of the electric and magnetic coupling constants for
these transitions are obtained.
