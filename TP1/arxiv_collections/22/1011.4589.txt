We extend the framework of the finite volume method to dispersive
unidirectional water wave propagation in one space dimension. In particular we
consider a KdV-BBM type equation. Explicit and IMEX Runge-Kutta type methods
are used for time discretizations. The fully discrete schemes are validated by
direct comparisons to analytic solutions. Invariants conservation properties
are also studied. Main applications include important nonlinear phenomena such
as dispersive shock wave formation, solitary waves and their various
interactions.
