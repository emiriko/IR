In this paper we consider parafermionic Liouville field theory. We study
integral representations of three-point correlation functions and develop a
method allowing us to compute them exactly. In particular, we evaluate the
generalization of Selberg integral obtained by insertion of parafermionic
polynomial. Our result is justified by different approach based on dual
representation of parafermionic Liouville field theory described by
three-exponential model.
