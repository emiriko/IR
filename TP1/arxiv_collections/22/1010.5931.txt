Presented here are studies of the impact of excitation angle on surface
enhanced Raman and luminescence spectroscopy of dye immobilised on a plasmon
active nanocavity array support. Results show that both Raman and luminescence
intensities depend on the angle of incidence consistent with the presence of
cavity supported plasmon modes. Dependence of scattering or emission intensity
with excitation angle occurs over the window of observation.
