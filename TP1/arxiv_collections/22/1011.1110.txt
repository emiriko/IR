We give two contructions of sets of masks on cograssmannian permutations that
can be used in Deodhar's formula for Kazhdan-Lusztig basis elements of the
Iwahori-Hecke algebra. The constructions are respectively based on a formula of
Lascoux-Schutzenberger and its geometric interpretation by Zelevinsky. The
first construction relies on a basis of the Hecke algebra constructed from
principal lower order ideals in Bruhat order and a translation of this basis
into sets of masks. The second construction relies on an interpretation of
masks as cells of the Bott-Samelson resolution. These constructions give
distinct answers to a question of Deodhar.
