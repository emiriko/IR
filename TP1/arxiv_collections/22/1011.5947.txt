We discuss some of the challenges that future nuclear modeling may face in
order to improve the description of the nuclear structure. One challenge is
related to the need for A-body nuclear interactions justified by various
contemporary nuclear physics studies. Another challenge is related to the
discrepancy in the NNN contact interaction parameters for 3He and 3H that
suggests the need for accurate proton and neutron masses in the future
precision calculations.
