Graphene growth by chemical vapor deposition has received a lot of attention
recently owing to the ease with which large area films can be grown, but growth
of large domain or equivalently large grain size has not been reported yet. In
this brevia, we report on a CVD process that yields graphene with domains of
hundreds of micrometers, by very low pressure CVD, less than 50 mTorr, and very
low precursor flow rates using methane as the source of carbon on the inside of
copper foil enclosures at high temperature, around 1000 oC. The carrier
mobility for the large-domain graphene films is up to 21,000 cm2/Vs.
