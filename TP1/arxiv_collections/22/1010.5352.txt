Distribution of Cr atoms in Fe_{100-x}Cr_x alloys with x \le 25 within the
first two coordination shells, 1NN-2NN, around probe 57Fe atoms was studied by
means of the M\"ossbauer Spectroscopy. Clear evidence was found that the
distribution is characteristic of a given atomic configuration. Only the
configurations with Cr atoms situated in 2NN exhibit a quiasi-random
distribution, while those with Cr atoms present in 1NN shell and those with Cr
atoms in both shells is evidently not random showing clastering or
anticlastering features. These findings are novel and much more complete than
the up-to-date knowledge according to which there is an inversion of the
short-range order parameter at x = 11. The inversion in the present study was
found only for the configuration with one Cr atom in 1NN. On average, Cr atoms
are distributed almost randomly within the 1NN-2NN volume for x \eq ~10, and do
cluster for larger x.
