We study the effect that resistive regions have on the conductance of a
quantum wire with interacting electrons which is connected to Fermi liquid
leads. Using the bosonization formalism and a Rayleigh dissipation function to
model the power dissipation, we use both scattering theory and Green's function
techniques to derive the DC conductance. The resistive regions are generally
found to lead to incoherent transport. For a single wire, we find that the
resistance adds in series to the contact resistance of h/e^2 for spinless
electrons, and the total resistance is independent of the Luttinger parameter
K_W of the wire. We numerically solve the bosonic equations to illustrate what
happens when a charge density pulse is incident on the wire; the results depend
on the parameters of the resistive and interacting regions in interesting ways.
For a junction of Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid wires, we use a dissipationless
current splitting matrix to model the junction. For a junction of three wires
connected to Fermi liquid leads, there are two families of such matrices; we
find that the conductance matrix generally depends on K_W for one family but is
independent of K_W for the other family, regardless of the resistances present
in the system.
