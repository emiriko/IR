Galvanomagnetic effects in graphene
  Magnetoresistivity and Hole-effect were theoretically investigated for
neutral and gated graphene. It is shown that in neutral graphene Hall-effect is
totally absent. In gated, exactly monopolar graphene effect of
magnetoresistivity vanishes; here Hall-constant does not involve any relaxation
characteristic in contrast to result obtained for popular method of relaxation
time approximation.
