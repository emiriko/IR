We investigate the $B \rar K_{0}^{*}(1430) l^+ l^- $ transition in the
Applequist-Cheng-Dobrescu model in the presence of a universal extra dimension.
In particular, we calculate double lepton polarization asymmetries and
branching ratio related to this channel and compare the obtained results with
the predictions of the standard model. Our analysis of the considered
observables in terms of radius $R$ of the compactified extra-dimension as the
new parameter of the model show a considerable discrepancy between the
predictions of two models in low $\frac{1}{R}$ values.
