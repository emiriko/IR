There are two approaches to projective representation theory of symmetric and
alternating groups, which are powerful enough to work for modular
representations. One is based on Sergeev duality, which connects projective
representation theory of the symmetric group and representation theory of the
algebraic supergroup $Q(n)$ via appropriate Schur (super)algebras and Schur
functors.
  The second approach follows the work of Grojnowski for classical affine and
cyclotomic Hecke algebras and connects projective representation theory of
symmetric groups in characteristic $p$ to the crystal graph of the basic module
of the twisted affine Kac-Moody algebra of type $A_{p-1}^{(2)}$.
  The goal of this work is to connect the two approaches mentioned above and to
obtain new branching results for projective representations of symmetric
groups. This is achieved by developing the theory of lowering operators for the
supergroup $Q(n)$ which is parallel to (although much more intricate than) the
similar theory for $GL(n)$ developed by the first author. The theory of
lowering operators for $GL(n)$ is a non-trivial generalization of Carter's work
in characteristic zero, and it has received a lot of attention. So this part of
our work might be of independent interest.
  One of the applications of lowering operators is to tensor products of
irreducible $Q(n)$-modules with natural and dual natural modules, which leads
to important special translation functors. We describe the socles and primitive
vectors in such tensor products.
