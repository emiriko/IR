In this paper we present a concise overview of our recent results concerning
the electric potential distribution around a small charged particle in weakly
ionized plasmas. A number of different effects which influence plasma screening
properties are considered. Some consequences of the results are discussed,
mostly in the context of complex (dusty) plasmas.
