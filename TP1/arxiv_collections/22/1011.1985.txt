We propose an approach to reconstruct two-electron spin qubit states in
semiconductor quantum dots by employing tomographic techniques. This procedure
exploits the combination of fast gate operations on electron spins trapped in
dots and dynamical nuclear polarization of the underlying Ga and As nuclei. The
presented method can be an important tool in solid state quantum computation
for complete characterization of qubit states and theirs correlations.
