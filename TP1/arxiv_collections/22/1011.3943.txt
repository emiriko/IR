We present a theory for the regime of coherent interlayer tunneling in a
disordered quantum Hall bilayer at total filling factor one, allowing for the
effect of static vortices. We find that the system consists of domains of
polarized superfluid phase. Injected currents introduce phase slips between the
polarized domains which are pinned by disorder. We present a model of saturated
tunneling domains that predicts a critical current for the breakdown of
coherent tunneling that is extensive in the system size. This theory is
supported by numerical results from a disordered phase model in two dimensions.
We also discuss how our picture might be used to interpret experiments in the
counterflow geometry and in two-terminal measurements.
