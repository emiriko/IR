We present some preliminary results from our program of intensive
near-infrared photometric monitoring of a sample of confirmed and candidate
Luminous Blue Variables (LBVs) conducted from 2008 to 2010. Clear long-term
variability has been observed for Wray 17-96 and V481 Sct, with overall
brightness variation greater than 1 mag in the J band. Other sources, such as
LBV 1806-20 showed detectable variability with amplitudes of few tenths of a
magnitude with time-scale of about 60 days.
