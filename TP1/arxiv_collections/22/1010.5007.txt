In a recent analysis it was found that the local (z=0) rate at which
gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) produce energy in 1 MeV photons, Q_GRB(z=0), is 300
times lower than the local energy production rate in ultra-high energy
cosmic-rays. This may appear to be in contradiction with earlier results,
according to which Q_GRB(z=0) is similar to the local energy production rate in
>10^{19} eV cosmic-rays, Q_{10EeV}(z=0). This short (1 page) note identifies
the origin of the apparent discrepancy and shows that Q_GRB(z=0) \sim
Q_{10EeV}(z=0) holds.
