Recently we have introduced the microscopic response method (MRM) to compute
the conductivity and Hall mobility for complex system with topological and
thermal disorder, which is more convenient than the Kubo formula. We prove that
for a canonical ensemble the MRM leads to the same expression as the Kubo
formula. When the gradient of carrier density is small, the MRM reduces to the
widely used Kubo-Greenwood formula.
