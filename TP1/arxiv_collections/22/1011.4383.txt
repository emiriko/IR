Diffusion in an evolving environment is studied by continuos-time Monte Carlo
simulations. Diffusion is modelled by continuos-time random walkers on a
lattice, in a dynamic environment provided by bubbles between two
one-dimensional interfaces driven symmetrically towards each other. For
one-dimensional random walkers constrained by the interfaces, the bubble size
distribution domi- nates diffusion. For two-dimensional random walkers, it is
also controlled by the topography and dynamics of the interfaces. The results
of the one-dimensional case are recovered in the limit where the interfaces are
strongly driven. Even with simple hard-core repulsion between the interfaces
and the particles, diffusion is found to depend strongly on the details of the
dynamical rules of particles close to the interfaces. Article reference:
