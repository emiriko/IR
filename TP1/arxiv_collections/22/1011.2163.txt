Component Based Approach has been introduced in core engineering discipline
long back but the introduction to component based concept in software
perspective is recently developed by Object Management Group. Its benefits from
the re-usability point of view is enormous. The intertwining relationship of
domain engineering with component based software engineering is analyzed. The
object oriented approach and its basic difference with component approach is of
great concern. The present study highlights the life-cycle, cost effectiveness
and the basic study of component based software from application perspective.
