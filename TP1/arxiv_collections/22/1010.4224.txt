Testing quantum foundations for systems in high energy physics gets currently
more and more attention e.g. witnessed for entangled neutral K-mesons by the
approved programme of the KLOE collaboration at the accelerator facility DAPHNE
(Frascati, Italy). We focus on this quantum system in high energy physics and
discuss two topics, Bell inequalities and the kaonic quantum eraser, and show
how the neutral kaon system differs from systems of ordinary matter and light.
In detail, we show a relation of the imbalance of matter and antimatter to the
violation of a Bell inequality and discuss another Bell inequality which is
maximally violated for a non-maximally entangled state though neutral kaons can
be considered as two state systems. We compare in general this system in high
energy physics with bipartite qudits. Last but not least we review the quantum
marking and eraser procedure and explain why neutral kaons offer more eraser
possibilities than usual quantum systems.
