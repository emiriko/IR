We investigate the existence of the meromorphic extension of the spectral
zeta function of the Laplacian on self-similar fractals using the classical
results of Kigami and Lapidus (based on the renewal theory) and new results of
Hambly and Kajino based on the heat kernel estimates and other probabilistic
techniques. We also formulate conjectures which hold true in the examples that
have been analyzed in the existing literature.
