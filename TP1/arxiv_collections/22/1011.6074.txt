It was found that the spontaneous electric field can occur in doped graphene
in an external dc electric field. The direction of the spontaneous field is
perpendicular to the applied field. This effect can be connected with the
nonequilibrium electron subsystem of graphene. It was also shown up the
influence of problem parameters on the characteristics of the spontaneous
field.
