A major challenge of spintronics is in generating, controlling and detecting
spin-polarized current. Manipulation of spin-polarized current, in particular,
is difficult. We demonstrate here, based on calculated transport properties of
graphene nanoribbons, that nearly +-100% spin-polarized current can be
generated in zigzag graphene nanoribbons (ZGNRs) and tuned by a source-drain
voltage in the bipolar spin diode, in addition to magnetic configurations of
the electrodes. This unusual transport property is attributed to the intrinsic
transmission selection rule of the spin subbands near the Fermi level in ZGNRs.
The simultaneous control of spin current by the bias voltage and the magnetic
configurations of the electrodes provides an opportunity to implement a whole
range of spintronics devices. We propose theoretical designs for a complete set
of basic spintronic devices, including bipolar spin diode, transistor and logic
gates, based on ZGNRs.
