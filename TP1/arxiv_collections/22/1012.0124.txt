We study the critical behavior of the $d=3$ Ising model with bond randomness
through extensive Monte Carlo simulations and finite-size scaling techniques.
Our results indicate that the critical behavior of the random-bond model is
governed by the same universality class as the site- and bond-diluted models,
clearly distinct from that of the pure model, thus providing a complete set of
universality in disordered systems.
