The axioms of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics lack clear physical meaning.
In particular, they say nothing about nonlocality. Yet quantum mechanics is not
only nonlocal, it is twice nonlocal: there are nonlocal quantum correlations,
and there is the Aharonov-Bohm effect, which implies that an electric or
magnetic field h e r e may act on an electron t h e r e. Can we invert the
logical hierarchy? That is, can we adopt nonlocality as an axiom for quantum
mechanics and derive quantum mechanics from this axiom and an additional axiom
of causality? Three versions of these two axioms lead to three different
theories, characterized by "maximal nonlocal correlations", "jamming" and
"modular energy". Where is quantum mechanics in these theories?
