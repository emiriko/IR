We present an engineered version of the divide-and-conquer algorithm for
finding the closest pair of points, within a given set of points in the
XY-plane. For this version of the algorithm we show that only two pairwise
comparisons are required in the combine step, for each point that lies in the 2
delta-wide vertical slab. The correctness of the algorithm is shown for all
Minkowski distances with p>=1. We also show empirically that, although the time
complexity of the algorithm is still O(n lg n), the reduction in the total
number of comparisons leads to a significant reduction in the total execution
time, for inputs with size sufficiently large.
