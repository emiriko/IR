We show that stochastic recovery always leads to counter-intuitive behaviors
in the risk measures of a CDO tranche - namely, continuity on default and
positive credit spread risk cannot be ensured simultaneously. We then propose a
simple recovery variance regularization method to control the magnitude of
negative credit spread risk while preserving the continuity on default.
