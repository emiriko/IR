Perfect imaging for electromagnetic waves using the Maxwell Fish Eye (MFE)
requires a new concept: the perfect drain. From the mathematical point of view,
a perfect point drain is just like an ideal point source, except that it drains
power from the electromagnetic field instead of generating it. We show here
that the perfect drain for the MFE can be seen as a dissipative region the
diameter of which tends to zero. The complex permittivity $\varepsilon$ of this
region cannot take arbitrary values, however, since it depends on the size of
the drain as well as on the frequency. This interpretation of the perfect drain
connects well with central concepts of electromagnetic theory. This opens up
both the modeling in computer simulations and the experimental verification of
the perfect drain.
