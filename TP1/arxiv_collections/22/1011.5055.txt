A model for energy spectrum of superlattice on the base of graphene placed on
the striped dielectric substrate is proposed. A direct current component which
appears in that structure perpendicularly to pulling electric field under the
influence of elliptically polarized electromagnetic wave was derived. A
transverse current density dependence on pulling field magnitude and on
magnitude of component of elliptically polarized wave directed along the axis
of a superlattice is analyzed.
