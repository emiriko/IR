The master equation describing the non-equilibrium dynamics of a quantum dot
coupled to metallic leads is considered. Employing a superoperator approach, we
derive an exact time-convolutionless master equation for the probabilities of
dot states, i.e., a time-convolutionless Pauli master equation. The generator
of this master equation is derived order by order in the hybridization between
dot and leads. Although the generator turns out to be closely related to the
T-matrix expressions for the transition rates, which are plagued by
divergences, in the time-convolutionless generator all divergences cancel order
by order. The time-convolutionless and T-matrix master equations are contrasted
to the Nakajima-Zwanzig version. The absence of divergences in the
Nakajima-Zwanzig master equation due to the nonexistence of secular reducible
contributions becomes rather transparent in our approach, which explicitly
projects out these contributions. We also show that the time-convolutionless
generator contains the generator of the Nakajima-Zwanzig master equation in the
Markov approximation plus corrections, which we make explicit. Furthermore, it
is shown that the stationary solutions of the time-convolutionless and the
Nakajima-Zwanzig master equations are identical. However, this identity neither
extends to perturbative expansions truncated at finite order nor to dynamical
solutions. We discuss the conditions under which the Nakajima-Zwanzig-Markov
master equation nevertheless yields good results.
