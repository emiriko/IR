The ARGO-YBJ experiment is a multipurpose detector exploiting the
full-coverage approach at very high altitude. The apparatus is in stable data
taking since November 2007 at the YangBaJing Cosmic Ray Laboratory (Tibet, P.R.
China, 4300 m a.s.l., 606 g/cm$^2$). In this paper we report the main results
in Gamma-Ray Astronomy and Cosmic Ray Physics after about 3 years of
operations.
