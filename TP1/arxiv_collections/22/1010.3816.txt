Currently there is considerable interest in making use of many-core processor
architectures, such as Nvidia and AMD graphics processing units (GPUs) for
scientific computing. In this work we explore the use of the Open Computing
Language (OpenCL) for a typical Numerical Relativity application: a time-domain
Teukolsky equation solver (a linear, hyperbolic, partial differential equation
solver using finite-differencing). OpenCL is the only vendor-agnostic and
multi-platform parallel computing framework that has been adopted by all major
processor vendors. Therefore, it allows us to write portable source-code and
run it on a wide variety of compute hardware and perform meaningful
comparisons. The outcome of our experimentation suggests that it is relatively
straightforward to obtain order-of-magnitude gains in overall application
performance by making use of many-core GPUs over multi-core CPUs and this fact
is largely independent of the specific hardware architecture and vendor. We
also observe that a single high-end GPU can match the performance of a
small-sized, message-passing based CPU cluster.
