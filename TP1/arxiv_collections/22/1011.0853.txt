The Wide-Field X-ray Telescope (WFXT) is a proposed NASA mission dedicated to
performing surveys of the sky in the soft X-ray band (0.3-6 keV). The key
characteristics of this missions are a constant point spread function with Half
Energy Width of ~5 arcsec over a ~1 degree field of view as well as an
effective area ~10 times larger than the one of Chandra. Despite the fact that
the mission is tailored for extragalactic purposes, we show here that extremely
interesting results can also be obtained on the study of neutron stars.
