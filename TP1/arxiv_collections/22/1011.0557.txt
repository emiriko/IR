In this paper, we show the equivalence between a classical static scalar
field theory and the (closed) de Sitter cosmological model whose potential
represents shape invariance property. Based on this equivalence, we calculate
the one-loop quantum cosmological correction to the ground state energy of the
kink-like solution in the (closed) de Sitter cosmological model in which the
fluctuation potential $V^{\prime\prime}$ has a shape invariance property. It is
shown that this type of correction, which yields a renormalized mass in the
case of scalar field theory, may be {\it interpreted} as a renormalized
gravitational constant in the case of (closed) de Sitter cosmological model.
