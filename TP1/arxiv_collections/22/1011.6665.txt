Muons from cosmic-ray interactions in the atmosphere provide a
high-statistics source of particles that can be used to study the performance
and calibration of the ATLAS detector. Cosmic-ray muons can penetrate to the
cavern and deposit energy in all detector subsystems. Such events have played
an important role in the commissioning of the detector since the start of the
installation phase in 2005 and were particularly important for understanding
the detector performance in the time prior to the arrival of the first LHC
beams. Global cosmic-ray runs were undertaken in both 2008 and 2009 and these
data have been used through to the early phases of collision data-taking as a
tool for calibration, alignment and detector monitoring. These large datasets
have also been used for detector performance studies, including investigations
that rely on the combined performance of different subsystems. This paper
presents the results of performance studies related to combined tracking,
lepton identification and the reconstruction of jets and missing transverse
energy. Results are compared to expectations based on a cosmic-ray event
generator and a full simulation of the detector response.
