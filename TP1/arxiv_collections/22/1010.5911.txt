In the Coulomb gauge of QCD, the Hamiltonian contains a non-linear Christ-Lee
term, which may alternatively be derived from a careful treatment of ambiguous
Feynman integrals at 2-loop order. We investigate how and if UV divergences
from higher order graphs can be consistently absorbed by renormalization of the
Christ-Lee term. We find that they cannot.
