The accretion/ejection coupling in accreting black hole binaries has been
described by empirical relations between the X-ray/radio and
X-ray/optical-infrared luminosities. These correlations were initially supposed
to be universal. However, recently many sources have been found to produce jets
that, given certain accretion-powered luminosities, are fainter than expected
from the correlations. This shows that black holes with similar accretion flows
can produce a broad range of outflows in power. Here we discuss whether typical
parameters of the binary system, as well as the properties of the outburst,
produce any effect on the energy output in the jet. We also define a jet-toy
model in which the bulk Lorentz factor becomes larger than ~1 above ~0.1% of
the Eddington luminosity. We finally compare the "radio quiet" black holes with
the neutron stars.
