We propose an extension of the zone-based algorithmics for analyzing timed
automata to handle systems where timing uncertainty is considered as
probabilistic rather than set-theoretic. We study duration probabilistic
automata (DPA), expressing multiple parallel processes admitting memoryfull
continuously-distributed durations. For this model we develop an extension of
the zone-based forward reachability algorithm whose successor operator is a
density transformer, thus providing a solution to verification and performance
evaluation problems concerning acyclic DPA (or the bounded-horizon behavior of
cyclic DPA).
