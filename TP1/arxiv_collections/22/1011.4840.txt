Different numerical mappings of the DNA sequences have been studied using a
new cluster-scaling method and the well known spectral methods. It is shown, in
particular, that the nucleotide sequences in DNA molecules have robust
cluster-scaling properties. These properties are relevant to both types of
nucleotide pair-bases interactions: hydrogen bonds and stacking interactions.
It is shown that taking into account the cluster-scaling properties can help to
improve heterogeneous models of the DNA dynamics. It is also shown that a
chaotic (deterministic) order, rather than a stochastic randomness, controls
the energy minima positions of the stacking interactions in the DNA sequences
on large scales. The chaotic order results in a large-scale chaotic coherence
between the two complimentary DNA-duplex's sequences. A competition between
this broad-band chaotic coherence and the resonance coherence produced by
genetic code has been briefly discussed. The Arabidopsis plant genome (which is
a model plant for genome analysis) and two human genes: BRCA2 and NRXN1, have
been considered as examples.
