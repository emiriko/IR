We investigate the structure of a simple class of affine toric Calabi-Yau
varieties that are defined from quiver representations based on finite eulerian
directed graphs (digraphs). The vanishing first Chern class of these varieties
just follows from the characterisation of eulerian digraphs as being connected
with all vertices balanced. Some structure theory is used to show how any
eulerian digraph can be generated by iterating combinations of just a few
canonical graph-theoretic moves. We describe the effect of each of these moves
on the lattice polytopes which encode the toric Calabi-Yau varieties and
illustrate the construction in several examples. We comment on physical
applications of the construction in the context of moduli spaces for
superconformal gauged linear sigma models.
