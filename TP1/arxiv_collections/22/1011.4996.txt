The estimation of cosmological parameters from a given data set requires a
construction of a likelihood function which, in general, has a complicated
functional form. We adopt a Gaussian copula and constructed a copula likelihood
function for the convergence power spectrum from a weak lensing survey. We show
that the parameter estimation based on the Gaussian likelihood erroneously
introduces a systematic shift in the confidence region, in particular for a
parameter of the dark energy equation of state w. Thus, the copula likelihood
should be used in future cosmological observations.
