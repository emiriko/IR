Let the sign components of the maximal covectors of a simple oriented matroid
M be represented by the real numbers -1 and 1. Consider the vertex set V(R) of
a symmetric cycle R of adjacent topes in the tope graph of M as a subposet of
the tope poset of M. If B is the bottom element of the tope poset then B is
equal to the unweighted sum of the members of the set min V(R) of minimal
elements of the subposet V(R); if B is the positive tope then the set min V(R)
is a critical tope committee for the acyclic oriented matroid M.
