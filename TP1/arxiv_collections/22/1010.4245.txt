We consider representations of rational Cherednik algebras which are
particular ideals in the ring of polynomials. We investigate convergence of the
integrals which express the Gaussian inner product on these representations. We
derive that the integrals converge for the minimal submodules in types B and D
for the singular values suggested by Cherednik with at most one exception,
hence the corresponding modules are unitary. The analogous result on unitarity
of the minimal submodules in type A was obtained by Etingof and Stoica, we give
a different proof of convergence of the Gaussian product in this case. We also
obtain partial results on unitarity of the minimal submodule in the case of
exceptional Coxeter groups and group B with unequal parameters.
