A brief review on major advances in heavy fermion physics is presented
including the Ce metal phase diagram, the huge effective mass detected in
CeAl3, and the successive discoveries of unconventional superconductivity in
CeCu2Si2 and three U based compounds, UBe13, UPt3 and URu2Si2. In order to
track the origin of the huge effective mass, the case of intermediate valence
compounds is discussed with emphasis of the differences between Yb and Ce
materials. The formation of the effective mass is analyzed by two regular- and
singular-part contributions. Examples are given for both, antiferromagnetic
(CeRu2Si2 series) and ferromagnetic tricriticalities (UGe2). Pressure and
magnetic-field studies on the ferromagnetic superconductor URhGe illustrate the
role of the singular effective mass enhancement on the superconducting pairing.
The discovery of the Ce-115 material gives the opportunity to study deeply the
interplay of antiferromagnetism and superconductivity. This is clearly
demonstrated by field re-entrance AF inside the SC phase just below the
superconducting upper critical field (Hc2) for CeCoIn5 or on both side of Hc2
within a restricted pressure window for CeRhIn5. The present status of the
search for the hidden-order parameter of URu2Si2 is given and we emphasize that
it may correspond to a lattice unit-cell doubling which leads to a drastic
change in the band structure and spin dynamic, with the possibility of
competition between multipolar ordering and antiferromagnetism.
