What is the relationship between the macroscopic parameters of the
constitutive equation for a granular soil and the microscopic forces between
grains? In order to investigate this connection, we have simulated by molecular
dynamics the oedometric compression of a granular soil (a dry and bad-graded
sand) and computed the hypoplastic parameters $h_s$ (the granular skeleton
hardness) and $\eta$ (the exponent in the compression law) by following the
same procedure than in experiments, that is by fitting the Bauer's law $e/e0 =
exp(-(3p/hs)\eta)$, where $p$ is the pressure, and $e_0$ and $e$ are the
initial and present void ratios. The micro-mechanical simulation includes
elastic and dissipative normal forces plus slip, rolling and static friction
between grains. By this way we have explored how the macroscopic parameters
change by modifying the grains stiffness, V ; the dissipation coefficient,
$\gamma_n$; the static friction coefficient, $\mu_s$; and the dynamic friction
coefficient, $\mu_k$ . Cumulating all simulations, we obtained an unexpected
result: the two macroscopic parameters seems to be related by a power law, $h_s
= 0.068(4)\eta^{9.88(3)}$. Moreover, the experimental result for a Guamo sand
with the same granulometry fits perfectly into this power law. Is this relation
real? What is the final ground of the Bauer's Law? We conclude by exploring
some hypothesis.
