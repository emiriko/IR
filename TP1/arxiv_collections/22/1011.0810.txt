Putting data into the public domain is not the same thing as making those
data accessible for intelligent analysis. A distinguished group of editors and
experts who were already engaged in one way or another with the issues inherent
in making research data public came together with statisticians to initiate a
dialogue about policies and practicalities of requiring published research to
be accompanied by publication of the research data. This dialogue carried
beyond the broad issues of the advisability, the intellectual integrity, the
scientific exigencies to the relevance of these issues to statistics as a
discipline and the relevance of statistics, from inference to modeling to data
exploration, to science and social science policies on these issues.
