Merging compact binaries are the most viable and best studied candidates for
gravitational wave (GW) detection by the fully operational network of
ground-based observatories. In anticipation of the first detections, the
expected distribution of GW sources in the local universe is of considerable
interest. Here we investigate the full phase space distribution of coalescing
compact binaries at $z = 0$ using dark matter simulations of structure
formation. The fact that these binary systems acquire large barycentric
velocities at birth ("kicks") results in merger site distributions that are
more diffusely distributed with respect to their putative hosts, with mergers
occurring out to distances of a few Mpc from the host halo. Redshift estimates
based solely on the nearest galaxy in projection can, as a result, be
inaccurate. On the other hand, large offsets from the host galaxy could aid the
detection of faint optical counterparts and should be considered when designing
strategies for follow-up observations. The degree of isotropy in the projected
sky distributions of GW sources is found to be augmented with increasing kick
velocity and to be severely enhanced if progenitor systems possess large kicks
as inferred from the known population of pulsars and double compact binaries.
Even in the absence of observed electromagnetic counterparts, the differences
in sky distributions of binaries produced by disparate kick-velocity models
could be discerned by GW observatories, within the expected accuracies and
detection rates of advanced LIGO--in particular with the addition of more
interferometers.
