We present a renormalizable model for fermion masses based solely on the
double tetrahedral group T'. It does not include right handed neutrinos and
majorana neutrino masses are generated radiatively. The scalar sector of the
model involves three SU(2) doublets and a set of lepton number violating
(charged) scalars needed to give mass to the neutrinos. In the quark sector the
model leads to a Fritzsch type scenario that is consistent with all the
existing data. In the lepton sector, the model leads to tribimaximal (and near
tribimaximal) mixing, and an inverted mass hierarchy.
