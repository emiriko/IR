We suggest an approach for the enumeration of minimal permutations having d
descents which uses skew Young tableaux. We succeed in finding a general
expression for the number of such permutations in terms of (several) sums of
determinants. We then generalize the class of skew Young tableaux under
consideration; this allows in particular to discover some presumably new
results concerning Eulerian numbers.
