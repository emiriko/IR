We present the first set of polarimetric images made with the GMRT. These
were obtained as part of the program to commission the polarization mode at the
telescope. We find that the instrumental polarization leakage at the GMRT
varies with frequency. It is hence necessary to solve for the leakage as a
function of spectral channel. Once this is done however, it is possible to
calibrate these terms to better than 1% accuracy, making it feasible to study
sources that are polarized at the few percent level. We present 610 MHz
polarization images of two extended FR-II radio galaxies, viz. 3C 79 and 3C
265. These were selected from the sample of sources for which the total
polarization fraction at 610 MHz is known from the survey of Conway & Strom
(1984). We present high resolution polarization images of these two sources and
also find that the polarization fractions of the two sources as seen at the
GMRT are consistent with those reported by Conway & Strom (1984).
