The DRAO ST was used for the past 15 years as the primary instrument for the
Canadian Galactic Plane Survey. This has been a spectacularly successful
project, advancing our understanding of the Milky Way Galaxy through panoramic
imaging of the main constituents of the Interstellar Medium. Observations for
the CGPS are now complete and the Synthesis Telescope at DRAO has returned to
proposal-driven mode.
  The Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory invites astronomers to apply for
observing time with the DRAO Synthesis Telescope. The DRAO ST provides radio
observations of atomic hydrogen and radio continuum emission, including the
polarized signal, with high spatial dynamic range and arcminute resolution.
Imaging techniques developed for the CGPS have made the telescope into a
front-line instrument for wide-field imaging, particularly of polarized
emission. We will discuss telescope characteristics, show examples of data to
demonstrate the unique capabilities of the ST, and explain where and how to
apply for observing time.
