This paper aims to study the color behavior of the BL Lac object OJ 287
during optical outburst. According to the revisit of the data from the OJ-94
monitoring project and the analysis the data obtained with the 60/90 cm Schmidt
Telescope of NAOC, we found a bluer-when-brighter chromatism in this object.
The amplitude of variation tends to decrease with the decrease of frequency.
These results are consistent with the shock-in-jet model. We made some
simulations and confirmed that both amplitude difference and time delay between
variations at different wavelengths can result in the phenomenon of
bluer-when-brighter. Our observations confirmed that OJ 287 underwent a
double-peaked outburst after about 12 years from 1996, which provides further
evidence for the binary black hole model in this object.
