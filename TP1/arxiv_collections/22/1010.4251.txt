The massive 3-loop fermion-loop corrections $\propto C_A N_f T_F^2$ and $C_F
N_f T_F^2$ to the massive operator matrix elements $A_{Qg}$,
$A_{Qq}^{\rm{PS}}$, $A_{qq,Q}^{\rm{PS}}$, $A_{qq,Q}^{\rm{NS}}$ and
$A_{qq,Q}^{\rm{NS,TR}} have been obtained for general values of $N$. Thereby
the corresponding contributions to the asymptotic heavy flavor Wilson
coefficients of the structure function $F_2(x,Q^2)$ and of transversity in the
region $Q^2 \geq 10 \cdot m^2$ are known. Our method is based on direct
integration, avoiding the integration-by-parts technique, which is advantageous
due to the compactness of the intermediate and final results. We also obtain
the corresponding contributions to the 3-loop anomalous dimensions and confirm
results in the literature.
