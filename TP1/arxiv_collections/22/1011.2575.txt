Complex sequencing rules observed in birdsongs provide an opportunity to
investigate the neural mechanism for generating complex sequential behaviors.
To relate the findings from studying birdsongs to other sequential behaviors,
it is crucial to characterize the statistical properties of the sequencing
rules in birdsongs. However, the properties of the sequencing rules in
birdsongs have not yet been fully addressed. In this study, we investigate the
statistical propertiesof the complex birdsong of the Bengalese finch (Lonchura
striata var. domestica). Based on manual-annotated syllable sequences, we first
show that there are significant higher-order context dependencies in Bengalese
finch songs, that is, which syllable appears next depends on more than one
previous syllable. This property is shared with other complex sequential
behaviors. We then analyze acoustic features of the song and show that
higher-order context dependencies can be explained using first-order hidden
state transition dynamics with redundant hidden states. This model corresponds
to hidden Markov models (HMMs), well known statistical models with a large
range of application for time series modeling. The song annotation with these
models with first-order hidden state dynamics agreed well with manual
annotation, the score was comparable to that of a second-order HMM, and
surpassed the zeroth-order model (the Gaussian mixture model (GMM)), which does
not use context information. Our results imply that the hierarchical
representation with hidden state dynamics may underlie the neural
implementation for generating complex sequences with higher-order dependencies.
