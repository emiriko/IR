The 2-d spin 1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet with exchange coupling $J$ is
investigated on a periodic square lattice of spacing $a$ at very small
temperatures using the loop-cluster algorithm. Monte Carlo data for the
staggered and uniform susceptibilities are compared with analytic results
obtained in the systematic low-energy effective field theory for the staggered
magnetization order parameter. The low-energy parameters of the effective
theory, i.e.\ the staggered magnetization density ${\cal M}_s =
0.30743(1)/a^2$, the spin stiffness $\rho_s = 0.18081(11) J$, and the spin wave
velocity $c = 1.6586(3) J a$ are determined with very high precision. Our study
may serve as a test case for the comparison of lattice QCD Monte Carlo data
with analytic predictions of the chiral effective theory for pions and
nucleons, which is vital for the quantitative understanding of the strong
interaction at low energies.
