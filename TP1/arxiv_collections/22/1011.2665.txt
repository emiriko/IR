Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography is seen as a main candidate for
production of future generation computer technology. Due to the short
wavelength of EUV light (around 13 nm) novel reflective masks have to be used
in the production process. A prerequisite to meet the high quality requirements
for these EUV masks is a simple and accurate method for absorber pattern
profile characterization. In our previous work we demonstrated that the Finite
Element Method (FEM) is very well suited for the simulation of EUV
scatterometry and can be used to reconstruct EUV mask profiles from
experimental scatterometric data. In this contribution we apply an indirect
metrology method to periodic EUV line masks with different critical dimensions
(140 nm and 540 nm) over a large range of duty cycles (1:2, ..., 1:20). We
quantitatively compare the reconstructed absorber pattern parameters to values
obtained from direct AFM and CD-SEM measurements. We analyze the reliability of
the reconstruction for the given experimental data. For the CD of the absorber
lines, the comparison shows agreement of the order of 1nm. Furthermore we
discuss special numerical techniques like domain decomposition algorithms and
high order finite elements and their importance for fast and accurate solution
of the inverse problem.
