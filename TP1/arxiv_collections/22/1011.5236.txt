We present measurements of the masses and widths of four bottom baryon
resonances, Sigma_b(*)+-, reconstructed in the Lambda_b pi+- hadron decay
modes. The isospin mass splittings for the Sigma_b and Sigma_b* multiplets are
extracted as well. The analysis is based on a data sample corresponding to an
integrated luminosity of 6 fb^-1 .
