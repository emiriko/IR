We present preliminary results for $B_K$ from the MILC ultrafine lattices,
based on a partial ensemble of 305 configurations. We use HYP-smeared improved
staggered valence quarks. The analysis is done using fitting forms based on
both SU(2) and SU(3) staggered chiral perturbation thery. For the SU(2)
analysis, we find that the result using the NLO fit function is consistent with
that from a partial NNLO fit. For the SU(3) analysis, where we have to use
partially constrained fits due to the number of fit parameters, we find that
our two preferred fits ("N-BB1" and "N-BB2") are also consistent, both with
each other and with the results of the SU(2) fits. These results are used in
companion proceedings to improve the control over the continuum extrapolation.
