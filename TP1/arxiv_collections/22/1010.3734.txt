We present $R$-matrix calculations of photoabsorption and photoionization
cross sections across the K-edge of Mg, Si, S, Ar, and Ca ions with more than
10 electrons. The calculations include the effects of radiative and Auger
damping by means of an optical potential. The wave functions are constructed
from single-electron orbital bases obtained using a Thomas--Fermi--Dirac
statistical model potential. Configuration interaction is considered among all
states up to $n=3$. The damping processes affect the resonances converging to
the K-thresholds causing them to display symmetric profiles of constant width
that smear the otherwise sharp edge at the photoionization threshold. These
data are important for modeling of features found in photoionized plasmas.
