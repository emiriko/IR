We investigate bulk and shear viscosities of the gluon plasma within
relaxation time approximation to an effective Boltzmann-Vlasov type kinetic
theory by viewing the plasma as describable in terms of quasigluon excitations
with temperature dependent self-energies. The found temperature dependence of
the transport coefficients agrees fairly well with available lattice QCD
results. The impact of some details in the quasigluon dispersion relation on
the specific shear viscosity is discussed.
