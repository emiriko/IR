We present an improved study of spectroscopic observables in the $SU(2)$
Yang-Mills theory with two adjoint fermions. We make an improvement on the
precision of previous results which clarify the scale of finite volume effects
present. This analysis adds to the evidence for near-conformal dynamics of this
theory, while indicating a preference for a low anomalous mass dimension of the
massless theory.
