A finite word $w$ is an abelian square if $w = xx^\prime$ with $x^\prime$ a
permutation of $x$. In 1972, Entringer, Jackson, and Schatz proved that every
binary word of length $k^2 + 6k$ contains an abelian square of length $\geq
2k$. We use Cartesian lattice paths to characterize abelian squares in binary
sequences, and construct a binary word of length $q(q+1)$ avoiding abelian
squares of length $\geq 2\sqrt{2q(q+1)}$ or greater. We thus prove that the
length of the longest binary word avoiding abelian squares of length $2k$ is
$\Theta(k^2)$.
