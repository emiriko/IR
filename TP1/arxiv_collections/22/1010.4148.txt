We review our studies on the rho and sigma resonances properties derived from
the Inverse Amplitude Method. In particular, we study the leading $1/N_c$
behavior of the resonances masses and widths and their evolution with changing
$m_\pi$. The $1/N_c$ expansion gives a clear definition of $\bar qq$ states,
which is neatly satisfied by the $\rho$ but not by the sigma, showing that its
dominant component is not $\bar qq$. The $m_\pi$ dependence of the resonance
properties is relevant to connect with lattice studies. We show that our
predictions compare well with some lattice results and we find that the
rho-pi-pi coupling constant is $m_\pi$ independent, in contrast with the
sigma-pi-pi$ coupling, that shows a strong $m_\pi$ dependence.
