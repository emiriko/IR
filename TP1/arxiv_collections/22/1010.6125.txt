A non-perturbative method which can go beyond the weak coupling perturbation
theory is introduced. Essential idea is to formulate a set of exact
differential equations as a function of the coupling strength $g$. Unlike other
resummation in which information of the higher order terms is necessary, we
only need a leading order perturbative formula in every step to reach the large
value of $g$. The method is applied to the quantum anharmonic oscillator and
quantum double well potential in one dimension. Both are known to have
divergent series in the weak coupling perturbation and the latter is not Borel
summable. Our method is shown to work well from the weak coupling to the strong
coupling for the energy eigenvalues and the wave functions. The method is also
applied successfully to the system with time-dependent external field.
