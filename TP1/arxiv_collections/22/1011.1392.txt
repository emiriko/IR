We study both regular (the zero-momentum ghost dressing function not
diverging), also named decoupling, and critical (diverging), also named
scaling, Yang-Mills propagators solutions by analyzing the low-momentum
behaviour of the ghost propagator Dyson-Schwinger equation (DSE) in Landau
gauge, assuming for the truncation a constant ghost-gluon vertex, as it is
extensively done, and a simple model for a massive gluon propagator. The
asymptotic expression obtained for the regular or decoupling ghost dressing
function up to the order ${\cal O}(q^2)$ fits pretty well the low-momentum
ghost propagator obtained through the numerical integration of the coupled
gluon and ghost DSE in the PT-BFM scheme and, when the size of the coupling
renormalized at some scale approaches some critical value, the PT-BFM results
seems to trend to the the scaling solution as a limiting case
