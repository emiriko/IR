The use of the absolute measure of local chirality is championed since it has
a uniform distribution for randomly reshuffled chiral components so that any
deviations from uniformity in the associated "X-distribution" are directly
attributable to QCD-induced dynamics. We observe a transition in the
qualitative behavior of this absolute X-distribution of low-lying eigenmodes
which, we propose, defines a chiral polarization scale of the QCD vacuum.
