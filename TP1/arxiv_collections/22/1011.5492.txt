Systems of coupled oscillators have been seen to exhibit chimera states, i.e.
states where the system splits into two groups where one group is phase locked
and the other is phase randomized. In this work, we report the existence of
chimera states in a system of two interacting populations of sine circle maps.
This system also exhibits the clustered chimera behavior seen earlier in delay
coupled systems. Rich spatio-temporal behavior is seen in different regimes of
the phase diagram.We carry out a detailed analysis of the stability regimes and
map out the phase diagram using numerical and analytic techniques.
