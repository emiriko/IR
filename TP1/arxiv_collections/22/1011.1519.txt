In this paper, Fuzzy Logic controller is developed for ac/ac Matrix
Converter. Furthermore, Total Harmonic Distortion is reduced significantly.
Space Vector Algorithm is a method to improve power quality of the converter
output. But its quality is limited to 86.7%.We are introduced a Cross coupled
DQ axis controller to improve power quality. The Matrix Converter is an
attractive topology for High voltage transformation ratio. A Matlab / Simulink
simulation analysis of the Matrix Converter system is provided. The design and
implementation of fuzzy controlled Matrix Converter is described. This AC-AC
system is proposed as an effective replacement for the conventional AC-DC-AC
system which employs a two-step power conversion.
