This paper proposes a new approach to multi-sensor data fusion. It suggests
that aggregation of data from multiple sensors can be done more efficiently
when we consider information about sensors' different characteristics. Similar
to most research on effective sensors' characteristics, especially in control
systems, our focus is on sensors' accuracy and frequency response. A rule-based
fuzzy system is presented for fusion of raw data obtained from the sensors that
have complement characteristics in accuracy and bandwidth. Furthermore, a fuzzy
predictor system is suggested aiming for extreme accuracy which is a common
need in highly sensitive applications. Advantages of our proposed sensor fusion
system are shown by simulation of a control system utilizing the fusion system
for output estimation.
