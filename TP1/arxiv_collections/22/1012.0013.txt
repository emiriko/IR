The standard formulation of gauge theories results from the Lagrangian
(functional integral) quantization of classical gauge theories. A more
intrinsic qunantum theoretical access in the spirit of Wigner's representation
theory shows that there is a fundamental clash between the pointlike
localization of zero mass (vector, tensor) potentials and the Hilbert space
(positivity, unitarity) structure of QT. The quantization approach has no other
way than to stay with pointlike localization and sacrifice the Hilbert space
whereas the approach build on the intrinsic quantum concept of modular
localization keeps the Hilbert space and trades the conflict creating pointlike
generation with the tightest consistent localization:: semiinfinite spacelike
string localization. Whereas these potentials in the presence of interactions
stay quite close to associated pointlike field strength, the interacting matter
fields to which they are coupled bear the brunt of the nonlocal aspect in that
they are string.generated in a way which cannot be undone by any
differentiation. The new stringlike approach to gauge theory also revives the
idea of a Schwinger-Higgs screening mechanism as a deeper and less metaphoric
description of the Higgs spontaneous symmetry breaking and its accompanying
tale about "God's particle" and its mass generation for all other particles.
