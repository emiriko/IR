We present a new decoding procedure to transmit classical information in a
quantum channel which, saturating asymptotically the Holevo bound, achieves the
optimal rate of the communication line. Differently from previous proposals, it
is based on performing a sequence of (projective) YES/NO measurements which in
N steps determines which codeword was sent by the sender (N being the number of
the codewords). Our analysis shows that as long as N is below the limit imposed
by the Holevo bound the error probability can be sent to zero asymptotically in
the length of the codewords.
