Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) has been shown to be able to fit spiral
galaxy rotation curves as well as giving a theoretical foundation for
empirically determined scaling relations, such as the Tully - Fisher law,
without the need for a dark matter halo. As a complementary analysis, one
should investigate whether MOND can also reproduce the dynamics of early - type
galaxies (ETGs) without dark matter. As a first step, we here show that MOND
can indeed fit the observed central velocity dispersion $\sigma_0$ of a large
sample of ETGs assuming a simple MOND interpolating functions and constant
anisotropy. We also show that, under some assumptions on the luminosity
dependence of the Sersic n parameter and the stellar M/L ratio, MOND predicts a
fundamental plane for ETGs : a log - linear relation among the effective radius
$R_{eff}$, $\sigma_0$ and the mean effective intensity $\langle I_e \rangle$.
However, we predict a tilt between the observed and the MOND fundamental
planes.
