Too many policy failures are fundamentally failures of knowledge. This has
become particularly apparent during the recent financial and economic crisis,
which is questioning the validity of mainstream scholarly paradigms. We propose
to pursue a multi-disciplinary approach and to establish new institutional
settings which remove or reduce obstacles impeding efficient knowledge
creation. We provided suggestions on (i) how to modernize and improve the
academic publication system, and (ii) how to support scientific coordination,
communication, and co-creation in large-scale multi-disciplinary projects. Both
constitute important elements of what we envision to be a novel ICT
infrastructure called "Innovation Accelerator" or "Knowledge Accelerator".
