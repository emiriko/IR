In the context of Born-Infeld electrodynamics, the electromagnetic fields
interact with each other via their non-linear couplings. A calculation will be
performed where an incoming electromagnetic plane wave scatters off a Coulomb
Field in the geometrical optics approximation. In addition to finding the first
order angle of deflection, exact solutions for the trajectory will also be
found. The possibility of electromagnetic bound states will be discussed.
