The occurence of shear bands in a complex fluid is generally understood as
resulting from a structural evolution of the material under shear, which leads
(from a theoretical perspective) to a non-monotonic stationnary flow curve
related to the coexistence of different states of the material under shear. In
this paper we present a scenario for shear-banding in a particular class of
complex fluids, namely foams and concentrated emulsions, which differs from
other scenarii in two important ways. First, the appearance of shear bands is
shown to be possible both without any intrinsic physical evolution of the
material (e.g. via a parameter coupled to the flow such as concentration or
entanglements) and without any finite critical shear rate below which the flow
does not remain stationary and homogeneous. Secondly, the appearance of shear
bands depends on the initial conditions, i.e., the preparation of the material.
In other words, it is history dependent. This behaviour relies on the tensorial
character of the underlying model (2D or 3D) and is triggered by an initially
inhomogeneous strain distribution in the material. The shear rate displays a
discontinuity at the band boundary, whose amplitude is history dependent and
thus depends on the sample preparation.
