Star forming galaxies represent a valuable tracer of cosmic history. Recent
observational progress with Hubble Space Telescope has led to the discovery and
study of the earliest-known galaxies corresponding to a period when the
Universe was only ~800 million years old. Intense ultraviolet radiation from
these early galaxies probably induced a major event in cosmic history: the
reionization of intergalactic hydrogen. New techniques are being developed to
understand the properties of these most distant galaxies and determine their
influence on the evolution of the universe.
