As part of the UKQCD and RBC collaborations' N_f=2+1 domain-wall fermion
phenomenology programme, we calculate the first two moments of the light-cone
distribution amplitudes of the pseudoscalar mesons pion and kaon and the
(longitudinally-polarised) vector mesons rho, K-star and phi. We obtain the
desired quantities with good precision and are able to discern the expected
quark-mass dependence of SU(3)-flavour breaking effects. An important
ingredient of the calculation is the nonperturbative renormalisation of lattice
operators using the RI'/MOM technique.
