The sphaleron rate is defined as the diffusion constant for topological
number NCS = int g^2 F Fdual/32 pi^2. It establishes the rate of equilibration
of axial light quark number in QCD and is of interest both in electroweak
baryogenesis and possibly in heavy ion collisions. We calculate the
weak-coupling behavior of the SU(3) sphaleron rate, as well as making the most
sensible extrapolation towards intermediate coupling which we can. We also
study the behavior of the sphaleron rate at weak coupling at large Nc.
