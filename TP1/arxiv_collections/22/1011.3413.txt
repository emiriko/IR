While the masses of light hadrons have been extensively studied in lattice
QCD simulations, there exist only a few exploratory calculations of the strong
decay widths of hadronic resonances. We will present preliminary results of a
computation of the rho meson width obtained using $N_f=2+1$ flavor simulations.
The work is based on L\"uscher's formalism and its extension to moving frames.
