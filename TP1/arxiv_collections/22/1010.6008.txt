We study the pion mass dependence of the rho(770) and f_0(600) masses and
widths from one and two-loop unitarized Chiral Perturbation Theory. We show the
consistency of one-loop calculations with lattice results for the M_rho, f_pi
and the isospin 2 scattering length a_20.Then, we develop and apply the
modified Inverse Amplitude Method formalism for two-loop ChPT. In contrast to
the f_0(600), the rho(770) is rather sensitive to the two-loop ChPT parameters
--our main source of systematic uncertainty. We thus provide two-loop
unitarized fits constrained by lattice information on M_rho, f_pi, by the qqbar
leading 1/N_c behavior of the rho and by existing estimates of low energy
constants. These fits yield relatively stable predictions up to m_pi\simeq
300-350 MeV for the rho coupling and width as well as for all the f_0(600)
parameters. We confirm, to two-loops, the weak m_pi dependence of the rho
coupling and the KSRF relation, and the existence of two virtual f_0(600) poles
for sufficiently high m_pi. At two loops one of these poles becomes a bound
state when m_pi is somewhat larger than 300 MeV.
