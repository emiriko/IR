Tests with cosmic ray muons of a small liquid argon time projection chamber
(LAr TPC) in a magnetic field of 0.55 T are described. No effect of the
magnetic field on the imaging properties were observed. In view of a future
large, magnetized LAr TPC, we investigated the possibility to operate a high
temperature superconducting (HTS) solenoid directly in the LAr of the detector.
The critical current $I_c$ of HTS cables in an external magnetic field was
measured at liquid nitrogen and liquid argon temperatures and a small prototype
HTS solenoid was built and tested.
