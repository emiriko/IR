Electromagnetic fields with complex spatial variation routinely arise in
Nature. We study the response of a small molecule to monochromatic fields of
arbitrary three-dimensional geometry. First, we consider the allowed
configurations of the fields and field gradients at a single point in space.
Many configurations cannot be generated from a single plane wave, regardless of
polarization, but any allowed configuration can be generated by superposition
of multiple plane waves. There is no local configuration of the fields and
gradients that requires near-field effects. Second, we derive a set of local
electromagnetic quantities, where each couples to a particular multipole
transition. These quantities are small or zero in plane waves, but can be large
in regions of certain superpositions of plane waves. Our findings provide a
systematic framework for designing far-field and near-field experiments to
drive multipole transitions. The proposed experiments provide information on
molecular structure that is inaccessible to other spectroscopic techniques, and
open the possibility for new types of optical control of molecules.
