A mini-review of measurements of inclusive semileptonic $B \to X_c\ell\nu$
and radiative $B\to X_s\gamma$ decays is presented. The semileptonic $X_c$ mass
moments are presented from Belle and BABAR. The inclusive $B\to X_s\gamma$
gamma branching fraction is presented from Belle as well as a preliminary
measurement of the direct CP-asymmetry of $B \to X_{s+d}\gamma$ decays at
BABAR. Fundamental Standard Model parameters and heavy quark parameters can be
derived from the $X_c$ mass and lepton energy moments from $B \to X_c\ell\nu$
decays and from the photon energy moments from $B \to X_s\gamma$ decays. The
values of the CKM matrix element $|V_{cb}|$, the $b$-quark mass $m_b$, and the
Fermi motion of the $b$-quark inside the $B$-meson are presented based on a
global fit to these moments by the Heavy Flavor Averaging Group.
