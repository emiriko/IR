We study self-duality of Grothendieck's blended extensions (extensions
panach\'ees) in the context of a tannakian category. The set of equivalence
classes of symmetric, resp. antisymmetric, blended extensions is naturally
endowed with a torsor structure, which enables us to compute the unipotent
radical of the associated monodromy groups in various situations
