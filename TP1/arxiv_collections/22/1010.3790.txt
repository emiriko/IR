The Sydney University Stellar Interferometer (SUSI) has been used to make a
new determination of the angular diameter of Sirius A. The observations were
made at an effective wavelength of 694.1 nm and the new value for the
limb-darkened angular diameter is 6.048 +/- 0.040mas (+/-0.66%). This new
result is compared with previous measurements and is found to be in excellent
agreement with a conventionally calibrated measurement made with the European
Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) at 2.176
microns (but not with a second globally calibrated VLTI measurement). A
weighted mean of the SUSI and first VLTI results gives the limb-darkened
angular diameter of Sirius A as 6.041 +/- 0.017mas (+/-0.28%). Combination with
the Hipparcos parallax gives the radius equal to 1.713 +/- 0.009R_sun. The
bolometric flux has been determined from published photometry and
spectrophotometry and, combined with the angular diameter, yields the emergent
flux at the stellar surface equal to (5.32+/- 0.14)x10^8 Wm^-2 and the
effective temperature equal to 9845 +/- 64 K. The luminosity is 24.7 +/- 0.7
L_sun.
