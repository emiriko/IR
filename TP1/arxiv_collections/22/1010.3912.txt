The effect of the AlOx barrier thickness on magnetic and morphological
properties of Ta/Co/(AlOx)/Alq3/Si hybrid structures was systematically studied
by means of atomic force microscopy, SQUID magnetometry and nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR). All used techniques pointed out that the barrier thickness of
2 nm is required to obtain a magnetically good cobalt layer on top of Alq3.
59Co NMR measurements revealed that the AlOx barrier gives rise to the
formation of an interface layer with "defective" cobalt favouring growth of
"bulk" cobalt with good magnetic properties.
