We study non-perturbatively five-dimensional SU(2) gauge theories by means of
the mean-field expansion on the lattice. On the anisotropic torus we show that
a continuum limit can be defined where the anisotropy is a relevant parameter.
The analysis of the static force supports the fact that the four-dimensional
hyperplanes decouple from each other in the continuum limit. Clear signs of
confinement are found in the static potential along the hyperplanes. We present
first results from Monte Carlo simulations on the phase diagram.
