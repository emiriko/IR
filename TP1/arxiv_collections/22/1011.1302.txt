Two-flavor chiral expansions provide a useful perturbative framework to study
hadron properties. Such expansions should exhibit marked improvement over the
conventional three-flavor chiral expansion. Although in principle one can
formulate two-flavor theories for the various hyperon multiplets, the nearness
of kaon thresholds can seriously undermine the effectiveness of such two-flavor
theories in practice. We investigate the importance of virtual kaon thresholds
on hyperon properties, specifically their isovector axial charges and
electromagnetic observables. In particular we uncover the underlying expansion
parameter governing the description of virtual kaon thresholds. For spin-half
hyperons, this expansion parameter is under theoretical control. As a result,
the virtual kaon contributions are well described in the two-flavor theory by
terms analytic in the pion mass-squared. For spin three-half hyperons, however,
one is closer to the kaon production threshold, and the expansion parameter is
not as small. Breakdown of $SU(2)$ chiral perturbation theory is shown to arise
from a pole in the expansion parameter associated with the kaon threshold. We
find that, despite the fact that higher-order corrections to the expansion
parameter is necessary to ascertain whether the two-flavor theory of spin
three-half hyperons remains perturbative, there is a useful perturbative
expansion for isovector axial charges and magnetic moments of both spin-half
and spin three-half hyperons.
