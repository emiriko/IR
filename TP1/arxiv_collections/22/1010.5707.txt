The contributions of scalar leptoquarks in lepton flavor violating (LFV)
processes of type $l_i\to l_j \gamma$ are investigated in frame of the minimal
model with the four color symmetry and Higgs mechanism of quark and lepton mass
generation. It is shown that experimental data on the decays $\mu\to e \gamma$,
$\tau \to \mu \gamma$, $\tau\to e \gamma$ allow the existence of light scalar
leptoquarks of type under consideration, with masses of order 1 TeV or below.
