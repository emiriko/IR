Criteria suitable for measuring entanglement between two different potential
wells in a Bose- Einstein condensation (BEC) are evaluated. We show how to
generate the required entanglement, utilizing either an adiabatic two-mode or
dynamic four-mode interaction strategy, with techniques that take advantage of
s-wave scattering interactions to provide the nonlinear coupling. The dynamic
entanglement method results in an entanglement signature with spatially
separated detectors, as in the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) paradox.
