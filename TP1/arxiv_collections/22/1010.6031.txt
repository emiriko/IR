Now that English translations of Schwarzschild's original paper exist, that
paper has become accessible to more people. Historically, the so-called
"standard Schwarzschild solution" was not the original Schwarzschild's work,
but it is actually due to J. Droste and, independently, H. Weyl, while it has
been ultimately enabled like correct solution by D. Hilbert. Based on this,
there are authors who claim that the work of Hilbert was wrong and that
Hilbert's mistake spawned black-holes and the community of theoretical
physicists continues to elaborate on this falsehood, with a hostile shouting
down of any and all voices challenging them. In this paper we re-analyse "the
original Schwarzschild solution" and we show that it is totally equivalent to
the solution enabled by Hilbert. Thus, the authors who claim that "the original
Schwarzschild solution" implies the non existence of black holes give the wrong
answer. We realize that the misunderstanding is due to an erroneous
interpretation of the different coordinates. In fact, arches of circumference
appear to follow the law dl = rd{\phi}, if the origin of the coordinate system
is a non-dimensional material point in the core of the black-hole, while they
do not appear to follow such a law, but to be deformed by the presence of the
mass of the central body M if the origin of the coordinate system is the
surface of the Schwarzschild sphere.
