We extend the framework of forward and reverse processes commonly utilized in
the derivation and analysis of the nonequilibrium work relations to
thermodynamic processes with repeated discrete feedback. Within this framework,
we derive a generalization of the detailed fluctuation theorem, which is
modified by the addition of a term that quantifies the change in uncertainty
about the microscopic state of the system upon making measurements of physical
observables during feedback. As an application, we extend two nonequilibrium
work relations: the nonequilibrium work fluctuation theorem and the
relative-entropy work relation.
