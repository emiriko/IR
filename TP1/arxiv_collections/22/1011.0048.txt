A Lie group $G$ naturally acts on its Lie algebra $\gg$, called the adjoint
action. In this paper, we determine the orbit types of the compact exceptional
Lie group $G_2$ in its Lie algebra $\gg_2$. As results, the group $G_2$ has
four orbit types in the Lie algebra $\gg_2$ as $$ G_2/G_2, \quad G_2/(U(1)
\times U(1)), \quad G_2/((Sp(1)\times U(1))/\Z_2), \quad G_2/((U(1)\times
Sp(1))/\Z_2). $$ These orbits, especially the last two orbits, are not
equivalent, that is, there exists no $G_2$-equivariant homeomorphism among
them.
