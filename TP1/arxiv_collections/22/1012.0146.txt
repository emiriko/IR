The algorithm of the ensemble pulsar time scale (PT$_{\rm ens}$) based on the
optimal Wiener filtration method has been proposed. This algorithm allows the
separation of the contributions to the post-fit pulsar timing residuals of the
atomic clock and pulsar itself. Filters were designed with the use of the
cross-spectra of the timing residuals. The method has been applied to the
timing data of six millisecond pulsars. Direct comparison with the classical
method of the weighted average showed that use of the optimal Wiener filters
before averaging allows noticeably to improve the fractional instability of the
ensemble time scale. Application of the proposed method to the most stable
millisecond pulsars with the fractional instability $\sigma_z < 10^{-15}$ may
improve the fractional instability of PT$_{\rm ens}$ up to the level $\sim
10^{-16}$.
