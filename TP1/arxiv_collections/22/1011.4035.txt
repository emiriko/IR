Magnetic reconnection is commonly considered as a mechanism of solar
(eruptive) flares. A deeper study of this scenario reveals, however, a number
of open issues. Among them is the fundamental question, how the magnetic energy
is transferred from large, accumulation scales to plasma scales where its
actual dissipation takes place. In order to investigate this transfer over a
broad range of scales we address this question by means of a high-resolution
MHD simulation. The simulation results indicate that the magnetic-energy
transfer to small scales is realized via a cascade of consecutive smaller and
smaller flux-ropes (plasmoids), in analogy with the vortex-tube cascade in
(incompressible) fluid dynamics. Both tearing and (driven) "fragmenting
coalescence" processes are equally important for the consecutive fragmentation
of the magnetic field (and associated current density) to smaller elements. At
the later stages a dynamic balance between tearing and coalescence processes
reveals a steady (power-law) scaling typical for cascading processes. It is
shown that cascading reconnection also addresses other open issues in solar
flare research such as the duality between the regular large-scale picture of
(eruptive) flares and the observed signatures of fragmented (chaotic) energy
release, as well as the huge number of accelerated particles. Indeed,
spontaneous current-layer fragmentation and formation of multiple channelised
dissipative/acceleration regions embedded in the current layer appears to be
intrinsic to the cascading process. The multiple small-scale current sheets may
also facilitate the acceleration of a large number of particles. The structure,
distribution and dynamics of the embedded potential acceleration regions in a
current layer fragmented by cascading reconnection are studied and discussed.
