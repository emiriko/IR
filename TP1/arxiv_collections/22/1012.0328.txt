The quick and precise localization of GRBs by the Swift telescope allows the
early evolution of the afterglow light curve to be captured by ground-based
telescopes. With GROND measurements we can investigate the
optical/near-infrared light curve of the afterglow of gamma-ray burst 080413B
in the context of late rebrightening. Multi-wavelength follow-up observations
were performed on the afterglow of GRB 080413B. X-ray emission was detected by
the X-ray telescope onboard the Swift satellite and obtained from the public
archive. Optical and near-infrared photometry was performed with the
seven-channel imager GROND mounted at the MPG/ESO 2.2 m telescope and
additionally with the REM telescope, both in La Silla, Chile. The light curve
model was constructed using the obtained broad-band data. The broad-band light
curve of the afterglow of GRB 080413B is well fitted with an on-axis
two-component jet model. The narrow ultra-relativistic jet is responsible for
the initial decay, while the rise of the moderately relativistic wider jet near
its deceleration time is the cause of the rebrightening of the light curve. The
later evolution of the optical/NIR light curve is then dominated by the wide
component, the signature of which is almost negligible in the X-ray
wavelengths. These components have opening angles of theta(narrow) ~1.7 degrees
and theta(wide) ~9 degrees, and Lorentz factors of Gamma(narrow) >188 and
Gamma(wide) ~18.5. We calculated the beaming-corrected energy release to be 7.9
x 10^48 erg.
