High resolution X-ray spectroscopy has revealed soft X-rays from high density
plasma in Classical T-Tauri stars (CTTSs), probably arising from the accretion
shock region. However, the mass accretion rates derived from the X-ray
observations are consistently lower than those derived from UV/optical/NIR
studies. We aim to test the hypothesis that the high density soft X-ray
emission is from accretion by analysing optical accretion tracers from an X-ray
selected sample of CTTSs in a homogeneous manner. We analyse optical spectra of
a sample of CTTSs and calculate the accretion rates based on measuring optical
emission lines. These are then compared to the accretion rates derived from the
X-ray spectroscopy. We find that, for each CTTS in our sample, the different
optical tracers predict mass accretion rates that agree within the errors,
albeit with a spread of ~1 order of magnitude. Typically, mass accretion rates
derived from Halpha and HeI 5876 Ang are larger than those derived from Hbeta,
Hgamma and OI. When comparisons of the optical mass accretion rates are made to
the X-ray derived mass accretion rates, we find that: a) the latter are always
lower (but by varying amounts); b) the latter range within a factor of ~2
around 2x10^{-10} M_odot yr^{-1}, despite the fact that the former span a range
of ~3 orders of magnitude. We suggest that the systematic underestimation of
the X-ray derived mass accretion rates could depend on the density distribution
inside the accretion streams, where the densest part of the stream is not
visible in the X-ray band because of the absorption by the stellar atmosphere.
We also suggest that a non-negligible optical depth of X-ray emission lines
produced by post-shock accreting plasma may explain the almost constant mass
accretion rates derived in X-rays if the effect is larger in stars with larger
optical mass accretion rates.
