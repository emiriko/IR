The fcc spin-1 Ising (BEG) model has a dense ferromagnetic ($df$) ground
state instead of the ferromagnetic ground state at low temperature region and
exhibits the dense ferromagnetic ($df$) - ferromagnetic ($F$) phase transition
for $d=D/J=2.9$, $k=K/J=-0.5$, $\ell =L/J=0$ and $h=H/J=0$. The critical
behavior of the dense ferromagnetic ($df$) - ferromagnetic ($F$) phase
transition has been investigated using the cellular automaton cooling and
heating algorithms. The universality class and the type of the dense
ferromagnetic ($df$) - ferromagnetic ($F$) phase transition have been
researched within the framework of the finite - size scaling, the power law
relations and the probability distribution. The results show that the dense
ferromagnetic- ferromagnetic phase transition is of the second order and the
model shows universal second order Ising critical behavior at $d=2.9$ parameter
value through $k=-0.5$ line.
