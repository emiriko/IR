Ensuring security of e-government applications and infrastructures is crucial
to maintain trust among stakeholders to store, process and exchange information
over the e-government systems. Due to dynamic and continuous threats on
e-government information security, policy makers need to perform evaluation on
existing information security strategy as to deliver trusted e-government
services. This paper presents an information security evaluation framework
based on new fuzzy multi criteria decision making (MCDM) to help policy makers
conduct comprehensive assessment of e-government security strategy.
