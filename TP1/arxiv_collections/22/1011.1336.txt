Goos-Haenchen and Imbert-Fedorov shifts are diffractive corrections to
geometrical optics that have been extensively studied for a Gaussian beam that
is reflected or transmitted by a dielectric interface. Propagating in free
space before and after reflection or transmission, such a Gaussian beam spreads
due to diffraction. We address here the question how the Goos-Haenchen and
Imbert-Fedorov shifts behave for a ``nondiffracting'' Bessel beam.
