The CDF experiment at the Tevatron p-pbar collider established that extensive
and detailed exploration of the b-quark dynamics is possible in hadron
collisions, with results competitive and supplementary to those from e+e-
colliders. This provides an unique, rich, and highly rewarding program that is
currently reaching full maturity. I report a few recent world-leading results
on rare decays, CP-violation in Bs mixing, and b-> s penguin decays.
