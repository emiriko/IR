By means of Numerical Stochastic Perturbation Theory (NSPT), we calculate the
lattice gluon propagator up to three loops of perturbation theory in the limits
of infinite volume and vanishing lattice spacing. Based on known anomalous
dimensions and a parametrization of both the hypercubic symmetry group H(4) and
finite-size effects, we calculate the non-leading-log and non-logarithmic
contributions iteratively, starting with the first-loop expression.
