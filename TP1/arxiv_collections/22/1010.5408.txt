We present results of a survey of post-asymptotic giant branch stars
(post-AGBs) at high galactic latitude. To date, few post-AGB stars are known
throughout the Galaxy and the number of known members of the older populations
like the galactic halo is even smaller. This study looks at the number of
post-AGB stars which are produced using different synthetic population methods
and compare the results with observations. The resulting synthetic populations
are compared to observational results from a complete and studied subsample
from the photographic Palomar-Green (PG) survey (with high resolution
spectroscopic follow-up for post-AGB candidates) and the SDSS spectroscopic
database. The results show only two candidate post-AGB stars in a complete
subsample of the PG survey spanning 4200 square degrees and one in the SDSS
database. We discuss and explore any observational biases which may cause the
result. If found to be truely representative of the halo population, one can
expect the majority of Population II stars to fail to ascend the AGB and evolve
through other evolutionary channels such as the extended horizontal branch.
