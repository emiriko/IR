The focus of this thesis is about statistical mechanics on heterogeneous
random graphs, i.e. how this heterogeneity affects the cooperative behavior of
model systems. It is not intended as a review on it, rather it is showed how
this question emerges naturally and can give useful insights to specific
instances. The first chapter is about the statistical mechanics of congestion
in queuing networks. The second is devoted to the study of the glassy dynamics
of facilitated spin models on disordered structures. In the third chapter, the
presence of inverse phase transitions in tri-critical spin systems on
heterogeneous random graphs is pointed out. Finally, the last chapter is on the
role of volatility in the evolution of social networks. In the conclusions, a
general insight about the interplay between structure and dynamics on
heterogeneous random graphs is given. It is based on the different scaling of
the transition point with the moments of the degree distribution for continuous
and discontinuous transitions, respectively.
