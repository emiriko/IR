The nearby Lynx-Cancer void is a good laboratory to study the effect of very
rarefied environment on the evolution of the least massive dwarf galaxies. A
recently compiled sample of this void's galaxies includes about one hundred
objects with M_B in the range -12 to -18 mag. Good quality images are available
in the SDSS database for ~80% of the sample. Their u,g,r,i,z photometry allows
one to derive galaxy stellar mass (and, incorporating HI data, gas
mass-fraction) and ages of visible stellar populations, and hence, the epoch of
their formation (first SF episode). We present the first photometric results of
the ongoing study of the Lynx-Cancer void.
