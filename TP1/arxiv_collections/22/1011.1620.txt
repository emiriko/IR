We consider continuous-spin models on the $d$-dimensional hypercubic lattice
with the spins $\sigma_x$ \emph{a priori} uniformly distributed over the unit
sphere in $\R^n$ (with $n\ge2$) and the interaction energy having two parts: a
short-range part, represented by a potential $\Phi$, and a long-range
antiferromagnetic part $\lambda|x-y|^{-s}\sigma_x\cdot\sigma_y$ for some
exponent $s>d$ and $\lambda\ge0$. We assume that $\Phi$ is twice continuously
differentiable, finite range and invariant under rigid rotations of all spins.
For $d\ge1$, $s\in(d,d+2]$ and any $\lambda>0$, we then show that the
expectation of each $\sigma_x$ vanishes in all translation-invariant Gibbs
states. In particular, the spontaneous magnetization is zero and block-spin
averages vanish in all (translation invariant or not) Gibbs states. This
contrasts the situation of $\lambda=0$ where the ferromagnetic nearest-neighbor
systems in $d\ge3$ exhibit strong magnetic order at sufficiently low
temperatures. Our theorem extends an earlier result of A. van Enter ruling out
magnetized states with uniformly positive two-point correlation functions.
