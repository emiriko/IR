New technology for superconductor integrated circuits has been developed and
is presented. It employs diffusion stoplayers (DSLs) to protect Josephson
junctions (JJs) from interlayer migration of impurities, improve JJ critical
current (Ic) targeting and reproducibility, eliminate aging, and eliminate
pattern-dependent effects in Ic and tunneling characteristics of Nb/Al/AlOx/Nb
junctions in integrated circuits. The latter effects were recently found in
Nb-based JJs integrated into multilayered digital circuits. E.g., it was found
that Josephson critical current density (Jc) may depend on the JJ's
environment, on the type and size of metal layers making contact to niobium
base (BE) and counter electrodes (CE) of the junction, and also change with
time. Such Jc variations within a circuit reduce circuit performance and yield,
and restrict integration scale. This variability of JJs is explained as caused
by hydrogen contamination of Nb layers during wafer processing, which changes
the height and structural properties of AlOx tunnel barrier. Redistribution of
hydrogen impurities between JJ electrodes and other circuit layers by diffusion
along Nb wires and through contacts between layers causes long-term drift of
Jc. At least two DSLs are required to completely protect JJs from impurity
diffusion effects - right below the junction BE and right above the junction
CE. The simplest and the most technologically convenient DSLs we have found are
thin (from 3 nm to 10 nm) layers of Al. They were deposited in-situ under the
BE layer, thus forming an Al/Nb/Al/AlOx/Nb penta-layer, and under the first
wiring layer to junctions' CE, thus forming an Al/Nb wiring bi-layer. A
significant improvement of Jc uniformity on 150-mm wafer has also been obtained
along with large improvements in Jc targeting and run-to-run reproducibility.
