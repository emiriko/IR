In this paper, we study a regular Bardeen black hole as a gravitational lens.
We find the strong deflection limit for the deflection angle, from which we
obtain the positions and magnifications of the relativistic images. As an
example, we apply the results to the particular case of the supermassive black
hole at the center of our galaxy.
