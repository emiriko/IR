Using the div-curl inequalities of Bourgain-Brezis [?MR2057026] and van
Schaftingen [?MR2078071], we prove an improved Strichartz estimate for systems
of inhomogeneous wave and Schrodinger equations, for which the inhomogeneity is
a divergence-free vector field at each given time. The novelty of the result is
that one can allow $L^1_x$ norms of the inhomogeneity in the right hand side of
the estimate.
