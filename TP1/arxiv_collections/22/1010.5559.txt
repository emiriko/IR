In this work, I propose a scheme about a single graphene nanoribbon (GNR)
emitter in a microcavity, and focus on a fully-quantum-mechanical treatment
model with the excitonic interaction included to investigate the photon
properties and lasing action. When the single armchair-edged GNRs (AGNRs)
microcavity system is pumped, the exciton-photon coupling provides more photons
and enhances the photon emission process, making it essentially a lasing
object. The theoretical results demonstrated that single AGNR in a
semiconductor microcavity system maybe serve as a nanolaser with ultralow
lasing threshold.
