Main-sequence massive stars possess convective cores that likely harbor
strong dynamo action. To assess the role of core convection in building
magnetic fields within these stars, we employ the 3-D anelastic spherical
harmonic (ASH) code to model turbulent dynamics within a 10 solar mass
main-sequence (MS) B-type star rotating at 4 times the solar rate. We find that
strong (900 kG) magnetic fields arise within the turbulence of the core and
penetrate into the stably stratified radiative zone. These fields exhibit
complex, time-dependent behavior including reversals in magnetic polarity and
shifts between which hemisphere dominates the total magnetic energy.
