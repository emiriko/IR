Observations with the adaptive optics system on the Very Large Telescope
reveal that outer main belt asteroid (702) Alauda has a small satellite with
primary to secondary diameter ratio of $\sim$56. The secondary revolves around
the primary in 4.9143 $\pm$ 0.007 days at a distance of 1227 $\pm$ 24 km,
yielding a total system mass of (6.057 $\pm$ 0.36) $\times$ 10$^{18}$ kg.
Combined with an IRAS size measurement, our data yield a bulk density for this
B-type asteroid of 1570 $\pm$ 500 kg~m$^{-3}$.
