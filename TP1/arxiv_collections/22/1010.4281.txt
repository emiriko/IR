Recent results, establishing evidence of intractability for such restrictive
utility functions as additively separable, piecewise-linear and concave, under
both Fisher and Arrow-Debreu market models, have prompted the question of
whether we have failed to capture some essential elements of real markets,
which seem to do a good job of finding prices that maintain parity between
supply and demand.
  The main point of this paper is to show that even non-separable, quasiconcave
utility functions can be handled efficiently in a suitably chosen, though
natural, realistic and useful, market model; our model allows for perfect price
discrimination. Our model supports unique equilibrium prices and, for the
restriction to concave utilities, satisfies both welfare theorems.
