We present a review of nonequilibrium phase transitions in mass-transport
models with kinetic processes like fragmentation, diffusion, aggregation, etc.
These models have been used extensively to study a wide range of physical
problems. We provide a detailed discussion of the analytical and numerical
techniques used to study mass-transport phenomena.
