We extract parton distribution functions (PDFs) and structure functions from
recent experimental data of polarized lepton-DIS on nucleons at next-to-leading
order (NLO) Quantum Chromodynamics. We apply the Jacobi polynomial method to
the DGLAP evolution as this is numerically efficient. Having determined the
polarized proton and neutron spin structure, we extend this analysis to
describe 3He and 3H polarized structure functions, as well as various sum
rules. We compare our results with other analyses from the literature.
