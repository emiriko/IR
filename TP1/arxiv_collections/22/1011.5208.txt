The propagation of sigma meson in nuclear matter is studied in the Walecka
model, assuming that the sigma couples to a pair of nucleon-antinucleon states
and to particle-hole states, including the in medium effect of sigma-omega
mixing. We have also considered, by completeness, the coupling of sigma to two
virtual pions. We have found that the sigma meson mass decreases respect to its
value in vacuum and that the contribution of the sigma omega mixing effect on
the mass shift is relatively small.
