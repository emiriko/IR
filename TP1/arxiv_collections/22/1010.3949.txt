In 2006-2010, several Radio Frequency (RF) detectors and calibration
equipment were deployed as part of the IceCube array at depths between 5 to
1400 meters in preparation for a future large scale GZK neutrino detector.
IceCube's deep holes and well-established data handling system provide a unique
opportunity for deep-ice RF detection studies at the South-Pole. We will
present verification and calibration results as well as a status-review of
ongoing analyses such as ice-properties, RF noise and reconstruction
algorithms.
