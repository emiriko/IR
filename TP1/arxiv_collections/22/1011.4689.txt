This paper studies formality of the differential graded algebra $RHom(E,E)$,
where $E$ is a semistable sheaf on a K3 surface. The main tool is Kaledin's
theorem on formality in families. For a large class of sheaves $E$, this DG
algebra is formal, therefore we have an explicit description of the singularity
type of the moduli space of semistable sheaves at the point represented by $E$.
This paper also explains why Kaledin's theorem fails to apply in the remaining
case.
