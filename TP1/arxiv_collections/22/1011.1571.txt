We observed comet C/2007 N3 (Lulin) twice on UT 28 January 2009, using the UV
grism of the Ultraviolet and Optical Telescope (UVOT) on board the Swift Gamma
Ray Burst space observatory. Grism spectroscopy provides spatially resolved
spectroscopy over large apertures for faint objects. We developed a novel
methodology to analyze grism observations of comets, and applied a Haser comet
model to extract production rates of OH, CS, NH, CN, C3, C2, and dust. The
water production rates retrieved from two visits on this date were $6.7 \pm
0.7$ and 7.9 $\pm$ 0.7 x 1E28 molecules s-1, respectively. Jets were sought
(but not found) in the white-light and `OH' images reported here, suggesting
that the jets reported by Knight and Schleicher (2009) are unique to CN. Based
on the abundances of its carbon-bearing species, comet Lulin is `typical'
(i.e., not `depleted') in its composition.
