Cramer's (1986) transactional interpretation of quantum mechanics posits
retrocausal influences in quantum processes in an attempt to alleviate some of
the interpretational difficulties of the Copenhagen interpretation. In response
to Cramer's theory, Maudlin (2002) has levelled a significant objection against
any retrocausal model of quantum mechanics. I present here an examination of
the transactional interpretation of quantum mechanics and an analysis of
Maudlin's critique. I claim that, although Maudlin correctly isolates the
weaknesses of Cramer's theory, his justification for this weakness is off the
mark. The cardinal vice of the transactional interpretation is its failure to
provide a sufficient causal structure to constrain uniquely the behaviour of
quantum systems and I contend that this is due to a lack of causal symmetry in
the theory. In contrast, Maudlin attributes this shortcoming to retrocausality
itself and emphasises an apparently fundamental incongruence between
retrocausality and his own metaphysical picture of reality. I conclude by
arguing that the problematic aspect of this incongruence is Maudlin's
assumptions about what is appropriate for such a metaphysical picture.
