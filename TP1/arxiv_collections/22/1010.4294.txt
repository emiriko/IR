We study the correspondence between the interacting new agegraphic dark
energy and the polytropic gas model of dark energy in the non-flat FRW
universe. This correspondence allows to reconstruct the potential and the
dynamics for the scalar field of the polytropic model, which describe
accelerated expansion of the universe.
