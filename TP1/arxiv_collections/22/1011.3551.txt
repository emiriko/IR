In this paper we define and prove of the existence of the multi-point Green's
function for SLE - a normalized limit of the probability that an $SLE_{\kappa}$
curve passes near to a pair of marked points in the interior of a domain. When
$\kappa<8$ this probability is nontrivial, and an expression can be written in
terms two-sided radial SLE. One of the main components to our proof is a
refinement of a bound first provided by Beffara [Ann. Probab. 36 (2008)
1421-1452]. This work contains a proof of this bound independent from the
original.
