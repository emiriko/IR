Modern Avionics are controlled by sophisticated mission components in the
Aircraft. The control function is implemented via a standard ARINC-429 bus
interface. It is a two-wire point-topoint serial data bus for control
communications in Avionics. The bus operates 12.5 or 100kb/sec, the
implementation is envisaged for one transmits and receive channel respectively.
Further the code can be modified for more no of independent Tx and Rx channels.
An on chip memory allotment on the FPGA will provide a buffer bank for storing
the incoming or outgoing data. For this purpose SRAM based FPGAs are utilized.
This flexible ARINC429 solution gives exactly what is needed for real time
applications. The IP can be programmed to send an interrupt to the host and
also prepare it to process the data. Majority of the hardware function of
digital natures are embedded into a single FPGA by saving in terms of PCB board
space, power consumption and volume results. This paper deals with the
development, implementation, simulation, and verification of ARINC_429 formats.
The IP core development is described in VHDL.
