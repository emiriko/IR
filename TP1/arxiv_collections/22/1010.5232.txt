We report on the observation of the charm mesons D^\ast \pm, D^\pm and D_s
^\pm with 1.4 nb^-1 of data, and of the J/psi-->mu+mu- resonance with 78 nb-1
of data from the ATLAS detector in 7 TeV proton-proton collisions at the LHC.
The resultant signals support the high performance of the ATLAS detector as
predicted from simulation and prospects for future measurements in the charm
and charmonium sector.
