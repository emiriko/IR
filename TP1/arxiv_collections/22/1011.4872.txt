The CASTOR calorimeter is a detector covering the very forward region of the
CMS experiment at the LHC. It surrounds the beam pipe with 14 longitudinal
modules each of which consisting of 16 azimuthal sectors and allows to
reconstruct shower profiles, separate electrons and photons from hadrons and
search for phenomena with anomalous hadronic energy depositions. The physics
program that can be performed with this detector includes a large variety of
different QCD topics. In particular, the calorimeter is supposed to contribute
to studies of low-x parton dynamics, diffractive scattering, multi-parton
interactions and cosmic ray related physics in proton-proton and heavy-ion
collisions. The physics capabilities of this detector are briefly summarized in
this paper.
