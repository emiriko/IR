Cross sections are calculated for single and double photon exchange in
ultraperipheral Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC. The particle production is
simulated with the DPMJET event generator. Large cross sections are found for
particle production around mid-rapidity making these processes an important
background to hadronic nuclear interactions at both the trigger and analysis
levels.
