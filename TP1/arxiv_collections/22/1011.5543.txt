Non-photonic electrons (when $p_T >$ 3 GeV/$c$) represent the directions of
the parent heavy quarks, and their angular correlations with charged hadrons
provide a unique tool to study the relative contributions from $D$ and B meson
decays in p+p collisions, as well as the flavor-dependence of the energy loss
mechanism in A+A collisions. We review the disentanglement of charm and bottom
contributions to non-photonic electrons in p+p collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 200$
GeV at RHIC. B decay contribution is approximately 50$ at the electron
transverse momentum of $p_{T} > 5$ GeV/$c$ from STAR results. Incorporating the
energy loss information of non-photonic electrons, the result indicates a B
meson suppression at high $p_T$ in heavy ion collisions. We also present
non-photonic electron-hadron correlations in d+Au collisions as a baseline
reference for the investigation of the heavy quark energy loss in A+A
collisions. Heavy quark energy loss and heavy quark evolution in the QCD medium
can lead to a finite "elliptic flow" parameter ($v_2$) of $D$ and $B$ mesons
which can be studied through $v_2$ of non-photonic electrons. Preliminary $v_2$
measurements for non-photonic electrons are shown to be lower than $v_2$ of
charged hadrons (or $K_S^0$, $\Lambda$) for 200 GeV Au+Au collisions.
