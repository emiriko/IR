We revisit a theory of skyrmion transport in ferromagnets. On a basis of an
effective U(1) gauge theory for spin-chirality fluctuations in double-exchange
ferromagnets, we derive an expression for the velocity of a skyrmion core
driven by the dc electric field. We find that mutual feedback effects between
conduction electrons and localized spins give rise to Chern-Simons terms,
suggesting a dissipationless mechanism for the skyrmion Hall current. A
conventional description of the current-induced skyrmion motion, appearing
through the spin transfer torque and scattering events, is reproduced in a
certain limit of our description, where the Chern-Simons terms are not fully
incorporated. Our theory is applicable to not only metallic but also insulating
systems, where the purely topological and dissipationless skyrmion Hall current
can be induced in the presence of an energy gap.
