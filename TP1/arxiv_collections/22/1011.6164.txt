Correlation functions of the FF and F\tilde{F} operators in hot SU(3)
Yang-Mills theory have recently been studied both on the lattice and in
perturbation theory, and the results subsequently compared to the strong
coupling limit of large-N_c N=4 Super Yang-Mills theory, available through the
AdS/CFT correspondence. Here, we review the perturbative calculations, covering
both Euclidean spatial correlators and the UV limit of spectral densities, and
comment on the emerging physical picture as well as on possible extensions of
the present studies.
