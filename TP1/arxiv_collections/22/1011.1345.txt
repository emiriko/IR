In this paper we describe the technology of building a vacuum-tight high
voltage feedthrough which is able to operate at voltages up to 30 kV. The
feedthrough has a coaxial structure with a grounded sheath which makes it
capable to lead high voltage potentials into cryogenic liquids, without risk of
surface discharges in the gas phase above the liquid level. The feedthrough is
designed to be used in ionization detectors, based on liquefied noble gases,
such as Argon or Xenon.
