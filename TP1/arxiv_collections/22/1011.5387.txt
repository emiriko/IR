Using the exact Bose-Fermi mapping, we study universal properties of
ground-state density distributions and finite-temperature quantum critical
behavior of one-dimensional hard-core bosons in trapped incommensurate optical
lattices. Through the analysis of universal scaling relations in the quantum
critical regime, we demonstrate that the superfluid to Bose glass transition
and the general phase diagram of disordered hard-core bosons can be uniquely
determined from finite-temperature density distributions of the trapped
disordered system.
