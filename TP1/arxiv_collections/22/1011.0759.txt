Supersymmetry with heavy scalars is a model where at the LHC we have to rely
on rate measurements to determine the parameters of the underlying new physics.
For this example we show how to properly combine rate measurements with
kinematic endpoints, taking into account statistical, systematic and theory
uncertainties. Provided we observe a sizeable number of events the LHC should
be able to determine many model parameters with small enough error bars to for
example test unification patterns.
