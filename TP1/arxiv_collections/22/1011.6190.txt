M-type stars exhibit strong magnetic fields towards decreasing effective
temperatures. The measurement of these fields is complicated due to missing
indicators. Molecular FeH lines provide an excellent means to determine
magnetic field strengths from the Zeeman broadening of magnetically sensitive
lines. Our aim is the investigation of possible dependencies of the amount of
sensitivity to magnetic fields from rotational quantum number, branch, and the
projection of the total angular momentum onto the internuclear axis ({\Omega}).
We also compare results from com-putations with those from observations. We use
high resolution CRIRES spectra of the two M dwarfs GJ1002 (M5.5 inactive) and
GJ1224 (M4.5 active). Individual lines are fitted by Gaussians and the obtained
line depths and widths from the active and inactive star can be compared with
each other. In this way, magnetically sensitive lines can be detected. For test
purposes, we do the same with computed spectra of FeH. One with zero magnetic
field and the other with a 2 kG magnetic field vector used in the disc
integration (i.e. pure radial at the disc center). We found, in agreement with
theory, that lines with high {\Omega} show strong sensitivity to magnetic
fields. No obvious correlation with branch or J was found, which was also
expected for lines formed in intermediate Hund's case. The computations agreed
in general well with the observations, but in many cases the individual
splitting of certain lines can be very different to observations.
