We consider a functional obtained by adding a trace term to the Allen-Cahn
phase segregation model and we prove some density estimates for the level sets
of the interfaces.
  We treat in a unified way also the cases of possible degeneracy and
singularity of the ellipticity of the model and the quasiminimal case.
