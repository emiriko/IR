The lightest N* state, N(1440) P11, also known as Roper resonance, has
puzzled physicists for decades. A large variety of theoretical models aimed to
understand its properties have been proposed. Some of them are briefly reviewed
here, together with the hadronic processes where the Roper resonance is
revealed or plays an important role.
