We study synchronized quantized charge pumping through several dynamical
quantum dots (QDs) driven by a single time modulated gate signal. We show that
the main obstacle for synchronization being the lack of uniformity can be
overcome by operating the QDs in the decay cascade regime. We discuss the
mechanism responsible for lifting the stringent uniformity requirements. This
enhanced functionality of dynamical QDs might find applications in
nanoelectronics and quantum metrology.
