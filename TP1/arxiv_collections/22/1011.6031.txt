Typical constraints on embedded systems include code size limits, upper
bounds on energy consumption and hard or soft deadlines. To meet these
requirements, it may be necessary to improve the software by applying various
kinds of transformations like compiler optimizations, specific mapping of code
and data in the available memories, code compression, etc. However, a
transformation that aims at improving the software with respect to a given
criterion might engender side effects on other criteria and these effects must
be carefully analyzed. For this purpose, we have developed a common framework
that makes it possible to experiment various code transfor-mations and to
evaluate their impact of various criteria. This work has been carried out
within the French ANR MORE project.
