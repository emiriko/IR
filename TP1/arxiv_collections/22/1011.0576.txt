We study a uniform matrix product state as a variational state for classical
and quantum spin chains in the thermodynamic limit. Under a careful treatment
of the translational symmetry, eigen values of the transfer matrix defined in
the calculation of expectation values can reflect the periodicity of the ground
state and indicate optimum periodicity of the matrix product state. We discuss
the relation between the periodicity and accuracy of magnetization curves. This
approach is free from the error due to finite system size, which works well
especially for the magnetic plateau problem.
