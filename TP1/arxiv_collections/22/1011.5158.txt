We present a study of the relationship between galaxy colour, stellar mass,
and local galaxy density in a deep near-infrared imaging survey up to a
redshift of z~3 using the GOODS NICMOS Survey (GNS). The GNS is a very deep,
near-infrared Hubble Space Telescope survey imaging a total of 45 arcmin^2 in
the GOODS fields, reaching a stellar mass completeness limit of M* = 10^9.5
M_sun at z=3. Using this data we measure galaxy local densities based on galaxy
counts within a fixed aperture, as well as the distance to the 3rd, 5th and 7th
nearest neighbour. We find a strong correlation between colour and stellar mass
at all redshifts up to z~3. We do not find a strong correlation between colour
and local density, however, the highest overdensities might be populated by a
higher fraction of blue galaxies than average or underdense areas, indicating a
possible reversal of the colour-density relation at high redshift. Our data
suggests that the possible higher blue fraction at extreme overdensities might
be due to a lack of massive red galaxies at the highest local densities.
