Non Gaussian states and processes are useful resources in quantum information
with continuous variables. An experimentally accessible criterion has been
proposed to measure the degree of non Gaussianity of quantum states, based on
the conditional entropy of the state with a Gaussian reference. Here we adopt
such criterion to characterise an important class of non classical states,
single-photon added coherent states. Our studies demonstrate the reliability
and sensitivity of this measure, and use it to quantify how detrimental is the
role of experimental imperfections in our realisation.
