A broad program of measurements is planned for heavy ion collisions in ATLAS.
With up to a factor of 30 increase in collision energy compared to existing
data, significant new insights are anticipated to be obtained with the first
data measured. Global features of the LHC collisions will be accessible with
the early data and will set the stage for the precision measurements to follow.
ATLAS is particularly well suited for exploration of "jet quenching," the
extinction of energetic jets in the hot dense medium. Observations of heavy
quark jet suppression will be possible with unprecedented energy reach and
statistical precision, potentially yielding new insights into the basic
mechanisms involved.
