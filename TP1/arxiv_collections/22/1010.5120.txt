We study the Landau gauge gluon and ghost propagators of SU(3) gauge theory,
employing the logarithmic definition for the lattice gluon fields and
implementing the corresponding form of the Faddeev-Popov matrix. This is
necessary in order to consistently compare lattice data for the bare
propagators with that of higher-loop numerical stochastic perturbation theory
(NSPT). In this paper we provide such a comparison, and introduce what is
needed for an efficient lattice study. When comparing our data for the
logarithmic definition to that of the standard lattice Landau gauge we clearly
see the propagators to be multiplicatively related. The data of the associated
ghost-gluon coupling matches up almost completely. For the explored lattice
spacings and sizes discretization artifacts, finite-size and Gribov-copy
effects are small. At weak coupling and large momentum, the bare propagators
and the ghost-gluon coupling are seen to be approached by those of higher-order
NSPT.
