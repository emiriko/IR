We present a determination of photospheric parameters and C abundances for a
sample of 172 G and K dwarfs, subgiants, and giants with and without detected
planets in the solar neighbourhood. The analysis was based on high S/N and high
resolution spectra observed with the ELODIE spectrograph, and for which the
observational data was publicly available. We intend to contribute precise and
homogeneous C abundances in studies that compare the behaviour of light
elements in stars, hosting planets or not. This will bring new arguments to the
discussion of possible anomalies that have been suggested and will contribute
to a better understanding of different planetary formation process. The
photospheric parameters were computed through the excitation potential,
equivalent widths, and ionisation equilibrium of Fe lines selected in the
spectra. C abundances were derived from spectral synthesis applied to prominent
molecular head bands of C_2 Swan (5128 and 5165) and to a C atomic line
(5380.3). The distribution of [C/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] shows no difference in the
behaviour of planet-host stars in comparison with stars for which no planet was
detected, for both dwarf and giant subsamples. This result is in agreement with
the hypothesis of primordial origin for the chemical abundances presently
observed instead of self-enrichment during the planetary system formation and
evolution. Additionally, giants are clearly depleted in [C/Fe] (~0.14 dex) when
compared with dwarfs, which is probably related to evolution-induced mixing of
H-burning products in the envelope of evolved stars. Subgiants, although in
small number, seems to follow the same C abundance distribution as dwarfs. We
also analysed the kinematics of the sample stars that, in majority, are members
of the Galaxy's thin disc. Finally, comparisons with other analogue studies
were performed and, within the uncertainties, showed good agreement.
