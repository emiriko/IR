We have experimentally studied few-body impurity systems consisting of a
single fermionic atom and a small bosonic field on the sites of an optical
lattice. Quantum phase revival spectroscopy has allowed us to accurately
measure the absolute strength of Bose-Fermi interactions as a function of the
interspecies scattering length. Furthermore, we observe the modification of
Bose-Bose interactions that is induced by the interacting fermion. Because of
an interference between Bose-Bose and Bose-Fermi phase dynamics, we can infer
the mean fermionic filling of the mixture and quantify its increase (decrease)
when the lattice is loaded with attractive (repulsive) interspecies
interactions.
