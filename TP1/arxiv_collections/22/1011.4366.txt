This paper considers the problem of cooperative power control in distributed
small cell wireless networks. We introduce a novel framework, based on repeated
games, which models the interactions of the different transmit base stations in
the downlink. By exploiting the specific structure of the game, we show that we
can improve the system performance by selecting the Pareto optimal solution as
well as reduce the price of stability.
