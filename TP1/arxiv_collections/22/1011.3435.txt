We are carrying out detailed study of the X-ray and infrared (IR) properties
of a sample of local (d < 70 Mpc) luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs) using
XMM-Newton and Spitzer (imaging and spectroscopy). The main goal is to study
the extreme processes of star formation and/or active galactic nuclei (AGN)
taking place in this cosmologically important class of galaxies. In this
proceedings we present the preliminary results obtained from the analysis of
the XMM-Newton X-ray images and the X-ray spectral modeling.
