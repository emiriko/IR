In this article, several aspects of the dynamics of a toy model for longrange
Hamiltonian systems are tackled focusing on linearly unstable unmagnetized
(i.e. force-free) cold equilibria states of the Hamiltonian Mean Field (HMF).
For special cases, exact finite-N linear growth rates have been exhibited,
including, in some spatially inhomogeneous case, finite-N corrections. A random
matrix approach is then proposed to estimate the finite-N growth rate for some
random initial states. Within the continuous, $N \rightarrow \infty$, approach,
the growth rates are finally derived without restricting to spatially
homogeneous cases. All the numerical simulations show a very good agreement
with the different theoretical predictions. Then, these linear results are used
to discuss the large-time nonlinear evolution. A simple criterion is proposed
to measure the ability of the system to undergo a violent relaxation that
transports it in the vicinity of the equilibrium state within some linear
e-folding times.
