With the help of transport and statistical models, we find that the ratios of
higher net-proton cumulants measured at RHIC are dominated by the statistical
fluctuations. Future measurements should focus on the dynamical fluctuations,
which are relevant to the underlying mechanisms of particle production, the
critical phenomena in particular. We also demonstrate that a proton-antiproton
correlation directly show if protons and antiprotons are emitted independently.
