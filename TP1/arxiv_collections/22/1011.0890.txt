Given a rational homology sphere M, whose splice diagram satisfy the
semigroup condition, Neumann and Wahl were able to define a complete
intersection surface singularity called splice diagram singularity from the
splice diagram of M. They were also able to show that under an additional
hypothesis on M called the congruence condition, the link of the splice diagram
singularity is the universal abelian cover of M. In this article we generalize
the congruence condition to the class of orbifolds called graph orbifold. We
show that under a small additional hypothesis, this orbifold congruence
condition implies that the link or the splice diagram equations is the
universal abelian cover. We also show that any two node splice diagram
satisfying the semigroup condition, is the splice diagram of a graph orbifold
satisfying the orbifold congruence condition.
