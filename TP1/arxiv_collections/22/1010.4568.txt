We study the dynamics of particles coupled to gravity in (2 + 1) dimensions.
Using the ADM formalism, we derive the general Hamiltonian for an N-body system
and analyze the dynamics of a two-particle system. Non-linear terms are found
up to second-order order in {\kappa} in the general case, and to every order in
the quasi-static limit.
