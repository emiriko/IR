We study the nuclear symmetry energy of dense matter using holographic QCD.
To this end, we consider two flavor branes with equal quark masses in a
D4/D6/D6 model. We find that at all densities the symmetry energy monotonically
increases. At small densities, it exhibits a power law behavior with the
density, $E_{\rm sym} \sim \rho^{1/2}$.
