The propagation of charge carriers in graphene is compared to that in type
II/III heterostructures for which a two-band Kane model is appropriate. In
particular, conditions for a quantitative analogy between these two cases are
searched for, and found to be quite restrictive. The analysis in this paper
shows that the essential property of graphene is not the spinor character of
its wavefunction but the linear dispersion relation, which does not hold in
finite-gap two-band Kane-type semiconductors. Therefore, Kane-like and
Dirac-like charge carriers behave differently, except in zero-bandgap
semiconductor superlattices.
