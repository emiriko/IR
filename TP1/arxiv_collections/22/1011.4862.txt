We investigate the dynamical behavior of entanglement in a system made by two
solid-state emitters, as two quantum dots, embedded in two separated
micro-cavities. In these solid-state systems, in addition to the coupling with
the cavity mode, the emitter is coupled to a continuum of leaky modes providing
additional losses and it is also subject to a phonon-induced pure dephasing
mechanism. We model this physical configuration as a multipartite system
composed by two independent parts each containing a qubit embedded in a
single-mode cavity, exposed to cavity losses, spontaneous emission and pure
dephasing. We study the time evolution of entanglement of this multipartite
open system finally applying this theoretical framework to the case of
currently available solid-state quantum dots in micro-cavities.
