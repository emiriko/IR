We perform detailed analytical and numerical studies of a recently proposed
method for a spectroscopic measurement of the superfluid fraction of an
ultracold atomic gas [N. R. Cooper and Z. Hadzibabic, Phys. Rev. Lett. 104,
030401 (2010)]. Previous theoretical work is extended by explicitly including
the effects of non-zero temperature and interactions, and assessing the
quantitative accuracy of the proposed measurement for a one-component Bose gas.
We show that for suitably chosen experimental parameters the method yields an
experimentally detectable signal and a sufficiently accurate measurement. This
is illustrated by explicitly considering two key examples: First, for a weakly
interacting three-dimensional Bose gas it reproduces the expected result that
below the critical temperature the superfluid fraction closely follows the
condensate fraction. Second, it allows a clear quantitative differentiation of
the superfluid and the condensate density in a strongly interacting Bose gas.
