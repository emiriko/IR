We demonstrate the acquisition of stimulated Raman scattering spectra with
the use of a single femtosecond pulse. High resolution vibrational spectra are
obtained by shifting the phase of a narrow band of frequencies in the broadband
input pulse spectrum, using spectral shaping. The vibrational spectrum is
resolved by examining the amplitude features formed in the spectrum after
interaction with the sample. Using this technique, low frequency Raman lines
(<100cm^-1) are resolved in a straightforward manner.
