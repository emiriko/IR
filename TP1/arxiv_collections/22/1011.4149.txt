In this paper, we present the asymptotically flat black hole solutions for
arbitrary values of coefficients in third order Lovelock gravity, and then
derive gravitational mass, Hawking temperature and entropy of the black holes.
In addition, based on a Hamilton-Jacobi approach beyond the semiclassical
approximation, we compute the corrected temperature and entropy of the third
order Lovelock black holes in seven dimensional spacetimes. By considering the
coefficients {\alpha}2 = {\alpha} and {\alpha}3 = {\alpha}2/3, we obtain a
special black hole solution. Later, we perform the local and global stability
analysis of the black holes with different horizon structures k = \pm1 for
coefficient {\alpha}2 < 0 and {\alpha}2 > 0, respectively.
