We consider new issues of duality in four-dimensional Lorentz-breaking field
theories. In particular, we demonstrate that the arising of the aether-like
Lorentz-breaking term is necessary in order for the 4D models to display the
duality analog between the MCS and self-dual models in 3D. We further study the
dispersion relations in both theories and discuss the physical contents of the
models involved in this new dualilty.
