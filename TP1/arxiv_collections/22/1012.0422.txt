We study the complex dynamics of a one-dimensional Bose gas subjected to a
dissipative local defect which induces one-body atom losses. In experiments
these atom losses occur, for example, when a focused electron or light beam or
a single trapped ion is brought into contact with a quantum gas. We discuss how
within such setups one can measure or manipulate densities locally and specify
the excitations that are induced by the defect. In certain situations the
defect can be used to generate entanglement in a controlled way despite its
dissipative nature. The careful examination of the interplay between hole
excitations and the collapse of the wave function due to nondetection of loss
is crucial for the understanding of the dynamics we observe.
