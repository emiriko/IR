The aim of ultrarelativistic heavy ion physics is to study collectivity and
thermodynamics of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) by creating a transient small
volume of matter with extreme density and temperature. There is experimental
evidence that most of the particles created in such a collision form indeed a
thermalized system characterized by collective response to pressure gradients.
However, a numerically small subset of high transverse momentum ($P_T$)
processes takes place independent of the bulk, with the outgoing partons
subsequently propagating through the bulk medium. Understanding the
modification of such 'hard probes' by the bulk medium is an important part of
the efforts to determine the properties of hot and dense QCD matter. In this
paper, current developments are reviewed.
