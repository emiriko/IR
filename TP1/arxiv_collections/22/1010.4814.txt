Using mainly the 1600 angstrom continuum channel, and also the 1216 angstrom
Lyman-alpha channel (which includes some UV continuum and C IV emission),
aboard the TRACE satellite, we observed the complete lifetime of a transient,
bright chromospheric loop. Simultaneous observations with the SUMER instrument
aboard the SOHO spacecraft revealed interesting material velocities through the
Doppler effect existing above the chromospheric loop imaged with TRACE,
possibly corresponding to extended non-visible loops, or the base of an X-ray
jet.
