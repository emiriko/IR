Understanding the physical processes responsible for accelerating the solar
wind requires detailed measurements of the collisionless plasma in the extended
solar corona. Some key clues about these processes have come from instruments
that combine the power of an ultraviolet (UV) spectrometer with an occulted
telescope. This combination enables measurements of ion emission lines far from
the bright solar disk, where most of the solar wind acceleration occurs.
Although the UVCS instrument on SOHO made several key discoveries, many
questions remain unanswered because its capabilities were limited. This white
paper summarizes these past achievements and also describes what can be
accomplished with next-generation instrumentation of this kind.
