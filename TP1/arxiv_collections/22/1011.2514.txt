Motivated by previous suggestions that three-body hard-core interactions in
lower-dimensional ultracold Bose gases might provide a way for creation of
non-Abelian anyons, the exact ground state of a harmonically trapped 1D Bose
gas with three-body hard-core interactions is constructed by duality mapping,
starting from an $N$-particle ideal gas of mixed symmetry with three-body
nodes, which has double occupation of the lowest harmonic oscillator orbital
and single occupation of the next $N-2$ orbitals. It has some similarity to the
ground state of a Tonks-Girardeau gas, but is more complicated. It is proved
that in 1D any system of $N\ge 3$ bosons with three-body hard-core interactions
also has two-body soft-core interactions of generalized Lieb-Liniger delta
function form, as a consequence of the topology of the configuration space of
$N$ particles in 1D, i.e., wave functions with \emph{only} three-body hard core
zeroes are topologically impossible. This is in contrast with the case of 2D,
where pure three-body hard-core interactions do exist, and are closely related
to the fractional quantized Hall effect. The exact ground state is compared
with a previously-proposed Pfaffian-like approximate ground state, which
satisfies the three-body hard-core constraint but is not an exact energy
eigenstate. Both the exact ground state and the Pfaffian-like approximation
imply two-body soft-core interactions as well as three-body hard-core
interactions, in accord with the general topological proof.
