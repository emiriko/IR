Invariance of the AdS_4 x CP^3 superstring under D=3 N=6 superconformal
symmetry is discussed in the sector described by the OSp(4|6)/(SO(1,3) x U(3))
supercoset sigma-model action presented in the conformal basis for the
osp(4|6)/(so(1,3) x u(3)) Cartan forms. Transformation rules under D=3 N=6
superconformal symmetry for the (10|24)-dimensional 'reduced' AdS_4 x CP^3
superspace coordinates are obtained and used to derive corresponding
world-sheet currents.
