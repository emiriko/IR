Many biological phenomena are inherently multiscale, i.e. they are
characterized by interactions involving different spatial and temporal scales
simultaneously. Though several approaches have been proposed to provide
"multilayer" models, only Complex Automata, derived from Cellular Automata,
naturally embed spatial information and realize multiscaling with
well-established inter-scale integration schemas. Spatial P systems, a variant
of P systems in which a more geometric concept of space has been added, have
several characteristics in common with Cellular Automata. We propose such a
formalism as a basis to rephrase the Complex Automata multiscaling approach
and, in this perspective, provide a 2-scale Spatial P system describing bone
remodelling. The proposed model not only results to be highly faithful and
expressive in a multiscale scenario, but also highlights the need of a deep and
formal expressiveness study involving Complex Automata, Spatial P systems and
other promising multiscale approaches, such as our shape-based one already
resulted to be highly faithful.
