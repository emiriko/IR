We introduce a variant of the replica trick within the nonlinear sigma model
that allows calculating the distribution function of the persistent current. In
the diffusive regime, a Gaussian distribution is derived. This result holds in
the presence of local interactions as well. Breakdown of the Gaussian
statistics is predicted for the tails of the distribution function at large
deviations.
