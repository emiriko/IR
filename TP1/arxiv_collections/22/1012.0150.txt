We analyze the asymptotic behavior of Regge trajectories of non-strange
mesons. In contrast to an existing belief, it is demonstrated that for the
asymptotically linear Regge trajectories the width of heavy hadrons cannot
linearly depend on their mass. Using the data on masses and widths of rho_J,
omega_J, a_J and f_J mesons for the spin values J \leq 6, we extract the
parameters of the asymptotically linear Regge trajectory predicted by the
finite width model of quark gluon bags. As it is shown the obtained parameters
for the data set B correspond to the cross-over temperature lying in the
interval 170.9-175.3 MeV which is consistent with the kinetic freeze-out
temperature of early hadronizing particles found in relativistic heavy ion
collisions at and above the highest SPS energy.
