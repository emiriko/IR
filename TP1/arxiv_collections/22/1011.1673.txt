The quantum theory of optical coherence is applied to the scrutiny of the
statistical properties of the relic inflaton quanta. After adapting the
description of the quantized scalar and tensor modes of the geometry to the
analysis of intensity correlations, the normalized degrees of first-order and
second-order coherence are computed in the concordance paradigm and are shown
to encode faithfully the statistical properties of the initial quantum state.
The strongly bunched curvature phonons are not only super-Poissonian but also
super-chaotic. Testable inequalities are derived in the limit of large angular
scales and can be physically interpreted in the light of the tenets of Hanbury
Brown-Twiss interferometry. The quantum mechanical results are compared and
contrasted with different situations including the one where intensity
correlations are the result of a classical stochastic process. The survival of
second-order correlations (not necessarily related to the purity of the initial
quantum state) is addressed by defining a generalized ensemble where
super-Poissonian statistics is an intrinsic property of the density matrix and
turns out to be associated with finite volume effects which are expected to
vanish in the thermodynamic limit.
