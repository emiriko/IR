We study the transmission of classical information in quantum channels. We
present a decoding procedure that is very simple but still achieves the channel
capacity. It is used to give an alternative straightforward proof that the
classical capacity is given by the regularized Holevo bound. This procedure
uses only projective measurements and is based on successive "yes"/"no" tests
only.
