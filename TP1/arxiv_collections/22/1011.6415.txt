We show the existence of an L-functions of a cuspidal representation of
GSp(4,A)*GSp(4,A) which has a pole of order 2 at s = 1, even for globally
generic representations. However if \pi comes from GSO(4,A), then \pi? is the
Weil transfer of \Pi_?1 \otimes \Pi_2 realized as a representation of GSO(4,A).
This agrees with Langlands Functoriality principle as GSO(4) is an endoscopic
group for GSp(4) and shows that data ?\Pi_?1 \otimes \Pi_2 on GSO(4) transfers
to \Pi_?1 \boxplus \Pi_2 through the composite of the endoscopic transfer from
GSO(4) to GSp(4) and the twisted endoscopic transfer from GSp(4) to GL(4).
