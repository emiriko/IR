The emission of $\nu\bar\nu$ pairs off electrons in a polarized ultra-intense
electromagnetic (e.g.\ laser) wave field is analyzed. We elaborate on the
significance of non-linear electrodynamics effects (i.e., multi-photon
processes) and the peculiarities of neutrino production.
  Special attention is devoted to the convergence of the reaction probabilities
as a function of the number of absorbed photons. Expressions for large field
intensities are provided.
  The asymmetry between the probabilities of electron and $\mu+\tau$ neutrino
production depends on initial conditions such as energy of the wave field
photons and the field intensity.
  These findings differ from the lowest order perturbative calculation of the
reaction $\gamma + e \to e' + \nu \bar \nu$.
