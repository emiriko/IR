The observation of the so-called dispersion cancelation (Opt. Express 17,
19244, 2009) and temporal phase modulation (Phys. Rev. Lett. 103, 163601, 2009)
of paired photons is generally attributed to the presence of frequency
entanglement between two frequency anticorrelated photons. In this paper, it is
shown that by introducing the appropriate amount of chromatic dispersion or
phase modulation between non-entangled photons, it is also possible to observe
these effects. Indeed, it is found that the relevant characteristic for the
observation of dispersion cancelation or the cancelation of temporal phase
modulation is the presence of certain frequency correlations between the
photons.
