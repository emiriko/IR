We have investigated effects of the QCD phase transition on the relic GW
spectrum applying several equations of state for the strongly interacting
matter: Besides the bag model, which describes a first order transition, we use
recent data from lattice calculations featuring a crossover. Finally, we
include a short period of inflation during the transition which allows for a
first order phase transition at finite baryon density. Our results show that
the QCD transition imprints a step into the spectrum of GWs. Within the first
two scenarios, entropy conservation leads to a step-size determined by the
relativistic degrees of freedom before and after the transition. The inflation
of the third scenario much stronger attenuates the high-frequency modes: An
inflationary model being consistent with observation entails suppression of the
spectral energy density by a factor of ~10^(-12).
