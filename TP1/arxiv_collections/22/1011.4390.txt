We investigate half-metallicity in [001] stacked (CrAs)$_n$/(GaAs)$_n$
heterostructures with $n \leq 3$ by means of a combined many-body and
electronic structure calculation. Interface states in the presence of strong
electronic correlations are discussed for the case $n=1$. For $n=2,3$ our
results indicate that the minority spin half-metallic gap is suppressed by
local correlations at finite temperatures, and continuously shrinks upon
increasing the heterostructure period. Although around room temperature the
magnetization of the heterostructure deviates by only $2%$ from the ideal
integer value, finite temperature polarization at $E_F$ is reduced by at least
$25%$. Below the Fermi level the minority spin highest valence states are found
to localize more on the GaAs layers while lowest conduction states have a
many-body origin. Our results, therefore, suggest that in these
heterostructures holes and electrons remain separated among different layers.
