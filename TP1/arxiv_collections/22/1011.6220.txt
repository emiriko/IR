Biometrics is the science and technology of measuring and analyzing
biological data of human body, extracting a feature set from the acquired data,
and comparing this set against to the template set in the database.
Experimental studies show that Unimodal biometric systems had many
disadvantages regarding performance and accuracy. Multimodal biometric systems
perform better than unimodal biometric systems and are popular even more
complex also. We examine the accuracy and performance of multimodal biometric
authentication systems using state of the art Commercial Off- The-Shelf (COTS)
products. Here we discuss fingerprint and face biometric systems, decision and
fusion techniques used in these systems. We also discuss their advantage over
unimodal biometric systems.
