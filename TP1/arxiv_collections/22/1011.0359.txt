Building on recent work by Rippon and Stallard, we explore the intricate
structure of the spider's web fast escaping sets associated with certain
transcendental entire functions. Our results are expressed in terms of the
components of the complement of the set (the 'holes' in the web). We describe
the topology of such components and give a characterisation of their possible
orbits under iteration. We show that there are uncountably many components
having each of a number of orbit types, and we prove that components with
bounded orbits are quasiconformally homeomorphic to components of the filled
Julia set of a polynomial. We also show that there are singleton periodic
components and that these are dense in the Julia set.
