Mayavi is an open-source, general-purpose, 3D scientific visualization
package. It seeks to provide easy and interactive tools for data visualization
that fit with the scientific user's workflow. For this purpose, Mayavi provides
several entry points: a full-blown interactive application; a Python library
with both a MATLAB-like interface focused on easy scripting and a feature-rich
object hierarchy; widgets associated with these objects for assembling in a
domain-specific application, and plugins that work with a general purpose
application-building framework. In this article, we present an overview of the
various features of Mayavi, we then provide insight on the design and
engineering decisions made in implementing Mayavi, and finally discuss a few
novel applications.
