This paper discusses the methodology necessary to measure the Hubble constant
Ho to a high degree of accuracy based upon Doppler tracking of spacecraft in
the solar system. Using this methodology with available published data we
determine a model independent value of the Hubble constant for the current
epoch in the solar system to be Ho = 2.59 \pm 0.05 x 10^-18 (s^-1) or as 79.8
\pm 1.7 (km/s/Mpc).
  We calculate the direct effect of the Cosmic Redshift on Doppler tracking of
spacecraft in the solar system. It is shown that with current tracking systems,
such as NASA's Deep Space Tracking Network, when the return trip light time of
the Doppler signal exceeds a certain threshold, imposed by the stability of the
frequency standard, the effect of the Cosmic Redshift is coherently conserved
in the returning Doppler signal.
  We demonstrate that in an underdetermined orbit, one determined by line of
sight Doppler alone, that if this Cosmic Redshift term is not accounted for,
the orbit determination program (ODP) miscalculates the actual recessional
velocity of the spacecraft from the measured recessional velocity causing a
mismatch between the actual and the predicted trajectory of the spacecraft. One
consequence is that the ODP will generate Doppler residuals, the difference
between the actual trajectory and the predicted trajectory which show an
anomalous force. When this effect is integrated in long arc solutions, it can
grow to considerable magnitude. We show that the ODP residuals uniquely
separate the Cosmic Redshift term from velocity Doppler sources and that the
solution can provide an accurate determination of Ho.
