We present metallicity distribution functions (MDFs) for the central regions
of eight dwarf satellite galaxies of the Milky Way: Fornax, Leo I and II,
Sculptor, Sextans, Draco, Canes Venatici I, and Ursa Minor. We use the
published catalog of abundance measurements from the previous paper in this
series. The measurements are based on spectral synthesis of iron absorption
lines. For each MDF, we determine maximum likelihood fits for Leaky Box,
Pre-Enriched, and Extra Gas (wherein the gas supply available for star
formation increases before it decreases to zero) analytic models of chemical
evolution. Although the models are too simplistic to describe any MDF in
detail, a Leaky Box starting from zero metallicity gas fits none of the
galaxies except Canes Venatici I well. The MDFs of some galaxies, particularly
the more luminous ones, strongly prefer the Extra Gas Model to the other
models. Only for Canes Venatici I does the Pre-Enriched Model fit significantly
better than the Extra Gas Model. The best-fit effective yields of the less
luminous half of our galaxy sample do not exceed 0.02 Z_sun, indicating that
gas outflow is important in the chemical evolution of the less luminous
galaxies. We surmise that the ratio of the importance of gas infall to gas
outflow increases with galaxy luminosity. Strong correlations of average [Fe/H]
and metallicity spread with luminosity support this hypothesis.
