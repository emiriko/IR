Thermalization play a central role in out-of-equilibrium physics of ultracold
atoms or electronic transport phenomena. On the other hand, entanglement
concepts have proven to be extremely useful to investigate quantum phases of
matter. Here, it is argued that **bipartite** entanglement measures provide key
information on out-of-equilibrium states and might therefore offer stringent
thermalization criteria. This is illustrated by considering a global quench in
an (extended) XXZ spin-1/2 chain across its (zero-temperature) quantum critical
point. A non-local **bipartition** of the chain **preserving translation
symmetry** is proposed. The time-evolution after the quench of the **reduced**
density matrix of the half-system is computed and its associated
(time-dependent) entanglement spectrum is analyzed. Generically, the
corresponding entanglement entropy quickly reaches a "plateau" after a short
transient regime. However, in the case of the integrable XXZ chain, the
low-energy entanglement spectrum still reveals strong time-fluctuations. In
addition, its infinite-time average shows strong deviations from the spectrum
of a Boltzmann thermal density matrix. In contrast, when the integrability of
the model is broken (by small next-nearest neighbor couplings), the
entanglement spectra of the time-average and thermal density matrices become
remarkably similar.
