In the single degenerate (SD) scenario for Type Ia supernova (SN Ia)
progenitors, an accreting white dwarf (WD) is expected to undergo a supersoft
X-ray source (SSS) phase. Recently, Gilfanov & Bogdan (2010, hereafter GB10)
claimed that observed X-ray fluxes of early type galaxies would be too low to
be consistent with the prediction of the SD scenario based on rather simple
assumptions. We present realistic evolutionary models of SD systems and
calculate durations of SSS phases. In most cases, accreting WDs spend a large
fraction of time in the optically thick wind phase and the recurrent nova phase
rather than the SSS phase. Thus the SSS phase lasts only for a few hundred
thousand years. This is by a factor of ~10 shorter than those adopted by GB10
where the SN~Ia progenitor WD was assumed to spend most of its life as a SSS.
The theoretical X-ray luminosity of the SSS has a large uncertainty because of
the uncertain atmospheric model of mass-accreting WDs and absorption of soft
X-rays by the companion star's cool wind material. We thus adopt an average of
the observed fluxes of existing symbiotic SSSs, i.e., ~0.4 x 10^{36} erg s^{-1}
for 0.3--0.7 keV. Using these SSS duration and soft X-ray luminosity, we show
that the observed X-ray flux obtained by GB10 is rather consistent with our
estimated flux in early type galaxies based on the SD scenario. This is a
strong support for the SD scenario as a main-contributor of SNe Ia in early
type galaxies.
