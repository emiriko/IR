Some dynamical properties of time-dependent driven elliptical-shaped billiard
are studied. It was shown that for the conservative time-dependent dynamics the
model exhibits the Fermi acceleration [Phys. Rev. Lett. 100, 014103 (2008)]. On
the other hand, it was observed that damping coefficients upon collisions
suppress such phenomenon [Phys. Rev. Lett. 104, 224101 (2010)]. Here, we
consider a dissipative model under the presence of in-flight dissipation due to
a drag force which is assumed to be proportional to the square of the
particle's velocity. Our results reinforce that dissipation leads to a phase
transition from unlimited to limited energy growth. The behaviour of the
average velocity is described using scaling arguments.
