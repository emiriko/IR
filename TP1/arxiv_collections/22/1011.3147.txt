The magnetic mass of neutral gluons in Abelian chromomagnetic field at high
temperature is calculated in SU(2)$ gluodynamics. It is noted that such type
fields are spontaneously generated at high temperature. The mass is computed
either from the Schwinger-Dyson equation accounting for the one-loop
polarization tensor or in Monte-Carlo simulations on a lattice. In latter case,
an average magnetic flux penetrating a plaquette is measured for a number of
lattices. Both calculations are in agreement with each other and result in zero
magnetic mass. Some applications of the results obtained are discussed.
