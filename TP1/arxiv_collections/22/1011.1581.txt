We extend a recent synchronization analysis of exact finite-state sources to
nonexact sources for which synchronization occurs only asymptotically. Although
the proof methods are quite different, the primary results remain the same. We
find that an observer's average uncertainty in the source state vanishes
exponentially fast and, as a consequence, an observer's average uncertainty in
predicting future output converges exponentially fast to the source entropy
rate.
