The new combined formulas have been established for the complex and real
rotation-angular functions arising in the evaluation of two-center overlap
integrals over arbitrary atomic orbitals in molecular coordinate system. These
formulas can be useful in the study of different quantum mechanical problems in
both the theory and practice of calculations dealing with atoms, molecules,
nuclei and solids when the integer and noninteger n complex and real atomic
orbitals basis sets are emploed. This work presented the development of our
previous paper (I.I. Guseinov, Phys. Rev. A, 32 (1985) 1864).
