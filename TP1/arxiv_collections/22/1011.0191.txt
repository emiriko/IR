We discuss combinatorial invariance of the betti numbers of the Milnor fiber
for arrangements of lines with points of multiplicity at most three and
describe a link between this problem and enumeration of solutions of the
Catalan equation over function field in the case when its coefficients are
products of linear forms and the equation defines an elliptic curve.
