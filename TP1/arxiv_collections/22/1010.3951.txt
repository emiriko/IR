This paper describes a framework and a method with which speech communication
can be analyzed. The framework consists of a set of low bit rate, short-range
acoustic communication systems, such as speech, but that are quite different
from speech. The method is to systematically compare these systems according to
different objective functions such as data rate, computational overhead,
psychoacoustic effects and semantics. One goal of this study is to better
understand the nature of human communication. Another goal is to identify
acoustic communication systems that are more efficient than human speech for
some specific purposes.
