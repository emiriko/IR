Undulatory locomotion of microorganisms like soil-dwelling worms and
spermatozoa, in structured environments, is ubiquitous in nature. They navigate
complex environments consisting of fluids and obstacles, negotiating
hydrodynamic effects and geometrical constraints. Here, we show fluid dynamics
videos of experiments and simulations of {\textit {C. elegans}} moving in an
array of micro-pillars. In addition, we show a video of transition from
swimming to crawling in drop of {\textit {C. elegans}}, where the fluid is
wicking into agar.
