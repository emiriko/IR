The Dempster--Shafer (DS) theory is a powerful tool for probabilistic
reasoning based on a formal calculus for combining evidence. DS theory has been
widely used in computer science and engineering applications, but has yet to
reach the statistical mainstream, perhaps because the DS belief functions do
not satisfy long-run frequency properties. Recently, two of the authors
proposed an extension of DS, called the weak belief (WB) approach, that can
incorporate desirable frequency properties into the DS framework by
systematically enlarging the focal elements. The present paper reviews and
extends this WB approach. We present a general description of WB in the context
of inferential models, its interplay with the DS calculus, and the maximal
belief solution. New applications of the WB method in two high-dimensional
hypothesis testing problems are given. Simulations show that the WB procedures,
suitably calibrated, perform well compared to popular classical methods. Most
importantly, the WB approach combines the probabilistic reasoning of DS with
the desirable frequency properties of classical statistics.
