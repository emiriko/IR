In this note we discuss the approach which was given by Wazwaz for the proof
of the complete integrability to the system of nonlinear differential
equations. We show that his method presented in [Wazwaz A.M. Completely
integrable coupled KdV and coupled KP systems, Commun Nonlinear Sci Simulat 15
(2010) 2828-2835] is incorrect.
