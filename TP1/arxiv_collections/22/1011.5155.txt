Given an endomorphism of a projective variety, by intersecting the graph and
the diagonal varieties we can determine the set of periodic points. In an
effort to determine the periodic points of a given minimal period, we follow a
construction similar to cyclotomic polynomials. The resulting zero-cycle is
called a dynatomic cycle and the points in its support are called formal
periodic points. This article gives a proof of the effectivity of dynatomic
cycles for morphisms of projective varieties using methods from deformation
theory.
