A modeling methodology and matrix formalism is presented that permits
analysis of arbitrarily complex interferometric waveguide systems, including
polarization and backreflection effects. Considerable improvement results from
separation of the dependencies on connection topology from the dependencies on
the devices and their specifications. A non-commutative operator and embedding
matrices are introduced allowing a compact depiction of the salient optical
equations, and straightforward calculation of the amplitude and intensity
transfer functions.
