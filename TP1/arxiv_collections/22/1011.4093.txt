Computational Thinking (CT) has been described as a universally applicable
ability such as reading and writing. In this paper, we describe an innovative
pedagogy using Rapid Digital Game Creation (RDGC) for learning CT skills. RDGC
involves the rapid building of digital games with high-level software that
requires little or no programming knowledge. We analyze how RDGC supports
various CT concepts and how it may be mapped to equivalent Java concepts by
building the same game using both RDGC and Java. We discuss the potential
benefits of this approach for attracting computing majors, as a precursor to
learning formal programming languages, for learning domain knowledge, and for
bridging the digital divide. We present the implications of this work for
teachers and researchers.
