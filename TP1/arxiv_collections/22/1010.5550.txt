We present results of a systematic study of failing core-collapse supernovae
and the formation of stellar-mass black holes (BHs). Using our open-source
general-relativistic 1.5D code GR1D equipped with a three-species neutrino
leakage/heating scheme and over 100 presupernova models, we study the effects
of the choice of nuclear equation of state (EOS), zero-age main sequence (ZAMS)
mass and metallicity, rotation, and mass-loss prescription on BH formation. We
find that the outcome, for a given EOS, can be estimated, to first order, by a
single parameter, the compactness of the stellar core at bounce. By comparing
protoneutron star (PNS) structure at the onset of gravitational instability
with solutions of the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkof equations, we find that thermal
pressure support in the outer PNS core is responsible for raising the maximum
PNS mass by up to 25% above the cold NS value. By artificially increasing
neutrino heating, we find the critical neutrino heating efficiency required for
exploding a given progenitor structure and connect these findings with ZAMS
conditions, establishing, albeit approximately, for the first time based on
actual collapse simulations, the mapping between ZAMS parameters and the
outcome of core collapse. We also study the effect of progenitor rotation and
find that the dimensionless spin of nascent BHs may be robustly limited below
a^* = Jc/GM^2 = 1 by the appearance of nonaxisymmetric rotational
instabilities.
