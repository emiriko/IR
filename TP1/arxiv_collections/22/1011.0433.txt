Many observed massive star-forming z\approx2 galaxies are large disks that
exhibit irregular morphologies, with \sim1kpc, \sim10^(8-10)Msun clumps. We
present the largest sample to date of high-resolution cosmological SPH
simulations that zoom-in on the formation of individual M*\sim10^(10.5)Msun
galaxies in \sim10^(12)Msun halos at z\approx2. Our code includes strong
stellar feedback parameterized as momentum-driven galactic winds. This model
reproduces many characteristic features of this observed class of galaxies,
such as their clumpy morphologies, smooth and monotonic velocity gradients,
high gas fractions (f_g\sim50%) and high specific star-formation rates
(\gtrsim1Gyr^(-1)). In accord with recent models, giant clumps
(Mclump\sim(5x10^8-10^9)Msun) form in-situ via gravitational instabilities.
However, the galactic winds are critical for their subsequent evolution. The
giant clumps we obtain are short-lived and are disrupted by wind-driven mass
loss. They do not virialise or migrate to the galaxy centers as suggested in
recent work neglecting strong winds. By phenomenologically implementing the
winds that are observed from high-redshift galaxies and in particular from
individual clumps, our simulations reproduce well new observational constraints
on clump kinematics and clump ages. In particular, the observation that older
clumps appear closer to their galaxy centers is reproduced in our simulations,
as a result of inside-out formation of the disks rather than inward clump
migration.
