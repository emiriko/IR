Our understanding of the Universe today includes overwhelming observational
evidence for the existence of an elusive form of matter that is generally
referred to as dark. Although many theories have been developed to describe its
nature, very little is actually known about its properties. Since its launch in
2008, the Large Area Telescope, onboard the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope,
has detected by far the greatest number ever of gamma rays, in the 20MeV 300GeV
energy range and electrons + positrons in the 7 GeV- 1 TeV range. This
impressive statistics allows one to perform a very sensitive indirect
experimental search for dark matter. I will present the latest results on these
searches.
