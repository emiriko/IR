We study an inflationary scenario in supergravity model with a gauge kinetic
function. We find exact anisotropic power-law inflationary solutions when both
the potential function for an inflaton and the gauge kinetic function are
exponential type. The dynamical system analysis tells us that the anisotropic
power-law inflation is an attractor for a large parameter region.
