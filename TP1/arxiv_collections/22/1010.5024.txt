We establish global existence and uniqueness theorems for the two-dimensional
non-diffusive Boussinesq system with viscosity only in the horizontal
direction, which arises in Ocean dynamics. This work improves the global
well-posedness results established recently by R. Danchin and M. Paicu for the
Boussinesq system with anisotropic viscosity and zero diffusion. Although we
follow some of their ideas, in proving the uniqueness result, we have used an
alternative approach by writing the transported temperature (density) as
$\theta = \Delta\xi$ and adapting the techniques of V. Yudovich for the 2D
incompressible Euler equations. This new idea allows us to establish uniqueness
results with fewer assumptions on the initial data for the transported quantity
$\theta$. Furthermore, this new technique allows us to establish uniqueness
results without having to resort to the paraproduct calculus of J. Bony.
  We also propose an inviscid $\alpha$-regularization for the two-dimensional
inviscid, non-diffusive Boussinesq system of equations, which we call the
Boussinesq-Voigt equations. Global regularity of this system is established.
Moreover, we establish the convergence of solutions of the Boussinesq-Voigt
model to the corresponding solutions of the two-dimensional Boussinesq system
of equations for inviscid flow without heat (density) diffusion on the interval
of existence of the latter. Furthermore, we derive a criterion for finite-time
blow-up of the solutions to the inviscid, non-diffusive 2D Boussinesq system
based on this inviscid Voigt regularization. Finally, we propose a
Voigt-$\alpha$ regularization for the inviscid 3D Boussinesq equations with
diffusion, and prove its global well-posedness. It is worth mentioning that our
results are also valid in the presence of the $\beta$-plane approximation of
the Coriolis force.
