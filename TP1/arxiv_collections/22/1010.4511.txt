We study the expected variability patterns of blazars within the two-zone
acceleration model putting special emphasis on flare shapes and spectral lags.
We solve semi-analytically the kinetic equations which describe the particle
evolution in the acceleration and radiation zone. We then perturb the solutions
by introducing Lorentzian variations in its key parameters and examine the
flaring behavior of the system. We apply the above to the X-ray observations of
blazar 1ES 1218+304 which exhibited a hard lag behavior during a flaring
episode and discuss possibilities of producing it within the context of our
model. The steady-state radio to X-rays emission of 1ES 1218+304 can be
reproduced with parameters which lie well within the ones generally accepted
from blazar modeling. Additionally, we find that the best way to explain its
flaring behavior is by varying the rate of particles injected in the
acceleration zone.
