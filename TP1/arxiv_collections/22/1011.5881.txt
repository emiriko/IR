It is currently believed that the Standard Model is an effective low energy
theory which in principle may contain higher dimensional non-renormalizable
operators. These operators may modify the standard model Higgs potential in
many ways, one of which being the appearance of a second vacuum. For a wide
range of parameters, this new vacuum becomes the true vacuum. It is then
assumed that our universe is currently sitting in the false vacuum. Thus the
usual second-order electroweak phase transition at early times will be followed
by a second, first-order phase transition. In cosmology, a first-order phase
transition is associated with the production of gravity waves. In this paper we
present an analysis of the production of gravitational waves during such a
second electroweak phase transition. We find that, for one certain range of
parameters, the stochastic background of gravitational waves generated by
bubble nucleation and collision have an amplitude which is estimated to be of
order $\Omega_{GW}h^2\sim10^{-11}$ at $f=3\times 10^{-4}$Hz, which is within
reach of the planned sensitivity of LISA. For another range of parameters, we
find that the amplitude is estimated o be of order $\Omega_{GW}h^2\sim10^{-25}$
around $f=10^3$Hz, which is within reach of LIGO. Hence, it is possible to
detect gravity waves from such a phase transition at two different detectors,
with completely different amplitude and frequency ranges.
