Recently the D{\O} Collaboration reported an observation of like-sign charge
asymmetry (CA), which is about $3.2 \sigma$ deviation from the standard model
(SM) prediction. Inspired by the observation we investigate the scalar
unparticle effects, under the color charge of $SU(3)_c$ symmetry, in the CP
violation in neutral B meson oscillations as well as the dispersive and
absorptive parts of $\bar B_q\leftrightarrow B_q$ transition, which can be
related to the CA directly. In order to illustrate the peculiar properties of
unparticle, our analysis is carried out in two scenarios for the right-handed
section: (I) $\lambda_R=\lambda_L$ and $U_D^R=U_D^L$, where $\lambda_{L,R}$ and
$U_D^{L,R}$ are the couplings and flavor mixing matrix of left- and
right-handed section, respectively; (II) $\lambda_R >> \lambda_L$ and $U_D^R$
is completely a free parameter. In scenario I we found that the wrong- and
like-sign CA cannot be changed significantly for a SM-like CP violating source
because of the strong constraint of $\Delta m_{B_d}$. Contrarily, in scenario
II we can figure out the parameter space in which the CA can be enhanced to the
value observed by D{\O} with the constraint of $\Delta m_{B_s}$ due to the
enhancement of $\Gamma^s_{12}$. In the parameter space we obtained, the
correlation between $\Delta\Gamma^s$ and $\phi_s$ is consistent with the
current CDF and D{\O} results.
