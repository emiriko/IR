In this paper we consider the problem of high accuracy localization of mobile
nodes in a multipath-rich environment where sub-meter accuracies are required.
We employ a peer to peer framework where the vehicles/nodes can get pairwise
multipath-degraded ranging estimates in local neighborhoods together with a
fixed number of anchor nodes. The challenge is to overcome the
multipath-barrier with redundancy in order to provide the desired accuracies
especially under severe multipath conditions when the fraction of received
signals corrupted by multipath is dominating. We invoke a message passing
analytical framework based on particle filtering and reveal its high accuracy
localization promise through simulations.
