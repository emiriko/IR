In Higgsless models, new vector resonances appear to restore the unitarity of
the W_L W_L scattering amplitude without the Higgs boson. In the ideal
delocalized three site Higgsless model, one of large prodcution cross section
of the neutral vector resonance (Z') at the Large Hadron Collider is the
W-associated production, pp \to Z'W \to WWW. Although the dileptonic decay
channnel, l\nu l'\nu 'jj, is experimentally clean to search for the Z' signals,
it is difficult to reconstruct the Z' invariant mass due to the two neutrinos
in the final state. We study collider signatures of Z' using the
M_{T2}-Assisted On-Shell (MAOS) reconstruction of the missing neutrino momenta.
We show the prospect of the Z' mass determination in the channel, l\nu l'\nu
'jj, at the Large Hadron Collider.
