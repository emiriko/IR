The question of the relative size of two independent penguin amplitudes is
studied using the data on the B^+ to pi^+ K^*0, and B^+ to K^+ \bar{K}^*0
decays. Our discussion involves a Regge-phenomenology-based estimate of SU(3)
breaking in the final quark-pair-creating hadronization process. The results
are in agreement with earlier estimates of the relative size of the two
penguins obtained from B^+ to pi^+ K^0, K^+ \bar{K}^0.
