We study the growth of a population of bacteria in a dynamical hostile
environment corresponding to the immune system of the colonised organism. The
immune cells evolve as subcritical open clusters of oriented percolation and
are perpetually reinforced by an immigration process, while the bacteria try to
grow as a supercritical oriented percolation in the remaining empty space. For
appropriate values of the parameters, we prove that the population of bacteria
grows linearly. In this perspective, we build general tools to study dependent
percolation models issued from renormalization processes.
