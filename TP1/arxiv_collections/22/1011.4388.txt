We construct a connected, irreducible component of the moduli space of
minimal surfaces of general type with $p_g=q=2$ and $K^2=5$, which contains
both examples given by Chen-Hacon and the first author. This component is
generically smooth of dimension 4, and all its points parametrize surfaces
whose Albanese map is a generically finite triple cover.
