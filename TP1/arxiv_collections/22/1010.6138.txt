We propose an efficient scheme for the realization of quantum information
transfer and entanglement with nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers coupled to a
high-Q whispering-gallery mode (WGM) microresonator. We show that, based on the
effective dipole-dipole interaction between the NV centers mediated by the WGM,
quantum information can be transferred between the NV centers through Raman
transitions combined with laser fields. This protocol may open up promising
possibilities for quantum communications with the solid state cavity QED
system.
