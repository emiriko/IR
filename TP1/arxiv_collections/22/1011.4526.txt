We use molecular dynamics simulations to study the driven phases of particles
such as vortices or colloids moving over a decagonal quasiperiodic substrate.
In the regime where the pinned states have quasicrystalline ordering, the
driven phases can order into moving square or smectic states, or into states
with aligned rows of both square and triangular tiling which we term
dynamically induced Archimedean-like tiling. We show that when the angle of the
drive is varied with respect to the substrate, directional locking effects
occur where the particle motion locks to certain angles. It is at these locking
angles that the dynamically induced Archimedean tiling appears. We also
demonstrate that the different dynamical orderings and locking phases show
pronounced changes as a function of filling fraction.
