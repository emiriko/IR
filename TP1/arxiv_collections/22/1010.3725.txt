We study the temperature dependence of bottomonium for temperatures in the
range $0.4 T_c < T < 2.1 T_c$, using nonrelativistic dynamics for the bottom
quark and full relativistic lattice QCD simulations for $N_f=2$ light flavors
on a highly anisotropic lattice. We find that the $\Upsilon$ is insensitive to
the temperature in this range, while the $\chi_b$ propagators show a crossover
from the exponential decay characterizing the hadronic phase to a power-law
behaviour consistent with nearly-free dynamics at $T \simeq 2 T_c$.
