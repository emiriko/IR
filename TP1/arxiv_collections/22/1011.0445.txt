When stars like our Sun are young they rotate rapidly and are very
magnetically active. We explore dynamo action in rapidly rotating suns with the
3-D MHD anelastic spherical harmonic (ASH) code. The magnetic fields built in
these dynamos are organized on global-scales into wreath-like structures that
span the convection zone. Wreath-building dynamos can undergo quasi-cyclic
reversals of polarity and such behavior is common in the parameter space we
have been able to explore. These dynamos do not appear to require tachoclines
to achieve their spatial or temporal organization. Wreath-building dynamos are
present to some degree at all rotation rates, but are most evident in the more
rapidly rotating simulations.
