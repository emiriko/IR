We discuss how the curvature and the strain density of the atomic lattice
generate the quantization of graphene sheets as well as the dynamics of
geometric quasiparticles propagating along the constant curvature/strain
levels. The internal kinetic momentum of Riemannian oriented surface (a vector
field preserving the Gaussian curvature and the area) is determined.
