We present a set of photoionization models that reproduce simultaneously the
observed optical and mid-infrared spatial distribution of the HII region NGC595
in the disk of M33 using the code CLOUDY. Both optical (PMAS-Integral Field
Spectroscopy) and mid-infrared (8 mi and 24 mi bands from Spitzer) data provide
enough spatial resolution to model in a novel approach the inner structure of
the HII region. We define a set of elliptical annular regions around the
central ionizing cluster with an uniformity in their observed properties and
consider each annulus as an independent thin shell structure. For the first
time our models fit the relative surface brightness profiles in both the
optical (Halpha, [OII], [OIII]) and the mid-infrared emissions (8 mi and 24
mi), under the assumption of a uniform metallicity (12+log(O/H) = 8.45; Esteban
et al. 2009) and an age for the stellar cluster of 4.5 Myr (Malumuth et al.
1996). Our models also reproduce the observed uniformity of the R23 parameter
and the increase of the [OII]/[OIII] ratio due to the decrease of the
ionization parameter. The variation of the Halpha profile is explained in terms
of the differences of the occupied volume (the product of filling factor and
total volume of the shell) in a matter-bounded geometry, which also allows to
reproduce the observed pattern of the extinction. The 8 mi/24 mi ratio is low
(ranging between 0.04 and 0.4) because it is dominated by the surviving of
small dust grains in the HII region, while the PAHs emit more weakly because
they cannot be formed in these thin HII gas shells. The ratio is also well
fitted in our models by assuming a dust-to-gas ratio in each annulus compatible
with the integrated estimate for the whole HII region after the 70 mi, and 160
mi Spitzer observations.
