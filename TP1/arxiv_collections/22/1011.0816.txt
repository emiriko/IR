We report an analysis of the interstellar $\gamma$-ray emission in the third
Galactic quadrant measured by the {Fermi} Large Area Telescope. The window
encompassing the Galactic plane from longitude $210\arcdeg$ to $250\arcdeg$ has
kinematically well-defined segments of the Local and the Perseus arms, suitable
to study the cosmic-ray densities across the outer Galaxy. We measure no large
gradient with Galactocentric distance of the $\gamma$-ray emissivities per
interstellar H atom over the regions sampled in this study. The gradient
depends, however, on the optical depth correction applied to derive the \HI\
column densities. No significant variations are found in the interstellar
spectra in the outer Galaxy, indicating similar shapes of the cosmic-ray
spectrum up to the Perseus arm for particles with GeV to tens of GeV energies.
The emissivity as a function of Galactocentric radius does not show a large
enhancement in the spiral arms with respect to the interarm region. The
measured emissivity gradient is flatter than expectations based on a cosmic-ray
propagation model using the radial distribution of supernova remnants and
uniform diffusion properties. In this context, observations require a larger
halo size and/or a flatter CR source distribution than usually assumed. The
molecular mass calibrating ratio, $X_{\rm CO} = N({\rm H_{2}})/W_{\rm CO}$, is
found to be $(2.08 \pm 0.11) \times 10^{20} {\rm cm^{-2} (K km s^{-1})^{-1}}$
in the Local-arm clouds and is not significantly sensitive to the choice of
\HI\ spin temperature. No significant variations are found for clouds in the
interarm region.
