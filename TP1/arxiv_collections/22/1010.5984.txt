Electromagnetic emission in the form of photons or dileptons provide
important information on the onset and evolution of a heavy ion collision at
ultrarelativistic energies. We briefly summarize the theoretical assessments of
the thermalized electromagnetic emissivities from a hot partonic and hadronic
medium, and compare them to current experiments at collider energies.
