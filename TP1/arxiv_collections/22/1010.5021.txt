Recombination of photogenerated charge carriers in polymer bulk
heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells reduces the short circuit current (Jsc) and
the fill factor (FF). Identifying the mechanism of recombination is, therefore,
fundamentally important for increasing the power conversion efficiency. Light
intensity and temperature dependent current-voltage measurements on polymer BHJ
cells made from a variety of different semiconducting polymers and fullerenes
show that the recombination kinetics are voltage dependent and evolve from
first order recombination at short circuit to bimolecular recombination at open
circuit as a result of increasing the voltage-dependent charge carrier density
in the cell. The "missing 0.3V" inferred from comparison of the band gaps of
the bulk heterojunction materials and the measured open circuit voltage at room
temperature results from the temperature dependence of the quasi-Fermi-levels
in the polymer and fullerene domains - a conclusion based upon the fundamental
statistics of Fermions.
