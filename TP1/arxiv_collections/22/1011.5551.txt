We survey the theory of local models of Shimura varieties. In particular, we
discuss their definition and illustrate it by examples. We give an overview of
the results on their geometry and combinatorics obtained in the last 15 years.
We also exhibit their connections to other classes of algebraic varieties such
as nilpotent orbit closures, affine Schubert varieties, quiver Grassmannians
and wonderful completions of symmetric spaces.
