We calculate the branching ratios of the $K^+ \to \pi^0 l^+ \nu_l\gamma (l =
e, \mu)$ decays, and the T-odd triple momenta correlations
$\xi=\vec{q}\cdot[\vec{p}_l \times \vec{p}_\pi]/M^3_K$, due to the
electromagnetic final state interaction, in these processes. The contributions
on the order of $\omega^{-1}$ and $\omega^0$ to the corresponding amplitudes
are treated exactly. For the branching ratios, the corrections on the order of
$\omega$ are estimated and demonstrated to be small. We compare the results
with those of other authors. In some cases our results differ considerably from
the previous ones.
