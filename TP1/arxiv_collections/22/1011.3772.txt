A search for a diffuse flux of astrophysical muon neutrinos, using data
collected by the ANTARES neutrino telescope is presented. A $(0.83\times 2\pi)$
sr sky was monitored for a total of 334 days of equivalent live time. The
searched signal corresponds to an excess of events, produced by astrophysical
sources, over the expected atmospheric neutrino background. The observed number
of events is found compatible with the background expectation. Assuming an
$E^{-2}$ flux spectrum, a 90% c.l. upper limit on the diffuse $\nu_\mu$ flux of
$E^2\Phi_{90%} = 5.3 \times 10^{-8} \ \mathrm{GeV\ cm^{-2}\ s^{-1}\ sr^{-1}} $
in the energy range 20 TeV - 2.5 PeV is obtained. Other signal models with
different energy spectra are also tested and some rejected.
