Physico-mechanical properties of polymers in solid state, in particular
conditions of their structural transformations, are substantially defined by
existence and mobility of elementary nonlinear excitations. The localized
oscillatory excitations (breathers) which have been revealed in crystalline PE
are important for thermodynamic studies. In the given work the breathers in
more complex crystalline of helix macromolecules are analytically investigated
for the first time. We show that introduction of adequate variables allows to
construct the continuum model describing spatially localized excitations with
internal degree of freedom. Characteristic parameters of breathers and
conditions of their mobility are defined.
