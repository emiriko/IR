The problem of buckling and coiling of jets of viscous, Newtonian liquids has
received a substantial level of attention over the past two decades, both from
experimental and theoretical points of view. Nevertheless, many industrial
fluids and consumer products are non-Newtonian, and their rheological
properties affect their flow behavior. The present work aims at studying the
dynamics of cylindrical jets of a viscoelastic, shear-thinning solution of
cetylpyridinium salt (CPyCl). In concentrated solutions, CPyCl surfactant
molecules have been shown to assemble in long wormlike micellar structures,
which gives the fluid its non-Newtonian properties. Jets of this fluid show
novel features compared to their Newtonian counterparts, including a type of
motion, in which the jet folds back and forth on itself in a fashion similar to
sheets of viscous fluids, instead of coiling around the vertical axis as
cylindrical Newtonian jets do. Another novel feature of CPyCl micellar fluid
jets is a widening of the jet above the plate reminiscent of the die-swell
phenomenon that we call \emph{reverse swell}. We propose physical mechanisms
for both folding and reverse swell, and compare theoretical predictions to
experimental measurements. In addition, we systematically explore different
flow regimes in the parameter space of the height of fall and flow rate and
compare regime maps of a CPyCl micellar solution and a Newtonian silicone oil.
