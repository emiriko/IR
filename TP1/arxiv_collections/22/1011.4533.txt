We analyze how the radiation pressure interaction between a mechanical
element and an intensely driven optical cavity mode can be exploited for
generating squeezed light. We study in particular how the performance of the
optomechanical device can be improved when a homodyne-based feedback loop is
added to control the motion of the mechanical element of the system. We show
that, when driving the cavity at resonance, an appropriate proportional
feedback control is able to improve the generation of ponderomotive squeezing,
which should be detectable with state-of-the-art apparatuses.
