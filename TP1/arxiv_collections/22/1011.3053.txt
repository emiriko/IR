Memory effects are ubiquitous in nature and are particularly relevant at the
nanoscale where the dynamical properties of electrons and ions strongly depend
on the history of the system, at least within certain time scales. We review
here the memory properties of various materials and systems which appear most
strikingly in their non-trivial time-dependent resistive, capacitative and
inductive characteristics. We describe these characteristics within the
framework of memristors, memcapacitors and meminductors, namely memory circuit
elements whose properties depend on the history and state of the system. We
examine basic issues related to such systems and critically report on both
theoretical and experimental progress in understanding their functionalities.
We also discuss possible applications of memory effects in various areas of
science and technology ranging from digital to analog electronics,
biologically-inspired circuits, and learning. We finally discuss future
research opportunities in the field.
