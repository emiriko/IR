We give an interpretation of the temperature in de Sitter universe in terms
of a dynamical Unruh effect associated with the Hubble sphere. As with the
quantum noise perceived by a uniformly accelerated observer in static
space-times, observers endowed with a proper motion can in principle detect the
effect. In particular, we study a "Kodama observer" as a two-field Unruh
detector for which we show the effect is approximately thermal. We also
estimate the back-reaction of the emitted radiation and find trajectories
associated with the Kodama vector fields are stable.
