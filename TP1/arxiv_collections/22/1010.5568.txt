We outline the design of a framework for modelling cloud computing
systems.The approach is based on a declarative programming model which takes
the form of a lambda-calculus enriched with suitable mechanisms to express and
enforce application-level security policies governing usages of resources
available in the clouds. We will focus on the server side of cloud systems, by
adopting a pro-active approach, where explicit security policies regulate
server's behaviour.
