We study recent Intermediate Luminosity Optical Transients (ILOTs) and major
eruptions of Luminous Blue Variables (LBVs), and strengthen claims for a
similar mechanism powering both. This process is a short duration release of
gravitational energy in a binary system. In some ILOTs a merger occurs and one
of the stars does not survive the transient event, e.g., V838 Mon and V1309
Sco. In some transient events a rapid and short mass transfer process takes
place and the two stars survive the transient event, e.g., the Great Eruption
of Eta Carinae. We study new ILOTs and reanalyze known ones in light of new
observations and models. We reach our conclusion by analyzing these ILOTs using
the Energy-Time Diagram (ETD) where we plot the total energy of the eruption
against its eruption timescale. ILOTs and major LBV eruptions occupy the
Optical Transient Stripe (OTS) in the ETD. The upper boundary of the stripe is
explained by our proposed model where a main sequence (or a slightly off-main
sequence) star accretes at a very high rate (<~ 1 M_\odot yr^{-1}) from a
companion. We identify one LBV, NGC 3432 OT, with two eruptions; one with weak
total energy and the other with large total energy. It bridges the regions of
the ILOTs and LBVs in the OTS. We further study the ILOT M85 OT2006 and show
that it cannot be a nova, even not an extreme one. We build a model where ILOTs
can become optically thin in a timescale of few years and the inflated envelope
collapses into an accretion disk around the star. Such an ILOT will evolve
blue-ward after few years.
