Recent observations have revealed two new classes of planetary orbits.
Rossiter- Mclaughlin (RM) measurements have revealed hot Jupiters in
high-obliquity orbits. In addition, direct-imaging has discovered giant planets
at large (~ 100 AU) separations via direct-imaging technique. Simple-minded
disk-migration scenarios are inconsistent with the high-inclination (and even
retrograde) orbits as seen in recent RM measurements. Furthermore, forming
giant planets at large semi-major axis (a) may be challenging in the
core-accretion paradigm. We perform many N-body simulations to explore the two
above-mentioned orbital architectures. Planet-planet scattering in a
multi-planet system can naturally excite orbital inclinations. Planets can also
get scattered to large distances. Large-a planetary orbits created from
planet-planet scattering are expected to have high eccentricities (e).
Theoretical models predict that the observed long-period planets, such as
Fomalhaut-b have moderate e \approx 0.3. Interestingly, these are also in
systems with disks. We find that if a massive-enough outer disk is present, a
scattered planet may be circularized at large a via dynamical friction from the
disk and repeated scattering of the disk particles.
