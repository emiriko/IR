Batle et al. [Phys. Rev. A {\bf 72}, 032337 (2005)] and Borr\'{a}s et al.
[Phys. Rev. A {\bf 74}, 022326 (2006)] studied the connection between
entanglement and speed of quantum evolution for certain low-dimensional
bipartite quantum states. However, their studies did not cover all possible
cases. And the relation between entanglement and the maximum possible quantum
evolution speed for these uncovered cases can very different from the ones that
they have studied.
