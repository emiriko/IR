Spin echo techniques are essential for achieving long coherence times in
solid-state quantum memories for light because of inhomogeneous broadening of
the spin transitions. It has been suggested that unrealistic levels of
precision for the radio frequency control pulses would be necessary for
successful decoherence control at the quantum level. Here we study the effects
of pulse imperfections in detail, using both a semi-classical and a fully
quantum-mechanical approach. Our results show that high efficiencies and low
noise-to-signal ratios can be achieved for the quantum memories in the
single-photon regime for realistic levels of control pulse precision. We also
analyze errors due to imperfect initial state preparation (optical pumping),
showing that they are likely to be more important than control pulse errors in
many practical circumstances. These results are crucial for future developments
of solid-state quantum memories.
