It is well-known that one-dimensional isentropic gas dynamics has two
elementary waves, i.e., shock wave and rarefaction wave. Among the two waves,
only the rarefaction wave can be connected with vacuum. Given a rarefaction
wave with one-side vacuum state to the compressible Euler equations, we can
construct a sequence of solutions to one-dimensional compressible isentropic
Navier-Stokes equations which converge to the above rarefaction wave with
vacuum as the viscosity tends to zero. Moreover, the uniform convergence rate
is obtained. The proof consists of a scaling argument and elementary energy
analysis based on the underlying rarefaction wave structures.
