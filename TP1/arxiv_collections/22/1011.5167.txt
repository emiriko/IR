This article describes a technique of using a trigonometric function and
combinatorial calculations to code or transform any finite sequence of binary
numbers (0s and 1s) of any length to a unique set of three Real numbers. In
reverse, these three Real numbers can be used independently to reconstruct the
original Binary sequence precisely. The main principles of this technique are
then applied in a proposal for a highly efficient model for Lossless Data
Compression.
