With the aim of uncovering viable regions of parameter space in deflected
mirage mediation (DMM) models of supersymmetry breaking, we study the landscape
of particle mass hierarchies for the lightest four non-Standard Model states
for DMM models and compare the results to that of minimal
supergravity/constrained MSSM (mSUGRA/CMSSM) models, building on previous
studies of Feldman, Liu, and Nath. Deflected mirage mediation is a
string-motivated scenario in which the soft terms include comparable
contributions from gravity mediation, gauge mediation, and anomaly mediation.
DMM allows a wide variety of phenomenologically preferred models with light
charginos and neutralinos, including novel patterns in which the heavy Higgs
particles are lighter than the lightest superpartner. We use this analysis to
motivate two DMM benchmark points to be used for more detailed collider
studies. One model point has a higgsino-dominated lightest superpartner and a
compressed yet heavy spectrum, while the other has a stau NLSP and similar
features to mSUGRA/CMSSM models, but with a slightly less stretched spectrum.
