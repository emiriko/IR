Incompressible MHD turbulence is investigated under the presence of a uniform
magnetic field $\bb0$. Such a situation is described in the correlation space
by a divergence relation which expresses the statistical conservation of the
Els\"asser energy flux through the inertial range. The ansatz is made that the
development of anisotropy, observed when $B_0$ is strong enough, implies a
foliation of space correlation. A direct consequence is the possibility to
derive a vectorial law for third-order Els\"asser moments which is parametrized
by the intensity of anisotropy. We use the so-called critical balance
assumption to fix this parameter and find a unique expression.
