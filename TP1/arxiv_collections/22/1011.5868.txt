We have measured the size effect in nonlocal Gilbert relaxation rate in
FM(t$_{FM}$) / Cu (5nm) [/ Pt (2nm)] / Al(2nm) heterostructures, FM = \{
Ni$_{81}$Fe$_{19}$, Co$_{60}$Fe$_{20}$B$_{20}$, pure Co\}. Common behavior is
observed for three FM layers, where the additional relaxation obeys both a
strict inverse power law dependence $\Delta G =K \:t^{n}$,
$n=-\textrm{1.04}\pm\textrm{0.06}$ and a similar magnitude
$K=\textrm{224}\pm\textrm{40 Mhz}\cdot\textrm{nm}$. As the tested FM layers
span an order of magnitude in spin diffusion length $\lambda_{SDL}$, the
results are in support of spin diffusion, rather than nonlocal resistivity, as
the origin of the effect.
