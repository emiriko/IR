We investigate multi-band Hubbard models for the three iron 3$d$-$t_{2g}$
bands and the two iron 3$d$-$e_g$ bands in ${\rm La O Fe As}$ by means of the
Gutzwiller variational theory. Our analysis of the paramagnetic ground state
shows that neither Hartree--Fock mean-field theories nor effective spin models
describe these systems adequately. In contrast to Hartree--Fock-type
approaches, the Gutzwiller theory predicts that antiferromagnetic order
requires substantial values of the local Hund's-rule exchange interaction. For
the three-band model, the antiferromagnetic moment fits experimental data for a
broad range of interaction parameters. However, for the more appropriate
five-band model, the iron $e_g$ electrons polarize the $t_{2g}$ electrons and
they substantially contribute to the ordered moment.
