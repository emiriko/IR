In this paper, we derive a model from Maxwell equations for the magnetic
resonance of split-ring resonators. Using this model we revisit the scaling of
split-ring resonators. Inspired by our model, we propose a new type of
split-hybrid metal-dielectric ring resonator, of which the ring is made
composed of moderately high index dielectric material (e.g. SiC, TiO2, ZnS)
(for the major portion), while and metal (e.g. Ag) fills the gap. Such a new
magnetic metamaterial is able to overcome the saturation problem of split-ring
resonatorssaturation-free and therefore is able to operate at short wavelength
down to ultraviolet range.
