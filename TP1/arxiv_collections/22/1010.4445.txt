The very metal-poor star HE 0338-3945 shows a double-enhanced pattern of the
neutron-capture elements. The study to this sample could make people gain a
better understanding of s- and r-process nucleosynthesis at low metallicity.
Using a parametric model,we find that the abundance pattern of the
neutron-capture elements could be best explained by a binary system formed in a
molecular cloud, which had been polluted by r-process material. The observed
abundance pattern of C and N can be explained by an AGB model(Karakas &
Lattanzio 2007), . Combing with the parameters obtained from Cui & Zhang
(2006), we suggest that the initial mass of the AGB companion is most likely to
be about 2.5Msun, which excludes the possibility of forming a type-1.5
supernova. By comparing with the observational abundance pattern of CS
22892-052, we find that the dominating production of O should accompany with
the production of the heavy r-process elements of r+s stars. Similar to r-II
stars, the heavy r-process elements are not produced in conjunction with all
the light elements from Na to Fe group. The abundance pattern of the light and
r-process elements for HE 0338-3945 is very close to the pattern of the r-II
star CS 22892-052. So, we suggest that this star HE 0338-3945 should be a
special r-II star.
