We present a complete classification of complex projective surfaces $X$ with
nontrivial self-maps (i.e. surjective morphisms $f:X\rightarrow X$ which are
not isomorphisms) of any given degree. The starting point of our classification
are results contained in Fujimoto and Nakayama that provide a list of surfaces
that admit at least one nontrivial self-map. We then proceed by a case by case
analysis that blends geometrical and arithmetical arguments in order to exclude
that certain prime numbers appear as degrees of nontrivial self-maps of certain
surfaces.
