We have calculated the half-lives for $^{56}$Ni$^{\ast}$ within PCM and UFM
for clusters $\ge ^{16}$O. For PCM, the order of magnitude of cluster decay
constants for different density parameters is nearly same, except for SM
parameters. Similar trends are observed for UFM. The percentage variation in
the half-lives for the PCM lies within $\pm$5% excluding SM parameters, whereas
including SM parameters it lies within $\pm$13%. In the case of UFM, half-lives
lie within $\pm$1.5% for all density parameters except of SM. For SM parameters
these variations lie within $\pm$9%.
