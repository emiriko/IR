The Schwarzschild's black hole dynamics in presence of gravity is described
on using the thermodynamic equations of state for contractile materials. Its
entropy and temperature, obtained by using classical principles, reproduce the
results derived from quantum field theories and statistical mechanics. The
given results show that, by using the gravitational dynamics to reproduce the
thermodynamic equation TdS/dx = Fgravity, there is no way to establish the
entropic origin of gravity, because the results can be seen the other way
around.
