We present a study of the structure and dynamics of the dense gas surrounding
the HH 211-mm source, using VLA observations of the ammonia (1,1) and (2,2)
inversion transitions. We find the envelope around this Class 0 source has an
elongated geometry, extending about 104 AU in the direction perpendicular to
the well-known HH 211 jet, and exhibits a velocity distribution consistent with
rotation along the major axis. Our VLA observations indicate that the envelope
is mostly in virial equilibrium. However, comparing our data with results from
previous studies it appears that the gas within approximately 0.005 pc of the
central protostar is undergoing dynamical collapse. The size of this collapsing
radius may constrain the amount of mass that can eventually infall into the
forming star. We also find that the envelope is mostly internally heated, most
probably by radiation from the central protostar. In addition, we detect
evidence of outflow-envelope interaction in the ammonia data. These include a
velocity gradient in the dense gas along the outflow axis and significant line
broadening that is spatially correlated with the jet and it might be the result
of outflow-induced turbulence in the envelope.
