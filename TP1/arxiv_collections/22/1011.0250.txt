The non-invasive pulse-oximeter is a crucial parameter in continuous
monitoring systems. It plays a vital role from admission of the patient to
surgeries with general anaesthesia. The paper proposes the application of
wavelet transform to delineate the raw plethysmograph signals obtained from
basic portable and mobile-powered electronic hardware. The paper primarily
focuses on finding peaks and baseline from noisy infrared and red waveforms
which are responsible for calculating heart-rate and oxygen saturation
percentages.
