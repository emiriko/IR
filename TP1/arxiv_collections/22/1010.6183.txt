The Poincare-covariant Faddeev equation and its solution in rainbow-ladder
truncation, i.e., with a generalized gluon exchange as irreducible
two-particle-interaction, is presented. The covariant decomposition of baryon
amplitudes, representing relativistic three-quark states, is discussed and
explicitly given for the Delta-baryon. The calculated Delta mass compares
favourably with the experimental one.
