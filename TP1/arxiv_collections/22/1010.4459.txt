We propose an exactly solvable simplified statistical mechanical model for
the thermodynamics of beta-amyloid aggregation, generalizing a well-studied
model for protein folding. The monomer concentration is explicitly taken into
account as well as a non trivial dependence on the microscopic degrees of
freedom of the single peptide chain, both in the alpha-helix folded isolated
state and in the fibrillar one. The phase diagram of the model is studied and
compared to the outcome of fibril formation experiments which is qualitatively
reproduced.
