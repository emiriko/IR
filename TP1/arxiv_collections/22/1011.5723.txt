An AH (affine hypersurface) structure is a pair comprising a projective
equivalence class of torsion-free connections and a conformal structure
satisfying a compatibility condition which is automatic in two dimensions. They
generalize Weyl structures, and a pair of AH structures is induced on a
co-oriented non-degenerate immersed hypersurface in flat affine space. The
author has defined for AH structures Einstein equations, which specialize on
the one hand to the usual Einstein Weyl equations and, on the other hand, to
the equations for affine hyperspheres. Here these equations are solved for
Riemannian signature AH structures on compact orientable surfaces, the
deformation spaces of solutions are described, and some aspects of the geometry
of these structures are related. Every such structure is either Einstein Weyl
(in the sense defined for surfaces by Calderbank) or is determined by a pair
comprising a conformal structure and a cubic holomorphic differential, and so
by a convex flat real projective structure. In the latter case it can be
identified with a solution of the Abelian vortex equations on an appropriate
power of the canonical bundle. On the cone over a surface of genus at least two
carrying an Einstein AH structure there are Monge-Amp\`ere metrics of
Lorentzian and Riemannian signature and a Riemannian Einstein K\"ahler affine
metric. A mean curvature zero spacelike immersed Lagrangian submanifold of a
para-K\"ahler four-manifold with constant para-holomorphic sectional curvature
inherits an Einstein AH structure, and this is used to deduce some restrictions
on such immersions.
