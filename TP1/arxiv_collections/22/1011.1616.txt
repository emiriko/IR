Sculptured copper thin films were deposited on glass substrates, using
different deposition rates. The nano-structure and morphology of the films were
obtained, using X-ray diffraction (XRD), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and
scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Their optical properties were measured by
spectrophotometry in the spectral range of 340-850 nm. The Scot package was
used for modeling the film structure and fitting the calculated optical
transmittance results to the experimental data and obtaining, both real and
imaginary refractive indices, film thickness and fraction of metal inclusion in
the film structure.
