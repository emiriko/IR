We show that cold dark matter particles interacting through a Yukawa
potential could naturally explain the recently observed cores in dwarf galaxies
without affecting the dynamics of objects with a much larger velocity
dispersion, such as clusters of galaxies. The velocity dependence of the
associated cross-section as well as the possible exothermic nature of the
interaction alleviates earlier concerns about strongly interacting dark matter.
Dark matter evaporation in low-mass objects might explain the observed deficit
of satellite galaxies in the Milky Way halo and have important implications for
the first galaxies and reionization.
