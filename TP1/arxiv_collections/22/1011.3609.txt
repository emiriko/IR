In this paper, using an exponential function of intensity of radiation field,
two new classes of nonlinear coherent states will be constructed. For the first
class, we choose the nonlinearity function as f(n) = exp(\beta n), where \beta
characterizes the strength of the nonlinearity of the quantum system. We show
that, the corresponding \beta-states possess a collection of non-classicality
features, only for the particular values of \beta and z. But, interestingly
there exists finite (threshold) values of \beta, for which all of the
non-classicality signs will disappear, in appropriate regions around the origin
of the complex plane (z < |Z|). It is then illustrated that, using this
threshold (or greater) value of \beta, the corresponding \beta-states behave
very similar to canonical coherent states, as the most classical quantum
states, in approximately whole of the space. In the continuation, we motivate
to find another class of nonlinear coherent states, limited to a unit disk
centered at the origin, looking like the canonical coherent states in behavior,
in exactly the whole range of |z| < 1. This purpose also will be achieved by
considering the nonlinearity function as f(n)= exp(\lambda/n)/\sqrt{n}, where
\lambda is a tunable nonlinearity parameter. The canonical coherent state's
aspects of the corresponding \lambda-states will be refreshed, in particular
cases, working with a threshold (or greater) value of \lambda.
