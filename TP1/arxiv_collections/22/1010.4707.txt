We study the differential equations of lumped-parameter models of spacecraft
thermal control. Firstly, we consider a satellite model consisting of two
isothermal parts (nodes): an outer part that absorbs heat from the environment
as radiation of various types and radiates heat as a black-body, and an inner
part that just dissipates heat at a constant rate. The resulting system of two
nonlinear ordinary differential equations for the satellite's temperatures is
analyzed with various methods, which prove that the temperatures approach a
steady state if the heat input is constant, whereas they approach a limit cycle
if it varies periodically. Secondly, we generalize those methods to study a
many-node thermal model of a spacecraft: this model also has a stable steady
state under constant heat inputs that becomes a limit cycle if the inputs vary
periodically. Finally, we propose new numerical analyses of spacecraft thermal
models based on our results, to complement the analyses normally carried out
with commercial software packages.
