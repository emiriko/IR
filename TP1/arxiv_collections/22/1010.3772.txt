The nucleus-nucleus interaction potential has been studied within the
relativistic mean field theory. The systematics of the relativistic effects
have been investigated by analyzing the relation between the potential and the
bombarding energy as a function of the impact parameter. It is shown that the
potential barriers are noticeably sensitive to the bombarding energy for a
given impact parameter. At large bombarding energies the slope at the potential
edge decreases with the impact parameter. Comparisons with a non-relativistic
treatment shows that relativistic effects cannot be ignored at bombarding
energies around and larger than 100 MeV/nucleon.
