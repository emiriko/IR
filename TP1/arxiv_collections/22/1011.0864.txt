Walking technicolor is a mechanism for electroweak symmetry breaking without
Higgs field. The Higgs mechanism is provided by chiral symmetry breaking in the
technicolor theory. An essential ingredient is the vicinity to an IR fixed
point, which could reconcile technicolor with the electroweak precision tests.
SU(2) gauge theory with two Dirac adjoint fermions has been proposed as a
candidate for walking technicolor. Understanding whether this theory is
confining or IR-conformal is a challenging problem, which can be addressed by
means of numerical simulations. We have pointed out that a clean signal for the
existence of an IR fixed point in this theory can be obtained by comparing the
mesonic and gluonic sectors. We review some technical details of our
calculations. Possible systematic errors are discussed.
