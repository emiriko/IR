An analytical treatment of a propagating wave packet incident on a transient
barrier reveals a counterintuitive quantum mechanical effect in which, for a
particular time interval, the time-varying transmission probability {\it
exceeds} (`superarrival') that for the free propagation of the wave packet. It
is found that the speed with which the information about the barrier
perturbation propagates across the wave packet can exceed the group velocity of
the wave packet. An interesting implication of this effect regarding
information transfer is analyzed by showing one-to-one correspondence between
the strength of the barrier and the magnitude of `superarrival'.
