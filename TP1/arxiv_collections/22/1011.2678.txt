We suggest that three-body chemistry may occur in warm high density gas
evaporating in transient co\textendash desorption events on interstellar ices.
Using a highly idealised computational model we explore the chemical conversion
from simple species of the ice to more complex species containing several heavy
atoms, as a function of density and of adopted three body rate coefficients. We
predict that there is a wide range of densities and rate coefficients in which
a significant chemical conversion may occur. We discuss the implications of
this idea for the astrochemistry of hot cores.
