In this paper we employ Tutte's theory of bridges to derive a decomposition
theorem for binary matroids arising from signed graphs. The proposed
decomposition differs from previous decomposition results on matroids that have
appeared in the literature in the sense that it is not based on $k$-sums, but
rather on the operation of deletion of a cocircuit. Specifically, it is shown
that certain minors resulting from the deletion of a cocircuit of a binary
matroid will be graphic matroids apart from exactly one that will be
signed-graphic, if and only if the matroid is signed-graphic.
