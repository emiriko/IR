In this paper it is considered rule reduct generation problem, based on Rough
Set Theory. Rule Reduct Generation (RG) and Modified Rule Generation (MRG)
algorithms are well-known. Alternative to these algorithms Pruning Algorithm of
Generation A Minimal Set of Rule Reducts, or briefly Pruning Rule Generation
(PRG) algorithm is developed. PRG algorithm uses tree structured data type. PRG
algorithm is compared with RG and MRG algorithms
