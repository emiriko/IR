The lithosphere activity during seismogenic or occurrence of one earthquake
may emit electromagnetic wave which propagate to ionosphere and radiation belt,
then induce disturbance of electric and magnetic field and the precipitation of
high energy charged particles. This paper, based on the data detected by
DEMETER satellite, present the high energy charged particle burst(PB) with 4 to
6 times enhancement over the average value observed about ten days days before
Chile earthquake. The obvious particle burst was also observed in the northern
hemisphere mirror points conjugate of epicenter and no PB events in different
years over the same epicenter region was found. The energy spectra of the PBs
are different from the one averaged within the first three months in 2010. At
the same time, the disturbance of the VLF electric spectrum in ionosphere over
the epicenter detected by the DEMETER satellite are also observed in the same
two orbits. Those observations from energetic PB and VLF electric spectrum
disturbance demonstrates the coupling relation among the electromagnetic wave
emitted by seismic activity, energetic particle and electric field in
ionosphere. We eliminate the possible origination of PB including magnetic
burst and Solar activities. Finally we think the PB is likely to be related to
Chile earthquake and can be taken as the precursor of this earthquake.
