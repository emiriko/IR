Mean motion resonances are a common feature of both our own Solar System and
of extrasolar planetary systems. Bodies can be trapped in resonance when their
orbital semi-major axes change, for instance when they migrate through a
protoplanetary disc. We use a Hamiltonian model to thoroughly investigate the
capture behaviour for first and second order resonances. Using this method, all
resonances of the same order can be described by one equation, with
applications to specific resonances by appropriate scaling. We focus on the
limit where one body is a massless test particle and the other a massive
planet. We quantify how the the probability of capture into a resonance depends
on the relative migration rate of the planet and particle, and the particle's
eccentricity. Resonant capture fails for high migration rates, and has
decreasing probability for higher eccentricities, although for certain
migration rates, capture probability peaks at a finite eccentricity. We also
calculate libration amplitudes and the offset of the libration centres for
captured particles, and the change in eccentricity if capture does not occur.
Libration amplitudes are higher for larger initial eccentricity. The model
allows for a complete description of a particle's behaviour as it successively
encounters several resonances. The model is applicable to many scenarios,
including (i) Planet migration through gas discs trapping other planets or
planetesimals in resonances; (ii) Planet migration through a debris disc; (iii)
Dust migration through PR drag. Full details can be found in
