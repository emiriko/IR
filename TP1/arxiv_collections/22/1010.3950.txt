SrPt2As2 is a novel arsenide superconductor, which crystallizes in the
CaBe2Ge2-type structure as a different polymorphic form of the ThCr2Si2-type
structure. SrPt2As2 exhibits a charge-density-wave (CDW) ordering at about 470
K and enters into a superconducting state at Tc = 5.2 K. The coexistence of
superconductivity and CDW refers to Peierls instability with a moderately
strong electron-phonon interaction. Thus SrPt2As2 can be viewed as a
nonmagnetic analog of iron-based superconductors, such as doped BaFe2As2, in
which superconductivity emerges in close proximity to spin-density-wave
ordering.
