This is a survey of the recent progress and open questions on the structure
of the sets of 0-1 and non-negative integer matrices with prescribed row and
column sums. We discuss cardinality estimates, the structure of a random matrix
from the set, discrete versions of the Brunn-Minkowski inequality and the
statistical dependence between row and column sums.
