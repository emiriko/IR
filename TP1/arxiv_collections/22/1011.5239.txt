We obtain the degree distribution for a class of growing network models on
flat and curved spaces. These models evolve by preferential attachment weighted
by a function of the distance between nodes. The degree distribution of these
models is similar to the one of the fitness model of Bianconi and Barabasi,
with a fitness distribution dependent on the metric and the density of nodes.
We show that curvature singularities in these spaces can give rise to
asymptotic Bose-Einstein condensation, but transient condensation can be
observed also in smooth hyperbolic spaces with strong curvature. We provide
numerical results for spaces of constant curvature (sphere, flat and hyperbolic
space) and we discuss the conditions for the breakdown of this approach and the
critical points of the transition to distance-dominated attachment. Finally we
discuss the distribution of link lengths.
