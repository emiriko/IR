The Bak--Sneppen model is a simple stochastic model of evolution that
exhibits self-organized criticality and for which few analytical results have
been established. In the original Bak-Sneppen model and many subsequent
variants, interactions among the evolving species are tied to a specified
topology. We report a surprising connection between Bak-Sneppen type models and
more tractable Markov processes that evolve without any reference to an
underlying topology. Specifically, we show that in the case of a large number
of species, the long time behaviour of the fitness profile in the anisotropic
Bak--Sneppen model can be replicated by a model with a purely rank-based update
rule whose asymptotics can be studied rigorously.
