The Klein-Gordon-Schr\"odinger system in 3D is shown to be locally well-posed
for Schr\"odinger data in H^s and wave data in H^{\sigma} \times H^{\sigma -1},
if s > - 1/4, \sigma > - 1/2, \sigma -2s > 3/2 and \sigma -2 < s < \sigma +1 .
This result is optimal up to the endpoints in the sense that the local flow map
is not C^2 otherwise. It is also shown that (unconditional) uniqueness holds
for s=\sigma=0 in the natural solution space C^0([0,T],L^2) \times
C^0([0,T],L^2) \times C^0([0,T],H^{-1/2}) . This solution exists even globally
by Colliander, Holmer and Tzirakis. The proofs are based on new well-posedness
results for the Zakharov system by Bejenaru, Herr, Holmer and Tataru, and
Bejenaru and Herr.
