If the forward-backward (FB) asymmetry of top quark ($A_{\rm FB}$) observed
at the Tevatron deviates from the SM prediction, there must be $P$-violating
interactions in $q\bar{q} \rightarrow t\bar{t}$. This new interaction will
necessarily affect the top spin polarization. In this letter, we perform a
model independent analysis on the longitudinal (anti)top polarization ($P_L$
and $\bar{P}_L$) using an effective lagrangian with dim-6 four-quark operators
relevant for $q \bar{q} \rightarrow t \bar{t}$, and show that the $P$-odd
observable corresponding to the polarization difference $(P_L - \bar{P}_L)$
gives important informations on the chiral structures of new physics that might
be relevant to the $A_{\rm FB}$.
