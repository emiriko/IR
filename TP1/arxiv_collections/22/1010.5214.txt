The orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light, associated with a helical
structure of the wavefunction, has a great potential for quantum photonics, as
it allows attaching a higher dimensional quantum space to each photon.
Hitherto, however, the use of OAM has been hindered by its difficult
manipulation. Here, exploiting the recently demonstrated spin-OAM information
transfer tools, we report the first observation of the Hong-Ou-Mandel
coalescence of two incoming photons having nonzero OAM into the same outgoing
mode of a beam-splitter. The coalescence can be switched on and off by varying
the input OAM state of the photons. Such effect has been then exploited to
carry out the 1 \rightarrow 2 universal optimal quantum cloning of OAM-encoded
qubits, using the symmetrization technique already developed for polarization.
These results are finally shown to be scalable to quantum spaces of arbitrary
dimension, even combining different degrees of freedom of the photons.
