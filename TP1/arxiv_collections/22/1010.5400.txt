This note is an attempt to explain in simple words why the famous relation
$E=mc^2$ misrepresents the essence of Einstein's relativity theory. The note is
addressed to high-school teachers, and a part of it - to those university
professors who permit themselves to say that the mass of a body increases with
its velocity or momentum and thus mislead the teachers and their students.
