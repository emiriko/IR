We prove that a Cayley graph can be embedded in the euclidean plane without
accumulation points of vertices if and only if it is the 1-skeleton of a Cayley
complex that can be embedded in the plane after removing redundant simplices.
We also give a characterisation of these Cayley graphs in term of group
presentations, and deduce that they can be effectively enumerated.
