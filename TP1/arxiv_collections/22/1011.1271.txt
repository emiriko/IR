We consider the magnetic-field dependent spatial magnetization pattern around
a general impurity embedded in a Heisenberg antiferromagnet using both an
analytical and a numerical spin wave approach. The results are compared to
quantum Monte Carlo simulations. The decay of the magnetization pattern away
from the impurity follows a universal form which reflects the properties of the
pure antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model. Only the overall magnitude of the
induced magnetization depends also on the size of the impurity spin and the
impurity coupling.
