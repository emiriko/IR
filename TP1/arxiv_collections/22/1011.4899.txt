Although the formulas for the light deflection due to quadrupole
gravitational field of deflecting bodies are well known, the formulas are
rather complicated, so that massive computations of quadrupole light deflection
(e.g., in the framework of astrometric survey missions like Gaia) are
time-consuming. Considering an observer situated within a few million
kilometers from the Earth (clearly the most practical case), we derive the
simplest possible form of the relevant formulas still having numerical accuracy
of 1 micro-arcsecond. This form leads to simple upper estimates for the
quadrupole light deflection in various cases allowing one to relate the
magnitude of the actual quadrupole deflection with the corresponding monopole
deflection due to the same body. These upper estimates can be used to decide
if, for a given configuration, the actual quadrupole deflection should be
computed for a given accuracy goal.
