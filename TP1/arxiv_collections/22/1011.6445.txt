We develop a one-step scheme for generating multiparticle entangled states
between two cold atomic clouds in distant cavities coupled by an optical fiber.
We show that, through suitably choosing the intensities and detunings of the
fields and precisely tuning the time evolution of the system, multiparticle
entanglement between the separated atomic clouds can be engineered
deterministically, in which quantum manipulations are insensitive to the states
of the cavity and losses of the fiber. The experimental feasibility of this
scheme is analyzed based on recent experimental advances in the realization of
strong coupling between cold $^{87}$Rb clouds and fiber-based cavity. This
scheme may open up promising perspectives for implementing quantum
communication and networking with coupled cavities connected by optical fibers.
