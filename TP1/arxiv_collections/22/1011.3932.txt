Very recently, two new hexagonal rhenium sub-nitrides Re3N and Re2N, which
belong to a rather rare group of known metal-rich (M/N > 1) nitrides of heavy
4d,5d metals, have been successfully synthesized, and their potential
technological applications as ultra-incompressible materials have been
proposed. In this work we present a detailed ab initio study of novel rhenium
sub-nitrides in comparison with hcp-Re and wurtzite-like rhenium mono-nitride
ReN, with the purpose to evaluate the trends of the elastic, electronic
properties and chemical bonding in the series of these hexagonal systems as a
function of the Re/N stoichiometry: Re \rightarrow Re3N \rightarrow Re2N
\rightarrow ReN.
