We derive the two loop expressions for polygonal Wilson loops by starting
from the one loop expressions and applying an operator product expansion. We do
this for polygonal Wilson loops in R^{1,1} and find a result in agreement with
previous computations. We also discuss the spectrum of excitations around flux
tube that connects two null Wilson lines.
