Simulation studies and spectroscopic measurements are presented regarding the
development of a pixel multilayer CdTe detector under development in the
context of the COCAE project. The instrument will be used for the localization
and identification of radioactive sources and radioactively contaminated spots.
For the localization task the Compton effect is exploited. The detector
response under different radiation fields as well as the overall efficiency of
the detector has been evaluated. Spectroscopic measurements have been performed
to evaluate the energy resolution of the detector. The efficiency of the event
reconstruction has been studied in a wide range of initial photon energies by
exploiting the detector's angular resolution measure distribution. Furthermore,
the ability of the COCAE detector to localize radioactive sources has been
investigated.
