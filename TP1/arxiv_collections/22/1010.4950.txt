We examine the calculation of the color-ordered disk level S-matrix element
of massless scalar vertex operators for the special case that some of the
Mandelstam variables for which there are no open string channel in the
amplitude, are set to zero. By explicit calculation we show that the string
form factors in the 2n-point functions reduce to one at the eikonal Regge
limit.
