We attempt to confirm bright non-LTE emission from the exoplanet HD189733b at
3.25 microns, as recently reported by Swain et al. (2010) based on observations
at low spectral resolving power (R ~ 30). Non-LTE emission lines from gas in an
exoplanet atmosphere will not be significantly broadened by collisions, so the
measured emission intensity per resolution element must be substantially
brighter when observed at high spectral resolving power. We observed the planet
before, during, and after a secondary eclipse event at a resolving power R =
27,000 using the NIRSPEC spectrometer on the Keck II telescope. Our spectra
cover a spectral window near the peak found by Swain et al., and we compare
emission cases that could account for the magnitude and wavelength dependence
of the Swain et al. result with our final spectral residuals. To model the
expected line emission, we use a general non-equilibrium formulation to
synthesize emission features from all plausible molecules that emit in this
spectral region. In every case, we detect no line emission to a high degree of
confidence. After considering possible explanations for the Swain et al.
results and the disparity with our own data, we conclude that an astrophysical
source for the putative non-LTE emission is unlikely. We note that the
wavelength dependence of the signal seen by Swain et al. closely matches the
2nu2 band of water vapor at 300K, and we suggest that an imperfect correction
for telluric water is the source of the feature claimed by Swain et al.
