Stress fibers are contractile actomyosin bundles commonly observed in the
cytoskeleton of metazoan cells. The spatial profile of the polarity of actin
filaments inside contractile actomyosin bundles is either monotonic (graded) or
periodic (alternating). In the framework of linear irreversible thermodynamics,
we write the constitutive equations for a polar, active, elastic
one-dimensional medium. An analysis of the resulting equations for the dynamics
of polarity shows that the transition from graded to alternating polarity
patterns is a nonequilibrium Lifshitz point. Active contractility is a
necessary condition for the emergence of sarcomeric, alternating polarity
patterns.
