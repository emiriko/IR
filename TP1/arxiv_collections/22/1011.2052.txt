We seek for an alternative to the metric tensor $g_{\mu\nu}$ as a fundamental
geometrical object in four-dimensional Riemannian manifolds. We suggest that
the metric tensor $g_{\mu\nu}(P)$ at a given point $P$ of a manifold may be
replaced by a four-dimensional geometrical simplex $\sigma^^4(P)$ embedded to
the tangent space $T_P$ of the point $P$. The number of two-faces, or
triangles, of $\sigma^4(P)$ is the same as is the number of independent
components of $g_{\mu\nu}(P)$, and hence we may replace the components of
$g_{\mu\nu}$ by the two-face areas of $\sigma^4(P)$. In this sense the concept
of distance may, in four-dimensional Riemannian manifolds, be reduced to the
concept of area. This result may find some applications in the thermodynamical
approaches to quantum gravity.
