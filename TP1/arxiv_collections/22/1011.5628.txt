Loop Gravity provides a microscopic derivation of Black Hole entropy. In this
paper, I show that the microstates counted admit a semiclassical description in
terms of shapes of a tessellated horizon. The counting of microstates and the
computation of the entropy can be done via a mapping to an equivalent
statistical mechanical problem: the counting of conformations of a closed
polymer chain. This correspondence suggests a number of intriguing relations
between the thermodynamics of Black Holes and the physics of polymers.
