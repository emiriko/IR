Drift analysis has become a powerful tool to prove bounds on the runtime of
randomized search heuristics. It allows, for example, fairly simple proofs for
the classical problem how the (1+1) Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) optimizes an
arbitrary pseudo-Boolean linear function. The key idea of drift analysis is to
measure the progress via another pseudo-Boolean function (called drift
function) and use deeper results from probability theory to derive from this a
good bound for the runtime of the EA. Surprisingly, all these results manage to
use the same drift function for all linear objective functions.
  In this work, we show that such universal drift functions only exist if the
mutation probability is close to the standard value of $1/n$.
