Interference of two independently prepared ideal Bose gases is discussed, on
the basis of the idea of measurement-induced interference: even if the number
of each gas is individually fixed finite and the symmetry of the system is not
broken, an interference pattern is observed on each single snapshot. The key
role is played by the Hanbury Brown and Twiss effect, which leads to an
oscillating pattern of the cloud of identical atoms. Then, how essential is the
Bose-Einstein condensation to the interference? We describe the ideal Bose
gases trapped respectively in two spatially separated 3D harmonic traps at a
finite temperature as canonical ensembles with fixed numbers of atoms, and
compute the full statistics of the snapshot profiles of the expanding and
overlapping gases released from the traps. We obtain a simple formula, which
shows that the average fringe spectrum (average fringe contrast) is given by
the purity of each gas. The purity is known to be a good measure of
condensation, and this result clarifies the relevance of the condensation to
the interference. The fluctuation of the interference spectrum is also studied,
and it is shown that the fluctuation is vanishingly small below the critical
temperature, while it is nonvanishing above. This implies that interference
pattern is certainly observed on every snapshot below the critical temperature.
The fact that the number of atoms is fixed in the canonical ensemble is crucial
to this vanishing fluctuation.
