We propose computing bus devices that enable quantum information to be
coherently transferred between topological and conventional qubits. We describe
a concrete realization of such a topological quantum bus acting between a
topological qubit in a Majorana wire network and a conventional semiconductor
double quantum dot qubit. Specifically, this device measures the joint
(fermion) parity of these two different qubits by using the Aharonov-Casher
effect in conjunction with an ancilliary superconducting flux qubit that
facilitates the measurement. Such a parity measurement, together with the
ability to apply Hadamard gates to the two qubits, allows one to produce states
in which the topological and conventional qubits are maximally entangled and to
teleport quantum states between the topological and conventional quantum
systems.
