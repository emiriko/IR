This contribution is an attempt to try to understand the matter-antimatter
asymmetry in the universe within the {\it spin-charge-family-theory} if
assuming that transitions in non equilibrium processes among instanton vacua
and complex phases in mixing matrices are the sources of the matter-antimatter
asymmetry, as studied in the literature for several proposed theories. The {\it
spin-charge-family-theory} is, namely, very promising in showing the right way
beyond the {\it standard model}. It predicts families and their mass matrices,
explaining the origin of the charges and of the gauge fields. It predicts that
there are, after the universe passes through two $SU(2)\times U(1)$ phase
transitions, in which the symmetry breaks from $SO(1,3) \times SU(2) \times
SU(2) \times U(1) \times SU(3)$ first to $SO(1,3) \times SU(2) \times U(1)
\times SU(3)$ and then to $SO(1,3) \times U(1) \times SU(3)$, twice decoupled
four families. The upper four families gain masses in the first phase
transition, while the second four families gain masses at the electroweak
break. To these two breaks of symmetries the scalar non Abelian fields, the
(superposition of the) gauge fields of the operators generating families,
contribute. The lightest of the upper four families is stable (in comparison
with the life of the universe) and is therefore a candidate for constituting
the dark matter. The heaviest of the lower four families should be seen at the
LHC or at somewhat higher energies.
