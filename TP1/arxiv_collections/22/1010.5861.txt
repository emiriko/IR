Using generalized Landau gauge, we study the continuous change of gluon
properties from the Landau gauge toward the Coulomb gauge in SU(3) lattice QCD.
We investigate "instantaneous interquark potential", which is defined by the
spatial correlation of the temporal link-variable $U_4$ and is an interesting
gauge-dependent concept. In the Coulomb gauge, the instantaneous potential is
expressed by the Coulomb plus linear potential, where the slope is, however,
2-3 times as large as the physical string tension. In the Landau gauge, the
instantaneous potential has no linear part. We find that the linear part is
continuously growing by varying gauge from the Landau gauge toward the Coulomb
gauge. We also find that the instantaneous potential approximately reproduces
the physical interquark potential in a specific intermediate gauge,
$\lambda_C$-gauge. This $\lambda_C$-gauge is expected to be a useful gauge for
modeling effective theories such as the quark potential model.
