We provide rigorous evidence of the fact that the modified
Constantin-Lax-Majda equation modeling vortex and quasi-geostrophic dynamics
describes the geodesic flow on the subgroup of orientation-preserving
diffeomorphisms fixing one point, with respect to right-invariant metric
induced by the homogeneous Sobolev norm $H^{1/2}$ and show the local existence
of the geodesics in the extended group of diffeomorphisms of Sobolev class
$H^{k}$ with $k\ge 2$.
