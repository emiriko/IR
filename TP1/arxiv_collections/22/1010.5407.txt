Topological phonon modes are robust vibrations localized at the edges of
special structures. Their existence is determined by the bulk properties of the
structures and, as such, the topological phonon modes are stable to changes
occurring at the edges. The first class of topological phonons was recently
found in 2-dimensional structures similar to that of Microtubules. The present
work introduces another class of topological phonons, this time occurring in
quasi one-dimensional filamentous structures with inversion symmetry. The
phenomenon is exemplified using a structure inspired from that of actin
Microfilaments, present in most live cells. The system discussed here is
probably the simplest structure that supports topological phonon modes, a fact
that allows detailed analysis in both time and frequency domains. We advance
the hypothesis that the topological phonon modes are ubiquitous in the
biological world and that living organisms make use of them during various
processes.
