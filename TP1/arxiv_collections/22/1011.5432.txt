Possible hints for WIMP dark matter with mass around 10 GeV coming from the
DAMA, CoGeNT, and maybe also CRESST experiments are presented, and confronted
with constraints from CDMS and XENON data. Focusing on spin-independent (SI)
WIMP--nucleus interactions, I elaborate on the difficulties to make the hints
consistent with each other and to evade the constraints, mentioning energy
scale uncertainties, quenching and light-yield factors, as well as
uncertainties on halo properties. In the present situation it seems hard to
reconcile all data within the SI framework, which suggests that if the
experimental anomalies were indeed due to dark matter a more exotic mechanism
(to be identified) had to be at work.
