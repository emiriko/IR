Partial differential equations with discrete (concentrated) state-dependent
delays are studied. The existence and uniqueness of solutions with initial data
from a wider linear space is proven first and then a subset of the space of
continuously differentiable (with respect to an appropriate norm) functions is
used to construct a dynamical system. This subset is an analogue of \textit{the
solution manifold} proposed for ordinary equations in [H.-O. Walther, The
solution manifold and $C\sp 1$-smoothness for differential equations with
state-dependent delay, J. Differential Equations, {195}(1), (2003) 46--65]. The
existence of a compact global attractor is proven.
