Synchronization of actively oscillating organelles such as cilia and flagella
facilitates self-propulsion of cells and pumping fluid in low Reynolds number
environments. To understand the key mechanism behind synchronization induced by
hydrodynamic interaction, we study a model of rigid-body rotors making fixed
trajectories of arbitrary shape under driving forces that are arbitrary
functions of the phases. For a wide class of geometries, we obtain the
necessary and sufficient conditions for synchronization of a pair of rotors. We
also find a novel synchronized pattern with a time-dependent phase shift. Our
results shed light on the role of hydrodynamic interactions in biological
systems, and could help in developing efficient mixing and transport strategies
in microfluidic devices.
