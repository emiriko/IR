Over the past three years, we have worked on developing a well-characterized
30S radioactive beam to be used in a future experiment aiming to directly
measure the 30S(alpha,p) stellar reaction rate within the Gamow window of Type
I X-ray bursts. The importance of the 30S(alpha,p) reaction to X-ray bursts is
discussed. Given the astrophysical motivation, the successful results of and
challenges involved in the production of a low-energy 30S beam are detailed.
Finally, an overview of our future plans regarding this on-going project are
presented.
