We characterize the complexity of geodesic paths on a curved statistical
manifold M_{s} through the asymptotic computation of the information geometric
complexity V_{M_{s}} and the Jacobi vector field intensity J_{M_{s}}. The
manifold M_{s} is a 2l-dimensional Gaussian model reproduced by an appropriate
embedding in a larger 4l-dimensional Gaussian manifold and endowed with a
Fisher-Rao information metric g_{{\mu}{\nu}}({\Theta}) with non-trivial off
diagonal terms. These terms emerge due to the presence of a correlational
structure (embedding constraints) among the statistical variables on the larger
manifold and are characterized by macroscopic correlational coefficients r_{k}.
First, we observe a power law decay of the information geometric complexity at
a rate determined by the coefficients r_{k} and conclude that the non-trivial
off diagonal terms lead to the emergence of an asymptotic information geometric
compression of the explored macrostates {\Theta} on M_{s}. Finally, we observe
that the presence of such embedding constraints leads to an attenuation of the
asymptotic exponential divergence of the Jacobi vector field intensity.
