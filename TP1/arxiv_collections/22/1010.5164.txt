We present Spitzer MIPS 24-micron observations of 16 0.4<z<0.8 galaxy
clusters drawn from the ESO Distant Cluster Survey (EDisCS). This is the first
large 24-micron survey of clusters at intermediate redshift. The depth of our
imaging corresponds to a total IR luminosity of 8x10^10 Lsun, just below the
luminosity of luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs), and 6^{+1}_{-1}% of M_V < -19
cluster members show 24-micron emission at or above this level. We compare with
a large sample of coeval field galaxies and find that while the fraction of
cluster LIRGs lies significantly below that of the field, the IR luminosities
of the field and cluster galaxies are consistent. However, the stellar masses
of the EDisCS LIRGs are systematically higher than those of the field LIRGs. A
comparison with optical data reveals that ~80% of cluster LIRGs are blue and
the remaining 20% lie on the red sequence. Of LIRGs with optical spectra,
88^{+4}_{-5}% show [O II] emission with EW([O II])>5A, and ~75% exhibit optical
signatures of dusty starbursts. On average, the fraction of cluster LIRGs
increases with projected cluster-centric radius but remains systematically
lower than the field fraction over the area probed (< 1.5xR200). The amount of
obscured star formation declines significantly over the 2.4 Gyr interval
spanned by the EDisCS sample, and the rate of decline is the same for the
cluster and field populations. Our results are consistent with an exponentially
declining LIRG fraction, with the decline in the field delayed by ~1 Gyr
relative to the clusters.
