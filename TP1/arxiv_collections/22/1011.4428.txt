We show how the spontaneous emission rate of an excited two-level atom placed
in a trapped Bose-Einstein condensate of ground-state atoms is enhanced by
bosonic stimulation. This stimulation depends on the overlap of the excited
matter-wave packet with the macroscopically occupied condensate wave function,
and provides a probe of the spatial coherence of the Bose gas. The effect can
be used to amplify the distance-dependent decay rate of an excited atom near an
interface.
