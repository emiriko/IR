We report results of $^{59}$Co nuclear magnetic resonance measurements on a
single crystal of superconducting PuCoGa5 in its normal state. The nuclear
spin-lattice relaxation rates and the Knight shifts as a function of
temperature reveal an anisotropy of spin fluctuations with finite wave vector
q. By comparison with the isostructural members, we conclude that
antiferromagnetic XY-type anisotropy of spin fluctuations plays an important
role in mediating superconductivity in these heavy fermion materials.
