These notes are a part of my lectures on representations of adelic groups
attached to two-dimensional schemes. They contain a study of the
one-dimensional case as a preliminary step to the case of dimension two. We
consider the following issues: the Tate--Iwasawa method for algebraic curves; a
discrete version and holomorphic duality; the Poisson formula and residues;
explicit formulas; relation with the Artin representation; analogues for the
number fields. With appendix on the Dedekind zeta-functions by Irina
Rezvjakova.
