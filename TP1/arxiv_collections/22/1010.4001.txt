Low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) have been studied in the Galaxy since the
beginning of X-ray astronomy. A lot has been learned about these bright X-ray
sources, but significant questions are still open. These questions are related
to the origin and evolution of LMXBs, dynamical evolution in globular clusters
(GC) or evolution of native field binaries, and on how their properties may
depend on those of the parent stellar population. The discovery of several
populations LMXB populations in elliptical galaxies with Chandra gives us tools
to look at these sources in a new way.
