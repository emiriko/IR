We present the results of the recent high precision lattice calculation of
the average up/down, strange and charm quark masses performed by ETMC with Nf=2
twisted mass Wilson fermions. The analysis includes data at four values of the
lattice spacing and pion masses as low as ~270 MeV, allowing for accurate
continuum limit and chiral extrapolation. The strange and charm masses are
extracted by using several methods, based on different observables: the kaon
and the eta_s meson for the strange quark and the D, D_s and eta_c mesons for
the charm. The quark mass renormalization is carried out non-perturbatively
using the RI-MOM method. The results for the quark masses in the MSbar scheme
read: m_ud(2 GeV)= 3.6(2) MeV, m_s(2 GeV)=95(6) MeV and m_c(m_c)=1.28(4) GeV.
We have also obtained the ratios m_s/m_ud=27.3(9) and m_c/m_s=12.0(3).
Moreover, we provide the updated result for the bottom quark mass,
m_b(m_b)=4.3(2) GeV, obtained using the method presented in 0909.3187
[hep-lat].
