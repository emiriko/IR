Transport and scattering phenomena in open quantum-systems with a continuous
energy spectrum are conveniently solved using the time-dependent Schrodinger
equation. In the time-dependent picture, the evolution of an initially
localized wave-packet reveals the eigenstates and eigenvalues of the system
under consideration. We discuss applications of the wave-packet method in
atomic, molecular, and mesoscopic systems and point out specific advantages of
the time-dependent approach. In connection with the familiar initial value
formulation of classical mechanics, an intuitive interpretation of transport
emerges. For interacting many-particle systems, we discuss the efficient
calculation of the self-consistent classical transport in the presence of a
magnetic field.
