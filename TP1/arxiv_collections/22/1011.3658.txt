We study the ferromagnetism of Ga1-xMnxAs by using a model Hamiltonian, based
on an impurity band and the anti-ferromagnetic exchange interaction between the
spins of Mn atoms and the charge carriers in the impurity band. Based on the
mean field approach we calculate the spontaneous magnetization as a function of
temperature and the ferromagnetic transition temperature as a function of the
Mn concentration. The random distribution of Mn impurities is taken into
account by Matsubara and Toyozawa theory of impurities in semiconductors. We
compare our results with experiments and other theoretical findings.
