The purpose of this paper is to come up with a Pilot Wave model of quantum
field theory that incorporates particle creation and annihilation without
sacrificing determinism. This has been previously attempted in an article by
the same author titled "Incorporating particle creation and annihilation in
Pilot Wave model", in a much less satisfactory way. In this paper I would like
to "clean up" some of the things. In particular, I would like to get rid of a
very unnatural concept of "visibility" of particles, which makes the model much
simpler. On the other hand, I would like to add a mechanism for decoherence,
which was absent in the previous version.
