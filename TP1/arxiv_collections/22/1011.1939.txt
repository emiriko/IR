We propose distributed algorithms to automatically deploy a team of mobile
robots to partition and provide coverage of a non-convex environment. To handle
arbitrary non-convex environments, we represent them as graphs. Our
partitioning and coverage algorithm requires only short-range, unreliable
pairwise "gossip" communication. The algorithm has two components: (1) a motion
protocol to ensure that neighboring robots communicate at least sporadically,
and (2) a pairwise partitioning rule to update territory ownership when two
robots communicate. By studying an appropriate dynamical system on the space of
partitions of the graph vertices, we prove that territory ownership converges
to a pairwise-optimal partition in finite time. This new equilibrium set
represents improved performance over common Lloyd-type algorithms.
Additionally, we detail how our algorithm scales well for large teams in large
environments and how the computation can run in anytime with limited resources.
Finally, we report on large-scale simulations in complex environments and
hardware experiments using the Player/Stage robot control system.
