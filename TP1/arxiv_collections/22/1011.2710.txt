Terrestrial planets, with silicate mantles and metallic cores, are likely to
obtain water and carbon compounds during accretion. Here I examine the
conditions that allow early formation of a surface water ocean (simultaneous
with cooling to clement surface conditions), and the timeline of degassing the
planetary interior into the atmosphere. The greatest fraction of a planet's
initial volatile budget is degassed into the atmosphere during the end of magma
ocean solidification, leaving only a small fraction of the original volatiles
to be released into the atmosphere through later volcanism. Rocky planets that
accrete with water in their bulk mantle have two mechanisms for producing an
early water ocean: First, if they accrete with at least 1 to 3 mass% of water
in their bulk composition, liquid water may be extruded onto the planetary
surface at the end of magma ocean solidification. Second, at initial water
contents as low as 0.01 mass% or lower, during solidification a massive
supercritical fluid and steam atmosphere is produced that collapses into a
water ocean upon cooling. The low water contents required for this process
indicate that rocky super-Earth exoplanets may be expected to commonly produce
water oceans within tens to hundreds of millions of years of their last major
accretionary impact, through collapse of their atmosphere.
