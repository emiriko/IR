A general, system-independent formulation of the parabolic
Schr\"odinger-Poisson equation is presented for a charged hard wall in the
limit of complete screening by the ground state. It is solved numerically using
iteration and asymptotic-boundary conditions. The solution gives a simple
relation between the band bending and charge density at an interface. I further
develop approximative analytical forms for the potential and wave function,
based on properties of the exact solution. Specific tests of the validity of
the assumptions leading to the general solution are made. The assumption of
complete screening by the ground state is found be a limitation; however, the
general solution still provides a fair approximate account of the potential
when the bulk is doped. The general solution is further used in a simple model
for the potential profile of an AlN/GaN barrier, and gives an approximation
which compares well with the solution of the full Schr\"odinger-Poisson
equation.
