In \cite{NRxx}, we proposed a numerical regularized moment method of
arbitrary order (abbreviated as NRxx method) for Boltzmann-BGK equation, which
makes numerical simulation using very large number of moments possible. In this
paper, we are further exploring the efficiency of NRxx method with techniques
including the 2nd order HLL flux with linear reconstruction to improve spatial
accuracy, the RKC schemes to relieve the time step length constraint by the
regularization terms, and the revised Strang splitting to calculate convective
and diffusive terms only once without loss of accuracy. It is validated by the
numerical results that the overall efficiency is significantly improved and the
convergence order is kept well.
