A plasmonic nanostructure conceived with periodic layers of a doped
semiconductor and passive semiconductor is shown to generate spontaneously
surface plasmon polaritons thanks to its periodic nature. The nanostructure is
demonstrated to behave as an effective material modeled by a simple dielectric
function of ionic-crystal type, and possesses a fully tunable photonic band
gap, with widths exceeding 50%, in the region extending from mid-infra-red to
Tera-Hertz.
