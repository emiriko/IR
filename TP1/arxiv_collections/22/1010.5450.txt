It is demonstrated that Monte Carlo sampling can be used to efficiently
extract the expectation value of projected entangled pair states with large
virtual bond dimension. We use the simple update rule introduced by Xiang et
al. to obtain the tensors describing the ground state wavefunction of the
antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model and evaluate the finite size energy and
staggered magnetization for square lattices with periodic boundary conditions
of sizes up to L=16 and virtual bond dimensions up to D=16. The finite size
magnetization errors are 0.003(2) and 0.013(2) at D=16 for a system of size
L=8,16 respectively. Finite D extrapolation provides exact finite size
magnetization for L=8, and reduces the magnetization error to 0.005(3) for
L=16, significantly improving the previous state of the art results.
