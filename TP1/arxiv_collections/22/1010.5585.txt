We present an analysis of the winding sense (S and Z-shaped) of 1\,621 field
galaxies that have radial velocity between 3\,000 km s$^{-1}$ to 5\,000 km
s$^{-1}$. The preferred alignments of S- and Z-shaped galaxies are studied
using chi-square, auto-correlation and the Fourier tests. We classified total
galaxies into 32 subsamples and noticed a good agreement between the position
angle (PA) distribution of S- and Z-shaped galaxies. The homogeneous
distribution of the S- and Z-shaped galaxies is noticed for the late-type
spirals (Sc, Scd, Sd and Sm) than that of the early-types (Sa, Sab, Sb and
Sbc). A significant dominance of S-mode galaxies is noticed in the barred
spirals. A random alignment is noticed in the PA-distribution of Z- and S-mode
spirals. In addition, homogeneous distribution of the S- and Z-shaped galaxies
is found to be invariant under the global expansion. The PA-distribution of the
total S-mode galaxies is found to be random, whereas preferred alignment is
noticed for the total Z-mode galaxies. It is found that the galactic planes of
Z-mode galaxies tend to lie in the equatorial plane.
