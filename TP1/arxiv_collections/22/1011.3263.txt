The single-wave model equations are transformed to an exact hydrodynamic
closure by using a class of solutions to the Vlasov equation corresponding to
the waterbag model. The warm fluid dynamic equations are then manipulated by
means of the renormalization group method. As a result, amplitude equations for
the slowly varying wave amplitudes are derived. Since the characteristic
equation for waves has in general three roots, two cases are examined. If all
three roots of the characteristic equation are real, the amplitude equations
for the eigenmodes represent a system of three coupled nonlinear equations. In
the case, where the dispersion equation possesses one real and two complex
conjugate roots, the amplitude equations take the form of two coupled equations
with complex coefficients. The analytical results are then compared to the
exact system dynamics obtained by solving the hydrodynamic equations
numerically.
