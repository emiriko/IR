Differences in the stellar populations of galaxies can be used to quantify
the effect of environment on the star formation history. We target a sample of
early-type galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey in two different
environmental regimes: close pairs and a general sample where environment is
measured by the mass of their host dark matter halo. We apply a blind source
separation technique based on principal component analysis, from which we
define two parameters that correlate, respectively, with the average stellar
age (eta) and with the presence of recent star formation (zeta) from the
spectral energy distribution of the galaxy. We find that environment leaves a
second order imprint on the spectra, whereas local properties - such as
internal velocity dispersion - obey a much stronger correlation with the
stellar age distribution.
