Context. The SDSS-II Supernova Survey, conducted between 2005 and 2007, was
designed to detect a large number of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) around z~0.2,
the redshift "gap" between low-z and high-z SN searches. The survey has
provided multi-band photometric lightcurves for variable targets, and SN
candidates were scheduled for spectroscopic observations, primarily to provide
SN classification and accurate redshifts. We present SN spectra obtained in
2006 and 2007 using the NTT and the NOT. Aims. We provide an atlas of SN
spectra in the range z =0.03-0.32 that complements the well-sampled lightcurves
from SDSS-II in the forthcoming three-year SDSS SN cosmology analysis. The
sample can, for example, be used for spectral studies of SNe Ia, which are
critical for understanding potential systematic effects when SNe are used to
determine cosmological distances. Methods. The spectra were reduced in a
uniform manner, and special care was taken in estimating the uncertainties for
the different processing steps. Host-galaxy light was subtracted when possible
and the SN type fitted using the SuperNova IDentification code (SNID). We also
present comparisons between spectral and photometric dating using SALT
lightcurve fits to the photometry from SDSS-II, as well as the global
distribution of our sample in terms of the lightcurve parameters: stretch and
colour. Results. We report new spectroscopic data from 141 SNe Ia, mainly
between -9 and +15 days from lightcurve maximum, including a few cases of
multi-epoch observations. This homogeneous, host-galaxy subtracted, SN Ia
spectroscopic sample is among the largest such data sets and unique in its
redshift interval. The sample includes two potential SN 1991T-like SNe (SN
2006on and SN 2007ni) and one potential SN 2002cx-like SN (SN 2007ie). In
addition, the new compilation includes spectra from 23 confirmed Type II and 8
Type Ib/c SNe.
