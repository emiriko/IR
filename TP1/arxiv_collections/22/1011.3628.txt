Present X-ray missions like Chandra and XMM-Newton provide high-resolution
and high-S/N observations of extremely hot white dwarfs, e.g. burst spectra of
novae. Their analysis requires adequate Non-LTE model atmospheres. The
T\"ubingen Non-LTE Model-Atmosphere Package TMAP can calculate such model
atmospheres and spectral energy distributions at a high level of
sophistication. In the framework of the Virtual Observatory, the German
Astrophysical Virtual Observatory (GAVO) offers TheoSSA, a Virtual Observatory
(VO) service that provides easy access to theoretical SEDs. We present a new
grid of SEDs, that is calculated in the parameter range of novae and supersoft
X-ray sources.
