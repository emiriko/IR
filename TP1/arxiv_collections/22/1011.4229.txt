We conclude our investigation on the QCD equation of state (EoS) with 2+1
staggered flavors and one-link stout improvement. We extend our previous study
[JHEP 0601:089 (2006)] by choosing even finer lattices. These new results [for
details see arXiv:1007.2580] support our earlier findings. Lattices with
N_t=6,8 and 10 are used, and the continuum limit is approached by checking the
results at N_t=12. A Symanzik improved gauge and a stout-link improved
staggered fermion action is taken; the light and strange quark masses are set
to their physical values. Various observables are calculated in the temperature
(T) interval of 100 to 1000~MeV. We compare our data to the equation of state
obtained by the "hotQCD" collaboration.
