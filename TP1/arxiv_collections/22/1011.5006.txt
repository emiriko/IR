We prove a representation-theoretic version of Borisov-Batyrev mirror
symmetry, and use it to construct infinitely many new pairs of orbifolds with
mirror Hodge diamonds, with respect to the usual Hodge structure on singular
complex cohomology. We conjecture that the corresponding orbifold Hodge
diamonds are also mirror. When $X$ is the Fermat quintic in $\P^4$, and
$\tilde{X}^*$ is a $\Sym_5$-equivariant, toric resolution of its mirror $X^*$,
we deduce that for any subgroup $\Gamma$ of the alternating group $A_5$, the
$\Gamma$-Hilbert schemes $\Gamma$-$\Hilb(X)$ and $\Gamma$-$\Hilb(\tilde{X}^*)$
are smooth Calabi-Yau threefolds with (explicitly computed) mirror Hodge
diamonds.
