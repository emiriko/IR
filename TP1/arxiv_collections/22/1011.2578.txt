We provide a theoretical perspective on the glass transition in molecular
liquids at thermal equilibrium, on the spatially heterogeneous and aging
dynamics of disordered materials, and on the rheology of soft glassy materials.
We start with a broad introduction to the field and emphasize its connections
with other subjects and its relevance. The important role played by computer
simulations to study and understand the dynamics of systems close to the glass
transition at the molecular level is spelled out. We review the recent progress
on the subject of the spatially heterogeneous dynamics that characterizes
structural relaxation in materials with slow dynamics. We then present the main
theoretical approaches describing the glass transition in supercooled liquids,
focusing on theories that have a microscopic, statistical mechanics basis. We
describe both successes and failures, and critically assess the current status
of each of these approaches. The physics of aging dynamics in disordered
materials and the rheology of soft glassy materials are then discussed, and
recent theoretical progress is described. For each section, we give an
extensive overview of the most recent advances, but we also describe in some
detail the important open problems that, we believe, will occupy a central
place in this field in the coming years.
