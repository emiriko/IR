The parameters of the p-mode oscillations vary with solar activity. Such
temporal variations provide insights for the study of the structural and
dynamical changes occurring in the Sun's interior throughout the solar cycle.
We present here a complete picture of the temporal variations of the global
p-mode parameters (excitation, damping, frequency, peak asymmetry, and
rotational splitting) over the entire solar cycle 23 and the beginning of cycle
24 as observed by the space-based, Sun-as-a-star helioseismic GOLF and VIRGO
instruments onboard SoHO.
