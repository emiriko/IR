By a quantum version of the Arnold transformation of classical mechanics, all
quantum dynamical systems whose classical equations of motion are
non-homogeneous linear second-order ordinary differential equations, including
systems with friction linear in velocity, can be related to the quantum
free-particle dynamical system. This transformation provides a basic
(Heisenberg-Weyl) algebra of quantum operators, along with well-defined
Hermitian operators which can be chosen as evolution-like observables and
complete the entire Schr\"odinger algebra. It also proves to be very helpful in
performing certain computations quickly, to obtain, for example, wave functions
and closed analytic expressions for time-evolution operators.
