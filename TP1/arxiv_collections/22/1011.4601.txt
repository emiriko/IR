We investigate the quality factor and RMS amplitude of the lower kHz QPOs
from XTE J1701-462, a unique X-ray source which was observed in both the
so-called Z and atoll states. Correcting for the frequency drift of the QPO, we
show that, as in all sources for which such a correction can be applied, the
quality factor and RMS amplitude drops sharply above above a critical
frequency. For XTE J1701-462 this frequency is estimated to be ~800 Hz, where
the quality factor reaches a maximum of ~200 (e.g. a value consistent with the
one observed from more classical systems, such as 4U~1636-536). Such a drop has
been interpreted as the signature of the innermost stable circular orbit, and
that interpretation is consistent with the observations we report here. The kHz
QPOs in the Z state are much less coherent and lower amplitude than they are in
the atoll state. We argue that the change of the QPO properties between the two
source states is related to the change of the scale height of the accretion
disk; a prediction of the toy model proposed by barret et al. (2007). As a
by-product of our analysis, we also increased the significance of the upper kHz
QPO detected in the atoll phase up to 4.8 sigma (single trial significance),
and show that the frequency separation (266.5+/-13.1 Hz) is comparable with the
one measured from simultaneous twin QPOs the Z phase.
