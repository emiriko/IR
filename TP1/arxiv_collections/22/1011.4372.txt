Forced evaporative cooling in a far-off-resonance optical dipole trap is
proved to be an efficient method to produce fermionic- or bosonic-degenerated
gases. However in most of the experiences, the reduction of the potential
height occurs with a diminution of the collision elastic rate. Taking advantage
of a long-living excited state, like in two-electron atoms, I propose a new
scheme, based on an optical knife, where the forced evaporation can be driven
independently of the trap confinement. In this context, the runaway regime
might be achieved leading to a substantial improvement of the cooling
efficiency. The comparison with the different methods for forced evaporation is
discussed in the presence or not of three-body recombination losses.
