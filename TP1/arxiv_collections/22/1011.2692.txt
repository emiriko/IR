Using a generalized parton model approach including spin and intrinsic parton
motion effects, and assuming the validity of factorization for large-pT jet
production in hadronic collisions, we study the azimuthal distribution around
the jet axis of leading unpolarized or (pseudo)scalar hadrons, namely pions,
produced in the jet fragmentation process. We identify the observable
leading-twist azimuthal asymmetries for the unpolarized and single-polarized
case related to quark and gluon-originated jets. We account for all physically
allowed combinations of the transverse momentum dependent (TMD) parton
distribution and fragmentation functions, with special attention to the Sivers,
Boer-Mulders, and transversity quark distributions, and to the Collins
fragmentation function for quarks (and to the analogous functions for gluons).
For each of these effects we evaluate, at central and forward rapidities and
for kinematical configurations accessible at BNL-RHIC, the corresponding
potentially maximized asymmetry (for pi+ production), obtained by saturating
natural positivity bounds (and the Soffer bound for transversity) for the
distribution and fragmentation functions involved and summing additively all
partonic contributions. We then estimate, for both neutral and charged pions,
the asymmetries involving TMD functions for which parameterizations are
available. We also study the role of the different mechanisms, and the
corresponding transverse single spin asymmetries, for large-pT inclusive jet
production.
