We discuss the effect of chemical separation as matter freezes at the base of
the ocean of an accreting neutron star, and argue that the retention of light
elements in the liquid acts as a source of buoyancy that drives a slow but
continual mixing of the ocean, enriching it substantially in light elements,
and leading to a relatively uniform composition with depth. We first consider
the timescales associated with different processes that can redistribute
elements in the ocean, including convection, sedimentation, crystallization,
and diffusion. We then calculate the steady state structure of the ocean of a
neutron star for an illustrative model in which the accreted hydrogen and
helium burns to produce a mixture of O and Se. Even though the H/He burning
produces only 2% oxygen by mass, the steady state ocean has an oxygen abundance
more than ten times larger, almost 40% by mass. Furthermore, we show that the
convective motions transport heat inwards, with a flux of ~ 0.2 MeV per nucleon
for an O-Se ocean, heating the ocean and steepening the outwards temperature
gradient. The enrichment of light elements and heating of the ocean due to
compositionally-driven convection likely have important implications for carbon
ignition models of superbursts.
