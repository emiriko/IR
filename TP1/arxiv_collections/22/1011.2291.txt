In this paper we study the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy, electrical
and thermal conductivities for the R-charged black hole in STU model. We
generalize previous works to the case of a black hole with three different
charges. Actually we use diffusion constant to obtain ratio of shear viscosity
to entropy. By applying the thermodynamical stability we recover previous
results. Also we investigate the effect of higher derivative corrections.
