Protoplanetary disks are quasi-steady structures whose evolution and
dispersal determine the environment for planet formation. I review the theory
of protoplanetary disk evolution and its connection to observations.
Substantial progress has been made in elucidating the physics of potential
angular momentum transport processes - including self-gravity,
magnetorotational instability, baroclinic instabilities, and magnetic braking -
and in developing testable models for disk dispersal via photoevaporation. The
relative importance of these processes depends upon the initial mass, size and
magnetization of the disk, and subsequently on its opacity, ionization state,
and external irradiation. Disk dynamics is therefore coupled to star formation,
pre-main-sequence stellar evolution, and dust coagulation during the early
stages of planet formation, and may vary dramatically from star to star. The
importance of validating theoretical models is emphasized, with the key
observations being those that probe disk structure on the scales, between 1 AU
and 10 AU, where theory is most uncertain.
