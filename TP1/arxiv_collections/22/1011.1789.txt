We consider spin-polarized abelian quantum Hall states in the Tao-Thouless
limit, {\it ie} on a thin torus. For any filling factor $\nu=p/q$ a
well-defined sector of low-energy states is identified and the exclusion
statistics of the excitations is determined. We study numerically, at and near
$\nu=1/3$ and $2/5$, how the low energy states develop as one moves away from
the TT-limit towards the physical regime. We find that the lowest energy states
in the physical regime develop from states in the low energy sector but that
the exclusion statistics is modified.
