Cellular automata have been mainly studied on very regular graphs carrying
the vertices (like lines or grids) and under synchronous dynamics (all vertices
update simultaneously). In this paper, we study how the asynchronism and the
graph act upon the dynamics of the classical Minority rule. Minority has been
well-studied for synchronous updates and is thus a reasonable choice to begin
with. Yet, beyond its apparent simplicity, this rule yields complex behaviors
when asynchronism is introduced. We investigate the transitory part as well as
the asymptotic behavior of the dynamics under full asynchronism (also called
sequential: only one random vertex updates at each time step) for several types
of graphs. Such a comparative study is a first step in understanding how the
asynchronous dynamics is linked to the topology (the graph).
  Previous analyses on the grid [1,2] have observed that Minority seems to
induce fast stabilization. We investigate here this property on arbitrary
graphs using tools such as energy, particles and random walks. We show that the
worst case convergence time is, in fact, strongly dependent on the topology. In
particular, we observe that the case of trees is non trivial.
