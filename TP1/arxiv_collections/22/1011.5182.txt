In the context of two-particle interferometry, we construct a parallel
transport condition that is based on the maximization of coincidence intensity
with respect to local unitary operations on one of the subsystems. The
dependence on correlation is investigated and it is found that the holonomy
group is generally non-Abelian, but Abelian for uncorrelated systems. It is
found that our framework contains the L\'{e}vay geometric phase [2004 {\it J.
Phys. A: Math. Gen.} {\bf 37} 1821] in the case of two-qubit systems undergoing
local SU(2) evolutions.
