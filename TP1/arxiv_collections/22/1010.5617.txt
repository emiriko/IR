We propose formulas for the L\"uscher type finite size energy correction of
multiparticle states on the interval and evaluate them for the simplest case in
the AdS/CFT setting. By this we determine the leading wrapping correction to
the anomalous dimension of the simplest determinant type operator, which
corresponds to a one particle state on the Y=0 brane.
