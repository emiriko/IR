We study non-convex elastic energy functionals associated to (spatially)
periodic, frame indifferent energy densities with a single non-degenerate
energy well at SO(n). Under the assumption that the energy density admits a
quadratic Taylor expansion at identity, we prove that the Gamma-limits
associated to homogenization and linearization commute. Moreover, we show that
the homogenized energy density, which is determined by a multi-cell
homogenization formula, has a quadratic Taylor expansion with a quadratic term
that is given by the homogenization of the quadratic term associated to the
linearization of the initial energy density.
