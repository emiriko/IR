We construct the $CP$-odd weak basis invariants in the flavor basis for all
the phenomenologically viable neutrino mass matrices with a texture zero and a
vanishing minor and, also, find the necessary and sufficient conditions for
$CP$ invariance . We examine the interrelationships between different $CP$-odd
weak basis invariants for these texture structures and investigate their
implications for Dirac- and Majorana-type $CP$ violation.
