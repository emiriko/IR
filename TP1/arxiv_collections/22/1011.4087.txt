We present a general framework that reveals substructures of genuine
multipartite entanglement. Via simple inequalities it is possible to
discriminate different sets of multipartite qubit states. These inequalities
are beneficial regarding experimental examinations as only local measurements
are required. Furthermore, the number of observables scales favorably with
system size. In exemplary cases we demonstrate the noise resistance and discuss
implementations.
