Topological subsystem codes proposed recently by Bombin are quantum error
correcting codes defined on a two-dimensional grid of qubits that permit
reliable quantum information storage with a constant error threshold. These
codes require only the measurement of two-qubit nearest-neighbor operators for
error correction. In this paper we demonstrate that topological subsystem codes
(TSCs) can be viewed as generalizations of Kitaev's honeycomb model to
trivalent hypergraphs. This new connection provides a systematic way of
constructing TSCs and analyzing their properties. We also derive a necessary
and sufficient condition under which a syndrome measurement in a subsystem code
can be reduced to measurements of the gauge group generators. Furthermore, we
propose and implement some candidate decoding algorithms for one particular TSC
assuming perfect error correction. Our Monte Carlo simulations indicate that
this code, which we call the five-squares code, has a threshold against
depolarizing noise of at least 2%.
