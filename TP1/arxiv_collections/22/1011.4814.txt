The authors call attention to a previous work [Qing Lin and Bing He, Phys.
Rev. A 80, 042310 (2009)] on the realization of multi-qubit logic gates with
controlled-path and merging gate. We supplement the work by showing how to
efficiently build realistic quantum circuits in this approach and giving the
guiding rules for the task.
