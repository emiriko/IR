The effects of surface polar phonons on electronic transport properties of
monolayer graphene are studied by using a Monte Carlo simulation. Specifically,
the low-field electron mobility and saturation velocity are examined for
different substrates (SiC, SiO2, and HfO2) in comparison to the intrinsic case.
While the results show that the low-field mobility can be substantially reduced
by the introduction of surface polar phonon scattering, corresponding
degradation of the saturation velocity is not observed for all three substrates
at room temperature. It is also found that surface polar phonons can influence
graphene electrical resistivity even at low temperature, leading potentially to
inaccurate estimation of the acoustic phonon deformation potential constant.
