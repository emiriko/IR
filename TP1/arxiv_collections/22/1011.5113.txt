In this paper, we propose novel state-based algorithms which dynamically
control the random access network based on its current state such as channel
states of wireless links and backlog states of the queues. After formulating
the problem, corresponding algorithms with diverse control functions are
proposed. Consequently, it will be shown that the proposed state-based schemes
for control of the random access networks, results in significant performance
gains in comparison with previously proposed control algorithms. In order to
select an appropriate control function, performances of the state-based control
algorithms are compared for a wide range of traffic scenarios. It is also shown
that even an approximate knowledge of network statistics helps in selecting the
proper state dependent control function.
