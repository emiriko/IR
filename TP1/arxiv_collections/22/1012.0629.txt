Near the flavor SU(3) limit, we propose an analytical description for
color-flavor-locked-type Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) phase in the Nambu
Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model. The diquark behaviors in light-flavor and
strange-flavor-involved channels and Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of bound
diquark states are studied. When the attractive interaction between quarks is
strong enough, a BCS-BEC crossover is predicted in the environment with
color-flavor-locked pairing pattern. The resulting Bose-Einstein condensed
phase is found to be an intergrade phase before the emergence of the
previous-predicted BEC phase in two-flavor quark superconductor.
