Candidate transiting planet systems discovered by wide-field ground-based
surveys must go through an intensive follow-up procedure to distinguish the
true transiting planets from the much more common false positives. Especially
pernicious are configurations of three or more stars which produce radial
velocity and light curves that are similar to those of single stars transited
by a planet. In this contribution we describe the methods used by the HATNet
team to reject these blends, giving a few illustrative examples.
