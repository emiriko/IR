We propose that the strain induced effective pseudo-magnetic field in
graphene can also be explained by a curl movement of the Dirac points, if the
Dirac points can be regarded as a slowly varying function of position. We also
prove that the Dirac points must be confined within two triangles, each one has
1/8 the area of the Brillouin zone.
