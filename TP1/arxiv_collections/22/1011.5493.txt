We present a program for the numerical evaluation of multi-dimensional
polynomial parameter integrals. Singularities regulated by dimensional
regularisation are extracted using iterated sector decomposition. The program
evaluates the coefficients of a Laurent series in the regularisation parameter.
It can be applied to multi-loop integrals in Euclidean space as well as other
parametric integrals, e.g. phase space integrals.
