Recent experimental research with marine algae points towards quantum
entanglement at ambient temperature, with correlations between essential
biological units separated by distances as long as 20 Angstr\"oms. The
associated decoherence times, due to environmental influences, are found to be
of order 400 fs. This prompted some authors to connect such findings with the
possibility of some kind of quantum computation taking place in these
biological entities: within the decoherence time scales, the cell "quantum
calculates" the optimal "path" along which energy and signal would be
transported more efficiently. Prompted by these experimental results, in this
talk I remind the audience of a related topic proposed several years ago in
connection with the possible r\^ole of quantum mechanics and/or field theory on
dissipation-free energy transfer in microtubules (MT), which constitute
fundamental cell substructures. Quantum entanglement between tubulin dimers was
argued to be possible, provided there exists sufficient isolation from other
environmental cell effects. The model was based on certain ferroelectric
aspects of MT. In the talk I review the model and the associated experimental
tests so far and discuss future directions, especially in view of the algae
photo-experiments.
