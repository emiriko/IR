A great deal of research work has been undertaken in the alpha-clustering
study since the pioneering discovery, half a century ago, of 12C+12C molecular
resonances. Our knowledge of the field of the physics of nuclear molecules has
increased considerably and nuclear clustering remains one of the most fruitful
domains of nuclear physics, facing some of the greatest challenges and
opportunities in the years ahead. In this work, the occurence of "exotic"
shapes in light N=Z alpha-like nuclei is investigated. Various approaches of
superdeformed and hyperdeformed bands associated with quasimolecular resonant
structures are presented. Results on clustering aspects are also discussed for
light neutron-rich Oxygen isotopes.
