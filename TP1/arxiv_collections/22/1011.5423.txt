Neutral particles can couple with the $U(1)$ gauge field in the adjoint
representation at the tree level if the space-time coordinates are
noncommutative (NC). Considering neutrino-photon coupling in the NC QED
framework, we obtain the differential cross section of neutrino-electron
scattering. Similar to the magnetic moment effect, one of the NC terms is
proportional to $\frac 1 T$, where $T$ is the electron recoil energy.
Therefore, this scattering provides a chance to achieve a stringent bound on
the NC scale in low energy by improving the sensitivity to the smaller electron
recoil energy.
