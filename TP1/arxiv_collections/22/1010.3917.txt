We study slip avalanches in disordered materials under an increasing external
load in the framework of a fiber bundle model. Over-stressed fibers of the
model do not break, instead they relax in a stick-slip event which may trigger
an entire slip avalanche. Slip avalanches are characterized by the number
slipping fibers, by the slip length, and by the load increment, which triggers
the avalanche. Our calculations revealed that all three quantities are
characterized by power law distributions with universal exponents. We show by
analytical calculations and computer simulations that varying the amount of
disorder of slip thresholds and the number of allowed slips of fibers, the
system exhibits a disorder induced phase transition from a phase where only
small avalanches are formed to another one where a macroscopic slip appears.
