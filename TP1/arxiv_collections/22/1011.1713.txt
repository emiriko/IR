Three-dimensional studies of convection in deep spherical shells have been
used to test the hypothesis that the strong jet streams on Jupiter, Saturn,
Uranus, and Neptune result from convection throughout the molecular envelopes.
Due to computational limitations, these simulations must adopt viscosities and
heat fluxes many orders of magnitude larger than the planetary values. Several
numerical investigations have identified trends for how the mean jet speed
varies with heat flux and viscosity, but no previous theories have been
advanced to explain these trends. Here, we show using simple arguments that if
convective release of potential energy pumps the jets and viscosity damps them,
the mean jet speeds split into two regimes. When the convection is weakly
nonlinear, the equilibrated jet speeds should scale approximately with F/nu,
where F is the convective heat flux and nu is the viscosity. When the
convection is strongly nonlinear, the jet speeds are faster and should scale
approximately as (F/nu)^{1/2}. We demonstrate how this regime shift can
naturally result from a shift in the behavior of the jet-pumping efficiency
with heat flux and viscosity. Moreover, the simulations hint at a third regime
where, at sufficiently small viscosities, the jet speed becomes independent of
the viscosity. We show based on mixing-length estimates that if such a regime
exists, mean jet speeds should scale as heat flux to the 1/4 power. Our
scalings provide a good match to the mean jet speeds obtained in previous
Boussinesq and anelastic, three-dimensional simulations of convection within
giant planets over a broad range of parameters. When extrapolated to the real
heat fluxes, these scalings suggest that the mass-weighted jet speeds in the
molecular envelopes of the giant planets are much weaker--by an order of
magnitude or more--than the speeds measured at cloud level.
