We present a free energy functional for superfluid 3He in the presence of
homogeneously distributed impurity disorder which extends the Ginzburg-Landau
free energy functional to all temperatures. We use the new free energy
functional to calculate the thermodynamic potential, entropy, heat capacity and
density of states for the B-phase of superfluid 3He in homogeneous, isotropic
aerogel.
