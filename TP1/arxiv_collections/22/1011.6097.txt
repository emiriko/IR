Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) is used to replicate the signal combination
process that trading rules embody when they aggregate multiple sources of
financial information when predicting an asset's price movements. A set of
financially motivated kernels is constructed for the EURUSD currency pair and
is used to predict the direction of price movement for the currency over
multiple time horizons. MKL is shown to outperform each of the kernels
individually in terms of predictive accuracy. Furthermore, the kernel
weightings selected by MKL highlights which of the financial features
represented by the kernels are the most informative for predictive tasks.
