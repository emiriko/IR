For $\pi^0\eta$-photoproduction on the nucleon formal expressions are
developed for the five-fold differential cross section and the recoil
polarization including beam and target polarizations. The polarization
observables are described by various beam, target and beam-target asymmetries
for polarized photons and/or polarized nucleons. They are given as bilinear
hermitean forms in the reaction matrix elements divided by the unpolarized
cross section. Numerical results for the linear and circular beam asymmetries
for $\gamma p\to\pi^0\eta p$ are obtained within an isobar model and are
compared with existing data. Predictions are also given for the target
asymmetry $T_{11}$, and the beam-target asymmetries $T^c_{10}$ and $T^c_{11}$
for circularly polarized photons.
