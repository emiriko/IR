Two different "wave chaotic" systems, involving complex eigenvalues or
resonances, can be analyzed using common semiclassical methods. In particular,
one obtains fractal Weyl upper bounds for the density of resonances/eigenvalues
near the real axis, and a classical dynamical criterion for a spectral gap.
