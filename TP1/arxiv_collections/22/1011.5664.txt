We present observations of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect for the transiting
exoplanet systems WASP-1, WASP-24, WASP-38 and HAT-P-8, and deduce the
orientations of the planetary orbits with respect to the host stars' rotation
axes. The planets WASP-24b, WASP-38b and HAT-P-8b appear to move in prograde
orbits and be well aligned, having sky-projected spin orbit angles consistent
with zero: {\lambda} = -4.7 \pm 4.0{\deg}, {\lambda} = 15 + 33{\deg}/-43{\deg}
and {\lambda} = -9.7 +9.0{\deg}/-7.7{\deg}, respectively. The host stars have
Teff < 6250 K and conform with the trend of cooler stars having low
obliquities. WASP-38b is a massive planet on a moderately long period,
eccentric orbit so may be expected to have a misaligned orbit given the high
obliquities measured in similar systems. However, we find no evidence for a
large spin-orbit angle. By contrast, WASP-1b joins the growing number of
misaligned systems and has an almost polar orbit, {\lambda} = -79
+4.5{\deg}/-4.3{\deg}. It is neither very massive, eccentric nor orbiting a hot
host star, and therefore does not share the properties of many other misaligned
systems.
