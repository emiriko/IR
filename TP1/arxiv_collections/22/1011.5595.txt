We present four new transits of the planetary system TrES-3 observed between
2009 May and 2010 June. Among these, the third transit by itself indicates
possible evidence for brightness disturbance, which might be the result of the
planet blocking a cool starspot on the stellar surface. A total of 109 transit
times, including our measurements, were used to determine the improved
ephemeris with a transit epoch of 2454185.910944$\pm$0.000072 HJED and an
orbital period of 1.30618700$\pm$0.00000015 d. We analyzed the transit light
curves using the JKTEBOP code and adopting the quadratic limb-darkening law. In
order to derive the physical properties of the TrES-3 system, the transit
parameters are combined with the empirical relations from eclipsing binary
stars and stellar evolutionary models. The stellar mass and radius obtained
from a calibration using $T_A$, log $\rho_{\rm A}$ and [Fe/H] are consistent
with those from the isochrone analysis. We found that the exoplanet TrES-3b has
a mass of 1.93$\pm$0.07 M$_{\rm Jup}$, a radius of 1.30$\pm$0.04 R$_{\rm Jup}$,
a surface gravity of log $g_{\rm b}$=3.45$\pm$0.02, a density of 0.82$\pm$0.06
$\rho_{\rm Jup}$, and an equilibrium temperature of 1641$\pm$23 K. The results
are in good agreement with theoretical models for gas giant planets.
