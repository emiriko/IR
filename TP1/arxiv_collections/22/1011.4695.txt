It is shown that a "second (iron) knee" in cosmic ray spectrum expected at
energy about 100 PeV could not probably be found there. The reason is very
simple: the position of the "iron knee" depends on an answer to the questions:
"What do we see at 3-5 PeV? Is the knee seen at this energy associated with
proton or iron primaries?"
