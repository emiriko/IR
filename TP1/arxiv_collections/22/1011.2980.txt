The problem of response of nonequilibrium systems is currently under intense
investigation. We propose a general method of solution of the Liouville
Equation for thermostatted particle systems subjected to external forces which
retains only the slow degrees of freedom, by projecting out the majority of
fast variables. Response formulae, extending the Green-Kubo relations to
dissipative dynamics are provided, and comparison with numerical data is
presented.
