Starting from a given Markov kernel on a finite set $V$ and a bijection $g$
of $V$, we construct and study a time inhomogeneous Markov chain whose kernel
at time $n$ is obtained from $K$ by transport of $g^{n-1}$. We show that this
construction leads to interesting examples, and we obtain quantitative results
for some of these examples.
