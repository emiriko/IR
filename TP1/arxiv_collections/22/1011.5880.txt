We calculate and investigate the relativistic correlation function for
bipartite systems of spin-1/2 in vector and spin-1 particles in tensor states.
We show that the relativistic correlation function, which depends on particles
momenta, may have local extrema. What is more, the momentum dependance of the
correlation functions for two choices of relativistic spin operator may be
significantly different.
