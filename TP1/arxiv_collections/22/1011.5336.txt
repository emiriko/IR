We study a three-component superfluid Fermi gas in a spherically symmetric
harmonic trap using the Bogoliubov-deGennes method. We predict a coexistence
phase in which two pairing field order parameters are simultaneously nonzero,
in stark contrast to studies performed for trapped gases using local density
approximation. We also discuss the role of atom number conservation in the
context of a homogeneous system.
