Does the void environment have a sizable effect on the evolution of dwarf
galaxies? If yes, the best probes should be the most fragile least massive
dwarfs. We compiled a sample of about one hundred dwarfs with M_B in the range
-12 to -18 mag, falling within the nearby Lynx-Cancer void. The goal is to
study their evolutionary parameters -- gas metallicity and gas mass-fraction,
and to address the epoch of the first substantial episode of Star Formation.
Here we present and discuss the results of O/H measurements in 38 void
galaxies, among which several the most metal-poor galaxies are found with the
oxygen abundances of 12+log(O/H)=7.12-7.3 dex.
