A nonionic surfactant, the tri-ethylene glycol mono n-decyl ether (C10E3),
characterized by its lamellar phase state, was introduced in the interlayer of
a Na-montmorillonite clay at several concentrations. The synthesized
organoclays were characterized by Small Angle X-Ray Scattering in conjunction
with Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy, and adsorption isotherms.
Experiments showed that a bilayer of C10E3 was intercalated into the interlayer
space of the naturally exchanged Na-montmorillonite, resulting in the
aggregation of the lyotropic liquid crystal state in the lamellar phase. This
behavior strongly differs from previous observations of confinement of nonionic
surfactants in clays where the expansion of the interlayer space was limited to
two monolayers parallel to the silicate surface and cationic surfactants in
clays where the intercalation of organic compounds is introduced into the clay
galleries through ion exchange. The confinement of a bilayer of C10E3 nonionic
surfactant in clays offers new perspectives for the realization of hybrid
nanomaterials since the synthesized organoclays preserve the electrostatic
characteristics of the clays, thus allowing further ion exchange, while
presenting at the same time a hydrophobic surface and a maximum opening of the
interlayer space for the adsorption of neutral organic molecules of important
size with functional properties.
