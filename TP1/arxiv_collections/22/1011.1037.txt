We develop a comprehensive study on sharp potential type Riemannian Sobolev
inequalities of order 2 by means of a local geometric Sobolev inequality of
same kind and suitable De Giorgi-Nash-Moser estimates. In particular we discuss
questions like continuous dependence of optimal constants and existence and
compactness of extremal maps. The main obstacle arising in the present setting
lies at fairly weak conditions of regularity assumed on potential functions.
