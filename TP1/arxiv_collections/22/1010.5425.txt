This paper advocates use of the atomic orbitals which have direct physical
interpretation, i.e. Coulomb Sturmians and hydrogen-like orbitals. They are
exponential type orbitals (ETOs). Their radial nodes are shown to be essential
in obtaining accurate nuclear shielding tensors for NMR work. The present work
builds on a 2003 French PhD and many numerical results were published by 2007.
The improvements in this paper are noteworthy, the key being the actual basis
function choice.
  Until 2008, their products on different atoms were difficult to manipulate
for the evaluation of two-electron integrals. Coulomb resolutions provide an
excellent approximation that reduces these integrals to a sum of one-electron
overlap-like integral products that each involve orbitals on at most two
centers. Such two-center integrals are separable in prolate spheroidal
co-ordinates. They are thus readily evaluated. Only these integrals need to be
re-evaluated to change basis functions.
  In this paper, a review of the translation procedures for Slater type
orbitals (STO) and for Coulomb Sturmians follows that of the more recent
application to ETOs of a particularly convenient Coulomb resolution.
