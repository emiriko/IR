Nuclear norm minimization (NNM) has recently gained significant attention for
its use in rank minimization problems. Similar to compressed sensing, using
null space characterizations, recovery thresholds for NNM have been studied in
\cite{arxiv,Recht_Xu_Hassibi}. However simulations show that the thresholds are
far from optimal, especially in the low rank region. In this paper we apply the
recent analysis of Stojnic for compressed sensing \cite{mihailo} to the null
space conditions of NNM. The resulting thresholds are significantly better and
in particular our weak threshold appears to match with simulation results.
Further our curves suggest for any rank growing linearly with matrix size $n$
we need only three times of oversampling (the model complexity) for weak
recovery. Similar to \cite{arxiv} we analyze the conditions for weak, sectional
and strong thresholds. Additionally a separate analysis is given for special
case of positive semidefinite matrices. We conclude by discussing simulation
results and future research directions.
