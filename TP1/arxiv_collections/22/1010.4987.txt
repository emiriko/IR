In a Markovian model for a financial market, we characterize the best
arbitrage with respect to the market portfolio that can be achieved using
nonanticipative investment strategies, in terms of the smallest positive
solution to a parabolic partial differential inequality; this is determined
entirely on the basis of the covariance structure of the model. The solution is
intimately related to properties of strict local martingales and is used to
generate the investment strategy which realizes the best possible arbitrage.
Some extensions to non-Markovian situations are also presented.
