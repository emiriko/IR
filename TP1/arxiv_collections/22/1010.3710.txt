We demonstrate a 5-GHz-broadband tunable slow-light device based on
stimulated Brillouin scattering in a standard highly-nonlinear optical fiber
pumped by a noise-current-modulated laser beam. The noise modulation waveform
uses an optimized pseudo-random distribution of the laser drive voltage to
obtain an optimal flat-topped gain profile, which minimizes the pulse
distortion and maximizes pulse delay for a given pump power. Eye-diagram and
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) analysis show that this new broadband slow-light
technique significantly increases the fidelity of a delayed data sequence,
while maintaining the delay performance. A fractional delay of 0.81 with a SNR
of 5.2 is achieved at the pump power of 350 mW using a 2-km-long highly
nonlinear fiber with the fast noise-modulation method, demonstrating a 50%
increase in eye-opening and a 36% increase in SNR compared to a previous
slow-modulation method.
