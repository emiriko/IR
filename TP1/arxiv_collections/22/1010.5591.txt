The basic mechanism responsible for radio emission in radio-loud active
galactic nuclei (AGNs) is assumed to be synchrotron radiation. We suggest here
that radio emission in radio-quiet objects is also due to synchrotron radiation
of particles accelerated in shocks. We consider generic shocks and study the
resulting synchrotron properties. We estimate the synchrotron radio luminosity
and compare it with the X-ray component produced by inverse Compton emission.
We obtain that the radio to X-ray luminosity ratio is much smaller than unity,
with values typical of radio-quiet sources. The predicted trends on source
parameters, black hole mass and accretion rate, may account for the
anticorrelation between radio-loudness and Eddington ratio observed in
different AGN samples.
