We prove a general archimedean positivstellensatz for hermitian
operator-valued polynomials and show that it implies the multivariate
Fejer-Riesz Theorem of Dritschel-Rovnyak and positivstellens\"atze of
Ambrozie-Vasilescu and Scherer-Hol. We also obtain several generalizations of
these and related results. The proof of the main result depends on an extension
of the abstract archimedean positivstellensatz for *-algebras that is
interesting in its own right.
