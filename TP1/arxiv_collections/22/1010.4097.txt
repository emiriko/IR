In this work we show that from the spectrum of particles of a 3-3-1 gauge
model with heavy sterile neutrinos we can have up to three Cold Dark Matter
candidates as WIMPs. We obtain their relic abundance and analyze their
compatibility with recent direct detection experiments, exploring the
possibility of explaining the two events reported by CDMS-II. An interesting
outcome of this 3-3-1 model, concerning direct detection of two WIMPs in the
model, is a strong bound on the symmetry breaking scale, which imposes it to be
above 3 TeV.
