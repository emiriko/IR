Context. Palomar\,1 is a peculiar globular cluster (GC). It is the youngest
Galactic GC and it has been tentatively associated to several of the
substructures recently discovered in the Milky Way (MW), including the Canis
Major (CMa) overdensity and the Galactic Anticenter Stellar Structure (GASS).
Aims. In order to provide further insights into its origin, we present the
first high resolution chemical abundance analysis for one red giant in Pal\,1.
Methods. We obtained high resolution (R=30000) spectra for one red giant star
in Pal\,1 using the High Dispersion Spectrograph (HDS) mounted at the SUBARU
telescope. We used ATLAS-9 model atmospheres coupled with the SYNTHE and WIDTH
calculation codes to derive chemical abundances from the measured line
equivalent widths of 18 among $\alpha$, Iron-peak, light and heavy elements.
Results. The Palomar~1 chemical pattern is broadly compatible to that of the MW
open clusters population and similar to disk stars. It is, instead, remarkably
different from that of the Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf spheroidal galaxy.
Conclusions. If Pal\,1 association with either CMa or GASS will be confirmed,
this will imply that these systems had a chemical evolution similar to that of
the Galactic disk.
