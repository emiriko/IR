The flavor-separated polarized parton distribution functions for light quarks
and anti-quarks in the proton can be studied in the production of $W$ bosons in
$p$+$p$ collisions. The $W$s are produced in processes like
$u+\bar{d}\rightarrow W^+$ and $\bar{u}+ d \rightarrow W^-$ and we observe the
lepton (an electron or muon) from the decay channel $W^{\pm}\rightarrow
l^{\pm}\nu$. The electron energy spectrum from $W$ decays measured with an
integrated luminosity of approximately 10 pb$^{-1}$ will be shown, with a
measurement of the electron single spin asymmetry in central rapidity.
