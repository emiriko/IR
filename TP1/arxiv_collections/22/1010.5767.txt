Examples of glasses are abundant, yet it remains one of the phases of matter
whose understanding is very elusive. In recent years, remarkable experiments
have been performed on the dynamical aspects of glasses. Electron glasses offer
a particularly good example of the 'trademarks' of glassy behavior, such as
aging and slow relaxations. In this work we review the experimental literature
on electron glasses, as well as the local mean-field theoretical framework put
forward in recent years to understand some of these results. We also present
novel theoretical results explaining the periodic aging experiment.
