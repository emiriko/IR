This book consists of the chapters describing novel approaches to integrating
fault tolerance into software development process. They cover a wide range of
topics focusing on fault tolerance during the different phases of the software
development, software engineering techniques for verification and validation of
fault tolerance means, and languages for supporting fault tolerance
specification and implementation. Accordingly, the book is structured into the
following three parts: Part A: Fault tolerance engineering: from requirements
to code; Part B: Verification and validation of fault tolerant systems; Part C:
Languages and Tools for engineering fault tolerant systems.
