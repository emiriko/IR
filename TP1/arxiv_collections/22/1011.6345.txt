In the absence of fractures, methane bubbles in deep-water sediments can be
immovably trapped within a porous matrix by surface tension. The dominant
mechanism of transfer of gas mass therefore becomes the diffusion of gas
molecules through porewater. The accurate description of this process requires
non-Fickian diffusion to be accounted for, including both thermodiffusion and
gravitational action. We evaluate the diffusive flux of aqueous methane
considering non-Fickian diffusion and predict the existence of extensive bubble
mass accumulation zones within deep-water sediments. The limitation on the
hydrate deposit capacity is revealed; too weak deposits cannot reach the base
of the hydrate stability zone and form any bubbly horizon.
