The number of defects which are generated on crossing a quantum phase
transition can be minimized by choosing properly designed time-dependent
pulses. In this work we determine what are the ultimate limits of this
optimization. We discuss under which conditions the production of defects
across the phase transition is vanishing small. Furthermore we show that the
minimum time required to enter this regime is $T\sim \pi/\Delta$, where
$\Delta$ is the minimum spectral gap, unveiling an intimate connection between
an optimized unitary dynamics and the intrinsic measure of the Hilbert space
for pure states. Surprisingly, the dynamics is non-adiabatic, this result can
be understood by assuming a simple two-level dynamics for the many-body system.
Finally we classify the possible dynamical regimes in terms of the action
$s=T\Delta$.
