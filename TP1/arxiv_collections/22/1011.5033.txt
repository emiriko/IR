The recent availability of blue sensitive silicon photomultipliers allows the
direct readout of blue emitting plastic scintillator tiles without the use of a
wavelength shifting fiber. Such directly read out tiles, without light guides,
are attractive for the use in highly granular calorimeters that use large
numbers of individual cells and in other applications where very compact
designs are needed. However, the total signal amplitude and the uniformity of
the response can be problematic in such cases. We have developed a scanning
setup to investigate the response of scintillator tiles with SiPM readout in
detail. It was used to develop optimized scintillator tile geometries for
highly granular hadronic calorimetry at future colliders and to investigate the
feasibility of a SiPM readout for the trigger of the ATLAS ALFA luminosity
detectors. We report on results obtained with specialized scintillator tile
geometries, discuss first results obtained with directly coupled SiPM readout
of the ATLAS ALFA trigger tiles and introduce the application of fiberless
readout in an experiment to study the time structure of hadronic showers.
