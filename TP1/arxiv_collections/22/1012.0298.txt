We present the first 3+1 dimensional simulations of non-Abelian plasma
instabilities in gauge-covariant Boltzmann-Vlasov equations for the QCD gauge
group SU(3) as well as for SU(4) and SU(5). The real-time evolution of
instabilities for a plasma with stationary momentum-space anisotropy is studied
using a hard-loop effective theory that is discretized in the velocities of
hard particles. We find that the numerically less expensive calculations using
the group SU(2) essentially reproduce the nonperturbative dynamics of
non-Abelian plasma instabilities with higher rank gauge groups provided the
mass parameters of the corresponding hard-loop effective theories are the same.
In particular we find very similar spectra for the turbulent cascade that forms
in the strong-field regime, which is associated with an approximately linear
growth of energy in collective fields. The magnitude of the linear growth
however turns out to increase with the number of colors.
