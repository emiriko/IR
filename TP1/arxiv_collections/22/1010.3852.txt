The purpose of this study is to determine the nature of the oxidation
products of FeII-III hydroxycarbonate FeII4FeIII2(OH)12CO3~3H2O (green rust
GR(CO32-)) by using the miniaturised M\"ossbauer spectrometer MIMOS II. Two
M\"ossbauer measurements methods are used: method (i) with green rust pastes
coated with glycerol and spread into Plexiglas sample holders, and method (ii)
with green rust pastes in the same sample holders but introduced into a
gas-tight cell with a beryllium window under a continuous nitrogen flow. Method
(ii) allows us to follow the continuous deprotonation of GR(CO32-) into the
fully ferric deprotonated form FeIII6O4(OH)8CO3~3H2O by adding the correct
amount of H2O2, without any further oxidation or degradation of the samples.
