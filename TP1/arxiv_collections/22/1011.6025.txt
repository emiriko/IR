In the framework of the HIFISTARS guaranteed time key programme, we measured
more than 70 molecular emission lines with high signal-to-noise ratio towards
VY CMa using the high-resolution HIFI spectrometer on board the Herschel
satellite. The kinematic information obtained from the measured water lines
supports the hypothesis of multiple outflow components. The observed
high-intensity maser lines give no indication for strong polarisation.
