We review the developments in modeling gravitational recoil from merging
black-hole binaries and introduce a new set of 20 simulations to test our
previously proposed empirical formula for the recoil. The configurations are
chosen to represent generic binaries with unequal masses and precessing spins.
Results of these simulations indicate that the recoil formula is accurate to
within a few km/s in the similar mass-ratio regime for the out-of-plane recoil.
