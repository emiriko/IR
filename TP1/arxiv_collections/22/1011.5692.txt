We evolve nonadiabatic charged spherical distributions of matter. Dissipation
is described by the free-streaming approximation. We match a self-similar
interior solution with the Reissner-Nordstr\"om-Vaidya exterior solution. The
transport mechanism is decisive to the fate of the gravitational collapse.
Almost a half of the total initial mass is radiated away. The transport
mechanism determines the way in which the electric charge is redistributed.
