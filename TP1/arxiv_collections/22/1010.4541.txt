We use Monte Carlo simulation to study the vortex nucleation on magnetic
nanodots at low temperature. In our simulations, we have considered a simple
microscopic two-dimensional anisotropic Heisenberg model with term to describe
the anisotropy due to the presence of the nanodot edge. We have considered the
thickness of the edge, which was not considered in previous works, introducing
a term that controls the energy associated to the edge. Our results clearly
show that the thickness of the edge has a considerable influence in the vortex
nucleation on magnetic nanodots. We have obtained the hysteresis curve for
several values of the surface anisotropy and skin depth parameter ($\xi$). The
results are in excellent agreement with experimental data.
