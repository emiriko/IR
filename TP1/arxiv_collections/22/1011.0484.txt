We report a study of graphene and graphene field effect devices after
exposure to a series of short pulses of oxygen plasma. We present data from
Raman spectroscopy, back-gated field-effect and magneto-transport measurements.
The intensity ratio between Raman "D" and "G" peaks, I(D)/I(G) (commonly used
to characterize disorder in graphene) is observed to increase approximately
linearly with the number (N(e)) of plasma etching pulses initially, but then
decreases at higher Ne. We also discuss implications of our data for extracting
graphene crystalline domain sizes from I(D)/I(G). At the highest Ne measured,
the "2D" peak is found to be nearly suppressed while the "D" peak is still
prominent. Electronic transport measurements in plasma-etched graphene show an
up-shifting of the Dirac point, indicating hole doping. We also characterize
mobility, quantum Hall states, weak localization and various scattering lengths
in a moderately etched sample. Our findings are valuable for understanding the
effects of plasma etching on graphene and the physics of disordered graphene
through artificially generated defects.
