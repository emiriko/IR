After a brief introduction to the fermionic projector approach, we review how
entanglement and second quantized bosonic and fermionic fields can be described
in this framework. The constructions are discussed with regard to decoherence
phenomena and the measurement problem. We propose a mechanism leading to the
collapse of the wave function in the quantum mechanical measurement process.
