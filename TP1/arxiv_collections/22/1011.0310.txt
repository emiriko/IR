We investigate medium effects on mesonic screening lengths for QCD with
2-flavours of dynamical staggered quarks on lattices with cutoff a=1/6T.
Denoting the cross-over temperature by $T_c$, we vary the temperature T from
0.89$T_c$ to 1.92$T_c$, spanning both the hadronic and quark gluon plasma
phases. While chiral symmetry restoration in the vector channel appears to take
place near $T_c$, it is seen in the scalar channel only above 1.33 $T_c$.
Varying spatial lattice sizes, we find very little volume dependence in our
results at 0.94 $T_c$. We discuss the stability of the scalar meson at these
temperatures.
