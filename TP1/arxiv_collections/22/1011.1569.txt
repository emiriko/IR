We present 'BYTe', a comprehensive 'hot' line list for the ro-vibrational
transitions of ammonia, 14NH3, in its ground electronic state. This line list
has been computed variationally using the program suite TROVE, a new
spectroscopically-determined potential energy surface and an ab initio dipole
moment surface. BYTe, is designed to be used at all temperatures up to 1500K.
It comprises 1137650964 transitions in the frequency range from 0 to 12000
cm-1, constructed from 1366519 energy levels below 18000 cm-1 having J values
below 36. Comparisons with laboratory data confirm the accuracy of the line
list which is suitable for modelling a variety of astrophysical problems
including the atmospheres of extrasolar planets and brown dwarfs.
