In the present work we investigate the cosmological implications of the
entropy-corrected holographic dark energy (ECHDE) density in the Gauss-Bonnet
framework. This is motivated from the loop quantum gravity corrections to the
entropy-area law. Assuming the two cosmological scenarios are valid
simultaneously, we show that there is a correspondence between the ECHDE
scenario in flat universe and the phantom dark energy model in the framework of
Gauss-Bonnet theory with a potential. This correspondence leads consistently to
an accelerating universe.
