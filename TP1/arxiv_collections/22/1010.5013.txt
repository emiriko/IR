The first higher derivative term of the photon sector of Lorentz-violating
QED, with operator of mass dimension $d=5$, is radiatively induced from the
fermion sector, in which contains a derivative term with the dimensionless
coefficient $g^{\lambda\mu\nu}$. The calculation is performed perturbatively in
the coefficient for Lorentz violation, and due to the fact that the
contributions are quadratically divergent, we adopt dimensional regularization.
