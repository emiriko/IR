A systematic study of Ca+ atomic properties is carried out using
high-precision relativistic all-order method where all single, double, and
partial triple excitations of the Dirac-Fock wave functions are included to all
orders of perturbation theory. Reduced matrix elements, oscillator strengths,
transition rates, and lifetimes are determined for the levels up to n = 7.
Recommended values and estimates of their uncertainties are provided for a
large number of electric-dipole transitions. Electric-dipole scalar
polarizabilities for the 5s, 6s, 7s, 8s, 4p, 5p, 3d, and 4d states and tensor
polarizabilities for the 4p, 5p, 3d, and 4d states in Ca+ are calculated.
Methods are developed to accurately treat the contributions from highly-excited
states, resulting in significant (factor of 3) improvement in accuracy of the
3d_{5/2} static polarizability value, 31.8(3) a.u., in comparison with the
previous calculation [Arora et al., Phys. Rev. A 76, 064501 (2007)]. The
blackbody radiation (BBR) shift of the 4s - 3d_{5/2} clock transition in Ca+ is
calculated to be 0.381(4) Hz at room temperature, T=300K. Electric-quadrupole
4s -nd and electric-octupole 4s -nf matrix elements are calculated to obtain
the ground state multipole E2 and E3 static polarizabilities. The hyperfine
constants A are determined for the low-lying levels up to n = 7. The quadratic
Stark effect on hyperfine structure levels of 43Ca+ ground state is
investigated. These calculations provide recommended values critically
evaluated for their accuracy for a number of Ca+ atomic properties for use in
planning and analysis of various experiments as well as theoretical modeling.
