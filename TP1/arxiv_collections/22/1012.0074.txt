The BABAR Collaboration performed a search for xi(2220) production in the
initial-state radiation process e^+e^- --> gamma J/psi, J/psi --> gamma K^+K^-
or J/psi --> gamma K^0_SK^0_S. No evidence for the xi(2220) resonance has been
found. The 90% confidence level upper limits on the product of branching
fractions are sensitive to the spin and helicity hypotheses. These upper limits
are of the order 10^-5, below the values reported in previous experiments. Also
at BABAR, the decays B --> J/psi pi^+ pi^- pi^0 K are studied to search for the
decay X(3872) --> J/psi omega. This search yields a four standard deviation
evidence for X(3872) --> J/psi omega, with product branching fractions of B(B^+
--> X(3872)K^+) x B(X(3872) --> J/psi omega)=[0.6 +- 0.2(stat) +- 0.1(syst) ] x
10^-5, and B(B^0 --> X(3872)K^0) x B(X(3872) --> J/psi omega =[0.6 +- 0.3(stat)
+- 0.1(syst) ] x 10^-5. A detailed study of the pi^+ pi^- pi^0 mass
distribution from X(3872) decay favors a negative-parity assignment but does
not rule out the positive-parity hypothesis.
