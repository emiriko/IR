The experimental conditions leading to substantial reduction of
backscattering decay instability threshold in ECRH experiments in toroidal
devices are analyzed. It is shown that drastic decrease of threshold is
provided by non monotonic behaviour of plasma density, which is often observed
due to so-called density-pump-out effect or presence of magnetic islands, and
by poloidal magnetic field inhomogeniety making possible localization of ion
Bernstein decay waves. The corresponding ion Bernstein wave gain and the
parametric decay instability pump power threshold is calculated. The possible
experimental consequences of easy backscattering decay instability excitation
are discussed.
