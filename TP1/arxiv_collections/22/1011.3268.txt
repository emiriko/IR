The Generalized Second Price auction is the primary method by which sponsered
search advertisements are sold. We study the performance of this auction under
various equilibrium concepts. In particular, we demonstrate that the Bayesian
Price of Anarchy is at most $2(1-1/e)^{-1} \approx 3.16$, significantly
improving upon previously known bounds.
  Our techniques are intuitively straightforward and extend in a number of
ways. For one, our result extends to a bound on the performance of GSP at
coarse correlated equilibria, which captures (for example) a repeated-auction
setting in which agents apply regret-minimizing bidding strategies. In
addition, our analysis is robust against the presence of byzantine agents who
cannot be assumed to participate rationally.
  Additionally, we present tight bounds for the social welfare obtained at pure
NE for the special case of an auction for 3 slots, and discuss potential
methods for extending this analysis to an arbitrary number of slots.
