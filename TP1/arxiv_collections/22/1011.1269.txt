Many phenomena in physics, chemistry, and biology involve seeking an optimal
control to maximize an objective for a classical or quantum system which is
open and interacting with its environment. The complexity of finding an optimal
control for maximizing an objective is strongly affected by the possible
existence of sub-optimal maxima. Within a unified framework under specified
conditions, control objectives for maximizing at a terminal time physical
observables of open classical and quantum systems are shown to be inherently
free of sub-optimal maxima. This attractive feature is of central importance
for enabling the discovery of controls in a seamless fashion in a wide range of
phenomena transcending the quantum and classical regimes.
