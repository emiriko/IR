In this paper we explore models in which we add a singlet scalar Higgs to the
Standard Model. All of these models explain the origin of the mass hierarchy
amongst the fermion masses and mixing angles. We discuss 24 different
variations on this model, and explore the different phenomenological
possibilities. We find that the phenomenological implications of all the models
are very similar except in the Higgs sector. Higgs decays and signals can be
altered very significantly in all the models, but break up into two distinct
classes. We also describe a systematic method for generating these models from
higher order interactions involving vector-like quarks and flavon scalars.
