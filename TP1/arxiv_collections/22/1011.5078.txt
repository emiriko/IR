Recently it has been suggested that magnetic fields prevent mirror particles
from entering the galactic disk, thereby disfavoring the mirror dark matter
explanation of the dark matter direct detection experiments. We show that
mirror particle self interactions will typically randomize the directions of
mirror particles on length scales much shorter than their gyroradius. This
means that mirror particles are free to enter the galactic disk and
consequently mirror dark matter remains consistent with all experiments and
observations.
