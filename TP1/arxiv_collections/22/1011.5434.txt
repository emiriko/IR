V417 Cen is a D'-type symbiotic system surrounded by a faint, extended
asymmetric nebula. Optical photometric observations of this object cover last
20 years. They show strong long term modulation with a period of about 1700
days and amplitude about 1.5 mag in V band, in addition to variations with
shorter times-scales and much lower amplitudes. In this presentation we discuss
possible reasons of these variations.
