We present a simple formula for the expected number of inversions in a
permutation of size $n$ obtained by applying $t$ random (not necessarily
adjacent) transpositions to the identity permutation. More general, for any
finite irreducible Coxeter group belonging to one of the infinite families
(type A, B, D, and I), an exact expression is obtained for the expected length
of a product of $t$ random reflections.
