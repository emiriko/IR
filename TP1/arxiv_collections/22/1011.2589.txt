We conclude that arguments of Norman et al. in their Comment do not provide a
significant basis for their claim that the geometric mechanism for explaining
the observations reported by them is not viable. More generally, our study
highlights the importance of assessing structural issues before invoking exotic
mechanisms for explaining unusual spectroscopic observations, especially in
complex materia.
