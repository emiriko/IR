Motivated by the unexplored complexity of phases present in the multiorbital
Hubbard model, we analyze in this work the behavior of a degenerate two-orbital
anisotropic Hubbard model at half filling where both orbitals have equal
bandwidths and one orbital is constrained to be paramagnetic (PM), while the
second one is allowed to have an antiferromagnetic (AF) solution. Such a model
may be relevant for a large class of correlated materials with competing
magnetic states in different orbitals like the recently discovered Fe-based
superconductors. Using a dynamical cluster approximation we observe that novel
orbital selective phase transitions appear regardless of the strength of the
Ising Hund's rule coupling $J_z$. Moreover, the PM orbital undergoes a
transition from a Fermi liquid (FL) to a Mott insulator through a non-FL phase
while the AF orbital shows a transition from a FL to an AF insulator through an
AF metallic phase. We discuss the implications of the results in the context of
the Fe-based superconductors.
