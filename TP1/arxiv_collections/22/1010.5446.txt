Equilibrium magnetization distribution of the vortex state magnetic
nanoparticle is affected by the influence of the spin-transfer torque: an
off-center out--of--plane vortex appears in the case of the disk shape particle
and pure planar vortex in the case of asymmetric ring shape particle. The spin
current causes extra out-of-plane magnetization structures identical to well
known dip structures for the moving vortex. The shape of the dip structure
depends on the current strength and value of the off-center displacement and it
does not depend on the vortex polarity. The critical current depends on the
nanodot thickness.
