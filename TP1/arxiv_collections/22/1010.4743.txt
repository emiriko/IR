We present photometric properties and distance measurements of 252 high
redshift Type Ia supernovae (0.15 < z < 1.1) discovered during the first three
years of the Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS). These events were detected and
their multi-colour light curves measured using the MegaPrime/MegaCam instrument
at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT), by repeatedly imaging four
one-square degree fields in four bands. Follow-up spectroscopy was performed at
the VLT, Gemini and Keck telescopes to confirm the nature of the supernovae and
to measure their redshifts. Systematic uncertainties arising from light curve
modeling are studied, making use of two techniques to derive the peak
magnitude, shape and colour of the supernovae, and taking advantage of a
precise calibration of the SNLS fields. A flat LambdaCDM cosmological fit to
231 SNLS high redshift Type Ia supernovae alone gives Omega_M = 0.211 +/-
0.034(stat) +/- 0.069(sys). The dominant systematic uncertainty comes from
uncertainties in the photometric calibration. Systematic uncertainties from
light curve fitters come next with a total contribution of +/- 0.026 on
Omega_M. No clear evidence is found for a possible evolution of the slope
(beta) of the colour-luminosity relation with redshift.
