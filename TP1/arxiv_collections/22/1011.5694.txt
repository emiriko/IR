The depth of a visible surface of a scene is the distance between the surface
and the sensor. Recovering depth information from two-dimensional images of a
scene is an important task in computer vision that can assist numerous
applications such as object recognition, scene interpretation, obstacle
avoidance, inspection and assembly. Various passive depth computation
techniques have been developed for computer vision applications. They can be
classified into two groups. The first group operates using just one image. The
second group requires more than one image which can be acquired using either
multiple cameras or a camera whose parameters and positioning can be changed.
This project is aimed to find the real depth of the object from the camera
which had been used to click the photograph. An n-degree polynomial was
formulated, which maps the pixel depth of an image to the real depth. In order
to find the coefficients of the polynomial, an experiment was carried out for a
particular lens and thus, these coefficients are a unique feature of a
particular camera. The procedure explained in this report is a monocular
approach for estimation of depth of a scene. The idea involves mapping the
Pixel Depth of the object photographed in the image with the Real Depth of the
object from the camera lens with an interpolation function. In order to find
the parameters of the interpolation function, a set of lines with predefined
distance from camera is used, and then the distance of each line from the
bottom edge of the picture (as the origin line) is calculated.
