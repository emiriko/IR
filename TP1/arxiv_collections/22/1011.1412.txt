The low flux infrared imaging needs performant high wavelength detectors.
Quantum Well Infrared Photodetectors (QWIP), thanks to the maturity of GaAs,
the possibility to adjust the detected wavelength on a large range and to
realize large uniform matrix are good candidate for such applications. In order
to validate this interest, we have performed an electro-optic characterization
of a 15{\mu}m sample. These measurements have been used to simulate the
performance of a camera based on this QWIP and used in a low infrared photons
flux scenario. We predict that this QWIP would succeed. Nevertheless these
simulations also underline the detrimental role of the dark current. Thus we
have developed a simulation tool based on a hoping approach between localized
states, which provide us a better understanding of the transport in these
heterostructures. The code has in particular underlines the role plays by the
electron -ionized impurities interaction, which make the dark current very
sensitive to the doping profile. Using this tool we have designed new
structures, with optimized doping profile, in which the scattering rate has
been decreased by a factor two. Moreover we have identified a quantum origin to
the plateau shape of the I(V) curve. This code is more generally a useful
simulation tool for the transport in h\'et\'erostructures. The influence of
growth defects (non ideal interface and disorder) has been quantized and we
have performed the first evaluation of The R0A in a THz QCD. Finally non local
transport effects have been investigated. Saw teeth observation on the I(V)
curves have been modeled and their influence on the detectivty estimated.
