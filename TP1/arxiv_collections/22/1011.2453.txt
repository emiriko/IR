We consider an analytic way to make the interacting N-body problem tractable
by using harmonic oscillators in place of the relevant two-body interactions.
The two body terms of the N-body Hamiltonian are approximated by considering
the energy spectrum and radius of the relevant two-body problem which gives
frequency, center position, and zero point energy of the corresponding harmonic
oscillator. Adding external harmonic one-body terms, we proceed to solve the
full quantum mechanical N-body problem analytically for arbitrary masses.
Energy eigenvalues, eigenmodes, and correlation functions like density matrices
can then be computed analytically. As a first application of our formalism, we
consider the N-boson problem in two- and three dimensions where we fit the
two-body interactions to agree with the well-known zero-range model for two
particles in a harmonic trap. Subsequently, condensate fractions, spectra,
radii, and eigenmodes are discussed as function of dimension, boson number N,
and scattering length obtained in the zero-range model. We find that energies,
radii, and condensate fraction increase with scattering length as well as boson
number, while radii decrease with increasing boson number. Our formalism is
completely general and can also be applied to fermions, Bose-Fermi mixtures,
and to more exotic geometries.
