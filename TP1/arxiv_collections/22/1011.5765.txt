The spin-charge-family theory offers a possible explanation for the
assumptions of the standard model - for the charges of a family members, for
the gauge fields, for the appearance of families, for the the scalar fields -
interpreting the standard model as its low energy effective manifestation. The
spin-charge-family theory predicts at the low energy regime two decoupled
groups of four families of quarks and leptons. The predicted fourth family
waits to be observed, while the stable fifth family is the candidate to form
the dark matter. The Higss and Yukawa couplings are the low energy effective
manifestation of several scalar fields, all with the bosonic (adjoint)
representations with respect to all the charge groups, with the family groups
included. Properties of the families are analysed and relations among coherent
contributions of the loop corrections to fermion properties discussed,
including the one which enables the existence of the Majorana neutrinos. The
appearance of several scalar fields is presented, their properties discussed,
it is explained how these scalar fields can effectively be interpreted as the
{\em standard model} Higgs (with the fermion kind of charges) and the Yukawa
couplings, and a possible explanation why the Higgs has not yet been observed
offered. The relation to proposals that the Yukawas follow from the SU(3)
family (flavour) group, having the family charges in the fundamental
representations of these groups, is discussed. The spin-charge-family theory
predicts that there are no supersymmetric partners of the observed fermions and
bosons.
