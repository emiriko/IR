We study the spin exchange between two electrons localized in separate
quantum dots in graphene. The electronic states in the conduction band are
coupled indirectly by tunneling to a common continuum of delocalized states in
the valence band. As a model, we use a two-impurity Anderson Hamiltonian which
we subsequently transform into an effective spin Hamiltonian by way of a
two-stage Schrieffer-Wolff transformation. We then compare our result to that
from a Coqblin-Schrieffer approach as well as to fourth order perturbation
theory.
