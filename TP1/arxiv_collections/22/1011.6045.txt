A 60 GHz wireless Gigabit Ethernet (G.E.) communication system capable of
near gigabit data rate has been developed at IETR. The realized system covers 2
GHz available bandwidth. This paper describes the design and realization of the
overall system including the baseband (BB), intermediate frequency (IF) and
radiofrequency (RF) blocks. A differential binary shift keying (DBPSK)
modulation and a differential demodulation are adopted at IF. In the BB
processing block, an original byte/frame synchronization technique is designed
to provide a small value of the preamble false alarm and missing probabilities.
For the system performances, two different real scenarios are investigated:
measurements carried out in a large gym and in hallways. Bit error rate (BER)
measurements have been performed in different configurations: with/without RS
(255, 239) coding, with frame synchronization using 32/64 bits preambles. As
shown by simulation, the 64 bits preamble provides sufficient robustness and
improves the system performance in term of BER. At a data rate of 875 Mbps, a
BER of 10-8 was measured at 30 m using high gain antennas for line of-sight
(LOS) conditions.
