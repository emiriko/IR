Our work has focused on support for film or television scriptwriting. Since
this involves potentially varied story-lines, we note the implicit or latent
support for interactivity. Furthermore the film, television, games, publishing
and other sectors are converging, so that cross-over and re-use of one form of
product in another of these sectors is ever more common. Technically our work
has been largely based on mathematical algorithms for data clustering and
display. Operationally, we also discuss how our algorithms can support
collective, distributed problem-solving.
