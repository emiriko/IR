We prove the nonexistence of stable immersed minimal surfaces uniformly
conformally equivalent to the complex plane in any complete orientable
four-dimensional Riemannian manifold with uniformly positive isotropic
curvature. We also generalize the same nonexistence result to higher dimensions
provided that the ambient manifold has uniformly positive complex sectional
curvature. The proof consists of two parts, assuming an "eigenvalue condition"
on the Cauchy-Riemann operator of a holomorphic bundle, we prove (1) a
vanishing theorem for these holomorphic bundles on the complex plane; (2) an
existence theorem for holomorphic sections with controlled growth by
Hormander's weighted L^2-method.
