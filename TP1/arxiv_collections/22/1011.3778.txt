In 1651 the Italian Jesuit Giovanni Battista Riccioli (1598-1671) published
in his encyclopedic work on astronomy, the Almagestum Novum, 77 arguments
against the Copernican movement of the Earth. These arguments are often
mentioned in secondary sources, but a complete listing has not been readily
available - thus one is provided here, in English. The 77 include interesting
arguments from physics and astronomy that went on to become subjects of further
investigation after the advent of Newtonian physics.
