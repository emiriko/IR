Dynamical decoupling (DD) is an efficient tool for preserving quantum
coherence in solid-state spin systems. However, the imperfections of real
pulses can ruin the performance of long DD sequences. We investigate the
accumulation and compensation of different pulse errors in DD using the
electron spins of phosphorus donors in silicon as a test system. We study
periodic DD sequences (PDD) based on spin rotations about two perpendicular
axes, and their concatenated and symmetrized versions. We show that pulse
errors may quickly destroy some spin states, but maintain other states with
high fidelity over long times. Pulse sequences based on spin rotations about
$x$ and $y$ axes outperform those based on $x$ and $z$ axes due to the
accumulation of pulse errors. Concatenation provides an efficient way to
suppress the impact of pulse errors, and can maintain high fidelity for all
spin components: pulse errors do not accumulate (to first order) as the
concatenation level increases, despite the exponential increase in the number
of pulses. Our theoretical model gives a clear qualitative picture of the error
accumulation, and produces results in quantitative agreement with the
experiments.
