We demonstrate the application of graphene as a support for imaging
individual biological molecules in transmission electron microscope (TEM). A
simple procedure to produce free-standing graphene membranes has been designed.
Such membranes are extremely robust and can support practically any
sub-micrometer object. Tobacco mosaic virus has been deposited on graphene
samples and observed in a TEM. High contrast has been achieved even though no
staining has been applied.
