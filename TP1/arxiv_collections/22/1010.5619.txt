We study the full counting statistics (FCS) in a single-molecule magnet (SMM)
with finite Coulomb interaction $U$. For finite $U$ the FCS, differing from
$U\rightarrow \infty $, shows a symmetric gate-voltage-dependence when the
coupling strengths with two electrodes are interchanged, which can be observed
experimentally just by reversing the bias-voltages. Moreover, we find that the
effect of finite $U$ on shot noise depends on the internal level structure of
the SMM and the coupling asymmetry of the SMM with two electrodes as well. When
the coupling of the SMM with the incident-electrode is stronger than that with
the outgoing-electrode, the super-Poissonian shot noise in the sequential
tunneling regime appears under relatively small gate-voltage and relatively
large finite $U$, and dose not for $U\rightarrow \infty $; while it occurs at
relatively large gate-voltage for the opposite coupling case. The formation
mechanism of super-Poissonian shot noise can be qualitatively attributed to the
competition between fast and slow transport channels.
