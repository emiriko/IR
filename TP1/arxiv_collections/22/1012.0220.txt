Bacteriophages, phages for short, are viruses of bacteria. The majority of
phages contain a double-stranded DNA genome packaged in a capsid at a density
of ~500 mg/ml. This high density requires substantial compression of the normal
B form helix, leading to the conjecture that DNA in mature phage virions is
under significant pressure, and that pressure is used to eject the DNA during
infection. A large number of theoretical, computer simulation and in vitro
experimental studies surrounding this conjecture has revealed many --- though
often isolated and/or contradictory --- aspects of packaged DNA. This prompts
us to present a unified view of the statistical physics and thermodynamics of
DNA packaged in phage capsids. We argue that the DNA in a mature phage is in a
(meta)stable state, wherein electrostatic self-repulsion is balanced by
curvature stress due to confinement in the capsid. We show that in addition to
the osmotic pressure associated with the packaged DNA and its counterions,
there are four different pressures within the capsid: pressure on the DNA,
hydrostatic pressure, the pressure experienced by the capsid, and the pressure
associated with the chemical potential of DNA ejection. Significantly, we
analyze the mechanism of force transmission in the packaged DNA, and
demonstrate that the pressure on DNA is not important for ejection. We derive
equations showing a strong hydrostatic pressure difference across the capsid
shell. We propose that when a phage is triggered to eject by interaction with
its receptor in vitro, the (thermodynamic) incentive of water molecules to
enter the phage capsid flushes the DNA out of the capsid. In vivo, the
difference between the osmotic pressures in the bacterial cell cytoplasm and
the culture medium similarly results in a water flow that drags the DNA out of
the capsid and into the bacterial cell.
