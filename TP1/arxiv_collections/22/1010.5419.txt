Supersymmetry, a new symmetry that relates bosons and fermions in particle
physics, still escapes observation. Search for SUSY is one of the main aims of
the recently launched Large Hadron Collider. The other possible manifestation
of SUSY is the Dark Matter in the Universe. The present lectures contain a
brief introduction to supersymmetry in particle physics. The main notions of
supersymmetry are introduced. The supersymmetric extension of the Standard
Model - the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model - is considered in more
detail. Phenomenological features of the MSSM as well as possible experimental
signatures of SUSY at the LHC are described. The DM problem and its possible
SUSY solution is presented.
