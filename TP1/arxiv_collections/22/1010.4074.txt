Vibrational modes and instabilities of a dust particle pair in a terrestrial
laboratory complex plasma are investigated employing an analytical method
whereby the plasma wakefield induced by an external electric field is modeled
using an image charge method. It is found that for both horizontally and
vertically aligned dust particle pairs in equilibrium, four normal modes exist.
Variations of the confinement parameters cause a single type of instability in
the horizontal pair and two types of instabilities in the vertical pair.
