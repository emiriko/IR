Higgs bosons can be produced copiously at the LHC via gluon fusion induced by
top and bottom quark loops, and can be enhanced strongly if extra heavy quarks
exist. We present results for Higgs +zero-, one- and two-jet production at the
LHC, in both the Standard Model and the 4th generation model, by evaluating the
corresponding heavy quark triangle, box and pentagon Feynman diagrams. We
compare the results by using the effective Higgs-gluon interactions in the
limit of heavy quarks with the cross sections including the full mass
dependences. NLO effects with full mass dependence are included in the
inclusive Higgs boson production rate. Our results improve the theoretical
basis for fourth generation effects on the Higgs boson search at the LHC.
