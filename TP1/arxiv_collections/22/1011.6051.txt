Felix de Roy (1883-1942), an internationality recognised amateur astronomer,
made significant contributions to variable star research. As an active
observer, he made some 91,000 visual estimates of a number of different
variable stars. A Belgian national, he took refuge in England during World War
1. While there, de Roy became well enough known to later serve as Director of
the BAA Variable Star Section for seventeen years. Through this office, and his
connections with other organisations around the world, he encouraged others to
pursue the observation of variable stars. Not merely content to accumulate
observational data, de Roy also analysed the data and published numerous
papers.
