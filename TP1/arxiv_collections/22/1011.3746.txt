We construct for the first time an energy-momentum tensor for the
electromagnetic field of a p-brane in arbitrary dimensions, entailing finite
energy-momentum integrals. The construction relies on distribution theory and
is based on a Lorentz-invariant regularization, followed by the subtraction of
divergent and finite counterterms supported on the brane. The resulting
energy-momentum tensor turns out to be uniquely determined. We perform the
construction explicitly for a generic flat brane. For a brane in arbitrary
motion our approach provides a new paradigm for the derivation of the,
otherwise divergent, self-force of the brane. The so derived self-force is
automatically finite and guarantees, by construction, energy-momentum
conservation.
