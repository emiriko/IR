We present the results of our optical identification of the X-ray source IGR
J16547-1916 detected by the INTEGRAL observatory during a deep all-sky survey.
Analysis of the spectroscopic data from the SWIFT and INTEGRAL observatories in
the X-ray energy band and from the BTA (Special Astrophysical Observatory)
telescope in the optical band has shown that the source is most likely an
intermediate polar -- an accreting white dwarf with the mass of M~0.85 M_Sun in
a low-mass binary system. Subsequent studies of the object's rapid variability
with the RTT-150 telescope have confirmed this conclusion by revealing periodic
pulsations of its optical emission with a period of ~550 s.
