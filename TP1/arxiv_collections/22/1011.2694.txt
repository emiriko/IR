Colloidal particles that are confined to an interface effectively form a
two-dimensional fluid. We examine the dynamics of such colloids when they are
subject to a constant external force, which drives them in a particular
direction over the surface. Such a situation occurs, for example, for colloidal
particles that have settled to the bottom of their container, when the
container is tilted at an angle, so that they `sediment' to the lower edge of
the surface. We focus in particular on the case when there are attractive
forces between the colloids which causes them to phase separate into regions of
high density and low density and we study the influence of this phase
separation on the sedimentation process. We model the colloids as Brownian
particles and use both Brownian dynamics computer simulations and dynamical
density functional theory (DDFT) to obtain the time evolution of the ensemble
average one-body density profiles of the colloids. We consider situations where
the external potential varies only in one direction so that the ensemble
average density profiles vary only in this direction. We solve the DDFT in
one-dimension, by assuming that the density profile only varies in one
direction. However, we also solve the DDFT in two-dimensions, allowing the
fluid density profile to vary in both the $x$- and $y$-directions. We find that
in certain situations the two-dimensional DDFT is clearly superior to its
one-dimensional counterpart when compared with the simulations and we discuss
this issue.
