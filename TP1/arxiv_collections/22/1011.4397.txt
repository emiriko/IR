We report a measurement of exclusive $e^+e^-\to D_s^{(*)+} D_s^{(*)-}$ cross
sections as a function of center-of-mass energy near $D_s^{(*)+} D_s^{(*)-}$
threshold with initial-state radiation. The analysis is based on a data sample
collected with the Belle detector with an integrated luminosity of
$967\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$.
