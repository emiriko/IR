We studied the anomalous Josephson current appearing at zero phase difference
in junctions coupled with a ferromagnetic trilayer which has noncoplanar
magnetizations. A $\pi/2$ junction with an equilibrium phase difference $\pi/2$
is obtained under suitable conditions. The equilibrium phase difference and the
amplitude of the supercurrent are all tunable by the structure parameters. In
addition to calculating the anomalous current using the Bogoliubov-de Gennes
equation, we also developed a clear physical picture explaining the anomalous
Josephson effect in the structure. We show that the triplet proximity
correlation and the phase shift in the anomalous current-phase relation all
stem from the spin precession in the first and third ferromagnet layers.
