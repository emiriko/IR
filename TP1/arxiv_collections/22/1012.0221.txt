The STAR collaboration has reported precision measurements on the transverse
single spin asymmetries for the production of forward $\pi^0$ mesons from
polarized proton collisions at $\sqrt{s} =\,$200 GeV. To disentangle the
contributions to forward asymmetries, one has to look beyond inclusive $\pi^0$
production to the production of forward jets or direct photons. Present forward
detector capabilities are not well matched to the complete reconstruction of
forward jets, but do have sufficient acceptance for "jet-like" events.
"Jet-like" events are the clustered response of an electromagnetic calorimeter
that is primarily sensitive to incident photons, electrons and positrons.
  During the RHIC running in the year 2006, STAR with the Forward Pion Detector
(FPD++) in place collected 6.8 pb$^{-1}$ of data with an average polarization
of 60%. FPD++ was a modular detector prototype of the Forward Meson
Spectrometer (FMS) that consisted of two detectors placed symmetrically with
respect to the beam line at a distance of 7.4 m from the interaction point.
Readout of the FPD++ was triggered when the sum of energies in the central
module of the calorimeter used for $\pi^0$ measurements was larger than a
threshold. This trigger minimizes the bias for "jet-like" events, making it
appropriate to disentangling contributions to the forward transverse spin
asymmetries. We report on the status of the analysis.
