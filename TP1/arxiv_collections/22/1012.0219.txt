We compute the viscosity spectral function of the dilute Fermi gas for
different values of the s-wave scattering length $a$, including the unitarity
limit $a\to\infty$. We perform the calculation in kinetic theory by studying
the response to a non-trivial background metric. We find the expected structure
consisting of a diffusive peak in the transverse shear channel and a sound peak
in the longitudinal channel. At zero momentum the width of the diffusive peak
is $\omega_0\simeq (2\epsilon)/(3\eta)$ where $\epsilon$ is the energy density
and $\eta$ is the shear viscosity. At finite momentum the spectral function
approaches the collisionless limit and the width is of order $\omega_0\sim
k(T/m)^{1/2}$.
