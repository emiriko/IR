This is a review of a decade-long effort to develop novel tools for exploring
magnetism in cold astrophysical media and to establish a new field of molecular
spectropolarimetry since Berdyugina et al. (2000). It is most directly
applicable to the Sun, cool stars, substellar objects, planets and other minor
bodies as well as interstellar and circumstellar matter. It is close to being a
mature field with developed theoretical tools poised to uncover new insights
into the magnetic structures in cooler environments. Here I attempt a broad
description of the literature and present some recent exciting results. In
particular, following my programmatic review at Solar Polarization Workshop 3,
I discuss advances in molecular magnetic diagnostics which are based on the
modeling of about a dozen diatomic molecules with various electronic
transitions and states, including the most challenging - FeH. The applications
stretch from sunspots to starspots, small-scale and turbulent solar magnetic
fields, red and white dwarfs, and spin-offs such as polarimetry of
protoplanetary disks and exoplanets.
