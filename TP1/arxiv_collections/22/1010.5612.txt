We investigate future constraints on early dark energy (EDE) achievable by
the Planck and CMBPol experiments, including cosmic microwave background (CMB)
lensing. For the dark energy, we include the possibility of clustering through
a sound speed c_s^2 <1 (cold dark energy) and anisotropic stresses
parameterized with a viscosity parameter c_vis^2. We discuss the degeneracies
between cosmological parameters and EDE parameters. In particular we show that
the presence of anisotropic stresses in EDE models can substantially undermine
the determination of the EDE sound speed parameter c_s^2. The constraints on
EDE primordial energy density are however unaffected. We also calculate the
future CMB constraints on neutrino masses and find that they are weakened by a
factor of 2 when allowing for the presence of EDE, and highly biased if it is
incorrectly ignored.
