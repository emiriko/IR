We have recently described a novel method for the construction of a
solid-state optical frequency reference based on doping $^{229}$Th into high
energy band-gap crystals. Since nuclear transitions are far less sensitive to
environmental conditions than atomic transitions, we have argued that the
$^{229}$Th optical nuclear transition may be driven inside a host crystal
resulting in an optical frequency reference with a short-term stability of
$3\times10^{-17}<\Delta f/f <1\times10^{-15}$ at 1 s and a systematic-limited
repeatability of $\Delta f/f \sim 2 \times 10^{-16}$. Improvement by
$10^2-10^3$ of the constraints on the variability of several important
fundamental constants also appears possible. Here we present the results of the
first phase of these experiments. Specifically, we have evaluated several high
energy band-gap crystals (Th:NaYF, Th:YLF, Th:LiCAF, Na$_2$ThF$_6$, LiSAF) for
their suitability as a crystal host by a combination of electron beam
microprobe measurements, Rutherford Backscattering, and synchrotron
excitation/fluorescence measurements. These measurements have shown LiCAF to be
the most promising host crystal, and using a $^{232}$Th doped LiCAF crystal, we
have performed a mock run of the actual experiment that will be used to search
for the isomeric transition in $^{229}$Th. This data indicates that a
measurement of the transition energy with a signal to noise ratio (SNR) greater
than 30:1 can be achieved at the lowest expected fluorescence rate.
