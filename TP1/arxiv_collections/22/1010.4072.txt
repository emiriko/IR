In a recent paper, Carrell and Goulden found a combinatorial identity of the
Bernstein operators that they then used to prove Bernstein's Theorem. We show
that this identity is a straightforward consequence of the classical result. We
also show how a similar approach using the codes of partitions can be
generalized from Schur functions to also include Schur $Q$-functions and derive
the combinatorial formulation for both cases. We then apply them by examining
the Littlewood-Richardson and Pieri Rules.
