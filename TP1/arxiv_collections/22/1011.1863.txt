Long-ranged step-step attractions destabilize the vicinal crystal surfaces.
Their competition with shorter-ranged step-step repulsions results in
self-organized patterns. The exponent in the time-scaling of their
characteristic size is influenced only by the range of the attractions but not
by the range of the repulsions as we show based on precise numerical analysis
of two different minimal models. Another anisotropy we identify is that the
vicinal surface is not destabilized by shorter-ranged attractions.
