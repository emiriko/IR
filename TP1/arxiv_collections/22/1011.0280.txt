In information systems, a system is analyzed using a modeling tool. Analysis
is an important phase prior to implementation in order to obtain the correct
requirements of the system. During the requirements phase, the software
requirements specification (SRS) is used to specify the system requirements.
Then, this requirements specification is used to implement the system. The
requirements specification can be represented using either a structure approach
or an object-oriented approach. A UML (Unified Modeling Language) specification
is a well-known for representation of requirements specification in an
object-oriented approach. In this paper, we present one case study and discuss
how mapping from UML specification into implementation is done. The case study
does not require advanced programming skills. However, it does require
familiarity in creating and instantiating classes, object-oriented programming
with inheritance, data structure, file processing and control loop. For the
case study, UML specification is used in requirements phase and Borland C++ is
used in implementation phase. Based on the case study, it shows that the
proposed approach improved the understanding of mapping from UML specification
into implementation.
