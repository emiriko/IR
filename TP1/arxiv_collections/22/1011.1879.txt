We present the current status of the IceTop air shower array on top of the
IceCube neutrino detector that IceTop can use as a huge detector of TeV muons.
We laos give a brief discussion of different types of air shower events that
contain information on the spectrum and composition of the cosmic rays in a
wide energy range.
