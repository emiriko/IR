We examine the density profiles of the quantum degenerate Bose-Fermi mixture
of $^{174}$Yb-$^{173}$Yb, experimental observed recently, in the mean field
regime. In this mixture there is a possibility of tuning the Bose-Bose and
Bose-Fermi interactions simultaneously using two well separated optical
Feshbach resonances, and it is a good candidate to explore phase separation in
Bose-Fermi mixtures. Depending on the Bose-Bose scattering length $a_\BB$, as
the Bose-Fermi interaction is tuned the density of the fermions is pinched or
swapping with bosons occurs.
