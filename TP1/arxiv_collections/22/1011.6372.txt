We present a statistical analysis of the X-ray luminosity of rotation powered
pulsars and their surrounding nebulae using the sample of Kargaltsev & Pavlov
(2008) and we complement this with an analysis of the gamma-ray-emission of
Fermi detected pulsars. We report a strong trend in the efficiency with which
spin-down power is converted to X-ray and gamma-ray emission with
characteristic age: young pulsars and their surrounding nebulae are efficient
X-ray emitters, whereas in contrast old pulsars are efficient gamma-ray
emitters. We divided the X-ray sample in a young (Tau < 1.7x10^4 yr) and old
sample and used linear regression to search for correlations between the
logarithm of the X-ray and gamma-ray luminosities and the logarithms of the
periods and period derivatives. The X-ray emission from young pulsars and their
nebulae are both consistent with L_X ~ Pdot^3/P^6. For old pulsars and their
nebulae the X-ray luminosity is consistent with a more or less constant
efficiency eta = L_X/Edot = ~ 8x10^-5. For the gamma-ray luminosity we confirm
that L_gamma ~ Edot^(1/2).
  We discuss these findings in the context of pair production inside pulsar
magnetospheres and the striped wind model. We suggest that the striped wind
model may explain the similarity between the X-ray properties of the pulsar
wind nebulae and the pulsars themselves, which according to the striped wind
model may both find their origin outside the light cylinder, in the pulsar wind
zone.
