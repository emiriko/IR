We extend the variational cluster approach to deal with strongly correlated
lattice bosons in the superfluid phase. To this end, we reformulate the
approach within a pseudoparticle formalism, whereby cluster excitations are
described by particlelike excitations. The approximation amounts to solving a
multicomponent noninteracting bosonic system by means of a multimode Bogoliubov
approximation. A source-and-drain term is introduced in order to break U(1)
symmetry at the cluster level. We provide an expression for the grand
potential, the single-particle normal and anomalous Green's functions, the
condensate density, and other static quantities. As a first nontrivial
application of the method we choose the two-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model and
evaluate results in both the Mott and the superfluid phases. Our results show
an excellent agreement with quantum Monte Carlo calculations.
