We show that higher-order nonlinear indices ($n_4$, $n_6$, $n_8$, $n_{10}$)
provide the main defocusing contribution to self-channeling of ultrashort laser
pulses in air and Argon at 800 nm, in contrast with the previously accepted
mechanism of filamentation where plasma was considered as the dominant
defocusing process. Their consideration allows to reproduce experimentally
observed intensities and plasma densities in self-guided filaments.
