We study certain self-interacting walks on the set of integers, that choose
to jump to the right or to the left randomly but influenced by the number of
times they have previously jumped along the edges in the finite neighbourhood
of their current position (in the present paper, typically, we will discuss the
case where one considers the neighbouring edges and the next-to-neighbouring
edges).
  We survey a variety of possible behaviours, including some where the walk is
eventually confined to an interval of large length. We also focus on certain
"asymmetric" drifts, where we prove that with positive probability, the walks
behave deterministically on large scale and move like a constant times the
square root of time, or like a constant times the logarithm of time.
