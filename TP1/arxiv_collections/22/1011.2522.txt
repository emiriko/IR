N-dark-dark solitons in the generally coupled integrable NLS equations are
derived by the KP-hierarchy reduction method. These solitons exist when
nonlinearities are all defocusing, or both focusing and defocusing
nonlinearities are mixed. When these solitons collide with each other, energies
in both components of the solitons completely transmit through. This behavior
contrasts collisions of bright-bright solitons in similar systems, where
polarization rotation and soliton reflection can take place. It is also shown
that in the mixed-nonlinearity case, two dark-dark solitons can form a
stationary bound state.
