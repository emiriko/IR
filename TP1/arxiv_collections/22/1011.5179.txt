Consider a viscous fluid of finite depth below the air. In the absence of the
surface tension effect at the air-fluid interface, the long time behavior of a
free surface with small amplitude has been an intriguing question since the
work of Beale \cite{beale_1}. In this monograph, we develop a new mathematical
framework to resolve this question. If the free interface is horizontally
infinite, we establish that it decays to a flat surface at an algebraic rate.
On the other hand, if the free interface is periodic, we establish that it
decays at an almost exponential rate, i.e. at an arbitrarily fast algebraic
rate determined by the smallness of the data. Our framework contains several
novel techniques, which include: (1) a local well-posedness theory of the
Navier-Stokes equations in the presence of a moving boundary; (2) a two-tier
energy method that couples the boundedness of high-order energy to the decay of
low-order energy, the latter of which is necessary to balance out the growth of
the highest derivatives of the free interface; (3) control of both negative and
positive Sobolev norms, which enhances interpolation estimates and allows for
the decay of infinite surface waves; (4) a localization procedure that is
compatible with the energy method and allows for curved lower surface geometry
in the periodic case. Our decay results lead to the construction of
global-in-time solutions to the surface wave problem.
