We'll be presenting an approach to solve the equation of simple harmonic
motion (SHM) which is non-standard as compared with the usual way of solution
presented in textbooks. In addition to help students avoid the unnecessary
memorization of formulas to solve physics problems, this approach could help
instructors to present the subject in a teaching framework which integrates
conceptual and mathematical reasoning, in a systemic way of thinking that will
help students to reinforce their quantitative reasoning skills by using
mathematical knowledge already familiar to students in a first calculus-based
introductory physics course, such as the chain rule for derivatives, inverse
trigonometric functions, and integration methods.
