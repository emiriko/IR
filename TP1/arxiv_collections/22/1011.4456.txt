We construct the product of real spectral triples of arbitrary finite
dimension (and arbitrary parity) taking into account the fact that in the even
case there are two possible real structures, in the odd case there are two
inequivalent representations of the gamma matrices (Clifford algebra), and in
the even-even case there are two natural candidates for the Dirac operator of
the product triple.
