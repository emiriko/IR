A novel electrochemical means to generate atomic hydrogen, simplifying the
synthesis and controllability of graphane formation on graphene is presented.
High quality, vacuum grown epitaxial graphene (EG) was used as starting
material for graphane conversion. A home-built electrochemical cell with Pt
wire and exposed graphene as the anode and cathode, respectively, was used to
attract H+ ions to react with the exposed graphene. Cyclic voltammetry of the
cell revealed the potential of the conversion reaction as well as oxidation and
reduction peaks, suggesting the possibility of electrochemically reversible
hydrogenation. A sharp increase in D peak in the Raman spectra of EG, increase
of D/G ratio, introduction of a peak at ~2930 cm-1 and respective peak shifts
as well as a sharp increase in resistance showed the successful hydrogenation
of EG. This conversion was distinguished from lattice damage by thermal
reversal back to graphene at 1000{\deg}C.
