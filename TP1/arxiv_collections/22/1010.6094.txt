We study how the \theta -term is affected by interactions in certain
one-dimensional gapped systems that preserve charge-conjugation, parity, and
time-reversal invariance. We exploit the relation between the chiral anomaly of
a fermionic system and the classical shift symmetry of its bosonized dual. The
vacuum expectation value of the dual boson is identified with the value of the
\theta -term for the corresponding fermionic system. Two (related) examples
illustrate the identification. We first consider the massive Luttinger liquid
and find the \theta -term to be insensitive to the strength of the interaction.
Next, we study the continuum limit of the Heisenberg XXZ spin-1/2 chain,
perturbed by a second nearest-neighbor spin interaction. For a certain range of
the XXZ anisotropy, we find that we can tune between two distinct sets of
topological phases by varying the second nearest-neighbor coupling. In the
first, we find the standard vacua at \theta = 0, \pi, while the second contains
vacua that spontaneously break charge-conjugation and parity with fractional
\theta / \pi = 1/ 2, 3/2. We also study quantized pumping in both examples
following recent work.
