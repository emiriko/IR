We present a novel method to image spin properties of spintronic systems
using the spatially confined field of a scanned micromagnetic probe, in
conjunction with existing electrical or optical global spin detection schemes.
It is thus applicable to all materials systems susceptible to either of those
approaches. The proposed technique relies on numerical solutions to the spin
diffusion equation in the presence of spatially varying fields to obtain the
local spin response to the micromagnetic probe field. These solutions also
provide insight into the effects of inhomogeneities on Hanle measurements.
