We consider a liquid bearing gas bubbles in a porous medium. When gas bubbles
are immovably trapped in a porous matrix by surface-tension forces, the
dominant mechanism of transfer of gas mass becomes the diffusion of gas
molecules through the liquid. Essentially, the gas solution is in local
thermodynamic equilibrium with vapor phase all over the system, i.e., the
solute concentration equals the solubility. When temperature and/or pressure
gradients are applied, diffusion fluxes appear and these fluxes are faithfully
determined by the temperature and pressure fields, not by the local solute
concentration, which is enslaved by the former. We derive the equations
governing such systems, accounting for thermodiffusion and gravitational
segregation effects which are shown not to be neglected for geological
systems---marine sediments, terrestrial aquifers, etc. The results are applied
for the treatment of non-high-pressure systems and real geological systems
bearing methane or carbon dioxide, where we find a potential possibility of the
formation of gaseous horizons deep below a porous medium surface. The reported
effects are of particular importance for natural methane hydrate deposits and
the problem of burial of industrial production of carbon dioxide in deep
aquifers.
