The problems of neutrino production states, prepared to the oscillation
process, in the case of non standard interactions, are briefly discussed.
Quantum neutrino states are determined from the dynamics of a production
process. We show, that even in models where only left-handed neutrinos are
introduced, the standard adopted procedure is valid only approximately.
Entanglement between neutrino masses or between masses, flavour and spins
cause, that their quantum states are mixed.
