We describe an informal methodology for developing on-line applications,
which is, to some extent, complementary to the Web 2.0 aspects of web
development. The presented methodology is suitable for developing low-cost and
non-cost web sites targeted at medium-sized communities. We present basic
building blocks used in the described strategy. To achieve a better
understanding of the discussed concepts we comment on their application during
the realization of two web projects. We focus on the role of community-driven
development, which is crucial for projects of the discussed type.
