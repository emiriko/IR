We could infer a secular decreasing trend in the poloidal to toroidal solar
magnetic flux amplification factor ( Af) using geomagnetic observations (
classic and IHV corrected aa indices) during the sunspot cycles 9-23. A similar
decreasing trend is also observed for the solar equatorial rotation (W) which
imply possibly a decrease in the efficiency of the solar dynamo during the
above period. We could show correlated changes of Af and extreme space weather
activity variations near earth since the middle of the 19th century. Indirect
solar observations ( solar proton fluence estimates) suggests that the distinct
enhancements in extreme space weather activity , Af and W found during sunspot
cycles 10 to 15 is probably largest of that kind during the past 400 years. We
find that the sunspot activity can reach an upper limit (R<300) when Af becomes
unity. If the current sunspot cycle 24 turns out to be weak then very severe
space weather conditions is most probable to occur during this cycle.
