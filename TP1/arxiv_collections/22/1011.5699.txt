We determine necessary conditions on the structure of symbol error rate (SER)
optimal quantizers for limited feedback beamforming in wireless networks with
one transmitter-receiver pair and R parallel amplify-and-forward relays. We
call a quantizer codebook "small" if its cardinality is less than R, and
"large" otherwise. A "d-codebook" depends on the power constraints and can be
optimized accordingly, while an "i-codebook" remains fixed. It was previously
shown that any i-codebook that contains the single-relay selection (SRS)
codebook achieves the full-diversity order, R. We prove the following:
  Every full-diversity i-codebook contains the SRS codebook, and thus is
necessarily large. In general, as the power constraints grow to infinity, the
limit of an optimal large d-codebook contains an SRS codebook, provided that it
exists. For small codebooks, the maximal diversity is equal to the codebook
cardinality. Every diversity-optimal small i-codebook is an orthogonal
multiple-relay selection (OMRS) codebook. Moreover, the limit of an optimal
small d-codebook is an OMRS codebook.
  We observe that SRS is nothing but a special case of OMRS for codebooks with
cardinality equal to R. As a result, we call OMRS as "the universal necessary
condition" for codebook optimality. Finally, we confirm our analytical findings
through simulations.
