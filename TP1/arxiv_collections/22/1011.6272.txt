We consider an application of a general theory for cavities with point-like
perturbations for a rectangular shape. Hereby we concentrate on experimental
wave patterns obtained for nearly degenerate states. The nodal lines in these
patterns may be broken, which is an effect coming only from the experimental
determination of the patterns. These findings are explained within a framework
of the developed theory.
