The cross section for exclusive heavy quark and heavy antiquark pair ($Q \bar
Q$) production in peripheral ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions is
calculated for the LHC energy $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 5.5 TeV. Here we consider only
processes with photon--photon interactions and omit diffractive contributions.
We present results in the impact parameter equivalent photon approximation
(EPA) and compare some of them with results obtained by exact calculations of
the Feynman diagrams in the momentum space. We include both $Q \bar Q$, $Q \bar
Q g$ and $Q \bar Q q \bar q$ final states as well as photon single-resolved
components. Realistic charge densities in nuclei were taken in the calculation.
The different components give contributions of the same order of magnitude to
the nuclear cross section. The cross sections found here are smaller than those
for the diffractive photon-pomeron mechanism and larger than diffractive
pomeron-pomeron discussed in the literature.
