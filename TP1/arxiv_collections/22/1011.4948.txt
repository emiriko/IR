This talk gives an overview of the recently-formulated Fluid/Gravity
correspondence, which was developed in the context of gauge/gravity duality.
Mathematically, it posits that Einstein's equations (with negative cosmological
constant) in d+1 dimensions capture the (generalized) Navier-Stokes equations
in d dimensions. Given an arbitrary fluid dynamical solution, we can
systematically construct a corresponding asymptotically AdS black hole
spacetime with a regular horizon whose properties mimic that of the fluid flow.
Apart from an overview of this construction, we describe some of its
applications. The presentation is intended for a broad audience of relativists,
and does not assume prior knowledge of string theory or gauge/gravity duality.
