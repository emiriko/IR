We show experimentally and theoretically that there is a coupling via the
Aharonov-Bohm phase between the order parameter of a ferromagnet and a singlet,
s-wave, Josephson supercurrent. We have investigated the possibility of
measuring the dispersion of such spin waves by varying the magnetic field
applied in the plane of the junction and demonstrated the electromagnetic
nature of the coupling by the observation of magnetic resonance side-bands to
microwave induced Shapiro steps.
