We discuss some recent lattice results on a few selected hadronic quantities
relevant for heavy flavour phenomenology and present some recent theoretical
developments. We put the emphasis on the challenges, which have to be faced, on
the way to precise heavy flavour physics from the lattice. We also discuss the
importance in the search for New Physics of possible future lattice studies of
the form factors entering B --> K and B --> K* semileptonic decays.
