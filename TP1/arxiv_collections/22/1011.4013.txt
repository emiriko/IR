A general formalism is developed to calculate the cross section and the
polarization observables for the reaction $\bar N+N\to \pi +\ell^++\ell^-$. The
matrix element and the observables are expressed in terms of six scalar
amplitudes (complex functions of three kinematical variables) which determine
the reaction dynamics. The numerical predictions are given in frame of a
particular model in the kinematical range accessible in the PANDA experiment at
FAIR.
