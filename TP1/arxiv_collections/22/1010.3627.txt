We study the quantum dynamics of diatomic molecule driven by a circularly
polarized resonant electric field. We look for a quantum effect due to
classical chaos appearing due to the overlapping of nonlinear resonances
associated to the vibrational and rotational motion. We solve the Schr\"odinger
equation associated with the wave function expanded in term of proper
stationary states, $|n>\otimes|lm>$ (vibrational$\otimes$angular momentum
states). Looking for quantum-classic correspondence, we consider the Liouville
dynamics in the two dimensional phase space defined by the coherent -like state
of vibrational states, and it is found some similarities when the quantum
dynamics is pictured in terms of number and phase operators.
