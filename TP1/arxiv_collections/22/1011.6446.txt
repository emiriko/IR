We present a systematic investigation of the antiferromagnetic ordering and
structural distortion for the series of Ba(Fe{1-x}Ru{x})2As2 compounds (0 <= x
<= 0.246). Neutron and x-ray diffraction measurements demonstrate that, unlike
for the electron-doped compounds, the structural and magnetic transitions
remain coincident in temperature. Both the magnetic and structural transitions
are gradually suppressed with increased Ru concentration and coexist with
superconductivity. For samples that are superconducting, we find strong
competition between superconductivity, the antiferromagnetic ordering, and the
structural distortion.
