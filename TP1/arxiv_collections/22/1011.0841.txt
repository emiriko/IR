As a contribution to the ongoing controversy about the role of higher-order
Kerr effect (HOKE) in laser filamentation, we first provide thorough details
about the protocol that has been employed to infer the HOKE indices from the
experiment. Next, we discuss potential sources of artifact in the experimental
measurements of these terms and show that neither the value of the observed
birefringence, nor its inversion, nor the intensity at which it is observed,
appear to be flawed. Furthermore, we argue that, independently on our values,
the principle of including HOKE is straightforward. Due to the different
temporal and spectral dynamics, the respective efficiency of defocusing by the
plasma and by the HOKE is expected to depend substantially on both incident
wavelength and pulse duration. The discussion should therefore focus on
defining the conditions where each filamentation regime dominates.
