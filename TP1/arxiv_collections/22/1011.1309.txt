We investigate the nonlinear dynamics of microcantilevers. We demonstrate
mechanical stiffening of the frequency response at large amplitudes,
originating from the geometric nonlinearity. At strong driving the cantilever
amplitude is bistable. We map the bistable regime as a function of drive
frequency and amplitude, and suggest several applications for the bistable
microcantilever, of which a mechanical memory is demonstrated.
