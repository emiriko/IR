We present optical photometry of 16 transits of the super-Earth GJ 1214b,
allowing us to refine the system parameters and search for additional planets
via transit timing. Starspot-crossing events are detected in two light curves,
and the star is found to be variable by a few percent. Hence, in our analysis,
special attention is given to systematic errors that result from star spots.
The planet-to-star radius ratio is 0.11610+/-0.00048, subject to a possible
upward bias by a few percent due to the unknown spot coverage. Even assuming
this bias to be negligible, the mean density of planet can be either
3.03+/-0.50 g cm^{-3} or 1.89+/-0.33 g cm^{-3}, depending on whether the
stellar radius is estimated from evolutionary models or from an empirical
mass-luminosity relation combined with the light curve parameters. One possible
resolution is that the orbit is eccentric (e approximately equal to 0.14),
which would favor the higher density, and hence a much thinner atmosphere for
the planet. The transit times were found to be periodic within about 15s,
ruling out the existence of any other super-Earths with periods within a
factor-of-two of the known planet.
