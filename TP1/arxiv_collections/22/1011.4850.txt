Near band-gap photoluminescence and reflectivity in magnetic field are
employed to determine the exchange-induced splitting of free exciton states in
paramagnetic wurtzite Ga1-xMnxN, x < 1%, grown on sapphire substrates by
metal-organic vapor phase epitaxy. The band gap is found to increase with x.
The giant Zeeman splitting of all three excitons A, B and C is resolved,
enabling the determination of the apparent exchange integrals N0alpha(app) =
0.0 +/- 0.1 eV and N0beta(app) = +0.8 +/- 0.2 eV. These non-standard values and
signs of the s - d and p - d exchange energies are explained in terms of recent
theories that suggest a contribution of the electron-hole exchange to the spin
splitting of the conduction band and a renormalization of the free hole
spin-splitting by a large p - d hybridization. According to these models, in
the limit of a strong p - d coupling, the band gap of (Ga,Mn)N increases with x
and the order of hole spin subbands is reversed, as observed.
