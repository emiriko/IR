Interface adaptation allows code written for one interface to be used with a
software component with another interface. When multiple adapters are chained
together to make certain adaptations possible, we need a way to analyze how
well the adaptation is done in case there are more than one chains that can be
used. We introduce an approach to precisely analyzing the loss in an interface
adapter chain using a simple form of abstract interpretation.
