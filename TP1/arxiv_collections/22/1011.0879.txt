Studying mechanical resonators via radiation pressure offers a rich avenue
for the exploration of quantum mechanical behavior in a macroscopic regime.
However, quantum state preparation and especially quantum state reconstruction
of mechanical oscillators remains a significant challenge. Here we propose a
scheme to realize quantum state tomography, squeezing and state purification of
a mechanical resonator using short optical pulses. The scheme presented allows
observation of mechanical quantum features despite preparation from a thermal
state and is shown to be experimentally feasible using optical microcavities.
Our framework thus provides a promising means to explore the quantum nature of
massive mechanical oscillators and can be applied to other systems such as
trapped ions.
