Quantum key distribution (QKD) allows two remote parties to grow a shared
secret key. Its security is founded on the principles of quantum mechanics, but
in reality it significantly relies on the physical implementation.
Technological imperfections of QKD systems have been previously explored, but
no attack on an established QKD connection has been realized so far. Here we
show the first full-field implementation of a complete attack on a running QKD
connection. An installed eavesdropper obtains the entire 'secret' key, while
none of the parameters monitored by the legitimate parties indicate a security
breach. This confirms that non-idealities in physical implementations of QKD
can be fully practically exploitable, and must be given increased scrutiny if
quantum cryptography is to become highly secure.
