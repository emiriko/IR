Starting from a Lagrangian, electromagnetic field in the presence of a
nonlinear dielectric medium is quantized using path-integral techniques and
correlation functions of different fields are calculated. The susceptibilities
of the nonlinear medium are obtained and their relation to coupling functions
are determined. Finally, the Casimir energy and force in the presence of a
nonlinear medium at finite temperature is calculated.
