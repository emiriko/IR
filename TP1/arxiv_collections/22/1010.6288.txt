Experiments performed within the last year have demonstrated Rydberg state
mediated quantum gates and deterministic entanglement between pairs of trapped
neutral atoms. These experiments validate ten year old proposals for Rydberg
mediated quantum logic, but are only the beginning of ongoing efforts to
improve the fidelity of the results obtained and scale the experiments to
larger numbers of qubits. We present here a summary of the results to date,
along with a critical evaluation of the prospects for higher fidelity Rydberg
gates.
