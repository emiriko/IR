In this article we discuss the effect of curvature on dynamics when a
physical system moves adiabatically in a curved space. These effects give a way
to measure the curvature of the space intrinsically without referring to higher
dimensional space. Two interesting examples, the Foucault Pendulum and the
perihelion shift of planetary orbits, are presented in a simple geometric way.
A paper model is presented to see the perihelion shift.
