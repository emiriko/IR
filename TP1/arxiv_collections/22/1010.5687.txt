We investigate chiral and deconfinement transitions in the strong coupling
lattice QCD for color SU(3). We combine the leading order Polyakov loop
effective action of the strong coupling expansion and the
next-to-next-to-leading order (1/g^4) fermionic effective action with one
species of unrooted staggered fermion. Two approximation schemes are adopted to
evaluate the Polyakov loop effects; a Haar measure method (no fluctuation from
the mean field) and a Weiss mean-field method (with fluctuations). The Polyakov
loop is found to suppress the chiral condensate and to reduce the chiral
transition temperature at mu = 0. The chiral transition temperature roughly
reproduces the Monte Carlo results in the region beta = 2N_c /g^2 < 4.
