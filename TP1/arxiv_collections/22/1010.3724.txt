We introduce an exactly solvable SU(2) symmetric Kitaev model with exotic
spin excitations. With time reversal symmetry (TRS), the ground state is a spin
liquid with gapless or gapped spin-1 but fermionic excitations. When TRS is
broken, the resulting spin liquid exhibits deconfined vortex excitations which
carry spin-1/2 quantum number and obey non-Abelian statistics. We show that
this SU(2) invariant non-Abelian spin liquid exhibits spin quantum Hall effect
with quantized spin Hall conductivity \sigma^s_{xy}=\hbar/2\pi, and that the
spin response is effectively described the SO(3) level-1 Chern-Simons theory at
low energy. We further propose that a SU(2) level-2 Chern-Simons theory is the
effective field theory describing the topological structure of the non-Abelian
SU(2) invariant spin liquid.
