The transition metal carbide Sc3CoC4 consists of a quasi-one-dimensional (1D)
structure with [CoC4]$_{\inft}$ polyanionic chains embedded in a scandium
matrix. At ambient temperatures Sc3CoC4 displays metallic behavior. At lower
temperatures, however, charge density wave formation has been observed around
143K which is followed by a structural phase transition at 72K. Below T^onset_c
= 4.5K the polycrystalline sample becomes superconductive. From Hc1(0) and
Hc2(0) values we could estimate the London penetration depth ({\lambda}_L ~=
9750 Angstroem) and the Ginsburg-Landau (GL) coherence length ({\xi}_GL ~= 187
Angstroem). The resulting GL-parameter ({\kappa} ~= 52) classifies Sc3CoC4 as a
type II superconductor. Here we compare the puzzling superconducting features
of Sc3CoC4, such as the unusual temperature dependence i) of the specific heat
anomaly and ii) of the upper critical field H_c2(T) at T_c, and iii) the
magnetic hysteresis curve, with various related low dimensional
superconductors: e.g., the quasi-1D superconductor (SN)_x or the 2D
transition-metal dichalcogenides. Our results identify Sc3CoC4 as a new
candidate for a quasi-1D superconductor.
