In this paper I explore the entanglement evolution of qubits that are part of
a five qubit quantum error correction code subject to various decohering
environments. Specifically, I look for possible parallels between the
entanglement degradation and the fidelity of the logical qubit of quantum
information stored in the physical qubits. In addition, I note the possible
exhibition of entanglement sudden death (ESD) due to decoherence and question
whether ESD is actually a roadblock to successful quantum computation.
