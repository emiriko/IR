We present a new web-tool - Net-PSICoNS - for population synthesis of
isolated near-by cooling neutron stars (NSs). The main aim is to provide an
easy test of models of the NS thermal evolution which can be used by groups
studying this subject. A user can upload cooling curves for a set of masses,
modify the mass spectrum if necessary, change radii to fit the EoS used for
cooling curve calculations, and then a population synthesis of close-by
isolated cooling NSs is performed. The output includes the Log N -- Log S
distribution confronted with the ROSAT observations and several other sets of
data. In this paper, we summarize the idea of the test proposed by Popov et al.
(2006), and present a user's manual for the web-tool.
