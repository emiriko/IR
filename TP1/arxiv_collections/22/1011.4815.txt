Comparing the number of clear nights (cloud free) available for astronomical
observations is a critical task because it should be based on homogeneous
methodologies. Current data are mainly based on different judgements based on
observer logbooks or on different instruments. In this paper we present a new
homogeneous methodology on very different astronomical sites for modern optical
astronomy, in order to quantify the available night time fraction. The data are
extracted from night time GOES12 satellite infrared images and compared with
ground based conditions when available. In this analysis we introduce a wider
average matrix and 3-Bands correlation in order to reduce the noise and to
distinguish between clear and stable nights. Temporal data are used for the
classification. In the time interval 2007-2008 we found that the percentage of
the satellite clear nights is 88% at Paranal, 76% at La Silla, 72.5% at La
Palma, 59% at Mt. Graham and 86.5% at Tolonchar. The correlation analysis of
the three GOES12 infrared bands B3, B4 and B6 indicates that the fraction of
the stable nights is lower by 2% to 20% depending on the site.
