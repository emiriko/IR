It is shown that when the gauge-invariant Bohr-Rosenfeld commutators of the
free electromagnetic field are applied to the expressions for the linear and
angular momentum of the electromagnetic field interpreted as operators then, in
the absence of electric and magnetic charge densities, these operators satisfy
the canonical commutation relations for momentum and angular momentum. This
confirms their validity as operators that can be used in quantum mechanical
calculations of angular momentum.
