The Telescope Array (TA) is the largest experiment in the northern hemisphere
studying ultrahigh energy cosmic rays. TA is a hybrid experiment, which means
it has two detector systems: a surface detector and a fluorescence detector. In
this paper we report on results from TA on the spectrum, composition, and
anisotropy of cosmic rays. The spectrum measured by the TA surface detector,
cosmic ray composition measured with the TA fluorescence detectors operating in
stereoscopic mode, and a search for correlations between the pointing
directions of cosmic rays, seen by the surface detector, and AGN's are
presented.
