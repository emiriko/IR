We model two bosons in an optical lattice near a Feshbach or photoassociation
resonance, focusing on the Bose-Hubbard model in one dimension. Whereas the
usual atoms-only theory with a tunable scattering length yields one bound state
for a molecular dimer for either attractive or repulsive atom-atom interaction,
an atom-molecule theory gives two bound states that may represent attractively
and repulsively bound dimers occurring simultaneously. Such unusual molecular
physics should be observable for an atom-molecule coupling strength comparable
to the width of the dissociation continuum of the lattice dimer, for example,
using narrow Feshbach resonances in Na, $^{87}$Rb, and $^{133}$Cs or
low-intensity photoassociation in $^{174}$Yb.
