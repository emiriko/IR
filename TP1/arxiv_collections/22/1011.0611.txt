Since the discovery of quasars in papers often appeared and appear the
assertions that the redshift quasar distribution includes a periodic component
with the period $\Delta z = 0.063$ or 0.11. A statement of such kind, if it is
correct, may manifest the existence of a far order in quasar distribution in
cosmological time, that might lead to a fundamental revision all the
cosmological paradigm. In the present time there is a unique opportunity to
check this statement with a high precision, using the rich statictics of 2dF
and SDSS catalogues (about 85000 quasars). Our analysis indicates that the
periodic component in distribution of quasar redshifts is absent at high
confidence level.
