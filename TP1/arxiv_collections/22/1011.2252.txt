We study the dynamics of quantum coherence and quantum correlations in two
semiconductor double-dot molecules separated by a distance and indirectly
coupled via a transmission line resonator. Dominant dissipation processes are
considered. The numerical results show the sudden death of entanglement and the
robustness of quantum discord to sudden death. Furthermore, the results
indicate the dephasing processes in our model can lead in the revival and decay
of coherence and discord with the absence of entanglement for certain initial
states. By observing the dynamics of coherence versus discord for different
initial states, we find that the similarities and differences of coherence and
discord are not only related to the dependance of discord on optimizing the
measurement set, but more importantly to the coherences in individual qubits
which are captured by the adopted coherence measure.
