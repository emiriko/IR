An application of the Exp-function method to search for exact solutions of
nonlinear differential equations is analyzed. Typical mistakes of application
of the Exp-function method are demonstrated. We show it is often required to
simplify the exact solutions obtained. Possibilities of the Exp-function method
and other approaches in mathematical physics are discussed. The application of
the singular manifold method for finding exact solutions of the Fitzhugh -
Nagumo equation is illustrated. The modified simple equation method is
introduced. This approach is used to look for exact solutions of the
generalized Korteweg - de Vries equation.
