We present the complete electroweak one-loop corrections to the partial
widths for two-body decays of a chargino (neutralino) into a W-boson and a
neutralino (chargino). We perform the calculation for the minimal and the
next-to-minimal supersymmetric standard model using an on-shell renormalization
scheme. Particular attention is paid to the question of gauge invariance which
is achieved using the so-called pinch technique. Furthermore we show that these
corrections show a strong parameter dependence and usually are in the range of
1-10 percent if the neutralino involved is a higgsino or wino like state.
However, in case of a bino-like or a singlino-like neutralino the corrections
can go up to 50% and more. Moreover we present the public program CNNDecays
performing these calculations.
