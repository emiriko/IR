In numerical simulations of nonabelian plasma instabilities in the hard-loop
approximation, a turbulent spectrum has been observed that is characterized by
a phase-space density of particles $n(p)\sim p^{-\nu}$ with exponent $\nu\simeq
2$, which is larger than expected from relativistic $2\leftrightarrow 2$
scatterings. Using the approach of Zakharov, L'vov and Falkovich, we analyse
possible Kolmogorov coefficients for relativistic $(m \ge 4)$-particle
processes, which give at most $\nu=5/3$ perturbatively for an energy cascade.
We discuss nonperturbative scenarios which lead to larger values. As an extreme
limit we find the result $\nu=5$ generically in an inherently nonperturbative
effective field theory situation, which coincides with results obtained by
Berges et al.\ in large-$N$ scalar field theory. If we instead assume that
scaling behavior is determined by Schwinger-Dyson resummations such that the
different scaling of bare and dressed vertices matters, we find that
intermediate values are possible. We present one simple scenario which would
single out $\nu=2$.
