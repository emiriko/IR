Using the MIT bag model, we study the contribution from the gluon vector
potential due to the spectators to the orbital angular momentum of a quark in
the bag model. For $\alpha_s = {\cal O}(1)$, this spectator contribution to the
quark orbital angular momentum in the gauge-covariant Ji decomposition is of
the same order as the non gauge-covariant quark orbital angular momentum and
its magnitude is larger for $d$ than for $u$ quarks and negative for both.
