We derive simple return models for several classes of bond portfolios. With
only one or two risk factors our models are able to explain most of the return
variations in portfolios of fixed rate government bonds, inflation linked
government bonds and investment grade corporate bonds. The underlying risk
factors have natural interpretations which make the models well suited for risk
management and portfolio design.
