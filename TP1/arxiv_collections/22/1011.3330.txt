We have investigated the magnetoconductance of semiconducting carbon
nanotubes (CNTs) in pulsed, parallel magnetic fields up to 60 T, and report the
direct observation of the predicted band-gap closure and the reopening of the
gap under variation of the applied magnetic field. We also highlight the
important influence of mechanical strain on the magnetoconductance of the CNTs.
