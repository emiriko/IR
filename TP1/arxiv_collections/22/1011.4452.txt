Motivated by the increasing ability of experimentalists to perform detector
tomography, we consider how to incorporate the imperfections and restrictions
of available measurements directly into the quantification of entanglement.
Exploiting the idea that the recently introduced semiquantum nonlocal games as
the gauge of the amount of entanglement in a state, we define an effective
entanglement functional giving us effective entanglement when the measurement
operators one has at their disposal are restricted by either fundamental
considerations, such as superselection rules, or practical inability to conduct
precise measurements. We show that effective entanglement is always reduced by
restricting measurements. We define effective entanglement as the least amount
of entanglement necessary to play all semiquantum nonlocal games at least as
well with unrestricted measurements as with the more entangled original state
and restricted measurements. We show that simple linear relationship between
effective and conventional G-concurrence, generalization of concurrence, can be
obtained when completely positive maps are used to describe measurement
restrictions. We consider how typical measurement errors like photon loss and
phase damping degrade effective entanglement in quantum optical experiments, as
well as the impact of mass superselection rules on entanglement of massive
indistinguishable particles. The flexibility of the effective entanglement
formalism allows this single-particle entanglement to be calculated in the
presence of a local Bose Einstein condensate reference frame with varying phase
uncertainty, thereby interpolating between the complete breaking or strict
application of the super-selection rule.
