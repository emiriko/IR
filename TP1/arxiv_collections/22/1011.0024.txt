Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) are having a transformational effect on
numerical lattice quantum chromodynamics (LQCD) calculations of importance in
nuclear and particle physics. The QUDA library provides a package of mixed
precision sparse matrix linear solvers for LQCD applications, supporting single
GPUs based on NVIDIA's Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA). This
library, interfaced to the QDP++/Chroma framework for LQCD calculations, is
currently in production use on the "9g" cluster at the Jefferson Laboratory,
enabling unprecedented price/performance for a range of problems in LQCD.
Nevertheless, memory constraints on current GPU devices limit the problem sizes
that can be tackled. In this contribution we describe the parallelization of
the QUDA library onto multiple GPUs using MPI, including strategies for the
overlapping of communication and computation. We report on both weak and strong
scaling for up to 32 GPUs interconnected by InfiniBand, on which we sustain in
excess of 4 Tflops.
