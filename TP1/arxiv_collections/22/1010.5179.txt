We use the marginal stability condition for galactic disks and the stellar
velocity dispersion data published by different authors to place upper limits
on the disk local surface density at two radial scalelengths $R=2h$.
Extrapolating these estimates, we constrain the total mass of the disks and
compare these estimates to those based on the photometry and color of stellar
populations. The comparison reveals that the stellar disks of most of spiral
galaxies in our sample cannot be substantially overheated and are therefore
unlikely to have experienced a significant merging event in their history. The
same conclusion applies to some, but not all of the S0 galaxies we consider.
However, a substantial part of the early type galaxies do show the stellar
velocity dispersion well in excess of the gravitational stability threshold
suggesting a major merger event in the past. We find dynamically overheated
disks among both seemingly isolated galaxies and those forming pairs. The ratio
of the marginal stability disk mass estimate to the total galaxy mass within
four radial scalelengths remains within a range of 0.4---0.8. We see no
evidence for a noticeable running of this ratio with either the morphological
type or color index.
