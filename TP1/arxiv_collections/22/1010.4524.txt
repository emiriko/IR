I investigate a disordered version of a simplified model of protein folding,
with binary degrees of freedom, applied to an ideal beta-hairpin structure.
Disorder is introduced by assuming that the contact energies are independent
and identically distributed random variables. The equilibrium free-energy of
the model is studied, performing the exact calculation of its quenched value
and proving the self-averaging feature.
