The magnetic properties of single crystalline EuPtGe$_3$, crystallizing in
the non-centrosymmetric BaNiSn$_3$-type crystal structure, have been studied by
means of magnetisation, electrical resistivity, heat capacity and $^{151}$Eu
M\"ossbauer spectroscopy. The susceptibility and heat capacity data indicate a
magnetic transition at $T_{\rm N}$ = 11\,K. The M\"ossbauer data confirm this
conclusion, but evidence a slight first order character of the transition.
Analysing the magnetisation data using a mean field model with two
antiferromagnetically coupled sublattices allows to explain some aspects of the
magnetic behaviour, and to derive the first and second neighbour exchange
integrals in EuPtGe$_3$.
