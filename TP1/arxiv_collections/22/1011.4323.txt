The Nernst effect is known to be a sensitive probe of the scattering
mechanisms. Large Nernst effects, a decade ago a topic mainly in vortex
dynamics in superconductors, have recently attracted interest in correlated
systems like cuprate metals and heavy fermion systems. However, it has been
found that these ``giant" Nernst signals stay within one order of magnitude of
the classical Sondheimer formula for a Fermi liquid. It therefore seems that a
large Nernst effect neither relies on nor is sensitive to strong correlations.
This might, however, be different in some recently studied supposedly
correlated systems like FeSB_2. We do not address these systems specifically,
but take them only as one inspiration for considering a theoretical scenario
where correlations could actually sizably modify the Sondheimer formula. We
point out that an enhanced Nernst signal would follow from the phenomenological
Boltzmann approach introduced by Coleman, Schofield and Tsvelik proposed to
capture electronic correlations by imposing different relaxation times on the
charge conjugation even and odd Majorana components of the electron.
