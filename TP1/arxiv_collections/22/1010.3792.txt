Considering simultaneously isospin and SU(3) flavor symmetry breakings, we
investigate the complete mass splittings of SU(3) baryons within a chiral
soliton model, a {}"model-independent approach" being employed. In linear order
several new mass relations are derived, which are mostly generalizations of
existing mass formulae. The dynamical quantities appearing in the expressions
for the masses are fixed by fitting them to the masses of the baryon octet and
the masses of $\Omega^{-}$ and $\Theta^{+}$ as input rather than by extracting
them from a calculated self-consistent soliton profile. In particular, the
consideration of isospin symmetry breaking allows us to use the experimental
data of the whole octet baryon masses as input. We predict the masses of the
baryon decuplet and antidecuplet without any further adjustable free parameter.
In addition, we also obtain the pion-nucleon sigma term which turns out to be
$\Sigma_{\pi N} = 36.4\pm3.9\,\mathrm{MeV}$. We get the ratio of the current
light quark masses $R = 58.1\pm1.3$. The present results indicate that the
recent experimental data for the $\Theta^{+}(1524)$ are compatible with the
experimental data of the octet and decuplet masses.
