It has previously been shown that varying the numerical timestep during a
symplectic orbital integration leads to a random walk in energy and angular
momentum, destroying the phase space-conserving property of symplectic
integrators. Here we show that when altering the timestep symplectic correctors
can be used to reduce this error to a negligible level. Furthermore, these
correctors can also be employed to avoid a large error introduction when
changing the Hamiltonian's partitioning. We have constructed a numerical
integrator using this technique that is nearly as accurate as widely used
fixed-step routines. In addition, our algorithm is drastically faster for
integrations of highly eccentricitic, large semimajor axis orbits, such as
those found in the Oort Cloud.
