The statistics of the curvature quanta generated during a stage of
inflationary expansion is used to derive a count response model for the
large-scale phonons determining, in the concordance lore, the warmer and the
cooler spots of the large-scale temperature inhomogeneities. The multiplicity
distributions for the counting statistics are shown to be generically
overdispersed in comparison with conventional Poissonian regressions. The
generalized count response model deduced hereunder accommodates an excess of
correlations in the regime of high multiplicities and prompts dedicated
analyses with forthcoming data collected by instruments of high angular
resolution and high sensitivity to temperature variations per pixel.
