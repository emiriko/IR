Quantum transmission spectra of a twisted electron waveguide expose the
coupling between traveling and quasi-bound states. Through a direct numerical
solution of the open-boundary Schr\"odinger equation we single out the effects
of the twist and show how the presence of a localized state leads to a
Breit-Wigner or a Fano resonance in the transmission. We also find that the
energy of quasi-bound states is increased by the twist, in spite of the
constant section area along the waveguide. While the mixing of different
transmission channels is expected to reduce the conductance, the shift of
localized levels into the traveling-states energy range can reduce their
detrimental effects on coherent transport.
