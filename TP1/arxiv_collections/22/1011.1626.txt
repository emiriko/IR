Phase transitions in polar binary mixtures can be drastically altered even by
a small amount of salt. This is because the preferential solvation strongly
depends on the ambient composition. Together with a summary of our research in
this problem, we present some detailed results on the role of antagonistic salt
composed of hydrophilic and hydrophobic ions. These ions tend to segregate at
liquid-liquid interfaces and selectively couple to water-rich and oil-rich
composition fluctuations, leading to mesophase formation. In our
two-dimensional simulation, the corasening of the domain structures can be
stopped or slowed down, depending on the interaction parameter (or the
temperature) and the salt density. We realize stripe patterns at the critical
composition and droplet patterns at off-critical compositions. In the latter
case, charged droplets emerge with considerable size dispersity in a percolated
region. We also give the structure factors among the ions, accounting for the
Coulomb interaction and the solvation interaction mediated by the composition
fluctuations.
