Spectrographs like HARPS can now reach a sub-m/s precision in radial-velocity
(RV) (Pepe & Lovis 2008). At this level of accuracy, we start to be confronted
with stellar noise produced by 3 different physical phenomena: oscillations,
granulation phenomena (granulation, meso- and super-granulation) and activity.
On solar type stars, these 3 types of perturbation can induce m/s RV variation,
but on different time scales: 3 to 15 minutes for oscillations, 15 minutes to
1.5 days for granulation phenomena and 10 to 50 days for activity. The high
precision observational strategy used on HARPS, 1 measure per night of 15
minutes, on 10 consecutive days each month, is optimized, due to a long
exposure time, to average out the noise coming from oscillations (Dumusque et
al. 2010) but not to reduce the noise coming from granulation and activity. The
smallest planets found with this strategy (Mayor et al. 2009) seems to be at
the limit of the actual observational strategy and not at the limit of the
instrumental precision. To be able to find Earth mass planets in the habitable
zone of solar-type stars (200 days for a K0 dwarf), new observational
strategies, averaging out simultaneously all type of stellar noise, are
required.
