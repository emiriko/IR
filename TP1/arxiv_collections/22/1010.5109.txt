Approximately 2.8 Myr before the present our planet was subjected to the
debris of a supernova explosion. The terrestrial proxy for this event was the
discovery of live atoms of 60Fe in a deep-sea ferromanganese crust. The
signature for this supernova event should also reside in magnetite Fe3O4
microfossils produced by magnetotactic bacteria extant at the time of the
Earth-supernova interaction, provided the bacteria preferentially uptake iron
from fine-grained iron oxides and ferric hydroxides. Using estimates for the
terrestrial supernova 60Fe flux, combined with our empirically derived
microfossil concentrations in a deep-sea drill core, we deduce a conservative
estimate of the ^{60}{Fe} fraction as 60Fe/Fe ~ 3.6 x 10^{-15}. This value sits
comfortably within the sensitivity limit of present accelerator mass
spectrometry capabilities. The implication is that a biogenic signature of this
cosmic event is detectable in the Earth's fossil record.
