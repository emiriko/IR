We present a complete next to next to leading order QCD corrections to the
resonant sneutrino and charged slepton production cross sections at hadronic
colliders such as the Tevatron and the Large Hadron Collider within the context
of $R$-parity violating supersymmetric model. We have demonstrated the role of
these corrections in reducing uncertainties resulting from renormalisation and
factorisation scales and thereby making our predictions reliable. We have
incorporated soft gluon effects at $N^3LO$ level in order to study the
stability of our results under perturbation. The NNLO corrections are found to
be large and significant. The results obtained in this article are also
applicable to resonance production of any color-neutral scalar.
