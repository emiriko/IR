Evidence is presented for the finite wave vector crossing of the two lowest
one-dimensional spin-split subbands in quantum point contacts fabricated from
two-dimensional hole gases with strong spin-orbit interaction. This phenomenon
offers an elegant explanation for the anomalous sign of the spin polarization
filtered by a point contact, as observed in magnetic focusing experiments.
Anticrossing is introduced by a magnetic field parallel to the channel or an
asymmetric potential transverse to it. Controlling the magnitude of the
spin-splitting affords a novel mechanism for inverting the sign of the spin
polarization.
