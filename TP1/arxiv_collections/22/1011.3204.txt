These lectures concern the theory of the Color Glass Condensate (CGC) and the
Glasma. These are forms of matter that control the earliest times in hadronic
collisions. I will motivate the CGC and Glasma from simple physical
considerations, and provide a sketchy derivation from QCD. There will be some
discussion of experimental tests of these ideas.
