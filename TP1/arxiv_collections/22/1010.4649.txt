I review the recent efforts in the search for a minimal and predictive
nonsupersymmetric SO(10) Grand Unified Thoery (GUT). The outcome is the revival
of a minimal scenario in which a long standing result, claiming the
incompatibility between unification constraints and symmetry breaking dynamics,
is now confuted by the implementation of the one-loop effective potential.
