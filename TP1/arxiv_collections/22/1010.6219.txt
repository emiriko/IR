In this paper we prove that a Gaussian white noise on the $d$-dimensional
torus has paths in the Besov spaces $B^{-d/2}_{p,\infty}(\T^d)$ with $p\in [1,
\infty)$. This result is shown to be optimal in several ways. We also show that
Gaussian white noise on the $d$-dimensional torus has paths in a the
Fourier-Besov space $\hat{b}^{-d/p}_{p,\infty}(\T^d)$. This is shown to be
optimal as well.
