We explore how to generate hierarchies in the splittings between
superpartners. Some of the consequences are the existence of invisible
components of dark matter, new inflaton candidates, invisible monopoles and a
number of invisible particles that might dominate during various eras, in
particular between BBN and recombination and decay subsequently.
