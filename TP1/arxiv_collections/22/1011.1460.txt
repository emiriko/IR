We present a unified treatment of the prevalence of different double
ionization (DI) pathways as a function of the sum of the final electron
energies in strongly driven Helium. We do so as a function of laser frequency
and intensity. At small total energy a new DI pathway prevails where both
electrons are ionized with a delay after re-collision. We find that three-body
collisions between the two electrons and the nucleus underly this pathway--we
refer to it as triple collision (TC) pathway. At high total energy the pathway
that prevails is the one where one electron is ionized with a delay following
re-collision---we refer to it as Delayed pathway. Asymptotic observables that
trace the prevalence of the latter pathways are identified.
