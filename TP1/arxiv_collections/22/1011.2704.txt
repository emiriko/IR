The built-up land represents an important type of overall landscape. In this
paper the built-up land structure in the largest cities in the Czech Republic
and selected cities in the U.S.A. is analysed using the framework of
statistical physics. We calculate the variance of the built-up area and the
number variance of built-up landed plots in discs. In both cases the variance
as a function of a disc radius follows a power law. The obtained values of
power law exponents are comparable through different cities. The study is based
on cadastral data from the Czech Republic and building footprints from GIS data
in the U.S.A.
