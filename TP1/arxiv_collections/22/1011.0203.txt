Theory holds that a star born with an initial mass between about 8 and 140
times the mass of the Sun will end its life through the catastrophic
gravitational collapse of its iron core to a neutron star or black hole. This
core collapse process is thought to usually be accompanied by the ejection of
the star's envelope as a supernova. This established theory is now being tested
observationally, with over three dozen core-collapse supernovae having had the
properties of their progenitor stars directly measured through the examination
of high-resolution images taken prior to the explosion. Here I review what has
been learned from these studies and briefly examine the potential impact on
stellar evolution theory, the existence of "failed supernovae", and our
understanding of the core-collapse explosion mechanism.
