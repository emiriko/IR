We report on the spectral cross-calibration results of the Konus-Wind, the
Suzaku/WAM, and the Swift/BAT instruments using simultaneously observed
gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). This is the first attempt to use simultaneously
observed GRBs as a spectral calibration source to understand systematic
problems among the instruments. Based on these joint spectral fits, we find
that 1) although a constant factor (a normalization factor) agrees within 20%
among the instruments, the BAT constant factor shows a systematically smaller
value by 10-20% compared to that of Konus-Wind, 2) there is a systematic trend
that the low-energy photon index becomes steeper by 0.1-0.2 and Epeak becomes
systematically higher by 10-20% when including the BAT data in the joint fits,
and 3) the high-energy photon index agrees within 0.2 among the instruments.
Our results show that cross-calibration based on joint spectral analysis is an
important step to understanding the instrumental effects which could be
affecting the scientific results from the GRB prompt emission data.
