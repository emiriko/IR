Motion of electrons can influence their spins through a fundamental effect
called spin-orbit interaction. This interaction provides a way to electrically
control spins and as such lies at the foundation of spintronics. Even at the
level of single electrons, spin-orbit interaction has proven promising for
coherent spin rotations. Here we report a spin-orbit quantum bit implemented in
an InAs nanowire, where spin-orbit interaction is so strong that spin and
motion can no longer be separated. In this regime we realize fast qubit
rotations and universal single qubit control using only electric fields. We
enhance coherence by dynamically decoupling the qubit from the environment. Our
qubits are individually addressable: they are hosted in single-electron quantum
dots, each of which has a different Land\'e g-factor. The demonstration of a
nanowire qubit opens ways to harness the advantages of nanowires for use in
quantum computing. Nanowires can serve as one-dimensional templates for
scalable qubit registers. Unique to nanowires is the possibility to easily vary
the material even during wire growth. Such flexibility can be used to design
wires with suppressed decoherence and push semiconductor qubit fidelities
towards error-correction levels. Furthermore, electrical dots can be integrated
with optical dots in p-n junction nanowires. The coherence times achieved here
are sufficient for the conversion of an electronic qubit into a photon, the
flying qubit, for long-distance quantum communication.
