We suggest circuit realizations of emulators transforming memristive devices
into effective floating memcapacitive and meminductive systems. The emulator's
circuits are based on second generation current conveyors and involve either
four single-output or two dual-output current conveyors. The equations
governing the resulting memcapactive and meminductive systems are presented.
