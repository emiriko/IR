We have theoretically studied the full counting statistics of electron
transport through a single-molecule magnet (SMM) with an arbitrary angle
between the applied magnetic field and the SMM's easy axis above the sequential
tunneling threshold, since the angle $\theta$ cannot be controlled in
present-day SMM experiments. In the absence of the small transverse anisotropy,
when the coupling of the SMM with the incident-electrode is stronger than that
with the outgoing-electrode, i.e., $\Gamma_{L}/\Gamma_{R}\gg1$, the maximum
peak of shot noise first increases and then decreases with increasing $\theta$
from 0 to $0.5\pi$. In particular, the shot noise can reach up to
super-Poissonian value from sub-Poissonian value when considering the small
transverse anisotropy. For $\Gamma_{L}/\Gamma_{R}\ll1$, the maximum peaks of
the shot noise and skewness can be reduced from a super-Poissonian to a
sub-Poissonian value with increasing $\theta$ from 0 to $0.5\pi$; the
super-Poissonian behavior of the skewness is more sensitive to the small
$\theta$ than shot noise, which is suppressed when taking into account the
small transverse anisotropy. These characteristics of shot noise can be
qualitatively attributed to the competition between the fast and slow transport
channels. The predictions regarding of the $\theta$-dependence of high order
current cumulants are very interesting for a better understanding electron
transport through SMM, and will allow for experimental tests in the near
future.
