In this paper we are using formal analogy of electromagnetic wave equation
and Schrodinger equation in order to study the phenomenon of perfect tunneling
(tunneling with unitary transmittance) in 1D semiconductor heterostructure.
Using the Kane model of semiconductor we are showing that such phenomenon can
indeed exist, resembling all the interesting features of the analogous
phenomenon in classical electromagnetism in which metamaterials (substances
with negative material parameters) are involved. We believe that these results
can open up the way to interesting applications in which the metamaterial ideas
are transfered into semiconductor domain.
