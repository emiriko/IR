We derive an effective action for contacts between superconducting terminals
with arbitrary transmission distribution of conducting channels. In the case of
normal-superconducting (NS) contacts we evaluate interaction correction to
Andreev conductance and demonstrate a close relation between Coulomb effects
and shot noise in these systems. In the case of superconducting (SS) contacts
we derive the electron-electron interaction correction to the Josephson
current. At $T=0$ both corrections are found to vanish for fully transparent NS
and SS contacts indicating the absence of Coulomb effects in this limit.
