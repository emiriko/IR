A 60 GHz wireless Gigabit Ethernet (G.E.) communication system is developed
at IETR. As the 60 GHz radio link operates only in a single-room configuration,
an additional Radio over Fibre (RoF) link is used to ensure the communications
in all the rooms of a residential environment. The realized system covers 2 GHz
bandwidth. Due to the hardware constraints, a symbol rate at 875 Mbps is
attained using simple single carrier architecture. In the baseband (BB)
processing block, an original byte/frame synchronization process is designed to
provide a smaller value of the preamble missing detection and false alarm
probabilities. Bit error rate (BER) measurements have been realized in a large
gym for line-of-sight (LOS) conditions. A Tx-Rx distance greater than 30 meters
was attained with low BER using high gain antennas and forward error correction
RS (255, 239) coding.
