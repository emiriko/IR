We discuss some of the main open issues related to the light-up and evolution
of the first accreting sources powering high redshift luminous quasars. We
discuss the perspectives of future deep X-ray surveys with the International
X-ray Observatory and possible synergies with the Wide Field X-ray Telescope.
