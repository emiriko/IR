We present an axiomatic framework for the residue structures induced by
Prufer extensions with a stress upon the intimate connection between their
arithmetic and arboreal theoretic properties. The main result of the paper
provides an adjunction relationship between two naturally defined functors
relating Prufer extensions and superrigid directed commutative regular
quasi-semirings.
