We report a combined study on the synthesis, spectroscopic characterization
and theoretical modelling of a series of {\alpha},{\omega}-dinaphthylpolyynes.
We synthesized this family of naphtyl-terminated sp carbon chains by reacting
diiodoacetylene and 1-ethynylnaphthalene under the Cadiot-Chodkiewicz reaction
conditions. By means of liquid chromatography (HPLC), we separated the products
and recorded their electronic absorption spectra, which enabled us to identify
the complete series of dinaphthylpolyynes Ar-C2n-Ar (with Ar = naphthyl group
and n = number of acetilenic units) with n ranging from 2 to 6. The longest
wavelength transition (LWT) in the electronic spectra of the dinaphthylpolyynes
red shifts linearly with n away from the LWT of the bare termination. This
result is also supported by DFT-LDA simulations. Finally, we probed the
stability of the dinaphthylpolyynes in a solid-state precipitate by
Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and by differential scanning
calorimetry (DSC).
