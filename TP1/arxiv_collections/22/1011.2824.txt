We apply relativistic many-body methods to compute static differential
polarizabilities for transitions inside the ground-state hyperfine manifolds of
monovalent atoms and ions. Knowing this transition polarizability is required
in a number of high-precision experiments, such as microwave atomic clocks and
searches for CP-violating permanent electric dipole moments. While the
traditional polarizability arises in the second-order of interaction with the
externally-applied electric field, the differential polarizability involves
additional contribution from the hyperfine interaction of atomic electrons with
nuclear moments. We derive formulas for the scalar and tensor polarizabilities
including contributions from magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole hyperfine
interactions. Numerical results are presented for Al, Rb, Cs, Yb$^+$, Hg$^+$,
and Fr.
