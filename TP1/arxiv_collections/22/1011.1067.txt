We derive explicitly the coupling property for the transition semigroup of a
L\'{e}vy process and gradient estimates for the associated semigroup of
transition operators. This is based on the asymptotic behaviour of the symbol
or the characteristic exponent near zero and infinity, respectively. Our
results can be applied to a large class of L\'{e}vy processes, including stable
L\'{e}vy processes, layered stable processes, tempered stable processes and
relativistic stable processes.
