The CERN-Latin-American School of High-Energy Physics is intended to give
young physicists an introduction to the theoretical aspects of recent advances
in elementary particle physics. These proceedings contain lectures on quantum
field theory, quantum chromodynamics, physics beyond the Standard Model,
neutrino physics, flavour physics and CP violation, particle cosmology,
high-energy astro-particle physics, and heavy-ion physics, as well as trigger
and data acquisition, and commissioning and early physics analysis of the ATLAS
and CMS experiments. Also included are write-ups of short review projects
performed by the student discussions groups.
