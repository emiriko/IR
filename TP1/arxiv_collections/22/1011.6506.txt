Microwave observations of quasi-periodic pulsations (QPP) in multi-timescales
are confirmed to be associated with an X3.4 flare/CME event at Solar Broadband
Radio Spectrometer in Huairou (SBRS/Huairou) on 13 December 2006. It is most
remarkable that the timescales of QPPs are distributed in a broad range from
hecto-second (very long period pulsation, VLP, the period P>100 s), deca-second
(long period pulsation, LPP, 10<P<100 s), few seconds (short period pulsation,
SPP, 1<P<10 s), deci-second (slow-very short period pulsation, slow-VSP,
0.1<P<1.0 s), to centi-second (fast-very short period pulsation, fast-VSP,
P<0.1 s), and forms a broad hierarchy of timescales. The statistical
distribution in logarithmic period-duration space indicates that QPPs can be
classified into two groups: group I includes VLP, LPP, SPP and part of
slow-VSPs distributed around a line approximately; group II includes fast-VSP
and most of slow-VSP dispersively distributed away from the above line. This
feature implies that the generation mechanism of group I is different from
group II. Group I is possibly related with some MHD oscillations in magnetized
plasma loops in the active region, e.g., VLP may be generated by standing slow
sausage mode coupling and resonating with the underlying photospheric 5-min
oscillation, the modulation is amplified and forms the main framework of the
whole flare/CME process; LPP, SPP, and part of slow-VSPs are most likely to be
caused by standing fast modes or LRC-circuit resonance in current-carrying
plasma loops. Group II is possibly generated by modulations of resistive
tearing-mode oscillations in electric current-carrying flaring loops.
