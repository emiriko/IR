This is a simple way rigorously to construct Grassmann, Clifford and
Geometric Algebras, allowing degenerate bilinear forms, infinite dimension,
using fields or certain modules (characteristic 2 with limitation) - and
characterize the algebras in a coordinate free form. The construction is done
in an orthogonal basis, and the algebras characterized by universality. The
basic properties with short proofs provides a clear foundation for further
development of the algebras.
