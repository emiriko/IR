The Small-Set Expansion Hypothesis (Raghavendra, Steurer, STOC 2010) is a
natural hardness assumption concerning the problem of approximating the edge
expansion of small sets in graphs. This hardness assumption is closely
connected to the Unique Games Conjecture (Khot, STOC 2002). In particular, the
Small-Set Expansion Hypothesis implies the Unique Games Conjecture
(Raghavendra, Steurer, STOC 2010).
  Our main result is that the Small-Set Expansion Hypothesis is in fact
equivalent to a variant of the Unique Games Conjecture. More precisely, the
hypothesis is equivalent to the Unique Games Conjecture restricted to instance
with a fairly mild condition on the expansion of small sets. Alongside, we
obtain the first strong hardness of approximation results for the Balanced
Separator and Minimum Linear Arrangement problems. Before, no such hardness was
known for these problems even assuming the Unique Games Conjecture.
  These results not only establish the Small-Set Expansion Hypothesis as a
natural unifying hypothesis that implies the Unique Games Conjecture, all its
consequences and, in addition, hardness results for other problems like
Balanced Separator and Minimum Linear Arrangement, but our results also show
that the Small-Set Expansion Hypothesis problem lies at the combinatorial heart
of the Unique Games Conjecture.
  The key technical ingredient is a new way of exploiting the structure of the
Unique Games instances obtained from the Small-Set Expansion Hypothesis via
(Raghavendra, Steurer, 2010). This additional structure allows us to modify
standard reductions in a way that essentially destroys their local-gadget
nature. Using this modification, we can argue about the expansion in the graphs
produced by the reduction without relying on expansion properties of the
underlying Unique Games instance (which would be impossible for a local-gadget
reduction).
