Urbi SDK is a software platform for the development of portable robotic
applications. It features the Urbi UObject C++ middleware, to manage hardware
drivers and/or possibly remote software components, and urbiscript, a domain
specific programming language to orchestrate them. Reactivity is a key feature
of Urbi SDK, embodied in events in urbiscript. This paper presents the support
for events in urbiscript.
