We analyze light meson electroproduction in the intermediate energy range
where the quark contributions are essential. Our calculations are carried out
on the basis of the handbag approach. We study cross sections and spin
asymmetries for various vector and pseudoscalar mesons. Our results are in good
agrement with COMPASS and HERMES experiments.
