Particles embedded in a fluctuating interface experience forces and torques
mediated by the deformations and by the thermal fluctuations of the medium.
Considering a system of two cylinders bound to a fluid membrane we show that
the entropic contribution enhances the curvature-mediated repulsion between the
two cylinders. This is contrary to the usual attractive Casimir force in the
absence of curvature-mediated interactions. For a large distance between the
cylinders, we retrieve the renormalization of the surface tension of a flat
membrane due to thermal fluctuations.
