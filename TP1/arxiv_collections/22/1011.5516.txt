On the one hand, inflation is an extremely convincing scenario: it solves
most cosmological paradoxes and generates fluctuations that became the seeds
for the growth of structures. It, however, suffers from a "naturalness"
problem: generating initial conditions for inflation is far from easy. On the
other hand, loop quantum cosmology is very successful: it solves the Big Bang
singularity through a non-perturbative and background-independent quantization
of general relativity. It, however, suffers from a key drawback: it is
extremely difficult to test. Recent results can let us hope that inflation and
LQC could mutually cure those pathologies: LQC seems to naturally generate
inflation and inflation could allow us to test LQC.
