Intense solar energetic particle (SEP) events data, associated with ground
level enhancements (GLEs), occurred during 1989 to 2006 have been obtained from
the spectrometers on board GOES spacecraft in the energy range 10-100 MeV. The
interplanetary effects of these events and their associated coronal mass
ejections (CMEs) have been provided by the LASCO/SOHO coronagraph images in the
field of view of 2-30 {\rsun} and the interplanetary scintillation images from
the Ooty Radio Telescope in the heliocentric distance range of $\sim$40-250
R$_\odot$. The comparison between the radial evolution of the CME and its
associated particle spectrum shows that the spectrum is soft at the onset of
the particle event. A flat spectrum is observed at the peak of the particle
event and the spectrum becomes steeper as the CME moves farther out into the
inner heliosphere. However, the magnitude of change in spectral slopes differs
from one CME to the other, suggesting the difference in energy available within
the CME to drive the shock. The spectral index evolution as a function of
initial speed of the CME at different parts of the particle profile has also
been compared. The result shows that the change in particle flux with time is
rather quick for the high-energy portion of the spectrum than that of the
low-energy part, which makes the steepening of the energy spectrum with
time/distance from the Sun. It indicates that the acceleration of particles by
a CME-driven shock may be efficient at low energies ($\leq$30 MeV) and the
efficiency of the shock decreases gradually towards the high-energy side of the
spectrum.
