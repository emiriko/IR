We study the chiral phase transition by the non-equilibrium propagation of
the sigma field. A quark fluid acts as a heat bath in local thermal equilibrium
and evolves fluid dynamically. We allow for dissipative processes and
fluctuations since the sigma field is propagated according to a Langevin-type
equation of motion. Non-equilibrium fluctuations at the first order phase
transition lead to an increase in the intensity of sigma excitations.
