We describe a microwave photon counter based on the current-biased Josephson
junction. The junction is tuned to absorb single microwave photons from the
incident field, after which it tunnels into a classically observable voltage
state. Using two such detectors, we have performed a microwave version of the
Hanbury Brown and Twiss experiment at 4 GHz and demonstrated a clear signature
of photon bunching for a thermal source. The design is readily scalable to tens
of parallelized junctions, a configuration that would allow number-resolved
counting of microwave photons.
