We study the transformation properties of a scalar-tensor theory, coupled to
fermions, under the Weyl rescaling associated with a transition from the Jordan
to the Einstein frame. We give a simple derivation of the corresponding
modification to the gauge couplings. After changing frame, this gives rise to a
direct coupling between the scalar and the gauge fields.
