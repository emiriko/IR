We investigate the electrostatics of a partially formed, charged spherical
shell in a salt solution. We solve the problem numerically at the
Poisson-Boltzmann level and analytically in the Debye-Huckel regime. From the
results on energetics of partially formed shells we examine the stability of
tethered (crystalline) and fluid shells towards rupture. We clearly delineate
different regimes of stability towards rupture, where, for fluid shells, we
also include the effects of bending elasticity of the shells. Our analysis
shows how charging of the shell induces its instability towards rupture but
also provides insight regarding growth of charged shells.
