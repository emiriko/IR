We introduce the concept of polychromatic plasmonics and suggest an broadband
plasmonic lens for nanofocusing of surface plasmon polaritons. The lens employs
a parabolically modulated metal-dielectric-metal structure. This plasmonic lens
has a bandwidth of more than an optical octave thus opening new opportunities
for broadband plasmonic applications.
