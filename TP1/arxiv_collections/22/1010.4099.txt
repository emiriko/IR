We study the cosmological evolution of a single BPS D-brane in the absence of
potential, which is in the category of the Chaplygin gas cosmological model.
When such a D-brane coupled to gravity moves in the bulk with a non-vanishing
velocity, it tends to slow down to zero velocity via mechanisms like
gravitational waves leakage to the bulk, losing its kinetic energy to fuel the
expansion of the universe on the D-brane. If the initial velocity of the
D-brane is high enough, the universe on the D-brane undergoes a dust-like stage
at early times and an acceleration stage at late times, as observed in the
original Chaplygin gas model. When the D-brane velocity is initially zero, the
D-brane will always remain fixed at some position in the bulk, with the brane
tension over the Plank mass squared as a cosmological constant. Interestingly,
this kind of fixed brane universe can arise as defects from tachyon inflation
