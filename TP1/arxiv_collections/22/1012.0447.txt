Several constructions motivate the existence of a dark $U(1)_D$ gauge boson
which interacts with the Standard Model only through its kinetic mixing or loop
induced processes. We describe two typical examples with specific signatures in
particular we show that a region with relatively light WIMPS, $M_{Z_D}\lsim 40$
GeV and a kinetic mixing $10^{-4} \lsim \delta \lsim 10^{-3} $ is not yet
excluded by the last experimental data and seems to give promising signals in a
near future. We also show that conditions from anomaly cancelation generate
tri-vector couplings $Z_D Z \gamma$ leading to a specific gamma ray line
observable by FERMI telescope.
