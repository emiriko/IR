We present an analysis of the X-ray properties of a sample of solar- and
late-type field stars identified in the Chandra Cosmic Evolution Survey
(COSMOS), a deep (160ks) and wide (0.9 deg2) extragalactic survey. The sample
of 60 sources was identified using both morphological and photometric
star/galaxy separation methods. We determine X-ray count rates, extract spectra
and light curves and perform spectral fits to determine fluxes and plasma
temperatures. Complementary optical and near-IR photometry is also presented
and combined with spectroscopy for 48 of the sources to determine spectral
types and distances for the sample. We find distances ranging from 30pc to
~12kpc, including a number of the most distant and highly active stellar X-ray
sources ever detected. This stellar sample extends the known coverage of the
L_X-distance plane to greater distances and higher luminosities, but we do not
detect as many intrinsically faint X-ray sources compared to previous surveys.
Overall the sample is typically more luminous than the active Sun, representing
the high-luminosity end of the disk and halo X-ray luminosity functions. The
halo population appears to include both low-activity spectrally hard sources
that may be emitting through thermal bremsstrahlung, as well as a number of
highly active sources in close binaries.
