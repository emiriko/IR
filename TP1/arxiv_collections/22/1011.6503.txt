We study the boundary $L_t$ of the Milnor fiber for the reduced holomorphic
germs $f:(\Bbb C^3,0) \rightarrow (\Bbb C,0)$ having a non-isolated singularity
at $0$. We prove that $L_t$ is a graph manifold by using a new technique of
carrousel depending on one parameter varying on a circle. Our results enable
one to compare the topology of $L_t$ and of the link of the normalization of
$f^{-1}(0)$.
