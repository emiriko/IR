The galaxy NGC2770 hosted two core-collapse supernova explosions, SN2008D and
SN2007uy, within 10 days of each other and 9 years after the first supernova of
the same type, SN1999eh, was found in that galaxy. In particular SN2008D
attracted a lot of attention due to the detection of an X-ray outburst, which
has been hypothesized to be caused by either a (mildly) relativistic jet or the
supernova shock breakout. We present an extensive study of the radio emission
from SN2008D and SN2007uy: flux measurements with the Westerbork Synthesis
Radio Telescope and the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope, covering ~600 days
with observing frequencies ranging from 325 MHz to 8.4 GHz. The results of two
epochs of global Very Long Baseline Interferometry observations are also
discussed. We have examined the molecular gas in the host galaxy NGC2770 with
the Arizona Radio Observatory 12-m telescope, and present the implications of
our observations for the star formation and seemingly high SN rate in this
galaxy. Furthermore, we discuss the near-future observing possibilities of the
two SNe and their host galaxy at low radio frequencies with the Low Frequency
Array.
