In this study we investigated indirect manifestations of color octet electron
at the next generation linear colliders: International Linear Collider (ILC)
and Compact Linear Collider (CLIC). Namely, production of two gluons via color
octet electron exchange is considered. Signal and background analysis have been
performed taking into account initial state radiation and beamstrahlung. We
show that color octet electron (e_(8)) manifestation will be seen upto
M(e_(8))=1.75 TeV and 1.70 TeV at ILC and CLIC with sqrt(s)=0.5 TeV,
respectively. CLIC with sqrt(s)=3 TeV will be sensitive upto M(e_(8))=6.88 TeV.
