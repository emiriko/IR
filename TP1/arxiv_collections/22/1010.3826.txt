{\it The universe is expanding} is known (through Galaxy observations) since
1929 through Hubble's discovery ($V = H D$). Recently in 1999, it is found
(through Supernovae observations) that the universe is not simply expanding but
is accelerating too. We, however, hardly know only $4\%$ of the universe. The
Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) satellite observational data
suggest $73\%$ content of the universe in the form of dark-energy, $23\%$ in
the form of non-baryonic dark-matter and the rest $4\%$ in the form of the
usual baryonic matter. The acceleration of the universe is ascribed to this
dark-energy with bizarre properties (repulsive-gravity). The question is that
whether Hubble's expansion is just due to the shock of big-bang & inflation or
it is due to the repulsive-gravity of dark-energy? Now, it is believed to be
due to dark-energy, say, by re-introducing the once-discarded
cosmological-constant $\Lambda$. In the present paper, it is shown that `the
formula for acceleration due to dark-energy' is (almost) exactly of same-form
as `the acceleration formula from the Hubble's law'. Hence, it is concluded
that: yes, `indeed it is the dark-energy responsible for the Hubble's expansion
too, in-addition to the current on-going acceleration of the universe'.
