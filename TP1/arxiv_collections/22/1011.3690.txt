The quantum $N$-body problem is studied in the context of nonrelativistic
quantum mechanics with a one-dimensional deformed Heisenberg algebra of the
form $[\hat x,\hat p]=i(1+\beta \hat p^2)$, leading to the existence of a
minimal observable length $\sqrt\beta$. For a generic pairwise interaction
potential, analytical formulas are obtained that allow to estimate the
ground-state energy of the $N$-body system by finding the ground-state energy
of a corresponding two-body problem. It is first shown that, in the harmonic
oscillator case, the $\beta$-dependent term grows faster with $N$ than the
$\beta$-independent one. Then, it is argued that such a behavior should be
observed also with generic potentials and for $D$-dimensional systems. In
consequence, quantum $N$-body bound states might be interesting places to look
at nontrivial manifestations of a minimal length since, the more particles are
present, the more the system deviates from standard quantum mechanical
predictions.
