We investigate the production of gamma-rays in the inner regions of SS 433
and in its interaction between its jets and the W50 nebula. We estimate the VHE
emission that can be generated within the jets at distances above 1e+13 cm from
the compact object. We also apply a theoretical model of the jet/medium
interaction to SS 433/W50. We compare the predicted fluxes to observations of
SS 433 at TeV energies, and derive new constraints of the physical properties
of this system.
