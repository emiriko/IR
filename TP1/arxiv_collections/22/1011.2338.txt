We observed VB 10 in August and September 2009 using the FORS2 camera of the
VLT with the aim of measuring its astrometric motion and of probing the
presence of the announced planet VB 10b. We used the published STEPS
astrometric positions of VB 10 over a time-span of 9 years, which allowed us to
compare the expected motion of VB 10 due to parallax and proper motion with the
observed motion and to compute precise deviations. The achieved single-epoch
precisions of our observations are about 0.1 mas and the data showed no
significant residual trend, while the presence of the planet should have
induced an apparent proper motion larger than 10 mas/yr. Subtraction of the
predicted orbital motion from the observed data produces a large trend in
position residuals of VB 10. We estimated the probability that this trend is
caused by random noise. Taking all the uncertainties into account and using
Monte-Carlo resampling of the data, we are able to reject the existence of VB
10b with the announced mass of 6.4 M_J with the false alarm probability of only
0.0005. A 3.2 M_J planet is also rejected with a false alarm probability of
0.023.
