We study the state decay of two qubits interacted with a common harmonic
oscillator reservoir. There are both decoherence error and the error caused by
the amplitude change of the superradiant state. We show that frequent
$\pi$-phase pulses can eliminate both typpes of errors therefore protect a
two-qubit odd-parity state more effectively than the frequent measurement
method. This shows that the the methods using dynamical decoupling and the
quantum Zeno effects actually can give rather {\em different} results when the
operation frequency is finite.
