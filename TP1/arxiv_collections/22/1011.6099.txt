We report the synthesis and measurements of magnetic, transport, and thermal
properties of polycrystalline Nb0.18Re0.82, which has a superconducting
transition at Tc ~ 8.8 K. The non-centrosymmetric alpha-Mn structure of the
compound is confirmed by X-ray diffraction. Using the measured values for the
lower critical field Hc1, upper critical field Hc2, and the specific heat C, we
estimate the thermodynamic critical field Hc(0), coherence length {\xi}(0),
penetration depth {\lambda}(0), and the Ginzburg-Landau parameter {\kappa}(0).
The specific heat jump at Tc, {\Delta}C/{\gamma}Tc = 1.86, suggests that
Nb0.18Re0.82 is moderately coupled superconductor. Below Tc the electronic
specific heat decays exponentially, suggesting that the gap is isotropic. Our
data suggests that the triplet admixture is weak in the polycrystalline form of
compound. However, the estimated value of the upper critical field Hc2(0) is
close to the calculated Pauli limit indicating the need for single crystal
measurements.
