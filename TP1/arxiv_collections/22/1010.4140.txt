The cross section for the reaction $p+^6\text{Li}\to\eta+^7\text{Be}$ was
measured at an excess energy of 11.28 MeV above threshold by detecting the
recoiling $^7$Be nuclei. A dedicated set of focal plane detectors was built for
the magnetic spectrograph Big Karl and was used for identification and four
momentum measurement of the $^7$Be. A differential cross section of
$\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}=(0.69\pm{0.20}\text{(stat.)}\pm
0.20\text{(syst.)})\text{nb/sr}$ for the ground state plus the 1/2$^-$ was
measured. The result is compared to model calculations.
