Photoproduction events containing a charmed meson $D^{*\pm}$ and two jets
were investigated with the H1 detector using the HERA II data sample. The $D^*$
meson was reconstructed in the decay channel, $D^{*\pm}\rightarrow
D^0\pi^\pm\rightarrow K^\mp\pi^\pm\pi^\pm$. Jets were reconstructed using the
inclusive $k_t$ algorithm and were selected if they have transverse momenta
$p_t(\textrm{jet})>3.5\gev$. One of the jets was associated with the $D^*$
meson itself, such that the jet originating from the parent charmed quark as
the meson can be tagged. The phase space of the measurement is limited within
central rapidity for the $D^*$ meson and the $D^*_\textrm{jet}$, $|\eta|<1.5$
while the second jet was measured within, $-1.5<\eta<2.9$. Single differential
cross sections and double differential distributions were measured and compared
to Leading Order Monte Carlo (MC) event generators, \PYTHIA and \CASCADE and
with the Next--to--Leading order MC generator \MCATNLO
