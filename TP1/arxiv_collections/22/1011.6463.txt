We have studied the structural and electronic properties of defect
chalcopyrite semiconductors AAl2Se4 (A = Ag, Cu, Cd, Zn) using Density
Functional Theory (DFT) based first principle technique within Tight binding
Linear Muffin Tin orbital (TB-LMTO) method. Our calculated structural
parameters such as lattice constants, anion displacement parameter (u),
tetragonal distortion ({\eta} = c/2a), bond lengths and bulk modulus are in
good agreement with other work. Our band structure calculation suggests that
these compounds are direct band gap semiconductors having band gaps 2.40, 2.50,
2.46 and 2.82 eV for AAl2 Se4 (A = Ag, Cu, Cd, Zn) respectively. Calculated
band gaps are in good agreement with other experimental and theoretical works
within LDA limitation. We have made a quantitative estimation of the effect of
p-d hybridization and structural distortion on the electronic properties. The
reduction in band gap due to p-d hybridization are 19.47%, 21.29%, 0% and 0.7%
for AAl2 Se4 (A = Ag, Cu, Cd, Zn) respectively. Increment of the band gap due
to structural distortion is 11.62%, 2.45%, 2.92% and 9.30% in case of AgAl2
Se4, CuAl2 Se4, CdAl2 Se4 and ZnAl2 Se4 respectively . We have also discussed
the bond nature of all four compounds.
