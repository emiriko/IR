Dihadron fragmentation functions describe the probability that a quark
fragments into two hadrons plus other undetected hadrons. In particular, the
so-called interference fragmentation functions describe the azimuthal asymmetry
of the dihadron distribution when the quark is transversely polarized. They can
be used as tools to probe the quark transversity distribution in the nucleon.
Recent studies on unpolarized and polarized dihadron fragmentation functions
are presented, and we discuss their role in giving insights into transverse
spin distributions.
