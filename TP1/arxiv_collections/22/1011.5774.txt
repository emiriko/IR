Cosmological solutions of Einstein's equations for equilibrium statistical
systems of particles with scalar interaction are investigated. It is shown that
the scalar field can effectively change the state equation of a statistical
system, that leads to the possibility of secondary acceleration of the
cosmological expansion.
