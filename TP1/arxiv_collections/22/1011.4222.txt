We present an effective method for estimating the motion of proteins from the
motion of attached probe particles in single-molecule experiments. The
framework naturally incorporates Langevin dynamics to compute the most probable
trajectory of the protein. By using a perturbation expansion technique, we
achieve computational costs more than four orders of magnitude smaller than the
conventional gradient descent method without loss of simplicity in the
computation algorithm. We present illustrative applications of the method using
simple models of single-molecule experiments and confirm that the proposed
method yields reasonable and stable estimates of the hidden motion in a highly
efficient manner.
