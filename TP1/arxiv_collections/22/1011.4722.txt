The shrinking rank method is a variation of slice sampling that is efficient
at sampling from multivariate distributions with highly correlated parameters.
It requires that the gradient of the log-density be computable. At each
individual step, it approximates the current slice with a Gaussian occupying a
shrinking-dimension subspace. The dimension of the approximation is shrunk
orthogonally to the gradient at rejected proposals, since the gradients at
points outside the current slice tend to point towards the slice. This causes
the proposal distribution to converge rapidly to an estimate of the longest
axis of the slice, resulting in states that are less correlated than those
generated by related methods. After describing the method, we compare it to two
other methods on several distributions and obtain favorable results.
