We study a single species of fermionic atoms in an "effective" magnetic field
at total filling factor $\nu_{f}=1$, interacting through a p-wave Feshbach
resonance, and show that the system undergoes a quantum phase transition from a
$\nu_{f} =1 $ fermionic integer quantum Hall state to $\nu_{b} =1/4 $ bosonic
fractional quantum Hall state as a function of detuning. The transition is in
the $(2+1)$-D Ising universality class. We formulate a dual theory in terms of
quasiparticles interacting with a $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ gauge field, and show that
charge fractionalization follows from this topological quantum phase
transition. Experimental consequences and possible tests of our theoretical
predictions are discussed.
