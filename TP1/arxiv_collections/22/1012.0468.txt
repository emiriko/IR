We consider two well-known integrable systems on the plane using the concept
of natural Poisson bivectors on Riemaninan manifolds. Geometric approach to
construction of variables of separation and separated relations for the
generalized Henon-Heiles system and the generalized system with quartic
potential is discussed in detail.
