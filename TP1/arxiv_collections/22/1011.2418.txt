The arrival directions of ultrahigh energy extensive air showers (EAS) by
Yakutsk, AGASA and P. Auger data are considered. It is found that the arrival
directions of EAS in the Yakutsk and AGASA data are correlated with pulsars
from the side Input, and in the P. Auger data are correlated with pulsars from
the Output of the Local Arm of Orion. It is shown that the majority of these
pulsars have a short rotation period around their axes, than expected by the
pulsar catalogue.
