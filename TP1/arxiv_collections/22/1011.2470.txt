We establish Manin's conjecture for a quartic del Pezzo surface split over Q
and having a singularity of type A_3 and containing exactly four lines. It is
the first example of split singular quartic del Pezzo surface whose universal
torsor is not a hypersurface for which Manin's conjecture is proved.
