Relations between kinematics, geometry and law of reference frame motion are
considered. We show, that kinematical tensors define geometry up to a space
functional arbitrariness when integrability condition for spin tensor is
satisfied. Some aspects of geometrization principle and geometrical
conventionalism of Poincare are discussed in a light of the obtained results.
