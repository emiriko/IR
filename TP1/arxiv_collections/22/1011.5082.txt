It is known that the parity of reflection amplitude can either be even or odd
under the mirror operation. Up to now, all the parities of reflection amplitude
in the one-mode energy region are even under the mirror operation. In this
paper, we give an example of odd parity for Andreev reflection (AR) in a
three-terminal graphene-supercondutor hybrid systems. We found that the parity
is even for the Andreev retroreflection (ARR) and odd for specular Andreev
reflection (SAR). We attribute this remarkable phenomenon to the distinct
topology of the band structure of graphene and the specular Andreev reflection
involving two energy bands with different parity symmetry. As a result of odd
parity of SAR, the SAR probability of a four-terminal system with two
superconducting leads (two reflection interfaces) can be zero even when the
system is asymmetric due to the quantum interference of two ARs.
