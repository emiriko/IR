The goal of this paper is to obtain a better knowledge of the achievable data
rate over noncoherent Rician fading channel with time and frequency memory. We
assume that the average-power as well as the peak-power of the input signal are
finite and the peak-power limitation is applied in the time domain. Expression
for this rate is based on a lower bound on mutual information that assume
independent and identically distributed input data symbols. The lower bound is
expressed as a difference of two terms. The first term is the information rate
of the coherent channel with a weighted signal-to-noise ratio that results from
the peak-power limitation. The second term is a penalty term, explicit in the
Doppler spectrum of the channel, that captures the effect of the channel
uncertainty induced by the noncoherent setting. Impact of channel parameters,
such as delay and Doppler spread, on the information rate are discussed and
numerical applications on an experimental Rician channel surveyed in an
acoustic underwater environment are also provided.
