In this Comment I argue that Silveirinha's criticism of my earlier work
[M.G.Silveirinha, Phys.Rev.B 80, 235120 2009)] is based on an unphysical
excitation model which involves an "external current" which overlaps with a
continuous medium but is not subject to constitutive relations. When this
excitation model is replaced by the conventional and experimentally-relevant
model of excitation by external electromagnetic fields, it can be easily shown
that Silveirinha's formulas contain the very results he wanted to disprove.
This and a few other misconceptions present in Silveirinha's paper are subject
of this Comment.
