We combine the GALFORM semi-analytical model of galaxy formation, which
predicts the star formation and merger histories of galaxies, the GRASIL
spectro-photometric code, which calculates the spectral energy distributions
(SEDs) of galaxies self-consistently including reprocessing of radiation by
dust, and artificial neural networks (ANN), to investigate the clustering
properties of galaxies selected by their emission at submillimetre wavelengths
(SMGs). We use the Millennium Simulation to predict the spatial and angular
distribution of SMGs. At redshift z = 2, we find that these galaxies are
strongly clustered, with a comoving correlation length of r0 = 5.6 \pm 0.9
Mpc/h for galaxies with 850{\mu}m flux densities brighter than 5 mJy, in
agreement with observations. We predict that at higher redshifts these galaxies
trace denser and increasingly rarer regions of the universe. We present the
predicted dependence of the clustering on luminosity, submillimetre colour,
halo and total stellar masses. Interestingly, we predict tight relations
between correlation length and halo and stellar masses, independent of sub-mm
luminosity.
