We study the interactions between the f_0(980) and a_0(980) scalar resonances
and the lightest pseudoscalar mesons. We first obtain the elementary
interaction amplitudes, or interacting kernels, without including any ad hoc
free parameter. This is achieved by using previous results on the nature of the
lightest scalar resonances as dynamically generated from the rescattering of
S-wave two-meson pairs. Afterwards, the interaction kernels are unitarized and
the final S-wave amplitudes result. We find that these interactions are very
rich and generate a large amount of pseudoscalar resonances that could be
associated with the K(1460), \pi(1300), \pi(1800), \eta(1475) and X(1835). We
also consider the exotic channels with isospin 3/2 and 1, having the latter
positive G-parity. The former could be also resonant in agreement with a
previous prediction.
