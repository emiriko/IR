We provide guessed recurrence equations for the counting sequences of rook
paths on d-dimensional chess boards starting at (0..0) and ending at (n..n),
where d=2,3,...,12. Our recurrences suggest refined asymptotic formulas of
these sequences. Rigorous proofs of the guessed recurrences as well as the
suggested asymptotic forms are posed as challenges to the reader.
