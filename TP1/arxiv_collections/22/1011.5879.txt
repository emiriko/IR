We study the properties of the broad line region in blazars by comparing the
virial estimate of black hole masses with that derived from the mass of the
host galaxies. The former is sensitive to the width of broad lines, i.e., to
the projection of the velocity of line-emitting clouds along the line of sight;
the latter is not. This comparison allows us to constrain the deprojection
factor f, thus revealing general properties of the geometry of the broad line
region. We show that blazars tend to have 1) higher f values than the quasars
of our reference sample: <f_{BLLacs}>=6.9 +/- 2.3, <f_{blazars}>=5.6 +/- 1.3
and <f_{quasars}>=2.0 +/- 0.3; 2) relatively narrow broad emission lines; 3)
modest equivalent widths, as expected because of the occurrence of jet emission
at very low inclination angles. In a disc-like sketch of the broad line region,
these results indicate a pole-on view of a flat geometry in blazars. This
consistently extends the orientation--dependent unified model of active nuclei
to the geometry of the broad line region.
