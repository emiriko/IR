A thin ferromagnetic layer on a bulk equal-spin-pairing triplet
superconductor is shown to mediate a Josephson coupling between the spin
$\uparrow$ and $\downarrow$ condensates of the superconductor. By deriving
analytic expressions for the bound states at the triplet
superconductor-ferromagnet interface, we show that this spin Josephson effect
establishes an effective anisotropy axis in the ferromagnetic layer. The
associated Josephson spin current is predicted to cause a measurable precession
of the magnetization about the vector order parameter of the triplet
superconductor.
