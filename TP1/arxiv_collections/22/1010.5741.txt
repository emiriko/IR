We revisit the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process with open
boundaries (TASEP), focussing on the recent discovery by de Gier and Essler
that the model has a dynamical transition along a nontrivial line in the phase
diagram. This line coincides neither with any change in the steady-state
properties of the TASEP, nor the corresponding line predicted by domain wall
theory. We provide numerical evidence that the TASEP indeed has a dynamical
transition along the de Gier-Essler line, finding that the most convincing
evidence was obtained from Density Matrix Renormalisation Group (DMRG)
calculations. By contrast, we find that the dynamical transition is rather hard
to see in direct Monte Carlo simulations of the TASEP. We furthermore discuss
in general terms scenarios that admit a distinction between static and dynamic
phase behaviour.
