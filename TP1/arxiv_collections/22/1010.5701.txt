Foundations of thermodynamics in special theory of relativity are considered.
We argue that from the phenomenological point of view the correct relativistic
transformations of heat and absolute temperature are given by the formulae
proposed by H. Ott, H. Arzeli\`{e}s and C. M\oller. It is shown that the same
transformation rules can be also found from the relativistic Gibbs distribution
for ideal gas. This distribution has been recently verified by the computer
simulations. Phenomenological and statistical thermometers in relativistic
thermodynamics are analysed.
