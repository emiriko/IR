The tools of zero biasing are adapted to yield a general result suitable for
analyzing the behavior of certain growth processes. The main theorem is applied
to prove central limit theorems, with explicit error terms in the L^1 metric,
for certain statistics of the Jack measure on partitions and for the number of
balls drawn in a Polya-Eggenberger urn process.
