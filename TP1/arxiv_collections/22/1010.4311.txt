The low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) system FIRST J102347.6+003841 hosts a newly
born millisecond pulsar (MSP) PSR J1023+0038 that was revealed as the first and
only known rotation-powered MSP in a quiescent LMXB. While the system is shown
to have an accretion disk before 2002, it remains unclear how the accretion
disk has been removed in order to reveal the radio pulsation in 2007. In this
Letter, we report the discovery of gamma-rays spatially consistent with FIRST
J102347.6+003841, at a significance of 7 standard deviations, using data
obtained by the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. The gamma-ray spectrum can be
described by a power law (PL) with a photon index of 2.9+-0.2, resulting in an
energy flux above 200 MeV of (5.5+-0.9)x10^{-12} erg cm^{-2}s^{-1}. The
gamma-rays likely originate from the MSP PSR J1023+0038, but also possibly from
an intrabinary shock between the pulsar and its companion star. To complement
the gamma-ray study, we also re-investigate the XMM-Newton data taken in 2004
and 2008. Our X-ray spectral analysis suggests that a broken PL with two
distinct photon indices describes the X-ray data significantly better than a
single PL. This indicates that there exists two components and that both
components appear to vary with the orbital phase. The evidence for gamma-ray
emission conforms with a recent suggestion that gamma-rays from PSR J1023+0038
may be responsible for ejecting the disk material out of the system.
