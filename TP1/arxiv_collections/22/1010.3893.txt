This paper is part of a series on the Azimuthally Symmetric Theory of
Gravitation (ASTG) which is built on Laplace-Poisson's well known equation. We
show herein that the emergent equations from the ASTG, under some critical
conditions determined by the spin, do possess repulsive gravitational fields in
the polar regions of the gravitating body in question. This places the ASTG on
an interesting pedestal to infer the origins of outflows as a repulsive
gravitational phenomenon. Outflows are a ubiquitous phenomenon found in star
forming systems and their true origin is a question yet to be settled. Given
the current thinking on their origin, the direction that the present paper
takes is nothing short of an asymptotic break from conventional wisdom; at the
very least, it is a complete paradigm shift because gravitation is not at all
associated with this process, but rather it is thought to be an all-attractive
force that only tries to squash matter together onto a single point.
Additionally, we show that the emergent Azimuthally Symmetric Gravitational
Field from the ASTG strongly suggests a solution to the supposed Radiation
Problem that is thought to be faced by massive stars in their process of
formation. That is, at about 8-10Msun radiation from the nascent star is
expected to halt the accretion of matter. We show that in-falling material will
fall onto the equatorial disk and from there, this material will be channeled
onto the forming star via the equatorial plane, thus accretion of mass
continues well past the value of about 8-10Msun, albeit via the disk. Along the
equatorial plane, the net force (with the radiation force included) on any
material there-on right up to the surface of the star is directed toward the
forming star, hence accretion of mass by the nascent star is un-hampered.
