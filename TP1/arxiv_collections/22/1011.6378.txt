I present computations of the integrated column densities produced in the
post-shock cooling layers and in the radiative precursors of partially-cooled
fast shocks as a function of the shock age. The results are applicable to the
shock-heated warm/hot intergalactic medium (WHIM) which is expected to be a
major baryonic reservoir, and contain a large fraction of the so-called
"missing baryons". My computations indicate that readily observable amounts of
intermediate and high ions, such as CIV, NV, and OVI are created in the
precursors of young shocks, for which the shocked gas remains hot and difficult
to observe. I suggest that such precursors may provide a way to identify and
estimate the "missing" baryonic mass associated with the shocks. The
absorption-line signatures predicted here may be used to construct ion-ratio
diagrams, which will serve as diagnostics for the photoionized gas in the
precursors. In my numerical models, the time-evolution of the shock structure,
self-radiation, and associated metal-ion column densities are computed by a
series of quasi-static models, each appropriate for a different shock age. The
shock code used in this work calculates the nonequilibrium ionization and
cooling, follows the radiative transfer of the shock self-radiation through the
post-shock cooling layers, takes into account the resulting photoionization and
heating rates, follows the dynamics of the cooling gas, and self-consistently
computes the photoionization states in the precursor gas. I present a complete
set of the age-dependent post-shock and precursor columns for all ionization
states of the elements H, He, C, N, O, Ne, Mg, Si, S, and Fe, as functions of
the shock velocity, gas metallicity, and magnetic field. I present my numerical
results in convenient online tables.
