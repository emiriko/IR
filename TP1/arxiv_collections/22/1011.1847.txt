Observations of SNRs in X-ray and gamma-ray bands promise to contribute with
important information in our understanding on the nature of galactic cosmic
rays. The analysis of SNRs images collected in different energy bands requires
the support of theoretical modeling of synchrotron and inverse Compton (IC)
emission. We develop a numerical code (REMLIGHT) to synthesize, from MHD
simulations, the synchrotron radio, X-ray and IC gamma-ray emission from SNRs
expanding in non-uniform interstellar medium (ISM) and/or non-uniform
interstellar magnetic field (ISMF). As a first application, the code is used to
investigate the effects of non-uniform ISMF on the SNR morphology in the
non-thermal X-ray and gamma-ray bands. We perform 3D MHD simulations of a
spherical SNR shock expanding through a magnetized ISM with a gradient of
ambient magnetic field strength. The model includes an approximate treatment of
upstream magnetic field amplification and the effect of shock modification due
to back reaction of accelerated cosmic rays. From the simulations, we
synthesize the synchrotron radio, X-ray and IC gamma-ray emission with
REMLIGHT, making different assumptions about the details of acceleration and
injection of relativistic electrons. A gradient of the ambient magnetic field
strength induces asymmetric morphologies in radio, X-ray and gamma-ray bands
independently from the model of electron injection if the gradient has a
component perpendicular to the line-of-sight. The degree of asymmetry of the
remnant morphology depends on the details of the electron injection and
acceleration and is different in the radio, X-ray, and gamma-ray bands. The
non-thermal X-ray morphology is the most sensitive to the gradient, showing the
highest degree of asymmetry. The IC gamma-ray emission is weakly sensitive to
the non-uniform ISMF, the degree of asymmetry of the SNR morphology being the
lowest in this band.
