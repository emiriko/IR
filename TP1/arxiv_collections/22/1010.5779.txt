Three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamic simulations of shell oxygen burning
(Meakin and Arnett 2007) exhibit bursty, recurrent fluctuations in turbulent
kinetic energy. These are shown to be due to a global instability in the
convective region, which has been suppressed in calculations of stellar
evolution which use mixing-length theory (MLT). Quantitatively similar behavior
occurs in the model of a convective roll (cell) of Lorenz (1963), which is
known to have a strange attractor that gives rise to random fluctuations in
time.An extension of the Lorenz model, which includes Kolmogorov damping and
nuclear burning, is shown to exhibit bursty, recurrent fluctuations like those
seen in the 3D simulations. A simple model of a convective layer (composed of
multiple Lorenz cells) gives luminosity fluctuations which are suggestive of
irregular variables (red giants and supergiants, Schwarzschild 1975).
  Apparent inconsistencies between Arnett, Meakin, and Young (2009) and
Nordlund, Stein, and Asplund (2009) on the nature of convective driving have
been resolved, and are discussed.
