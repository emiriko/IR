We consider diffusion limited aggregation of particles of two different
kinds. It is assumed that a particle of one kind may adhere only to another
particle of the same kind. The particles aggregate on a linear substrate which
consists of periodically or randomly placed particles of different kinds. We
analyze the influence of initial patterns on the structure of growing clusters.
It is shown that at small distances from the substrate, the cluster structures
repeat initial patterns. However, starting from a critical distance the initial
periodicity is abruptly lost, and the particle distribution tends to a random
one. An approach describing the evolution of the number of branches is
proposed. Our calculations show that the initial patter can be detected only at
the distance which is not larger than approximately one and a half of the
characteristic pattern size.
