It is well-known that when searching one out of four, the original Grover's
search algorithm is exact; that is, it succeeds with certainty. It is natural
to ask the inverse question: If we are not searching one out of four, is
Grover's algorithm definitely not exact? In this article we give a complete
answer to this question through some rationality results of trigonometric
functions.
