In this paper, we present the geodesic-like algorithm for the computation of
the shortest path between two objects on NURBS surfaces and periodic surfaces.
This method can improve the distance problem not only on surfaces but in
$\mathbb{R}^3$. Moreover, the geodesic-like algorithm also provides an
efficient approach to simulate the minimal geodesic between two holes on a
NURBS surfaces.
