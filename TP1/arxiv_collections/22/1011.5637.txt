When materials such as foams or emulsions are compressed, they display solid
behaviour above the so-called `jamming' transition. Because compression is done
out-of-equilibrium in the absence of thermal fluctuations, jamming appears as a
new kind of a nonequilibrium phase transition. In this proceeding paper, we
suggest that tools from equilibrium statistical mechanics can in fact be used
to describe many specific features of the jamming transition. Our strategy is
to introduce thermal fluctuations and use statistical mechanics to describe the
complex phase behaviour of systems of soft repulsive particles, before sending
temperature to zero at the end of the calculation. We show that currently
available implementations of standard tools such as integral equations,
mode-coupling theory, or replica calculations all break down at low temperature
and large density, but we suggest that new analytical schemes can be developed
to provide a fully microscopic, quantitative description of the jamming
transition.
