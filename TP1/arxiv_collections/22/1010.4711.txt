We discuss the end-point behavior of the pion distribution amplitude (DA) and
calculate its slope using QCD sum rules with nonlocal condensates. This is done
in terms of the standard derivative and also with the help of an "integral
derivative", recently obtained by us. Our approach favors a value of the slope
of the order (or less) of the asymptotic DA and is in clear disagreement with
flat-type pion DAs.
