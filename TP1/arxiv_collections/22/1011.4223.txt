We develop and calibrate a characteristic waveform extraction tool whose
major improvements and corrections of prior versions allow satisfaction of the
accuracy standards required for advanced LIGO data analysis. The extraction
tool uses a characteristic evolution code to propagate numerical data on an
inner worldtube supplied by a 3+1 Cauchy evolution to obtain the gravitational
waveform at null infinity. With the new extraction tool, high accuracy and
convergence of the numerical error can be demonstrated for an inspiral and
merger of mass M binary black holes even for an extraction worldtube radius as
small as R = 20M. The tool provides a means for unambiguous comparison between
waveforms generated by evolution codes based upon different formulations of the
Einstein equations and based upon different numerical approximations.
