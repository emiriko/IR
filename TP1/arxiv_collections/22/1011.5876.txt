SCUBA-2 is the largest submillimetre array camera in the world and was
commissioned on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) with two arrays
towards the end of 2009. A period of shared-risks observing was then completed
and the full planned complement of 8 arrays, 4 at 850 microns and 4 at 450
microns, are now installed and ready to be commissioned. SCUBA-2 has 10,240
bolometers, corresponding to a data rate of 8 MB/s when sampled at the nominal
rate of 200 Hz. The pipeline produces useful maps in near real time at the
telescope and often publication quality maps in the JCMT Science Archive (JSA)
hosted at the Canadian Astronomy Data Centre (CADC).
