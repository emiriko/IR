The purpose of this paper is to combine classical methods from transcendental
number theory with the technique of restriction to real scalars. We develop a
conceptual approach relating transcendence properties of algebraic groups to
results about the existence of homomorphisms to group varieties over real
fields. Our approach gives a new perspective on Mazur's conjecture on the
topology of rational points. We shall reformulate and generalize Mazur's
problem in the light of transcendence theory and shall derive conclusions in
the direction of the conjecture. Next to these new theoretical insights, the
aim of our application motivated Ansatz was to improve classical results of
transcendence, of algebraic independence in small transcendence degree and of
linear independence of algebraic logarithms. Thirty new corollaries, most of
which are generalizations of popular theorems, are stated in the seventh
chapter. For example we shall prove:
  Let a_1,a_2, a_3 be three linearly independent complex numbers, let \wp(z) be
a Weierstrass function with algebraic invariants and let b be a non-zero
complex numbers. If the four numbers satisfy certain hypotheses, then one among
the six numbers \wp(a_j), e^{ba_j} is transcendental.
  This version of our paper is very elaborated and essentially self-contained.
It should be admissible for master students specializing in transcendental
number theory and arithmetic geometry.
