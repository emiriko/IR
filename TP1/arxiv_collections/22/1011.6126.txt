Ultraviolet, optical, and near-infrared photometry and optical spectroscopy
of the broad-lined Type Ic supernova (SN) 2009bb are presented, following the
flux evolution from -10 to +285 days past B-band maximum. Thanks to the very
early discovery, it is possible to place tight constraints on the SN explosion
epoch. The expansion velocities measured from near maximum spectra are found to
be only slightly smaller than those measured from spectra of the prototype
broad-lined SN 1998bw associated with GRB 980425. Fitting an analytical model
to the pseudo-bolometric light curve of SN 2009bb suggests that 4.1+-1.9 Msun
of material was ejected with 0.22 +-0.06 Msun of it being 56Ni. The resulting
kinetic energy is 1.8+-0.7x10^52 erg. This, together with an absolute peak
magnitude of MB=-18.36+-0.44, places SN 2009bb on the energetic and luminous
end of the broad-lined Type Ic (SN Ic) sequence. Detection of helium in the
early time optical spectra accompanied with strong radio emission, and high
metallicity of its environment makes SN 2009bb a peculiar object. Similar to
the case for GRBs, we find that the bulk explosion parameters of SN 2009bb
cannot account for the copious energy coupled to relativistic ejecta, and
conclude that another energy reservoir (a central engine) is required to power
the radio emission. Nevertheless, the analysis of the SN 2009bb nebular
spectrum suggests that the failed GRB detection is not imputable to a large
angle between the line-of-sight and the GRB beamed radiation. Therefore, if a
GRB was produced during the SN 2009bb explosion, it was below the threshold of
the current generation of gamma-ray instruments.
