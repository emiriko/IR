The exact dynamical equation for Efimov trimers in the short range limit of
dimer resonances is derived via Yamaguchi separable potentials. This equation
which overcomes the non-uniqueness problem of zero-range potentials, closely
resembles one derived recently by Gogolin et al, with no further assumptions,
and hence enjoys all the benefits of the latter results.
