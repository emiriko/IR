In these proceedings, I report on the status of a simple singlet scalar dark
matter model in the light of recent results from both direct detection
experiments, in particular DAMA, CoGeNT, CDMS-II and Xenon10/100, and indirect
searches, in particular Fermi-LAT. Specifically, I confront the light scalar
WIMP candidates, M_DM ~ few GeV, that are consistent with CoGeNT and/or DAMA,
to constraints that may be set using the recent Fermi-LAT data on Milky Way
dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) and the isotropic diffuse gamma-ray emission.
I show that the latter observations set relevant exclusion limits on the
lightest WIMP candidates.
