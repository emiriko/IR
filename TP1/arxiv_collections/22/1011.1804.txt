We describe explicitly Lie superalgebra isomorphisms between the Lie
superalgebras of first-order superdifferential operators on supermanifolds,
showing in particular that any such isomorphism induces a diffeomorphism of the
supermanifolds. We also prove that the group of automorphisms of such a Lie
superalgebra is a semi-direct product of the subgroup induced by the
supermanifold diffeomorphisms and another subgroup which consists of
automorphisms determined by even superdivergences. These superdivergences are
proven to exist on any supermanifold and their local form is explicitly
described as well
