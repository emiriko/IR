We perform a comprehensive analysis of the spectrum of proper oscillations
(quasinormal modes), transmission/reflection coefficients and Hawking radiation
for a massive charged scalar field in the background of the Kerr-Newman black
hole immersed in an asymptotically homogeneous magnetic field. There are two
main effects: the Zeeman shift of the particle energy in the magnetic field and
the difference of values of an electromagnetic potential between the horizon
and infinity, i.e. the Faraday induction. We have shown that "turning on" the
magnetic field induces a stronger energy-emission rate and leads to
"recharging" of the black hole. Thus, a black hole immersed in a magnetic field
evaporates much quicker, achieving thereby an extremal state in a shorter
period of time. Quasinormal modes are moderately affected by the presence of a
magnetic field which is assumed to be relatively small compared to the
gravitational field of the black hole.
