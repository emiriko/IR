We analyze certain conservative interacting particle system and establish
ergodicity of the system for a family of invariant measures. Furthermore, we
show that convergence rate to equilibrium is exponential. This result is of
interest because it presents counterexample to the standard assumption of
physicists that conservative system implies polynomial rate of convergence.
