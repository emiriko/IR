We re-examine the question of measuring the weak phase gamma in B -> K pi pi
decays. To this end, we express all B -> K pi pi amplitudes in terms of
diagrams. We show that, as in B -> K pi, there exist relations between certain
tree and electroweak-penguin diagrams. The imposition of these relations allows
the extraction of gamma from measurements of the B -> K pi pi observables. We
estimate the theoretical error in this method to be O(5%).
