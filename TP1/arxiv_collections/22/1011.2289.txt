A three-terminal device based on a two-dimensional electron system is
investigated in the regime of non-equilibrium transport. Excited electrons
scatter with the cold Fermi sea and transfer energy and momentum to other
electrons. A geometry analogous to a water jet pump is used to create a jet
pump for electrons. Because of its phenomenological similarity we name the
observed behavior "electronic Venturi effect".
