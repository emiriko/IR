We introduce in this paper an elliptic dynamical reflection algebra
describing an SOS model with reflecting end. Using factorizing Drinfel'd twist,
we compute the partition function of this model with domain wall boundary
conditions. We show that it can be represented in the form of a single Izergin
determinant.
