This paper undertakes a re-examination of Sir William Hamilton's doctrine of
the quantification of the predicate. Hamilton's doctrine comprises two theses.
First, the predicates of traditional syllogistic sentence-forms contain
implicit existential quantifiers, so that, for example, "All p are q" is to be
understood as "All p are some q". Second, these implicit quantifiers can be
meaningfully dualized to yield novel sentence-forms, such as, for example, "All
p are all q". Hamilton attempted to provide a deductive system for his
language, along the lines of the classical syllogisms. We show, using
techniques unavailable to Hamilton, that such a system does exist, though with
qualifications that distinguish it from its classical counterpart.
