We calculate the trident pair production amplitude in a strong laser
background. We allow for finite pulse duration, while still treating the laser
fields nonperturbatively in strong-field QED. Our approach reveals explicitly
the individual contributions of the one-step and two-step processes. We also
expose the role gauge invariance plays in the amplitudes and discuss the
relation between our results and the optical theorem.
