Descriptions of molecular systems usually refer to two distinct theoretical
frameworks. On the one hand the quantum pure state, i.e. the wavefunction, of
an isolated system which is determined to calculate molecular properties and to
consider the time evolution according to the unitary Schr\"odinger equation. On
the other hand a mixed state, i.e. a statistical density matrix, is the
standard formalism to account for thermal equilibrium, as postulated in the
microcanonical quantum statistics. In the present paper an alternative
treatment relying on a statistical analysis of the possible wavefunctions of an
isolated system is presented. In analogy with the classical ergodic theory, the
time evolution of the wavefunction determines the probability distribution in
the phase space pertaining to an isolated system. However, this alone cannot
account for a well defined thermodynamical description of the system in the
macroscopic limit, unless a suitable probability distribution for the quantum
constants of motion is introduced. We present a workable formalism assuring the
emergence of typical values of thermodynamic functions, such as the internal
energy and the entropy, in the large size limit of the system. This allows the
identification of macroscopic properties independently of the specific
realization of the quantum state. A description of material systems in
agreement with equilibrium thermodynamics is then derived without constraints
on the physical constituents and interactions of the system. Furthermore, the
canonical statistics is recovered in all generality for the reduced density
matrix of a subsystem.
