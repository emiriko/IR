We present multi-epoch medium-resolution observations of two M4.5 candidate
members in the halo of the ~8 Myr Eta Chamaeleontis open cluster. Over six
months of observations both stars exhibited variations in their H-alpha line
profiles on timescales of days to months, with at least one episode of
substantial activity attributable to accretion from a circumstellar disk. We
derive an accretion rate ~10^-8.7 Msun/yr for this event, with a rate of
~10^-10.6 Msun/yr in quiescence. Episodic accretion like that observed here
means existing surveys of accreting Weak-lined T-Tauri Stars in young clusters
are likely incomplete and that gas dissipation timescales calculated from the
fraction of accreting objects are underestimates.
