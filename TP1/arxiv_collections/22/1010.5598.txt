Electronic excitation energy transfer along a molecular wire depends on the
relative orientation of the electronic transition dipole moments of neighboring
chromophores. In porphycenes this orientation is changed upon double proton
transfer in the electronic ground state. We explore the possibility to trigger
such a double proton transfer reaction by means of an infrared pump-dump laser
control scheme. To this end a quantum chemical characterization of an
asymmetrically substituted porphycene is performed using density functional
theory. Ground state geometries, the topology of the potential energy surface
for double proton transfer, and S0->S1 transition energies are compared with
the parent compound porphycene and a symmetric derivative. Employing a simple
two-dimensional model for the double proton transfer, which incorporates
sequential and concerted motions, quantum dynamics simulations of the laser
driven dynamics are performed which demonstrate tautomerization control. Based
on the orientation of the transition dipole moments this tautomerization may
lead to an estimated change in the F\"orster transfer coupling of about 60%
