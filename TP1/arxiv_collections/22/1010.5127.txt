We consider the generation of acoustic waves by turbulent convection and
perform spectral analysis of a monopole source of sound related to the heat
production by condensation of moisture. A quantitative explanation of the
correlation between intensity of infrasound generated by supercell storms and
later tornado formation is given. It is shown that low lifting condensation
level (LCL) and high values of convective available potential energy (CAPE),
which are known to favor significant tornadoes, also lead to a strong
enhancement of supercell's low frequency acoustic radiation.
