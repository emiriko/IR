We adapt the method used by Jaynes to derive the equilibria of statistical
physics to instead derive equilibria of bounded rational game theory. We
analyze the dependence of these equilibria on the parameters of the underlying
game, focusing on hysteresis effects. In particular, we show that by gradually
imposing individual-specific tax rates on the players of the game, and then
gradually removing those taxes, the players move from a poor equilibrium to one
that is better for all of them.
