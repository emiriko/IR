Recently, the idea of classical Metropolis sampling through Markov chains has
been generalized for quantum Hamiltonians. However, the underlying Markov chain
of this algorithm is still classical in nature. Due to Szegedy's method, the
Markov chains of classical Hamiltonians can achieve a quadratic quantum speedup
in the eigenvalue gap of the corresponding transition matrix. A natural
question to ask is whether Szegedy's quantum speedup is merely a consequence of
employing classical Hamiltonians, where the eigenstates simply coincide with
the computational basis, making cloning of the classical information possible.
We solve this problem by introducing a quantum version of the method of
Markov-chain quantization combined with the quantum simulated annealing (QSA)
procedure, and describe explicitly a novel quantum Metropolis algorithm, which
exhibits a quadratic quantum speedup in the eigenvalue gap of the corresponding
Metropolis Markov chain for any quantum Hamiltonian. This result provides a
complete generalization of the classical Metropolis method to the quantum
domain.
