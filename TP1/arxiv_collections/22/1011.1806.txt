We define vector fields, leaves and trajectories for schemes. With these
tools, we are able to give a geometrical interpretation and to generalize
several results of differential Galois theory and constructions on differential
schemes. We prove a theorem of extension of constant sections. Finally, as an
application, we compare three classical sheaves defined over the differential
spectrum.
