We present a massive spectroscopic survey of Galactic O stars, GOSSS, based
on new, high signal-to-noise ratio, R~2500 blue-violet digital observations
from both hemispheres. The sample size and selection criteria; the relationship
between GOSSS, the Galactic O-Star Catalog (GOSC), and three sister surveys
(OWN, IACOB, and Lucky Imaging); the current status; and our plans for the
future are discussed. We also show some of our first results, which include the
new Ofc category, two new examples of Of?p stars, a new atlas for O stars, and
the introduction of the O9.7 type for luminosity classes III to V. Finally, our
scientific objectives are discussed.
