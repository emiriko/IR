The SciBooNE Collaboration reports a measurement of inclusive charged current
interactions of muon neutrinos on carbon with an average energy of 0.8 GeV
using the Fermilab Booster Neutrino Beam. We compare our measurement with two
neutrino interaction simulations: NEUT and NUANCE. The charged current
interaction rates (product of flux and cross section) are extracted by fitting
the muon kinematics, with a precision of 6-15% for the energy dependent and 3%
for the energy integrated analyses. We also extract CC inclusive interaction
cross sections from the observed rates, with a precision of 10-30% for the
energy dependent and 8% for the energy integrated analyses. This is the first
measurement of the CC inclusive cross section on carbon around 1 GeV. These
results can be used to convert previous SciBooNE cross section ratio
measurements to absolute cross section values.
