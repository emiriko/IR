Dwarf elliptical galaxies (dEs) are the most common galaxy type in nearby
galaxy clusters; even so, many of their basic properties have yet to be
quantified. Here we present the results of our study of 4 Virgo dwarf
ellipticals obtained with the SAURON integral field unit on the William
Herschel Telescope (La Palma, Spain). While traditional long-slit observations
are likely to miss more complicated kinematic features, with SAURON we are able
to study both kinematics and stellar populations in two dimensions, obtaining a
much more detailed view of the mass distribution and star formation histories.
What is visible even in such a small sample is that dEs are not a uniform
group, not only morphologically, but also as far as their kinematic and stellar
population properties are concerned. We find the presence of substructures,
varying degrees of flattening and of rotation, as well as differences in age
and metallicity gradients. We confirm that two of our galaxies are
significantly flattened, yet non-rotating objects, which makes them likely
triaxial systems. The comparison between the dwarf and the giant groups shows
that dEs could be a low-mass extension of Es in the sense that they do seem to
follow the same trends with mass. However, dEs as progenitors of Es seem less
likely as we have seen that dEs have much lower abundance ratios.
