Following Brown, in this paper we give an overview of how to modify standard
hyperbolic formulations of the 3+1 evolution equations of General Relativity in
such a way that all auxiliary quantities are true tensors, thus allowing for
these formulations to be used with curvilinear sets of coordinates such as
spherical or cylindrical coordinates. After considering the general case for
both the Nagy-Ortiz-Reula (NOR) and the Baumgarte-Shapiro-Shibata-Nakamura
(BSSN) formulations, we specialize to the case of spherical symmetry and also
discuss the issue of regularity at the origin. Finally, we show some numerical
examples of the modified BSSN formulation at work in spherical symmetry.
