High-precision calculations of electroweak processes in light nuclei are of
great importance for multiple reasons. Gerry Brown together with Dan-Olof Riska
published in 1972 a famous calculation on radiative capture of a thermal
neutron on a proton, and their work was a precursor of subsequent great
developments in high-precision calculations of electroweak processes in light
nuclei. The application of effective field theory to nuclear systems is a
prominent example of these developments. We present an overview of it with main
emphasis placed on those topics in which we ourselves have been involved.
