We consider supersymmetric grand unified theory (GUT) with the gaugino
mediated supersymmetry breaking and investigate a possibility to discriminate
different GUT models in terms of predicted sparticle mass spectra. Taking two
example GUT models, the minimal SU(5) and simple SO(10) models, and imposing a
variety of theoretical and experimental constraints, we calculate sparticle
masses. Fixing parameters of each model so as to result in the same mass of
neutralino as the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP), giving the observed
dark matter relic density, we find sizable mass differences in the left-handed
slepton and right-handed down-type squark sectors in two models, which can be a
probe to discriminate the GUT models realized at the GUT scale far beyond the
reach of collider experiments.
