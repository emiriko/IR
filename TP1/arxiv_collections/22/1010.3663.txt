During summer of 1998 two large-scale complex campaigns, LITFASS98 (May 25th
to June 22nd) and LACE98 (July 13th to August 14th), took place at the
Meteorological Observatory Lindenberg (MOL). The aim of both experiments focus
on the intensive daily observations of atmospheric conditions and the
determination of their fundamental meteorological parameters in the vertical
column over Lindenberg (Lindenberg's Column). About 20 German research
institutions and addition one from the Netherlands, Austria and Russia
participated at the experiments. A wide variety of ground-based instruments was
operated in Lindenberg and Falkenberg, including LIDARs, microwave radiometer
and radiosondes complemented by tethered balloons and aircraft measurements.
For the first time the star- and sunphotometer of MOL were used together with
other geophysical tools. The observations with both photometers were carried
out practically every day and night except during absolutely overcast
conditions. The observed data were processed immediately by a series of
programs developed at Pulkovo Observatory (Russia), and the results (daily
variations of aerosol optical depths and water vapour column content) were
presented at daily briefings. The comparison of these results with radiosonde
and microwave radiometer data demonstrated the usefulness of photometer data
for the calibration of other ground-based observations and satellite
measurements.
