We present first results on the axial and pseudoscalar $\Delta$ form factors.
The analysis is carried out in the quenched approximation where statistical
errors are small and the lattice set-up can be investigated relatively quickly.
We also present an analysis with a hybrid action using staggered sea quarks and
domain-wall valence fermions.
