We report results of NMR experiments on the ruthenium oxide Hg2Ru2O7 with the
pyrochlore structure, which exhibits a metal-insulator transition at TMI = 107
K. In the metallic phase above TMI, the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate
1/T1 and the Knight shift at the Hg sites follow the Korringa relation,
indicating the absence of substantial spatial spin correlation. At low
temperatures in the insulating phase, 99,101Ru-NMR signals are observed at zero
magnetic field, providing evidence for a commensurate antiferromagnetic order.
The estimated ordered moment is about 1 muB per Ru, much smaller than 3 muB
expected for the ionic (4d)3plus configuration of Ru5plus. Thus the localized
spin models are not appropriate for the insulating phase of Hg2Ru2O7. We also
discuss possible antiferromagnetic spin structures.
