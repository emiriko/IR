We report a search for muon neutrino disappearance in the $\Delta m^{2}$
region of 0.5-40 $eV^2$ using data from both SciBooNE and MiniBooNE
experiments. SciBooNE data provides a constraint on the neutrino flux, so that
the sensitivity to $\nu_{\mu}$ disappearance with both detectors is better than
with just MiniBooNE alone. The preliminary sensitivity for a joint $\nu_\mu$
disappearance search is presented.
