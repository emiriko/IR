We report on a measurement of the characteristic temperature of an ultracold
rubidium ion source, in which a cloud of laser-cooled atoms is converted to
ions by photo-ionization. Extracted ion pulses are focused on a detector with a
pulsed-field technique. The resulting experimental spot sizes are compared to
particle-tracking simulations, from which a source temperature $T = (1 \pm 2)$
mK and the corresponding transversal reduced emittance $\epsilon_r = 7.9 X
10^{-9}$ m rad $\sqrt{\rm{eV}}$ are determined. We find that this result is
likely limited by space charge forces even though the average number of ions
per bunch is 0.022.
