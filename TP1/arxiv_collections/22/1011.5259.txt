A novel approach to optics integration in ion traps is demonstrated based on
a surface electrode ion trap that is microfabricated on top of a dielectric
mirror. Additional optical losses due to fabrication are found to be as low as
80 ppm for light at 422 nm. The integrated mirror is used to demonstrate light
collection from, and imaging of, a single 88 Sr+ ion trapped $169\pm4 \mu$m
above the mirror.
