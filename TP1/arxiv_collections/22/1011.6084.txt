Gamow's explanation of the exponential decay law uses complex "eigenvalues"
and exponentially growing "eigenfunctions". This raises the question, how
Gamow's description fits into the quantum mechanical description of nature,
which is based on real eigenvalues and square integrable wave functions.
Observing that the time evolution of any wave function is given by its
expansion in generalized eigenfunctions, we shall answer this question in the
most straightforward manner, which at the same time is accessible to graduate
students and specialists. Moreover the presentation can well be used in physics
lectures to students.
