We prove a structure theorem for non-isomorphic endomorphisms of weak Q-Fano
threefolds, or more generally for threefolds with big anti-canonical divisor.
Also provided is a criterion for a fibred rationally connected threefold to be
rational. As a consequence, we show (without using the classification) that
every smooth Fano threefold having a non-isomorphic surjective endomorphism is
rational.
