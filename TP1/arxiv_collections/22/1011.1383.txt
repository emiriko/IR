The impact of the KK-modes in d-brane models of gravity with large
compactification radii and TeV-scale quantum gravity on the hadronic potential
at small impact parameters is examined. The effects of the gravitational
hadronic form factors obtained from the generalized parton distributions (GPDs)
on the behavior of the gravitational potential and the possible spin
correlation effects are also analysed.
