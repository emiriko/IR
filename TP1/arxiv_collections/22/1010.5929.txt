Outlined here is a technique for sub-wavelength infrared surface imaging
performed using a phase matched optical parametric oscillator laser and an
atomic force microscope as the detection mechanism. The technique uses a novel
surface excitation illumination approach to perform simultaneously chemical
mapping and AFM topography imaging with an image resolution of 200 nm. This
method was demonstrated by imaging polystyrene micro-structures.
