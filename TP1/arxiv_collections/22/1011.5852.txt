We study the convergence of a functional renormalisation group technique by
looking at the ratio between the fermion-fermion scattering length and the
dimer-dimer scattering length for a system of nonrelativistic fermions. We find
that in a systematic expansion in powers of the fields there is a rapid
convergence of the result that agrees with know exact results.
