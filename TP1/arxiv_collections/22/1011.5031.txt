We present an experimental approach to discriminate hyper-elastic models
describing the mechanical behavior of rubber-like materials. An evaluation of
the displacement field obtained by digital image correlation allows us to
evaluate the heterogeneous strain field observed during these tests. We focus
on the particular case of hyper-elastic models to simulate the behavior of some
rubber-like materials. Assuming incompressibility of the material, the
hyper-elastic potential is determined from tension and compression tests. A
biaxial loading condition is obtained in a multiaxial testing machine and model
predictions are compared with experimental results.
