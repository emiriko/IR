We study the half-form Kaehler quantization of a smooth symplectic toric
manifold $(X,\omega)$, such that $[\omega/2\pi]-c_{1}(X)/2 \in
H^{2}(X,{\mathbb{Z}})$ and is nonnegative. We define the half-form corrected
quantization of $(X,\omega)$ to be given by holomorphic sections of a certain
hermitian line bundle $L\rightarrow X$ with Chern class $[\omega/
2\pi]-c_{1}(X)/2$. These sections then correspond to integral points of a
"corrected" polytope $P_{L}$ with integral vertices. For a suitably translated
moment polytope $P_{X}$ for $(X,\omega)$, we have that $P_{L}\subset P_{X}$ is
obtained from $P_{X}$ by a one-half inward-pointing normal shift along the
boundary.
  We use our results on the Kaehler quantization to motivate a definition of
half-form corrected quantization in the singular real toric polarization. Using
families of complex structures studied in
[Baier-Florentino-Mourao-Nunes:arXiv/0806.0606], which include the degeneration
of Kaehler polarizations to the vertical polarization, we show that, under this
degeneration, the half-form corrected $L^{2}$-normalized monomial holomorphic
sections converge to Dirac-delta-distributional sections supported on the
fibers over the integral points of $P_{L}$, which correspond to corrected
Bohr-Sommerfeld fibers. This result and the limit of the corrected connection,
with curvature singularities along the boundary of $P_X$, justifies the direct
definition we give for the corrected quantization in the singular real toric
polarization. We show that the space of quantum states for this definition
coincides with the space obtained via degeneration of the K\"ahler
quantization.
  We also show that the BKS pairing between Kaehler polarizations is not
unitary in general. On the other hand, the unitary connection induced by this
pairing is flat.
