Solar light gets scattered at cloud top level in Venus' atmosphere, in the
visible range, which corresponds to the altitude of 67 km. We present Doppler
velocity measurements performed with the high resolution spectrometer MTR of
the Solar telescope THEMIS (Teide Observatory, Canary Island) on the sodium D2
solar line (5890 \AA). Observations lasted only 49 min because of cloudy
weather. However, we could assess the instrumental velocity sensitivity, 31 m/s
per pixel of 1 arcsec, and give a value of the amplitude of zonal wind at
equator at 151 +/- 16 m/s.
