With the increasing growth of technology and the entrance into the digital
age, we have to handle a vast amount of information every time which often
presents difficulties. So, the digital information must be stored and retrieved
in an efficient and effective manner, in order for it to be put to practical
use. Wavelets provide a mathematical way of encoding information in such a way
that it is layered according to level of detail. This layering facilitates
approximations at various intermediate stages. These approximations can be
stored using a lot less space than the original data. Here a low complex 2D
image compression method using wavelets as the basis functions and the approach
to measure the quality of the compressed image are presented. The particular
wavelet chosen and used here is the simplest wavelet form namely the Haar
Wavelet. The 2D discret wavelet transform (DWT) has been applied and the detail
matrices from the information matrix of the image have been estimated. The
reconstructed image is synthesized using the estimated detail matrices and
information matrix provided by the Wavelet transform. The quality of the
compressed images has been evaluated using some factors like Compression Ratio
(CR), Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR), Mean Opinion Score (MOS), Picture
Quality Scale (PQS) etc.
