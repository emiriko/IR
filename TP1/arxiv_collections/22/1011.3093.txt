By a similar idea for the construction of Milnor's gamma functions, we
introduce "higher depth determinants" of the Laplacian on a compact Riemann
surface of genus greater than one. We prove that, as a generalization of the
determinant expression of the Selberg zeta function, this higher depth
determinant can be expressed as a product of multiple gamma functions and what
we call a Milnor-Selberg zeta function. It is shown that the Milnor-Selberg
zeta function admits an analytic continuation, a functional equation and,
remarkably, has an Euler product.
