Background: Direct measurement of the electric dipole moment (EDM) of the
neutron lies in the future; measurement of a nuclear EDM may well come first.
The deuteron is one nucleus for which exact model calculations are feasible.
Purpose: We explore the model dependence of deuteron EDM calculations. Methods:
Using a separable potential formulation of the Hamiltonian, we examine the
sensitivity of the deuteron EDM to variation in the nucleon-nucleon
interaction. We write the EDM as the sum of two terms, the first depending on
the target wave function with plane-wave intermediate states, and the second
depending on intermediate multiple scattering in the 3P1 channel, the latter
being sensitive to the off-shell behavior of the 3P1 amplitude. Results: We
compare the full calculation with the plane-wave approximation result, examine
the tensor force contribution to the model results, and explore the effect of
short range repulsion found in realistic, contemporary potential models of the
deuteron. Conclusions: Because one-pion exchange dominates the EDM calculation,
separable potential model calculations will provide an adequate description of
the 2H EDM until such time as a better than 10% measurement is obtained.
