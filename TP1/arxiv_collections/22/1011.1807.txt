We calculate the asymmetries in parity nonconserving deuteron
photodisintegration due to circularly polarized photons gamma+d to n+p with the
photon laboratory energy ranging from the threshold up to 10 MeV and the
radiative capture of thermal polarized neutrons by protons n+p to gamma+d. We
use the leading order electromagnetic Hamiltonian neglecting the smaller
nuclear exchange currents. Comparative calculations are done by using the
Reid93 and Argonne v18 potentials for the strong interaction and the DDH and
FCDH "best" values for the weak couplings in a weak one-meson exchange
potential. A weak NDelta transition potential is used to incorporate also the
Delta(1232)-isobar excitation in the coupled-channels formalism.
