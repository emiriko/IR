We analyze scattering of the transverse optic modes by spherically symmetric
Polarized Nano Regions (PNR) in the paraelectric phase of relaxor
ferroelectrics. Calculations have done in the frame of mean-field model early
supposed by E.Iolin & J.Toulouse but depolarization field effects, DF, were
taken into account. Elementary excitations of the system are found to be of two
types - Vortex (V) and Quasi Polar (QP). DF decreases temperature of the local
QP phase transition. The local phase transition temperature is found to be
lower (higher) for Vortex than for QP excitations for the case of small (large)
size PNR. Therefore both QP and Vortex condensations are possible.
Depolarization field hasn't effect on the Vortex scattering. For the case of QP
scattering DF effect is essential especially in the case when total angular
momentum j=1. Vortex and QP (at j \geq 2) cross section of scattering {\Sigma}
are nullified at the small value of momentum q of the incident wave. However QP
cross section {\Sigma}(j=1) is saturated at q~0.01-0.001, and nullified only at
the ultra small value of q corresponding macroscopic value of the soft mode
wavelength. This scattering leads to the suppression of the TO spreading wave
regime and allows qualitative understand some features of so-called waterfall
phenomena observed early by the Brookhaven group in the neutron inelastic
scattering in relaxors.
