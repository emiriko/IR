We study the superfluid character of a dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate
(DBEC) in a quasi-two dimensional (q2D) geometry. In particular, we allow for
the dipole polarization to have some non-zero projection into the plane of the
condensate so that the effective interaction is anisotropic in this plane,
yielding an anisotropic dispersion for propagation of quasiparticles. By
performing direct numerical simulations of a probe moving through the DBEC, we
observe the sudden onset of drag or creation of vortex-antivortex pairs at
critical velocities that depend strongly on the direction of the probe's
motion. This anisotropy emerges because of the anisotropic manifestation of a
roton-like mode in the system.
