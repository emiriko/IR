It is argued that the discovery of cosmic acceleration could have been
anticipated on thermodynamic grounds, namely, the generalized second law and
the approach to equilibrium at large scale factor. Therefore, the existence of
dark energy -or equivalently, some modified gravity theory- should have been
expected. In general, cosmological models that satisfy the above criteria show
compatibility with observational data.
