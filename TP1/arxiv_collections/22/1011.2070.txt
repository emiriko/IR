Stellar light from an AGB star is scattered by the circumstellar dust and
polarized in the direction perpendicular to the source. Therefore, images of
circumstellar envelopes around AGB stars in polarized light traces the dust
distribution and can be used to search for asymmetries, and to achieve a better
understanding of the mechanisms at play when AGB stars are transformed into
planetary nebulae. The PolCor instrument is a combined imager, polarimeter, and
coronograph providing images with an angular resolution down to 0.2". We have
used it to map the dust distribution around three AGB stars: W Aql, and the
detached shell sources DR Ser, and U Cam. W Aql is a binary and we find
indications of a bi-polar dust distribution around the star. The observations
of the latter two sources clearly reveal the detached shells, likely the result
of a brief, strongly enhanced mass-loss rate during the late evolution of these
stars. Mapping the detached shells gives us clues to the symmetry of the mass
loss and important evolutionary processes.
