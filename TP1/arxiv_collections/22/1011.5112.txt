Recent results from RHIC and first measurements from the ALICE experiment at
the CERN-Large Hadron Collider (LHC) on open heavy-flavour are presented. We
focus on RHIC measurements of single electrons and jet-like heavy-flavour
particle correlations. First D meson signals from 7 TeV proton-proton
collisions in ALICE are discussed. Next-to-leading-order QCD processes, such as
gluon splitting, become important at LHC energies and its contribution can be
accesses by the measurement of the "charm content in jets".
