We investigate spectral properties of a fermion coupled with a massive gauge
boson with a mass m at finite temperature (T) in the perturbation theory. The
massive gauge boson is introduced as a U(1) gauge boson in the Stueckelberg
formalism with a gauge parameter \alpha. We find that the fermion spectral
function has a three-peak structure for T \sim m irrespective of the choice of
the gauge parameter, while it tends to have one faint peak at the origin and
two peaks corresponding to the normal fermion and anti-plasmino excitations
familiar in QED in the hard thermal loop approximation for T \gg m. We show
that our formalism successfully describe the fermion spectral function in the
whole T region with the correct high-T limit except for the faint peak at the
origin, although some care is needed for choice of the gauge parameter for T
\gg m. We clarify that for T \sim m, the fermion pole is almost independent of
the gauge parameter in the one-loop order, while for T \gg m, the one-loop
analysis is valid only for \alpha \ll 1/g where g is the fermion-boson coupling
constant, implying that the one-loop analysis can not be valid for large gauge
parameters as in the unitary gauge.
