For a binary system specified by the density operators r0 and r1 and by the
prior probabilities q0 and q1, Helstrom's theory permits the evaluation of the
optimal measurement operators and of the corresponding maximum correct
detection probability. The theory is based on the eigendecomposition (EID) of
the operator, given by the difference of the weighted density operators, namely
D = q1r1-q0r0. In general, this EID is obtained explicitly only with pure
states, whereas with mixed states it must be carried out numerically. In this
letter we show that the same evaluation can be performed on the basis of a
modified version of the Gram matrix. The advantage is due to the fact that the
outer products of density operators are replaced by inner product, with a
considerable dimensionality reduction. At the limit, in quantum optical
communications the density operators have infinite dimensions, whereas the
inner products are simply scalar quantities. The Gram matrix approach permits
the explicit (not numerical) evaluation of a binary system performance in cases
not previously developed.
