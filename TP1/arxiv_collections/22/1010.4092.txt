The number of bug reports in complex software increases dramatically. Now
bugs are triaged manually, bug triage or assignment is a labor-intensive and
time-consuming task. Without knowledge about the structure of the software,
testers often specify the component of a new bug wrongly. Meanwhile, it is
difficult for triagers to determine the component of the bug only by its
description. We dig out the components of 28,829 bugs in Eclipse bug project
have been specified wrongly and modified at least once. It results in these
bugs have to be reassigned and delays the process of bug fixing. The average
time of fixing wrongly-specified bugs is longer than that of
correctly-specified ones. In order to solve the problem automatically, we use
historical fixed bug reports as training corpus and build classifiers based on
support vector machines and Na\"ive Bayes to predict the component of a new
bug. The best prediction accuracy reaches up to 81.21% on our validation corpus
of Eclipse project. Averagely our predictive model can save about 54.3 days for
triagers and developers to repair a bug. Keywords: bug reports; bug triage;
