A new framework (ADHYDRO) is presented that has been designed for description
of highly-anisotropic systems produced at the very early stages of relativistic
heavy-ion collisions. The structure of ADHYDRO is very much similar to
perfect-fluid hydrodynamics, however, ADHYDRO includes dissipation effects.
Dissipation is defined by the form of the entropy source that depends on the
pressure anisotropy and vanishes for the isotropic systems. With a simple
ansatz for the entropy source, that obeys general physical requirements, we
obtain the system of equations describing isotropization of the anisotropic
systems.
