The contribution of a magnetized plasma to the neutrino magnetic moment is
calculated. It is shown that only part of the additional neutrino energy in
magnetized plasma connecting with its spin and magnetic field strength defines
the neutrino magnetic moment. It is found that the presence of magnetized
plasma does not lead to the considerable increase of the neutrino magnetic
moment in contrast to the results presented in literature previously.
