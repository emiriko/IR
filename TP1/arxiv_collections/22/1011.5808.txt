In cloud computing environments, a large number of users access data stored
in highly available storage systems. To provide good performance to
geographically disperse users and allow operation even in the presence of
failures or network partitions, these systems often rely on optimistic
replication solutions that guarantee only eventual consistency. In this
scenario, it is important to be able to accurately and efficiently identify
updates executed concurrently. In this paper, first we review, and expose
problems with current approaches to causality tracking in optimistic
replication: these either lose information about causality or do not scale, as
they require replicas to maintain information that grows linearly with the
number of clients or updates. Then, we propose a novel solution that fully
captures causality while being very concise in that it maintains information
that grows linearly only with the number of servers that register updates for a
given data element, bounded by the degree of replication.
