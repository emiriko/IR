A new framework of compressive sensing (CS), namely statistical compressive
sensing (SCS), that aims at efficiently sampling a collection of signals that
follow a statistical distribution and achieving accurate reconstruction on
average, is introduced. For signals following a Gaussian distribution, with
Gaussian or Bernoulli sensing matrices of O(k) measurements, considerably
smaller than the O(k log(N/k)) required by conventional CS, where N is the
signal dimension, and with an optimal decoder implemented with linear
filtering, significantly faster than the pursuit decoders applied in
conventional CS, the error of SCS is shown tightly upper bounded by a constant
times the k-best term approximation error, with overwhelming probability. The
failure probability is also significantly smaller than that of conventional CS.
Stronger yet simpler results further show that for any sensing matrix, the
error of Gaussian SCS is upper bounded by a constant times the k-best term
approximation with probability one, and the bound constant can be efficiently
calculated. For signals following Gaussian mixture models, SCS with a piecewise
linear decoder is introduced and shown to produce for real images better
results than conventional CS based on sparse models.
