We report on the anisotropic response, the charge and lattice dynamics of
normal and charge-ordered phases with horizontal stripes in single crystals of
the organic conductor alpha-(BEDT-TTF)2I3 determined by dc resistivity,
dielectric and optical spectroscopy. An overdamped Drude response and a small
conductivity anisotropy observed in optics is consistent with a weakly
temperature dependent dc conductivity and anisotropy at high temperatures. The
splitting of the molecular vibrations nu27(Bu) evidences the abrupt onset of
static charge order below TCO=136 K. The drop of optical conductivity measured
within the ab plane of the crystal is characterized by an isotropic gap that
opens of approximately 75 meV with several phonons becoming pronounced below.
Conversely, the dc conductivity anisotropy rises steeply, attaining at 50 K a
value 25 times larger than at high temperatures. The dielectric response within
this plane reveals two broad relaxation modes of strength Deltaepsilon_LD ~=
5000 and Deltaepsilon_SD ~= 400, centered at 1 kHz < f_LD < 100 MHz and f_SD ~=
1 MHz. The anisotropy of the large-mode (LD) mean relaxation time closely
follows the temperature behavior of the respective dc conductivity ratio. We
argue that this phason-like excitation is best described as a long-wavelength
excitation of a 2kF bond-charge density wave expected theoretically for layered
quarter-filled electronic systems with horizontal stripes. Conversely, based on
the theoretically expected ferroelectric-like nature of the charge-ordered
phase, we associate the small-mode (SD) relaxation with the motion of
domain-wall pairs, created at the interface between two types of domains, along
the a and b axes. We also consider other possible theoretical interpretations
and discuss their limitations.
