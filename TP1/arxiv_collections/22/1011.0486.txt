We compute the next-to-leading order QCD corrections to the polarized (and
unpolarized) cross sections for the production of a hadron accompanied by an
opposite-side prompt photon. This process, being studied at RHIC, permits us to
reconstruct partonic kinematics using experimentally measurable variables. We
study the correlation between the reconstructed momentum fractions and the true
partonic ones, which in the polarized case might allow us to reveal the
spin-dependent gluon distribution with a higher precision.
