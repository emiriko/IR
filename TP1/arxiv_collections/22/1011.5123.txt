We present the methodology and some preliminary results of our study of the
relationship between a Mira's pulsating photosphere and its surrounding
molecular layer(s) throughout several pulsation cycles, based on spatially
resolved data. Our dataset consists of archival narrow-band observations in the
near-infrared H and K bands obtained with the Palomar Testbed Interferometer
between 1999 and 2006, extended with a few nights of VLTI AMBER low spectral
resolution data and near-infrared SAAO photometry. The fitted model is the
geometric star + layer model proposed by Perrin et al. (2004), in which the
physical parameters (diameter and temperature of star and layer; wavelength
dependent optical depth of the layer) are given a sinusoidal time dependence.
