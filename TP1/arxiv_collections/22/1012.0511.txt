The Large Hadron Collider will be a unique place to find new physics in the
next decade. A huge production of b and c quarks will allow a rich programme of
Heavy Flavour Physics to be carried out either by the multipurpose experiments
ATLAS and CMS or by LHCb, the experiment designed for such physics. An overview
of the LHC machine and experiments' performances will be given with the first
2010 data. The start-up is very bright and some first LHC heavy flavour results
will be presented. The b physics program at LHC will be illustrated with three
examples: the searches for rare decays such as B_s -> mu mu, the CP
measurements from B_s -> J/psi phi and CP measurements of the Cabibbo Kobayashi
Maskawa (CKM) angle gamma. Some prospects for an upgrade of the LHCb detector
will also be given.
