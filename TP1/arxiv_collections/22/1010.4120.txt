Mixtures of hard hyperspheres in odd space dimensionalities are studied with
an analytical approximation method. This technique is based on the so-called
Rational Function Approximation and provides a procedure for evaluating
equations of state, structure factors, radial distribution functions, and
direct correlations functions of additive mixtures of hard hyperspheres with
any number of components and in arbitrary odd-dimension space. The method gives
the exact solution of the Ornstein--Zernike equation coupled with the
Percus--Yevick closure, thus extending to arbitrary odd dimension the solution
for hard-sphere mixtures [J. L. Lebowitz, Phys.\ Rev.\ \textbf{133}, 895
(1964)]. Explicit evaluations for binary mixtures in five dimensions are
performed. The results are compared with computer simulations and a good
agreement is found.
