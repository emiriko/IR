Studies of the mass function (MF) of open clusters of different ages allow us
to probe the efficiency with which brown dwarfs (BDs) are evaporated from
clusters to populate the field. Surveys in old clusters (age > 100 Myr) do not
suffer so severely from several problems encountered in young clusters, such as
intra-cluster extinction and large uncertainties in BD models. Here we present
the results of a deep photometric survey to study the MF of the old open
cluster Praesepe (age 590 Myr and distance 190 pc), down to a 5 sigma detection
limit at i~25.6 mag (~40M_Jup). We identify 62 cluster member candidates, of
which 40 are substellar, from comparison with predictions from a dusty
atmosphere model. The MF rises from the substellar boundary until ~60M_Jup and
then declines. This is quite different from the form inferred for other open
clusters older than 50 Myr, but seems to be similar to those found in very
young open cluster, whose MFs peak at ~10M_Jup. Either Praesepe really does
have a different MF from other clusters or they had similar initial MFs but
have differed in their dynamical evolution. We further have identified six
foreground T dwarf candidates towards Praesepe, which require follow-up
spectroscopy to confirm their nature.
