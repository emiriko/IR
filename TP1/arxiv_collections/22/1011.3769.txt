In this note, we use the Lopez-Ros deformation introduced in [9] to show that
any embedded genus-one helicoid must be symmetric with respect to rotation by
180 degrees around a normal line. This partially answers a conjecture of
Bobenko from [3]. We also show this symmetry holds for an embedded genus-k
helicoid $\Sigma$, provided the underlying conformal structure of $\Sigma$ is
hyperelliptic.
