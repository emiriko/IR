A particular analytic continuation of classical string solutions having a
single AdS_5 spin is considered. These solutions describe strings tunnelling
from the boundary to the boundary of AdS_5. We use the Legendre transform of
the dimensionally regularised action of these solutions to evaluate the 2-point
functions of the dual operators, holographically. Subsequently, we evaluate the
structure coefficient of correlators involving two operators with spin S and a
BPS state, at strong coupling. Our expressions are valid for any value of the
AdS spin S/\sqrt{\lambda} and can be applied both at the case of long and short
strings. For long strings and at leading order, the structure coefficient is
independent of the spin S for twist J operators, while it scales as
1/\log^l{\frac{S}{\sqrt{\lambda}}} for the case of operators with two equal
angular momenta in S^5. For short strings, the structure coefficient is
proportional to the energy E of the string. Finally, we comment on the
possibility of relating the strong coupling 3-point function coefficient of
three large spin twist 2 operators to the action of the 6-gluon scattering
amplitude.
