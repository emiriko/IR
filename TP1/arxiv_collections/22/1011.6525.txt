With the aim of understanding which physical processes are primarily
responsible for the transformation of spiral galaxies into S0s in clusters, we
study the gas kinematics, morphological disturbances, and the Tully-Fisher
relation (TFR) of distant galaxies in various environments. We use the ESO
Distant Cluster Survey (EDisCS) dataset, that spans a broad range of cluster
and galaxy properties at 0.3 < z < 0.8. Our results indicate that the physical
mechanism acting on cluster galaxies (with M_B < -20 mag) must be strong enough
to significantly disturb the gas in cluster galaxies, but at the same time,
mild enough to leave the stellar structure unaffected.
