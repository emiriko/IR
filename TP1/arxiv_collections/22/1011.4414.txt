The realistic description of correlated electron systems has taken an
important step forward a few years ago as the combination of density functional
methods and the dynamical mean-field theory was conceived. This framework
allows access to both high and low energy physics and is capable of the
description of the specific physics of strongly correlated materials, like the
Mott metal-insulator transition. A very important step in the procedure is the
interface between the band structure method and the dynamical mean-field theory
and its impurity solver. We present a general interface between a projector
augmented wave based density functional code and many-body methods based on
Wannier functions obtained from a projection on local orbitals. The
implementation is very flexible and allows for various applications. Quantities
like the momentum resolved spectral function are accessible. We present
applications to SrVO$_3$ and the metal-insulator transition in
Ca$_{2-x}$Sr$_{x}$RuO$_4$.
