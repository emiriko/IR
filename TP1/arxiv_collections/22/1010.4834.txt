In this work we explore the performance of CUDA in quenched lattice SU(2)
simulations. CUDA, NVIDIA Compute Unified Device Architecture, is a hardware
and software architecture developed by NVIDIA for computing on the GPU. We
present an analysis and performance comparison between the GPU and CPU in
single and double precision. Analyses with multiple GPUs and two different
architectures (G200 and Fermi architectures) are also presented. In order to
obtain a high performance, the code must be optimized for the GPU architecture,
i.e., an implementation that exploits the memory hierarchy of the CUDA
programming model.
  We produce codes for the Monte Carlo generation of SU(2) lattice gauge
configurations, for the mean plaquette, for the Polyakov Loop at finite T and
for the Wilson loop. We also present results for the potential using many
configurations ($50\ 000$) without smearing and almost $2\ 000$ configurations
with APE smearing. With two Fermi GPUs we have achieved an excellent
performance of $200 \times$ the speed over one CPU, in single precision, around
110 Gflops/s. We also find that, using the Fermi architecture, double precision
computations for the static quark-antiquark potential are not much slower (less
than $2 \times$ slower) than single precision computations.
