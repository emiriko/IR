We develop a new method which measures the projected density distribution
w_p(r_p)n of photometric galaxies surrounding a set of
spectroscopically-identified galaxies, and simultaneously the projected
correlation function w_p(r_p) between the two populations. In this method we
are able to divide the photometric galaxies into subsamples in luminosity
intervals when redshift information is unavailable, enabling us to measure
w_p(r_p)n and w_p(r_p) as a function of not only the luminosity of the
spectroscopic galaxy, but also that of the photometric galaxy. Extensive tests
show that our method can measure w_p(r_p) in a statistically unbiased way. The
accuracy of the measurement depends on the validity of the assumption in the
method that the foreground/background galaxies are randomly distributed and
thus uncorrelated with those galaxies of interest. Therefore, our method can be
applied to the cases where foreground/background galaxies are distributed in
large volumes, which is usually valid in real observations. We applied our
method to data from SDSS including a sample of 10^5 LRGs at z~0.4 and a sample
of about half a million galaxies at z~0.1, both of which are cross-correlated
with a deep photometric sample drawn from the SDSS. On large scales, the
relative bias factor of galaxies measured from w_p(r_p) at z~0.4 depends on
luminosity in a manner similar to what is found at z~0.1, which are usually
probed by autocorrelations of spectroscopic samples. On scales smaller than a
few Mpc and at both z~0.4 and z~0.1, the photometric galaxies of different
luminosities exhibit similar density profiles around spectroscopic galaxies at
fixed luminosity and redshift. This provides clear support for the assumption
commonly-adopted in HOD models that satellite galaxies of different
luminosities are distributed in a similar way, following the dark matter
distribution within their host halos.
