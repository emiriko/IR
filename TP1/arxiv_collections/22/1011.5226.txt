In this paper, we propose a method to study the nature of resonant relaxation
in near-Keplerian systems. Our technique is based on measuring the fractal
dimension of the angular momentum trails and we use it to analyze the outcome
of N-body simulations. With our method, we can reliably determine the timescale
for resonant relaxation, as well as the rate of change of angular momentum in
this regime. We find that growth of angular momentum is more rapid than random
walk, but slower than linear growth. We also determine the presence of long
term correlations, arising from the bounds on angular momentum growth. We
develop a toy model that reproduces all essential properties of angular
momentum evolution.
