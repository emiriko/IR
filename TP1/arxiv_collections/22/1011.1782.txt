Complexity in strongly correlated electron systems is analyzed by considering
decoherence process between the localized state, |L> and the itinerant state,
|I>. The coherent superposition state of a|I> + b|L> decoheres to the pointer
states in the proximity of both extremes of the correlation where the
symmetry-breaking ground states of the charge pairing emerge. For maximizing
the entropy of the system, the superconducting pairing and the spin density
wave coexist within the uncertainty principle, which invokes the metastable
states as like pseudogap phase and electronic inhomogenity.
