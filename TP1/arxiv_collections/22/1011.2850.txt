The electronic transport properties of graphene-based superlattice structures
are investigated. A graphene-based modulation-doped superlattice structure
geometry is proposed and consist of periodically arranged alternate layers:
InAs/graphene/GaAs/graphene/GaSb. Undoped graphene/GaAs/graphene structure
displays relatively high conductance and enhanced mobilities at elevated
temperatures unlike modulation-doped superlattice structure more steady and
less sensitive to temperature and robust electrical tunable control on the
screening length scale. Thermionic current density exhibits enhanced behaviour
due to presence of metallic (graphene) mono-layers in superlattice structure.
The proposed superlattice structure might become of great use for new types of
wide-band energy gap quantum devices.
