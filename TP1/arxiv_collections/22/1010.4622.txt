We investigate charge qubit measurements using a single electron transistor,
with focus on the backaction-induced renormalization of qubit parameters. It is
revealed the renormalized dynamics leads to a number of intriguing features in
the detector's noise spectra, and therefore needs to be accounted for to
properly understand the measurement result. Noticeably, the level
renormalization gives rise to a strongly enhanced signal-to-noise ratio, which
can even exceed the universal upper bound imposed quantum mechanically on
linear-response detectors.
