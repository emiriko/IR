A simple kinematic model based on the superposition of p+p collisions,
relativistic geometry and hadronic rescattering is used to predict the elliptic
flow observable in sqrt{sNN} = 2.76 TeV Pb+Pb collisions. A short proper time
for hadronization is assumed. The predictions are compared with recent
experimental measurements of elliptic flow which have been made for this
colliding system and energy. It is found that the model predictions do a
reasonable job in describing the experimental results, suggesting that the
parton phase in these collisions may be short-lived.
