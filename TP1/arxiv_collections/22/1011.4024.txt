The statistical model of the hadron as a quarkonium system suggests the
dimensional dependence of some of the properties of the hadron like the scaling
in its probability density with the anomalous dimension as the exponent,the
universality, the power law scaling in transverse momentum in hadron
production.Recent experimental findings are found to be in agreement with the
corresponding predictions of the model.
