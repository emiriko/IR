We present a microscopic model for hadron resonances which contains, in
addition to constituent (anti)quarks, mesonic degrees of freedom. It is assumed
that the (anti)quarks are confined by an instantaneous potential and that the
mesons can couple directly to the (anti)quarks. This system is treated within a
relativistic coupled-channel formalism in order to take the dynamics of the
mesonic degrees of freedom fully into account. It is demonstrated that the mass
eigenvalue problem for such a system can be reformulated as a purely hadronic
eigenvalue problem in which bare hadrons, i.e. eigenstates of the pure
confinement problem, are coupled via meson loops. The substructure of the bare
hadrons is then hidden in (bare) hadron-meson vertex form factors. It is shown
for a simple toy model that such a kind of approach may lead to reasonable
(non-perturbative) decay widths for hadron resonances.
