We present a joint experimental and theoretical study of the superconducting
phase of the layered binary silicide BaSi2. Compared with the layered AlB2
structure of graphite or diboride-like superconductors, in the hexagonal
structure of binary silicides the sp3 arrangement of silicon atoms leads to
corrugated sheets. Through a high-pressure synthesis procedure we are able to
modify the buckling of these sheets, obtaining the enhancement of the
superconducting transition temperature from 4 K to 8.7 K when the silicon
planes flatten out. By performing ab-initio calculations based on density
functional theory we explain how the electronic and phononic properties of the
system are strongly affected by changes in the buckling. This mechanism is
likely present in other intercalated layered superconductors, opening the way
to the tuning of superconductivity through the control of internal structural
parameters.
