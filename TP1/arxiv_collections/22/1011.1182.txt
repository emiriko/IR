We report on the experimental generation of a train of subpicosecond electron
bunches. The bunch train generation is accomplished using a beamline capable of
exchanging the coordinates between the horizontal and longitudinal degrees of
freedom. An initial beam consisting of a set of horizontally-separated beamlets
is converted into a train of bunches temporally separated with tunable bunch
duration and separation. The experiment reported in this Letter unambiguously
demonstrates the conversion process and its versatility.
