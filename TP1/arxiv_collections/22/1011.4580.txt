In this paper, a new efficient computational algorithm is presented for
solving cyclic heptadiagonal linear systems based on using of heptadiagonal
linear solver and Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury formula. The implementation of the
algorithm using computer algebra systems (CAS) such as MAPLE and MATLAB is
straightforward. Numerical example is presented for the sake of illustration.
