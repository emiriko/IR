The binary system PSR B1259-63 consists of a 48 ms pulsar in a 3.4 year orbit
around a Be star and unpulsed TeV gamma-ray emission has been detected near
previous periastron passages. A likely source of the gamma-rays is the inverse
Compton up-scattering of target photons from the Be star by the
ultra-relativistic electron/positron pulsar wind in the region of the plerion
shock front. In this study the effect of the infrared emission from the Be
star's circumstellar disc on inverse Compton gamma-ray production in PSR
B1259-63 is investigated by considering an isotropic photon/electron
approximation. The modified photon density distribution is determined by using
a curve of growth method fitted to previous optical and infrared observations.
The inverse Compton scattering rate is calculated using the modified photon
distribution and the exact scattering equation. It is shown that including the
infrared emission increase the GeV gamma-ray flux by a factor $\ga 2$.
