A novel algorithm has been proposed for simulating thermal decomposition of
atomic clusters at such low temperatures that the corresponding lifetimes are
macroscopic and, hence, standard molecular dynamics algorithms are
inapplicable. The proposed algorithm is based on a combination of the molecular
dynamics and Monte Carlo techniques. It is used to calculate the temperature
dependence of the lifetime of the thermalized C20 fullerene until it decomposes
at T = 1300-4000 K. The frequency factor and activation energy of the
decomposition are determined. It is demonstrate that the temperature
dependences of the lifetimes of the heat-isolated and thermalized fullerenes
differ significantly.
