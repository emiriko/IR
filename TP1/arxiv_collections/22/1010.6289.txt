We explore the unification of gauge couplings and fermion masses in two
different types of supersymmetric left-right models, one with Higgs triplets
and the other with both Higgs triplets as well as bitriplets. The minimal
versions of these models do not give rise to the desired unification and some
extra fields have to be added. After such a modification, it is possible in one
model to get gauged $B-L$ symmetry to be unbroken down to TeV scale. We also
identify the parameter space at the electroweak scale which gives rise to
fermion mass unification at a high scale $M_{G}$. Type I seesaw emerges as the
natural explanation of the small neutrino masses in both the models.
