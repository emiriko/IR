For five years now, PHOTOS Monte Carlo for bremsstrahlung in the decay of
particles and resonances has been available with an interface to the C++ HepMC
event record. The main purpose of the present paper is to document the
technical aspects of the PHOTOS Monte Carlo installation and present version
use. A multitude of test results and examples are distributed together with the
program code.
  The PHOTOS C++ physics precision is better than its FORTRAN predecessor and
more convenient steering options are also available. An algorithm for the event
record interface necessary for process dependent photon emission kernel is
implemented. It is used in Z and W decays for kernels of complete first order
matrix elements of the decays. Additional emission of final state lepton pairs
is also available.
  Physics assumptions used in the program and properties of the solution are
reviewed. In particular, it is explained how the second order matrix elements
were used in design and validation of the program iteration procedure. Also, it
is explained that the phase space parametrization used in the program is exact.
