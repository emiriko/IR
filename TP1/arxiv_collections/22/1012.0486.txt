We discuss the following topics: n-dimensional local fields and adelic
groups; harmonic analysis on local fields and adelic groups for two-dimensional
schemes (function spaces, Fourier transform, Poisson formula); representations
of discrete Heisenberg groups; adelic Heisenberg groups and their
representations arising from two-dimensional schemes.
