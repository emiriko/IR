METIS is a mid-infrared instrument proposed for the European Extremely Large
Telescope (E-ELT). It is designed to provide imaging and spectroscopic
capabilities in the 3 - 14 micron region up to a spectral resolution of 100000.
One of the novel concepts of METIS is that of a high-resolution integral field
spectrograph (IFS) for a diffraction-limited mid-IR instrument. While this
concept has many scientific and operational advantages over a long-slit
spectrograph, one drawback is that the spectral resolution changes over the
field of view. This has an impact on the procedures to correct for telluric
absorption lines imprinted on the science spectra. They are a major obstacle in
the quest to maximize spectral fidelity, the ability to distinguish a weak
spectral feature from the continuum. The classical technique of division by a
standard star spectrum, observed in a single IFS spaxel, cannot simply be
applied to all spaxels, because the spectral resolution changes from spaxel to
spaxel. Here we present and discuss possible techniques of telluric line
correction of METIS IFS spectra, including the application of synthetic model
spectra of telluric transmission, to maximize spectral fidelity.
