Quantum cosmology is usually studied quantizing symmetry-reduced variables.
Is it possible, instead, to define quantum cosmology starting from the full
quantum gravity theory? In Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG), it is possible to cut
the degrees of freedom in a suitable way, in order to define a cosmological
model. Such a model provides a tool for describing general fluctuations of the
quantum geometry at the bounce that replaces the initial singularity. I focus
on its simplest version, a "dipole" formed by two tetrahedra. This has been
shown to describe a universe with anisotropic and inhomogenous degrees of
freedom. Its dynamics can be given using the spinfoam formalism. I briefly
review the present state of this approach.
