The TWIST Collaboration has completed a new measurement of the energy-angle
spectrum of positrons from the decay of highly polarized muons. A simultaneous
measurement of the muon decay parameters {\rho}, {\delta}, and (P_{\mu}){\xi}
tests the Standard Model (SM) in a purely leptonic process and provides
improved limits for relevant extensions to the SM. Specifically, for the
generalized left-right symmetric model |(g_R/g_L){\zeta}|<0.020 and
(g_L/g_R)m_2> 578 GeV/c^2, both 90% C.L.
