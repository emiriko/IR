We study the importance of inter-site coherences and quantum interference
effects in the x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) of mixed-valent systems. We
demonstrate its importance, first for a simple diatomic mixed-valent molecule
to elucidate the physics involved, and finally for mixed-valent Ti oxides,
using a model calculation including full spin and orbital multiplicities. Our
calculations demonstrate the inefficacy of conventional approaches of
describing the XAS from mixed-valent systems as incoherent combinations of XAS
from the pure-valent end members, and that multiplets forbidden in the
single-site approximation can be reached within a multi-site description. These
conclusions play an important role in the interpretation of XAS and resonant
x-ray scattering (RXS) in terms of the electronic structure of strongly
correlated systems.
