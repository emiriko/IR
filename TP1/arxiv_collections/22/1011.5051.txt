Let $S$ be a closed oriented surface of genus at least two. Gallo, Kapovich,
and Marden asked if 2\pi-graftings produce all projective structures on $S$
with arbitrarily fixed holonomy (Grafting Conjecture). In this paper, we show
that the conjecture holds true "locally" in the space $GL$ of geodesic
laminations on $S$ via a natural projection of projective structures on $S$
into $GL$ in the Thurston coordinates. In the sequel paper, using this local
solution, we prove the conjecture for generic holonomy.
