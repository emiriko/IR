In this manuscript, we consider the problems of channel assignment in
wireless networks and data migration in heterogeneous storage systems. We show
that a soft edge coloring approach to both problems gives rigorous
approximation guarantees. In the channel assignment problem arising in wireless
networks a pair of edges incident to a vertex are said to be conflicting if the
channels assigned to them are the same. Our goal is to assign channels (color
edges) so that the number of conflicts is minimized. The problem is NP-hard by
a reduction from Edge coloring and we present two combinatorial algorithms for
this case. The first algorithm is based on a distributed greedy method and
gives a solution with at most $2(1-\frac{1}{k})|E|$ more conflicts than the
optimal solution.The approximation ratio if the second algorithm is $1 +
\frac{|V|}{|E|}$, which gives a ($1 + o(1)$)-factor for dense graphs and is the
best possible unless P = NP. We also consider the data migration problem in
heterogeneous storage systems. In such systems, data layouts may need to be
reconfigured over time for load balancing or in the event of system
failure/upgrades. It is critical to migrate data to their target locations as
quickly as possible to obtain the best performance of the system. Most of the
previous results on data migration assume that each storage node can perform
only one data transfer at a time. However, storage devices tend to have
heterogeneous capabilities as devices may be added over time due to storage
demand increase. We develop algorithms to minimize the data migration time. We
show that it is possible to find an optimal migration schedule when all $c_v$'s
are even. Furthermore, though the problem is NP-hard in general, we give an
efficient soft edge coloring algorithm that offers a rigorous $(1 +
o(1))$-approximation guarantee.
