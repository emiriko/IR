Anomalous X-ray pulsars and soft gamma repeaters have recently emerged as a
unified class of neutron stars, identified by dramatic X-ray and gamma-ray
outbursts and via luminous X-ray pulsations, both thought to be powered by the
decay of an enormous internal magnetic field. This "magnetar" hypothesis has
raised the question of these objects' physical relationship with conventional
rotation-powered pulsars (RPPs). The highest magnetic-field RPPs might
therefore be expected to be transition objects between the two populations. The
recently reported magnetar-like outburst of PSR J1846-0258, previously thought
to be purely rotation-powered, clearly supports this suggestion. Here we review
the observational properties of the highest magnetic-field RPPs known, and show
some common characteristics that are notable among RPPs, which are plausibly
related to their high fields. Using these objects, we consider the evidence for
proposed "magneto-thermal evolution" in neutron stars, and argue that while
some exists, it is not yet conclusive.
