We show a different modification of Poincare algebra that also preserves
Lorentz algebra. The change begins with how boosts affect spacetime in a way
similar to how they affect the momenta in kappa Poincare algebra, hence the
term "dual kappa Poincare algebra". Since by construction the new spacetime
commutes, it follows that the momenta co-commute. Proposing a spacetime
co-algebra that is similar to the coproduct in the bicrossproduct basis of
kappa Poincare algebra, we derive the phase space algebra using the Heisenberg
double construction. The phase space variables of the dual kappa Poincare
algebra are then related to the SR phase space variables. From these relations,
we complete the dual kappa Poincare algebra by deriving the action of rotations
and boosts on the momenta.
