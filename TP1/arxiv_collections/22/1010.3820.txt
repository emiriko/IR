Completeness of the eigenfunctions of a quantum mechanical system is crucial
for its probability interpretation. By using the method of contour integral we
give properly normalized eigenfunctions for both discrete and continuum
spectrum of the Morse potential, and explicitly prove the completeness
relation. As an application we use our spectral decomposition formula to study
the problem of the pricing of an Asian option traded in financial markets.
