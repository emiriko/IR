We review recent results on properties of the meson gas relevant for Heavy
Ion Collision and Nuclear Matter experiments, within the framework of chiral
lagrangians. In particular, we describe the temperature and density evolution
of the $\sigma$ and $\rho$ poles and its connection with chiral symmetry
restoration, as well as the chemical nonequilibrated phase and transport
coefficients.
