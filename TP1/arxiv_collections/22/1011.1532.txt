Run II of the Tevatron collider at Fermilab is currently scheduled to end
late in 2011. Given the current performance of the collider and of the CDF and
D0 detectors, it is estimated that the current data set could be approximately
doubled with a run extended into 2014. A few examples are presented of the
physics potential of these additional statistics. These are discussed in the
context of the expected reach of the LHC 7 TeV data and the existing Tevatron
data. In particular, an extraordinary opportunity is described which could
probe the existence of a standard model Higgs boson with mass in the currently
preferred region between 115 GeV and 150 GeV.
