Recently it has been shown that when the Dark Matter (DM) particles captured
in the Sun directly annihilate into neutrino pairs, the oscillatory terms in
the oscillation probability do not average to zero and can lead to a seasonal
variation as the distance between the Sun and Earth changes in time. In this
paper, we explore this feature as a novel method to extract information on the
properties of dark matter. We show that by studying the variation of the flux
over a few months, it would in principle be possible to derive the DM mass as
well as new information on the flavor structure of the DM annihilation modes.
In addition to analytic analysis, we present the results of our numerical
calculations that take into account scattering and regeneration of neutrinos
traversing the Sun.
