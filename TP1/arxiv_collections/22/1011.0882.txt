The differential and total cross-sections for the dp \to 3He \eta reaction
have been measured in a high precision high statistics COSY-ANKE experiment
near threshold using a continuous beam energy ramp up to an excess energy Q of
11.3 MeV with essentially 100% acceptance. The kinematics allowed the mean
value of Q to be determined to about 9 keV. Evidence is found for the effects
of higher partial waves for Q > 4 MeV. The very rapid rise of the total
cross-section to its maximum value within 0.5 MeV of threshold implies a very
large \eta 3He scattering length and hence the presence of a quasi-bound state
extremely close to threshold. In addition, differential and total
cross-sections have been measured at excess energies of 19.5, 39.4, and 59.4
MeV over the full angular range. While at 19.5 MeV the results can be described
in terms of s- and p-wave production, by 59.4 MeV higher partial waves are
required. Including the 19.5 MeV point together with the near-threshold data in
a global s- and p-wave fit gives a poorer overall description of the data
though the position of the pole in the \eta 3He scattering amplitude,
corresponding to the quasi-bound or virtual state, is hardly changed.
