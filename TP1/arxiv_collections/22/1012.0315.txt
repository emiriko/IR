We study nonequilibrium edge state transport in the fractional quantum Hall
regime for states with one or several counter-propagating neutral modes. We
consider a setup in which the neutral modes are heated by a hot spot, and where
heat transported by the neutral modes causes a temperature difference between
the upper and lower edges in a Hall bar. This temperature difference is probed
by the excess noise it causes for scattering across a quantum point contact. We
find that the excess noise in the quantum point contact provides evidence for
counter-propagating neutral modes, and we calculate its dependence on both the
temperature difference between the edges and on source drain bias.
