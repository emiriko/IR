We study intensity distribution of transmission resonances under the
conditions of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) with lin||lin
configuration in 87Rb vapor. We demonstrate that for various orientations of
the external magnetic field all seven resolved EIT resonances exhibit maxima or
minima at certain directions of the linear polarization of the laser field.
This effect can be used for development of a high-precision vector EIT
magnetometer.
