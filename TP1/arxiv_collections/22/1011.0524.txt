We show that the combinatorial numbers known as {\em Bell numbers} are
generic in quantum physics. This is because they arise in the procedure known
as {\em Normal ordering} of bosons, a procedure which is involved in the
evaluation of quantum functions such as the canonical partition function of
quantum statistical physics, {\it inter alia}. In fact, we shall show that an
evaluation of the non-interacting partition function for a single boson system
is identical to integrating the {\em exponential generating function} of the
Bell numbers, which is a device for encapsulating a combinatorial sequence in a
single function. We then introduce a remarkable equality, the Dobinski
relation, and use it to indicate why renormalisation is necessary in even the
simplest of perturbation expansions for a partition function. Finally we
introduce a global algebraic description of this simple model, giving a Hopf
algebra, which provides a starting point for extensions to more complex
physical systems.
