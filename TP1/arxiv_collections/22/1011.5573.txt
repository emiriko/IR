In this contribution we consider Collective Behaviours as coherent sequences
of spatial configurations adopted by interacting agents through corresponding
different structures over time. Multiple structures over time and their
sequences are considered as Meta-Structures establishing sequences of spatial
configurations. They are intended as coherent when acquiring emergent
properties. This coherence is considered here as being represented by the
values adopted by suitable mesoscopic variables and their properties, i.e.,
meta-structural properties, allowing the researcher to a) Recognise a
phenomenon as emergent; b) Induce emergence of collective behaviour in
populations of agents collectively interacting; c) Act on collective emergent
phenomena with the purpose to change, regulate and maintain acquired properties
and d) Merge different collective emergent phenomena. We introduce a formal
tool, i.e., the mesoscopic general vector to represent the adoption, over time,
of mesoscopic properties by collectively interacting elements. We mention
future experimental lines of activities, future lines of research and possible
applications. Keywords: coherence, emergence, ergodicity, mesoscopic,
meta-structures.
