Evidence is presented for the necessity of including duality violations in a
consistent description of spectral function moments employed in the precision
determination of $\alpha_s$ from $\tau$ decay. A physically motivated ansatz
for duality violations in the spectral functions enables us to perform fits to
spectral moments employing both pinched and unpinched weights. We describe our
analysis strategy and provide some preliminary findings. Final numerical
results await completion of an ongoing re-determination of the ALEPH covariance
matrices incorporating correlations due to the unfolding procedure which are
absent from the currently posted versions. To what extent this issue affects
existing analyses and our own work will require further study.
