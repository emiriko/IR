We study the existence of one/two texture zeros or one/two vanishing minors
in the neutrino mass matrix with $\mu\tau$ symmetry. In the basis where the
charged lepton mass matrix and the Dirac neutrino mass matrix are diagonal, the
one/two zeros or one/two vanishing minors in the right-handed Majorana mass
matrix having $\mu\tau$ symmetry will propagate via seesaw mechanism as one/two
vanishing minors or one/two texture zeros in the neutrino mass matrix with
$\mu\tau$ symmetry respectively. It is found that only five such texture
structures of the neutrino mass matrix are phenomenologically viable. For
tribimaximal mixing, these texture structures reduce the number of free
parameters to one. Interesting predictions are obtained for the effective
Majorana mass $M_{ee}$, the absolute mass scale and the Majorana-type CP
violating phases.
