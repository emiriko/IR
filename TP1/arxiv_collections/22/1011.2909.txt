A conceptual model for microscopic-macroscopic slow-fast stochastic systems
is considered. A dynamical reduction procedure is presented in order to extract
effective dynamics for this kind of systems. Under appropriate assumptions, the
effective system is shown to approximate the original system, in the sense of a
probabilistic convergence.
