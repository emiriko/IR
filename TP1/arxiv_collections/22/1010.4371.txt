We study the ground-state properties of mixtures of strongly interacting
bosonic atoms in an optical lattice. Applying a mean-field approximation to the
Hubbard model for Bose-Bose mixtures, we calculate the densities and superfluid
order parameters for both species. Due to the repulsive interaction between the
two species, the system exhibits phase separation. First, in the extreme limit
of the zero-hopping case, we derive analytical expressions for the phase
boundaries. In particular, we derive the conditions for phase separation in the
Mott insulator phase. We find that the conditions for the phase separation
depend on the on-site interactions as well as the occupation numbers. In
particular, we show that the coexisting state appears by varying the on-site
inter-species interaction. We also show the phase diagram of the finite hopping
case. Second, we calculate the spatial density profile of $^{87}$Rb-$^{41}$K
mixtures in the combined potential of a parabolic trap and an optical lattice
using the local density approximation. We fixed the number of $^{87}$Rb and
varied the number of $^{41}$K, and used the parameters estimated by
experiments. We show that the phase separated $^{87}$Rb-$^{41}$K mixtures
distribute like in a parabolic trap case. Furthermore, we find that phase
separated mixtures distribute a nesting structure.
