For the model of a compressible barotropic fluid on a two dimensional
rotating Riemmanian manifold we discuss a special class of smooth solutions
having a form of a steady non-singular vortex moving with a bearing field. The
model can be obtained from the system of primitive equations governing the
motion of air over the Earth surface after averaging over the height and
therefore the solution obtained can be interpreted as a tropical cyclone which
is known as a long time existing stable vortex. We consider approximations of
$l$- plane and $\beta$ - plane used in geophysics for modeling of middle scale
processes and equations on the whole sphere as well. We show that the solutions
of the mentioned form satisfy the equations of the model either exactly or with
a discrepancy which is small in a neighborhood of the trajectory of the center
of vortex. We perform a numeric study of the change of the shape of the vortex
affected by the neglecting the discrepancy term.
