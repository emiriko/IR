Effects of disorder on two-dimensional Z2 topological insulator are studied
numerically by the transfer matrix method. Based on the scaling analysis, the
phase diagram is derived for a model of HgTe quantum well as a function of
disorder strength and magnitude of the energy gap. In the presence of sz
non-conserving spin-orbit coupling, a finite metallic region is found that
partitions the two topologically distinct insulating phases. As disorder
increases, a narrow-gap topologically trivial insulator undergoes a series of
transitions; first to metal, second to topological insulator, third to metal,
and finally back to trivial insulator. We show that this multiple transition is
a consequence of two disorder effects; renormalization of the band gap, and
Anderson localization. The metallic region found in the scaling analysis
corresponds roughly to the region of finite density of states at the Fermi
level evaluated in the self-consistent Born approximation.
