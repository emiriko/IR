Engineering of synthetic magnetic flux in Bose-Einstein condensates [Lin et
al., Nature {\bf 462}, 628 (2009)] has prospects for attaining the high vortex
densities necessary to emulate the fractional quantum Hall effect. We
analytically establish the hydrodynamical behaviour of a condensate in a
uniform synthetic magnetic field, including its density and velocity profile.
Importantly, we find that the onset of vortex nucleation observed
experimentally corresponds to a dynamical instability in the hydrodynamical
solutions and reveal other routes to instability and anticipated vortex
nucleation.
