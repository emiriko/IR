We performed a highly sensitive search for magnetic fields on a large set of
HgMn stars. With the aid of a new polarimeter attached to the HARPS
spectrometer at the ESO 3.6m-telescope, we obtained high-quality circular
polarization spectra of 41 single and double HgMn stars. Using a multi-line
analysis technique on each star, we co-added information from hundreds of
spectral lines resulting in significantly greater sensitivity to the presence
of magnetic fields, including very weak fields. For the 47 individual objects
studied, including 6 components of SB2 systems, we do not detect any magnetic
fields at greater than the 3 sigma level. The lack of detection in the circular
polarization profiles indicates that if strong fields are present on these
stars, they must have complex surface topologies. For simple global fields, our
detection limits imply upper limits to the fields present of 2-10 Gauss in the
best cases. We conclude that HgMn stars lack large-scale magnetic fields,
typical for spotted magnetic Ap stars, sufficient to form and sustain the
chemical spots observed on HgMn stars. Our study confirms that in addition to
magnetically altered atomic diffusion, there exists another differentiation
mechanism operating in the atmospheres of late-B main sequence stars which can
compositional inhomogeneities on their surfaces.
