The approximation of quantum unitary dynamics of a particle by a swarm of
point wise classical samples of this particle is proposed. Quantum mechanism of
speedup rests on the creation and annihilation of absolutely rigid bons, which
join samples in dot wise symplexes so that the density of swarm approximate the
quantum probability. This mechanism does not require differentiation of a
density that is adventage of this method over Bohm's quantum hydrodynamics: our
method is applicable to many particles in entangled states. In multi particle
case the limitation of total number of samples gives the natural model of
decoherence, e.g. the divergency from the exact solution of Shredinger
equation. Intensity of creation - annihilation of bonds between samples
substantially depends on the grain of spatial resolution, which makes
impossible to pass to the limits as in a classical substance; this is the price
for the scalability of a model to many particles.
