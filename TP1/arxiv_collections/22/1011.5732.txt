A new microscopic nucleon-nucleon (NN) interaction has been derived for the
first time from the popular relativistic mean field theory (RMFT) Lagrangian.
The NN interaction so obtained remarkably relate to the inbuilt fundamental
parameters of RMFT. Furthermore, by folding it with the RMFT-densities of
cluster and daughter nuclei to obtain the optical potential, it's application
is also examined to study the exotic cluster radioactive decays, and results
obtained found comparable with the successfully used M3Y phenomenological
effective NN interactions. The presently derived NN-interaction can also be
used to calculate a number of other nuclear observables.
