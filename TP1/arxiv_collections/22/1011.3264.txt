We present a generalization of the recently developed dual fermion approach
introduced for correlated lattices to non-equilibrium problems. In its local
limit, the approach has been used to devise an efficient impurity solver, the
superperturbation solver for the Anderson impurity model (AIM). Here we show
that the general dual perturbation theory can be formulated on the Keldysh
contour. Starting from a reference Hamiltonian system, in which the
time-dependent solution is found by exact diagonalization, we make a dual
perturbation expansion in order to account for the relaxation effects from the
fermionic bath. Simple test results for closed as well as open quantum systems
in a fermionic bath are presented.
