We present the first representation of the general term of the
Rayleigh-Schr\"odinger series for quasidegenerate systems. Each term of the
series is represented by a tree and there is a straightforward relation between
the tree and the analytical expression of the corresponding term. The
combinatorial and graphical techniques used in the proof of the series
expansion allow us to derive various resummation formulas of the series. The
relation with several combinatorial objects used for special cases (degenerate
or non-degenerate systems) is established.
