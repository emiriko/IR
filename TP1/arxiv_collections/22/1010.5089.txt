We present the status of the Unitarity Triangle Analysis (UTA), within the
Standard Model (SM) and beyond, with experimental and theoretical inputs
updated for the ICHEP 2010 conference. Within the SM, we find that the general
consistency among all the constraints leaves space only to some tension
(between the UTA prediction and the experimental measurement) in BR(B -> tau
nu), sin(2 beta) and epsilon_K. In the UTA beyond the SM, we allow for New
Physics (NP) effects in (Delta F)=2 processes. The hint of NP at the 2.9 sigma
level in the B_s-\bar B_s mixing turns out to be confirmed by the present
update, which includes the new D0 result on the dimuon charge asymmetry but not
the new CDF measurement of phi_s, being the likelihood not yet released.
