The relationship between the complexity classes P and NP is a question that
has not yet been answered by the Theory of Computation. The existence of a
language in NP, proven not to belong to P, is sufficient evidence to establish
the separation of P from NP. If a language is not recursive, it can't belong to
the complexity class NP. We find a problem in NP which is not in P; because if
it would be present in that class, then it will imply that some undecidable
problem will be in NP too. That's why it can be confirmed by reduction ad
absurdum the following result: P doesn't equal NP. This new problem named
Certifying is to find a possible input given a particular deterministic Turing
machine named Certified Turing machine and its output.
