We report the realization of the continuous wave laser emission in the orange
at 607 nm from a Pr:BaY2F8 (Pr:BYF) crystal pumped by a blue GaN laser diode. A
maximal output power of 78 mW is obtained in a quasi single transverse mode
beam. The effect of reabsorption losses at the laser wavelength is also
evidenced
