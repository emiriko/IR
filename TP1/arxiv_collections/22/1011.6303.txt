We study the early-stage kinetics of thermodynamically unstable systems with
quenched disorder. We show analytically that the growth of initial fluctuations
is amplified by the presence of disorder. This is confirmed by numerical
simulations of morphological phase separation (MPS) in thin liquid films and
spinodal decomposition (SD) in binary mixtures. We also discuss the
experimental implications of our results.
