We review recent progress in the understanding of low-energy baryon structure
by means of chiral perturbation theory. In particular, we discuss the
application of this formalism to the description of the quark mass dependence
of recent Lattice QCD results on the masses. We present the chiral
extrapolation of those of the PACS-CS and LHP collaborations and we predict the
baryonic sigma-terms.
