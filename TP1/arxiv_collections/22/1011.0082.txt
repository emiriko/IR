The phenomenon of Coulombic friction enters the stochastic description of dry
friction between two solids and the statistic characterization of vibrating
granular media. Here we analyze the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation
including both velocity and spatial components, exhibiting a formal connection
to a quantum mechanical harmonic oscillator in the presence of a delta
potential. Numerical solutions for the resulting spatial displacement
statistics show a crossover from exponential to Gaussian displacement
statistics. We identify a transient intermediate regime that exhibits
multiscaling properties arising from the contribution of Coulombic friction.
The possible role of these effects during observations in diffusion experiments
is shortly discussed.
