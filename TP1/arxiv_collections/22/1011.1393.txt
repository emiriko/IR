When a high voltage is applied on an asymmetric capacitor, it experiences a
force acting toward its thinner electrode. This effect is called Brown-Biefeld
effect (BB), after its discoverers Thomas-Townsend Brown and Paul-Alfred
Biefeld. Many theories have been proposed to explain this effect, and many
speculations can be found on the net suggesting the effect is an
antigravitation or a space warp effect. However, in the recent years, more an
more researchers attribute the BB effect to a unicharge ion wind. This work
calculates the levitation force due to ion wind and presents experimental
results which confirm the theoretical results.
