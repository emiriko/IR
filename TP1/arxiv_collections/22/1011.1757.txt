We prove extensions of Milnor's theorem for germs with nonisolated
singularity and use them to find new classes of genuine real analytic mappings
$\psi$ with positive dimensional singular locus $\Sing \psi \subset
\psi^{-1}(0)$, for which the Milnor fibration exists and yields an open book
structure with singular binding.
