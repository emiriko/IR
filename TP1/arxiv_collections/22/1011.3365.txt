We analyze the optical spectrum of type 1 QSO SDSS J1425+3231. This ob- ject
is interesting since its narrow emission lines such as [O
III]{\lambda}{\lambda}4959, 5007 are double- peaked, and the line structure can
be modeled well by three Gaussian components: two components for the two peaks
(we refer the peaks at low/high redshift as "the blue/red component") and
another one for the line wing which has the same line center as that of the
blue component, but ~ 3 times broader. The separation between the blue and red
components is ~ 500 km/s with blue component ~ 2 times broader than the red
one. The H{\beta} emission can be separated into four components: two for the
double-peaked narrow line and two for the broad line which comes from the broad
line region (BLRs). The black hole mass estimated from the broad H{\beta}
emission line using the typical reverberation map- ping relation is 0.85 \times
108M\odot, which is consistent with that derived from parameters of [O
III]{\lambda} 5007 of the blue component. We suggest this QSO might be a dual
AGN system, the broad H{\beta} emission line is mainly contributed by the
primary black hole (traced by the blue component) while the broad H{\beta}
component of the secondary black hole (traced by the red component) is hard to
be separated out considering a resolution of ~2000 of SDSS spectra or it is
totally obscured by the dusty torus.
