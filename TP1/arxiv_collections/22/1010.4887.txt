The natural or man-made disaster demands an efficient communication and
coordination among first responders to save life and other community resources.
Normally, the traditional communication infrastructures such as land line or
cellular networks are damaged and don't provide adequate communication services
to first responders for exchanging emergency related information. Wireless ad
hoc networks such as mobile ad hoc networks, wireless sensor networks and
wireless mesh networks are the promising alternatives in such type of
situations. The security requirements for emergency response communications
include privacy, data integrity, authentication, key management, access control
and availability. Various ad hoc communication frameworks have been proposed
for emergency response situations. The majority of the proposed frameworks
don't provide adequate security services for reliable and secure information
exchange. This paper presents a survey of the proposed emergency response
communication frameworks and the potential security services required by them
to provide reliable and secure information exchange during emergency
situations.
