The (bounded) hairpin completion and its iterated versions are operations on
formal lan- guages which have been inspired by the hairpin formation in
DNA-biochemistry. The paper answers two questions asked in the literature about
the iterated hairpin completion.
  The first question is whether the class of regular languages is closed under
iterated bounded hairpin completion. Here we show that this is true by
providing a more general result which applies to all the classes of languages
which are closed under finite union, intersection with regular sets, and
concatenation with regular sets. In particular, all Chomsky classes and all
standard complexity classes are closed under iterated bounded hairpin
completion.
  In the second part of the paper we address the question whether the iterated
hairpin completion of a singleton is always regular. In contrast to the first
question, this one has a negative answer. We exhibit an example of a singleton
language whose iterated hairpin completion is not regular, actually it is not
context-free, but context-sensitive.
