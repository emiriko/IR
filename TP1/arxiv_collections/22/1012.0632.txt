The original definition of quantum discord of bipartite states was defined
over projective measurements, in this paper we discuss some generalizations of
it. These generalizations are defined over general measurements, rank-one
general measurements or Neumark extension measurements. We investigate the
nonnegativity, zero-discord sets of all these quantum discords and some
properties about them.
