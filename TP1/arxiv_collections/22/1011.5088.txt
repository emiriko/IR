We present a technique which allows us to solve the Random Phase
Approximation equations with finite-range interactions and treats the continuum
part of the excitation spectrum without approximations. The interaction used in
the Hartree-Fock calculations to generate the single particle basis is also
used in the Continuum Random Phase Approximation calculations. We present
results for the electric dipole and quadrupole excitations in the $^{16}$O,
$^{22}$O, $^{24}$O, $^{40}$Ca, $^{48}$Ca and $^{52}$Ca nuclei. We compare our
results with those of the traditional discrete Random Phase Approximation, with
the continuum mean-field results and with the results obtained by a
phenomenological approach. We study the relevance of the continuum, of the
residual interaction and of the self-consistency. We also compare our results
with the available total photoabsorption cross section data. We compare our
photoabsorption cross section in $^4$He with that obtained by a calculation
which uses a microscopic interaction.
