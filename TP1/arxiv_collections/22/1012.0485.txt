We show that the disc bulk one-point functions in a sl(n) Toda conformal
field theory have a well-defined limit for the central charge c=n-1, and that
their limiting values can be obtained from a limit of bulk one-point functions
in the W_n minimal models. This comparison leads to a proposal for one-point
functions for twisted boundary conditions in Toda theory.
