We present a one-parameter extension of the raise and peel one-dimensional
growth model. The model is defined in the configuration space of Dyck (RSOS)
paths. Tiles from a rarefied gas hit the interface and change its shape. The
adsorption rates are local but the desorption rates are non-local, they depend
not only on the cluster hit by the tile but also on the total number of peaks
(local maxima) belonging to all the clusters of the configuration. The domain
of the parameter is determined by the condition that the rates are
non-negative. In the finite-size scaling limit, the model is conformal
invariant in the whole open domain. The parameter appears in the sound velocity
only. At the boundary of the domain, the stationary state is an adsorbing state
and conformal invariance is lost. The model allows to check the universality of
nonlocal observables in the raise and peel model. An example is given.
