We analysed the Suzaku XIS1 data of the A3112 cluster of galaxies in order to
examine the X-ray excess emission in this cluster reported earlier with the
XMM-Newton and Chandra satellites. The best-fit temperature of the intracluster
gas depends strongly on the choice of the energy band used for the spectral
analysis. This proves the existence of excess emission component in addition to
the single-temperature MEKAL in A3112. We showed that this effect is not an
artifact due to uncertainties of the background modeling, instrument
calibration or the amount of Galactic absorption. Neither does the PSF scatter
of the emission from the cool core nor the projection of the cool gas in the
cluster outskirts produce the effect. Finally we modeled the excess emission
either by using an additional MEKAL or powerlaw component. Due to the small
differencies between thermal and non-thermal model we can not rule out the
non-thermal origin of the excess emission based on the goodness of the fit.
Assuming that it has a thermal origin, we further examined the Differential
Emission Measure (DEM) models. We utilised two different DEM models, a Gaussian
differential emission measure distribution (GDEM) and WDEM model, where the
emission measure of a number of thermal components is distributed as a
truncated power law. The best-fit XIS1 MEKAL temperature for the 0.4-7.0 keV
band is 4.7+-0.1 keV, consistent with that obtained using GDEM and WDEM models.
