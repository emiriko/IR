In this article, we improve the Strichartz estimates obtained in [12] for the
Schr\"odinger equation with white noise dispersion in one dimension. This
allows us to prove global well posedness when a quintic critical nonlinearity
is added to the equation. We finally show that the white noise dispersion is
the limit of smooth random dispersion.
