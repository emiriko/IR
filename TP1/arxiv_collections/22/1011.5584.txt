We study the effect of the rotation of an external electric field on the
dynamics of half-integer disclination networks in two dimensional nematic
liquid crystals with a negative dielectric anisotropy using LICRA, a LIquid
CRystal Algorithm developed by the authors. We show that a rotation of $\pi$ of
the electric field around an axis of the liquid crystal plane continuously
transforms all half-integer disclinations of the network into disclinations of
opposite sign via twist disclinations. We also determine the evolution of the
characteristic length scale, thus quantifying the impact of the external
electric field on the coarsening of the defect network.
