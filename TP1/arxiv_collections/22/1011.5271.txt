The strange quark content of the nucleon, as well as other matrix elements,
can be calculated on the lattice by examining correlations between the nucleon
propagator and the quark condensate. The largest contribution to statistical
error comes from fluctuations in the condensate far from the propagation region
that contribute only noise. We will report on a technique for considering only
the condensate near the propagation region, significantly reducing the
statistical error.
