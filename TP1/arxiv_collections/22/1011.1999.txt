Existing state-wide data bases on prosecutors' decisions about juvenile
offenders are important, yet often un-explored resources for understanding
changes in patterns of judicial decisions over time. We investigate the extent
and nature of change in judicial behavior toward juveniles following the
enactment of a new set of mandatory registration policies between 1992 and 1996
via analyzing the data on prosecutors' decisions of moving forward for youths
repeatedly charged with sexual violence in South Carolina. To analyze this
longitudinal binary data, we use a random effects logistic regression model via
incorporating an unknown change-point year. For convenient physical
interpretation, our models allow the proportional odds interpretation of
effects of the explanatory variables and the change-point year with and without
conditioning on the youth-specific random effects. As a consequence, the
effects of the unknown change-point year and other factors can be interpreted
as changes in both within youth and population averaged odds of moving forward.
Using a Bayesian paradigm, we consider various prior opinions about the unknown
year of the change in the pattern of prosecutors' decision. Based on the
available data, we make posteriori conclusions about whether a change-point has
occurred between 1992 and 1996 (inclusive), evaluate the degree of confidence
about the year of change-point, estimate the magnitude of the effects of the
change-point and other factors, and investigate other provocative questions
about patterns of prosecutors' decisions over time.
