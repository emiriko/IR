Physics curricula across the US fail to prepare students adequately to solve
problems, especially novel problems. A new curriculum, Matter and Interactions
(M&I), was designed to improve student learning by organizing concepts around
fundamental principles. Despite this, students taught in traditional classes
continue to outperform M&I students on force concept questions. This study
aimed to determine the underlying issues related to the performance
differential. Students from both courses solved questions from the Force
Concept Inventory (FCI) while verbally describing their reasoning. Analysis of
the transcripts revealed that M&I students failed to employ the fundamental
principles, and traditional students used simple physics facts to help identify
the correct answers. Neither of these methods would be sufficient for solving
more complex problems.
