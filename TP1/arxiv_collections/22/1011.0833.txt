An effective potential in a meson-meson system is discussed based on the
SU(3) chiral constituent quark model, and the analytic form of the potential is
explicitly given. In addition, the effective potential is employed to study the
bound state problem of \omega \phi which is related to the new resonance of
f0(1810) observed in BESII very recently.
