It is demonstrated the existence of multidimensional matter-wave solitons in
a crossed optical lattice (OL) with linear OL in the $x-$direction and
nonlinear OL (NOL) in the $y-$direction, where the NOL can be generated by a
periodic spatial modulation of the scattering length using an optically induced
Feshbach resonance. In particular, we show that such crossed linear and
nonlinear OL allows to stabilize two-dimensional (2D) solitons against decay or
collapse for both attractive and repulsive interactions. The solutions for the
soliton stability are investigated analytically, by using a multi-Gaussian
variational approach (VA), with the Vakhitov-Kolokolov (VK) necessary criterion
for stability; and numerically, by using the relaxation method and direct
numerical time integrations of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE). Very good
agreement of the results corresponding to both treatments is observed.
