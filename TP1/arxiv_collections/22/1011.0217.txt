Numerous properties of vector addition systems with states amount to checking
the (un)boundedness of some selective feature (e.g., number of reversals, run
length). Some of these features can be checked in exponential space by using
Rackoff's proof or its variants, combined with Savitch's theorem. However, the
question is still open for many others, e.g., reversal-boundedness. In the
paper, we introduce the class of generalized unboundedness properties that can
be verified in exponential space by extending Rackoff's technique, sometimes in
an unorthodox way. We obtain new optimal upper bounds, for example for
place-boundedness problem, reversal-boundedness detection (several variants
exist), strong promptness detection problem and regularity detection. Our
analysis is sufficiently refined so as we also obtain a polynomial-space bound
when the dimension is fixed.
