The correlation between multiplicities in two separated rapidity windows, the
so-called long-range correlation (LRC), is studied in the framework of the
model with independent identical emitters. It's shown that the LRC coefficient,
defined for the scaled (relative) variables, nevertheless depends on the
absolute width of the forward rapidity window and does not depend on the width
of the backward one. The dependence of the LRC coefficient on the forward
rapidity acceptance is explicitly found with only one theoretical parameter.
The preliminary comparison with ALICE 7TeV pp collisions data shows that the
multiplicity LRC in the data can be described in the framework of the suggested
approach.
