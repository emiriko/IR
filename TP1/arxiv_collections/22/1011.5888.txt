We study the thermal distribution of phonons in a graphene sheet. Due to the
two electronic bands there are two out-of-plane phonon modes with respect to
the two sublattices. One of these modes undergoes an Ising transition by
spontaneously breaking the sublattice symmetry. We calculate the critical
point, the renormalization of the phonon frequency and the average lattice
distortion. This transition might be observable in Raman scattering and in
transport properties.
