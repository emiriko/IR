This paper studies geometrical structure of the manifold of escort
probability distributions and shows its new applicability to information
science. In order to realize escort probabilities we use a conformal
transformation that flattens so-called alpha-geometry of the space of discrete
probability distributions, which well characterizes nonadditive statistics on
the space. As a result escort probabilities are proved to be flat coordinates
of the usual probabilities for the derived dually flat structure. Finally, we
demonstrate that escort probabilities with the new structure admits a simple
algorithm to compute Voronoi diagrams and centroids with respect to
alpha-divergences.
