Lurie's representability theorem gives necessary and sufficient conditions
for a functor to be an almost finitely presented derived geometric stack. We
establish several variants of Lurie's theorem, making the hypotheses easier to
verify for many applications. Provided a derived analogue of Schlessinger's
condition holds, the theorem reduces to verifying conditions on the underived
part and on cohomology groups. Another simplification is that functors need
only be defined on nilpotent extensions of discrete rings. Finally, there is a
pre-representability theorem, which can be applied to associate explicit
geometric stacks to dg-manifolds and related objects.
