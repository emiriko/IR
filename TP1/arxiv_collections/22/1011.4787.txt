Molecular dynamics simulations are used to study the phase behavior of linear
multiblock copolymers with two types of monomers, A and B, where the length of
the polymer blocks $N_{A}$ and $N_{B}$ ($N_{A}=N_{B}=N$), the number of the
blocks $n_{A}$ and $n_{B}$ ($n_{A}=n_{B}=n$), and the solvent quality varies.
The fraction $f$ of A-type monomers is kept constant and equal to 0.5. Whereas
at high enough temperatures these macromolecules form coil structures, where
each block A or B forms rather individual clusters, at low enough temperatures
A and B monomers from different blocks can join together forming clusters of A
or B monomers. The dependence of the formation of these clusters on the varied
parameters is discussed in detail, providing a full understanding of the phase
behavior of linear multiblock copolymers, at least for this symmetrical case.
