We characterize the infall rate onto protostellar systems forming in
self-gravitating radiation-hydrodynamic simulations. Using two dimensionless
parameters to determine disks' susceptability to gravitational fragmentation,
we infer limits on protostellar system multiplicity and the mechanism of binary
formation. We show that these parameters give robust predictions even in the
case of marginally resolved protostellar disks. We find that protostellar
systems with radiation feedback predominately form binaries via turbulent
fragmentation, not disk instability, and we predict turbulent fragmentation is
the dominant channel for binary formation for low-mass stars. We clearly
demonstrate that systems forming in simulations including radiative feedback
have fundamentally different parameters than those in purely hydrodynamic
simulations.
