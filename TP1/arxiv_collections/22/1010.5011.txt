We study the 6-vertex model with fixed boundary conditions. In the
thermodynamical limit there is a formation of the limit shape. We collect most
of the known results about the analytical properties of the free energy of the
model as the function of electric fields and study the asymptotical behavior
near singularities. We also study the asymptotic of limit shapes and the
structure of correlation functions in the bulk.
