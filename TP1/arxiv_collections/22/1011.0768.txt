Neutrinos coupled to an underlying scalar field in the scenario for
unification of mass varying dark matter and cosmon-{\em like} dark energy is
examined. In the presence of a tiny component of mass varying neutrinos, the
conditions for the present cosmic acceleration and for the stability issue are
reproduced. It is assumed that {\em sterile} neutrinos behave like mass varying
dark matter coupled to mass varying {\em active} neutrinos through the {\em
seesaw} mechanism, in a kind of {\em mixed} dark matter sector. The crucial
point is that the dark matter mass may also exhibit a dynamical behavior driven
by the scalar field. The scalar field mediates the nontrivial coupling between
the mixed dark matter and the dark energy responsible for the accelerated
expansion of the universe. The equation of state of perturbations reproduce the
generalized Chaplygin gas (GCG) cosmology so that all the effective results
from the GCG paradigm are maintained, being perturbatively modified by
neutrinos.
