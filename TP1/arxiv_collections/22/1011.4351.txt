Using a weak convergence approach, we prove a LPD for the solution of 2D
stochastic Navier Stokes equations when the viscosity converges to 0 and the
noise intensity is multiplied by the square root of the viscosity. Unlike
previous results on LDP for hydrodynamical models, the weak convergence is
proven by tightness properties of the distribution of the solution in
appropriate functional spaces.
