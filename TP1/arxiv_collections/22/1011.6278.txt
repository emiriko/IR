We search for resonant WW or WZ production using up to 5.4 fb-1 of integrated
luminosity collected by the D0 experiment in Run II of the Fermilab Tevatron
Collider. The data are consistent with the standard model background
expectation, and we set limits on a resonance mass using the sequential
standard model (SSM) W' boson and the Randall-Sundrum model graviton G as
benchmarks. We exclude an SSM W' boson in the mass range 180 - 690 GeV and a
Randall-Sundrum graviton in the range 300 - 754 GeV at 95% CL.
