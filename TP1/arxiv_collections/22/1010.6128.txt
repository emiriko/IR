The advent of large cosmological sky surveys - ushering in the era of
precision cosmology - has been accompanied by ever larger cosmological
simulations. The analysis of these simulations, which currently encompass tens
of billions of particles and up to trillion particles in the near future, is
often as daunting as carrying out the simulations in the first place.
Therefore, the development of very efficient analysis tools combining
qualitative and quantitative capabilities is a matter of some urgency. In this
paper we introduce new analysis features implemented within ParaView, a
parallel, open-source visualization toolkit, to analyze large N-body
simulations. The new features include particle readers and a very efficient
halo finder which identifies friends-of-friends halos and determines common
halo properties. In combination with many other functionalities already
existing within ParaView, such as histogram routines or interfaces to Python,
this enhanced version enables fast, interactive, and convenient analyses of
large cosmological simulations. In addition, development paths are available
for future extensions.
