The thourough investigation of radiative corrections allows to gain
information on physics processes at higher energy scales than those directly
accessible by current experiments. As a consequence, using electroweak
precision measurements in conjunction with state-of-the-art SM predictions e.g.
allows the estimation of a preferred mass range for the SM Higgs boson mass.
Physics beyond the Standard Model can modify the relations between electroweak
observables and their theoretical predictions. Such effects can be parametrized
in terms of effective, so-called oblique parameters. A global fit of the
electroweak SM, as performed with the Gfitter package, allows the determination
of the oblique parameters and to probe physics models and to set constraints on
their free parameters. In this paper we present updated results of the global
electroweak SM fit taking into account the latest experimental precision
measurements and the results of direct Higgs searches from LEP and Tevatron.
Through the formalism of oblique parameters we obtain constraints on BSM models
with universal and warped extra dimensions. In constrast, taking into account
heavy flavor observables, (g-2), and dark matter predictions allows to
constrain the parameter space of the minimal supergravity model (mSugra).
