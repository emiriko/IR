Cosmic ray antiprotons provide an important probe for the study of cosmic ray
propagation in the interstellar space and to investigate the existence of
Galactic dark matter. The ARGO-YBJ experiment is observing the Moon shadow with
high statistical significance at an energy threshold of a few hundred GeV.
Using all the data collected until November 2009, we set two upper limits on
the antip/p flux ratio: 5% at an energy of 1.4 TeV and 6% at 5 TeV with a
confidence level of 90%. In the few-TeV range the ARGO-YBJ results are the
lowest available, useful to constrain models for antiproton production in
antimatter domains.
