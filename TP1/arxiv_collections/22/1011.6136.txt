The concept of a carrying capacity is essential in most models to prevent
unlimited growth. Despite the large amount of deaths it introduces, the actual
influence of the Verhulst term in simulations is often times not accounted for.
Generally, it is treated merely as a scaling parameter that functions to keep
simulated populations within computer limits. Here, we compare two different
implementations of the concept in the Penna model - Vehulst applied to all
individuals (VA) and to newborns only (VB). We observe variations in certain
model features when random Verhulst deaths are restricted to a single age
group.
