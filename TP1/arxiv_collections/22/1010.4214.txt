It was recently argued by Hooper and Goodenough [arXiv:1010.2752] that the
excess gamma ray emission from within 1-2 degrees of the galactic center can be
well-described by annihilation of ~8 GeV dark matter particles into tau pairs.
I show that such a dark matter signal can be obtained naturally in the
lepton-specific two-Higgs-doublet model extended by a stable singlet scalar
dark matter candidate. The favored parameter region prefers a light Higgs state
(below 200 GeV) with enhanced couplings to leptons and sizable invisible
branching fraction. Part of the favored region leads to invisible decays of
both of the CP-even neutral Higgs states.
