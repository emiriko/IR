We establish a classification of decision problems that are to be solved by
mobile agents operating in unlabeled graphs, using a deterministic protocol.
The classification is with respect to the ability of a team of agents to solve
the problem, possibly with the aid of additional information. In particular,
our focus is on studying differences between the decidability of a decision
problem by agents and its verifiability when a certificate for a positive
answer is provided to the agents. We show that the class MAV of mobile agents
verifiable problems is much wider than the class MAD of mobile agents decidable
problems. Our main result shows that there exist natural MAV-complete problems:
the most difficult problems in this class, to which all problems in MAV are
reducible. Our construction of a MAV-complete problem involves two main
ingredients in mobile agents computability: the topology of the quotient graph
and the number of operating agents. Beyond the class MAV we show that, for a
single agent, three natural oracles yield a strictly increasing chain of
relative decidability classes.
