Probing the $\bar ss$ content of the $\eta$ and $\eta'$ mesons and
considering mixing between these states as well as gluonic contributions, the
form factors responsible for semileptonic $D_s \to (\eta, \eta') l \nu$
transitions are calculated via light cone QCD sum rules. Corresponding
branching fractions and their ratio for different mixing angles are also
obtained. Our results are in a good consistency with experimental data as well
as predictions of other nonperturbative approaches.
