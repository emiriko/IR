For the observation of Bose-Einstein condensation, excitons in cuprous oxide
are regarded as promising candidates due to their large binding energy and long
lifetime. High particle densities may be achieved by entrapment in a stress
induced potential. We consider a multi-component gas of interacting para- and
orthoexcitons in cuprous oxide confined in a three-dimensional potential trap.
Based on the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov theory, we calculate density profiles as
well as decay luminescence spectra which exhibit signatures of the separation
of the Bose-condensed phases.
