For any n>1 we give an explicit example of an n-axially symmetric Cartesian
current in B^3 x S^2 with non-trivial vertical part and non-constant graph part
minimizing the relaxed Dirichlet energy among the n-axially symmetric Cartesian
currents with the same boundary. This stands in sharp contrast with a results
of Hardt, Lin and Poon for the case n=1.
