The intensity distribution of electromagnetic polar waves in a chain of
near-resonant weakly-coupled scatterers is investigated theoretically and
supported by a numerical analysis. Critical scaling behavior is discovered for
part of the eigenvalue spectrum due to the disorder-induced Anderson
transition. This localization transition (in a formally one-dimensional system)
is attributed to the long-range dipole-dipole interaction, which decays inverse
linearly with distance for polarization perpendicular to the chain. For
polarization parallel to the chain, with inverse squared long range coupling,
all eigenmodes are shown to be localized. A comparison with the results for
Hermitian power-law random banded matrices and other intermediate models is
presented. This comparison reveals the significance of non-Hermiticity of the
model and the periodic modulation of the coupling.
