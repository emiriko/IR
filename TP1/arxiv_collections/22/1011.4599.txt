Large area arrays of through-thickness nanoscale pores have been milled into
superconducting Nb thin films via a process utilizing anodized aluminum oxide
thin film templates. These pores act as artificial flux pinning centers,
increasing the superconducting critical current, Jc, of the Nb films. By
optimizing the process conditions including anodization time, pore size and
milling time, Jc values approaching and in some cases matching the
Ginzburg-Landau depairing current of 30 MA/cm^2 at 5 K have been achieved - a
Jc enhancement over as-deposited films of more than 50 times. In the field
dependence of Jc, a matching field corresponding to the areal pore density has
also been clearly observed. The effect of back-filling the pores with magnetic
material has then been investigated. While back-filling with Co has been
successfully achieved, the effect of the magnetic material on Jc has been found
to be largely detrimental compared to voids, although a distinct influence of
the magnetic material in producing a hysteretic Jc versus applied field
behavior has been observed. This behavior has been tested for compatibility
with currently proposed models of magnetic pinning and found to be most closely
explained by a model describing the magnetic attraction between the flux
vortices and the magnetic inclusions.
