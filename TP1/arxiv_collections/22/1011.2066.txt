Recurrence of a random walk is described by the Polya number. For quantum
walks, recurrence is understood as the return of the walker to the origin,
rather than the full-revival of its quantum state. Localization for two
dimensional quantum walks is known to exist in the sense of non-vanishing
probability distribution in the asymptotic limit. We show on the example of the
2-D Grover walk that one can exploit the effect of localization to construct
stationary solutions. Moreover, we find full-revivals of a quantum state with a
period of two steps. We prove that there cannot be longer cycles for a
four-state quantum walk. Stationary states and revivals result from
interference which has no counterpart in classical random walks.
