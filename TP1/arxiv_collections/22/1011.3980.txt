We present the results of $WBVR$ observations of the low-mass X-ray binary
V1341 $\textrm{Cyg} = \textrm{Cyg}$ X--2. Our observations include a total of
2375 individual measurements in four bands on 478 nights in 1986-1992. We tied
the comparison and check stars used for the binary to the $WBVR$ catalog using
their $JHK$ magnitudes. The uncertainty of this procedure was 3$%$ in the $B$
and $V$ bands and 8%-10% for the $W$ and $R$ bands. In quiescence, the
amplitude of the periodic component in the binary's $B$ brightness variations
is within $0.265^{m}{-}0.278^{m}$ ($0.290^{m}{-}0.320^{m}$ in $W$); this is due
to the ellipsoidal shape of the optical component, which is distorted with
gravitational forces from the X-ray component. Some of the system's active
states (long flares) may be due to instabilities in the accretion disk, and
possibly to instabilities of gas flows and other accretion structures. The
binary possesses a low-luminosity accretion disk. The light curves reveal no
indications of an eclipse near the phases of the upper and lower conjunctions
in quiescence or in active states during the observed intervals. We conclude
that the optical star in the close binary V1341 $\textrm{Cyg} = \textrm{Cyg}$
X-2 is a red giant rather than a blue straggler. We studied the long-term
variability of the binary during the seven years covered by our observations.
The optical observations presented in this study are compared to X-ray data
from the Ginga observatory for the same time intervals.
