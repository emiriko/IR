In this paper changes in wind speed and wind direction from a measured wind
field are being analyzed at high frequencies. This is used to estimate changes
in the angle of attack (AOA) on a blade segment over short time periods for
different estimated turbine concepts. Here a statistical approach is chosen to
grasp the characteristics of the probability distributions to give an over all
view of the magnitude and rate of the changes. The main interest is the
generation of basic distributions for the calculation of dynamic stall effects
and stall flutter due to wind fluctuations.
