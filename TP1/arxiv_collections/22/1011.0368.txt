A general framework for goal-oriented a posteriori error estimation for
finite volume methods is presented. The framework does not rely on recasting
finite volume methods as special cases of finite element methods, but instead
directly determines error estimators from the discretized finite volume
equations. Thus, the framework can be ap- plied to arbitrary finite volume
methods. It also provides the proper functional settings to address
well-posedness issues for the primal and adjoint problems. Numerical results
are presented to illustrate the validity and effectiveness of the a posteriori
error estimates and their applicability to adaptive mesh refinement.
