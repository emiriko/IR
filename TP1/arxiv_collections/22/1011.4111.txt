The solutional origin of limestone caves was recognized over a century ago,
but the short penetration length of an undersaturated solution made it seem
impossible for long conduits to develop. This is contradicted by field
observations, where extended conduits, sometimes several kilometers long, are
found in karst environments. However, a sharp drop in the dissolution rate of
CaCO_3 near saturation provides a mechanism for much deeper penetration of
reactant. The notion of a "kinetic trigger" - a sudden change in rate constant
over a narrow concentration range - has become a widely accepted paradigm in
speleogenesis modeling. However, it is based on one-dimensional models for the
fluid and solute transport inside the fracture, assuming that the dissolution
front is planar in the direction perpendicular to the flow. Here we show that
this assumption is incorrect; a planar dissolution front in an entirely uniform
fracture is unstable to infinitesimal perturbations and inevitably breaks up
into highly localized regions of dissolution. This provides an alternative
mechanism for cave formation, even in the absence of a kinetic trigger. Our
results suggest that there is an inherent wavelength to the erosion pattern in
dissolving fractures, which depends on the reaction rate and flow rate, but is
independent of the initial roughness. In contrast to one-dimensional models,
two-dimensional simulations indicate that there is only a weak dependence of
the breakthrough time on kinetic order; localization of the flow tends to keep
the undersaturation in the dissolution front above the threshold for non-linear
kinetics.
