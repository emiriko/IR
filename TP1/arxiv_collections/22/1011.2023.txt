We prove some de Rham theorems on bounded subanalytic submanifolds of $\R^n$
(not necessarily compact). We show that the $L^1$ cohomology of such a
submanifold is isomorphic to its singular homology. In the case where the
closure of the underlying manifold has only isolated singularities this implies
that the $L^1$ cohomology is Poincar\'e dual to $L^\infty$ cohomology (in
dimension $j <m-1$). In general,
  Poincar\'e duality is related to the so-called $L^1$ Stokes' Property. For
oriented manifolds, we show that the $L^1$ Stokes' property holds if and only
if integration realizes a nondegenerate pairing between $L^1$ and $L^\infty$
forms. This is the counterpart of a theorem proved by Cheeger on $L^2$ forms.
