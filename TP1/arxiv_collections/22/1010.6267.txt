Puzzled by the indication of a new critical theory for the spin-1/2
Heisenberg model with a spatially staggered anisotropy on the square lattice as
suggested in \cite{Wenzel08}, we re-investigate the phase transition of this
model induced by dimerization using first principle Monte Carlo simulations. We
focus on studying the finite-size scaling of $\rho_{s1} L$ and $\rho_{s2} L$,
where $L$ stands for the spatial box size used in the simulations and
$\rho_{si}$ with $i \in \{1,2\}$ is the spin-stiffness in $i$-direction. From
our Monte Carlo data, we find that $\rho_{s2} L$ suffers a much less severe
correction compared to that of $\rho_{s1} L$. Therefore $\rho_{s2} L$ is a
better quantity than $\rho_{s1} L$ for finite-size scaling analysis concerning
the limitation of the availability of large volumes data in our study. Further,
motivated by the so-called cubical regime in magnon chiral perturbation theory,
we additionally perform a finite-size scaling analysis on our Monte Carlo data
with the assumption that the ratio of spatial winding numbers squared is fixed
through all simulations. As a result, the physical shape of the system remains
fixed in our calculations. The validity of this new idea is confirmed by
studying the phase transition driven by spatial anisotropy for the ladder
anisotropic Heisenberg model. With this new strategy, even from $\rho_{s1} L$
which receives the most serious correction among the observables considered in
this study, we arrive at a value for the critical exponent $\nu$ which is
consistent with the expected $O(3)$ value by using only up to $L = 64$ data
points.
