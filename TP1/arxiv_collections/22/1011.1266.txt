We investigate AdS$_3$ and AdS$_2$ magnetic brane solutions within the
consistent truncation of AdS$_5 \times S^5$ supergravity. The AdS$_3$ solution
extends earlier work by allowing a general embedding of the magnetic $U(1)$ in
$SO(6)$. We determine the ratio of strong- and weak-coupling entropies as a
function of this embedding. Further, by considering crossed magnetic fields in
different $U(1)$'s we are able to construct a solution that runs from AdS$_5$
in the UV to AdS$_2 \times R^3$ in the IR. We find the notable result that
there is a zero temperature entropy at strong coupling but not at weak
coupling. We also show that the AdS$_2$ solution and at least some of the
AdS$_3$ solutions are stable within the truncation.
