The effect of the light group velocity reduction in dielectric Bragg
reflection waveguide structures (SiO$_2$/TiO$_2$) in the vicinity of the cutoff
frequency is studied experimentally. The effect of anti-mirror reflection,
specific for the Bragg reflection waveguides, is described and employed for
detection of "slow light". The experiments were performed with the use of the
Ti:sapphire laser pulses ~ 100 fs in length. The group index $n_g \sim$ 30 with
a fractional pulse delay (normalized to the pulse width) of $\sim$ 10 is
demonstrated. The problems and prospects of implementation of the slow-light
devices based on the Bragg reflection waveguide structures are discussed.
