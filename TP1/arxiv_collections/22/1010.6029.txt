We construct the smallest possible self contained heat engines; one composed
of only two qubits, the other of only a single qutrit. The engines are
self-contained as they do not require external sources of work and/or control.
They are able to produce work which is used to continuously lift a weight.
Despite the dimension of the engine being small, it is still able to operate at
the Carnot efficiency.
