We use chirally motivated effective meson-baryon potentials to describe the
low energy $\bar{K}N$ data including the characteristics of kaonic hydrogen.
Our results are examined in comparison with other approaches based on the
unitarity and dispersion relation for the inverse of the T-matrix. We
demonstrate that the movements of the poles generated by the model upon varying
the model parameters can serve as a tool to get additional insights on the
dynamics of the strongly coupled $\pi\Sigma$-$\bar{K}N$ system.
