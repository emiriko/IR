Semiclassical Gaussian approximations to the Boltzmann operator have become
an important tool for the investigation of thermodynamic properties of clusters
of atoms at low temperatures. Usually, numerically expensive thawed Gaussian
variants are applied. In this article, we introduce a numerically much cheaper
frozen Gaussian approximation to the imaginary time propagator with a width
matrix especially suited for the dynamics of clusters. The quality of the
results is comparable to that of thawed Gaussian methods based on the
single-particle ansatz. We apply the method to the argon trimer and investigate
the dissociation process of the cluster. The results clearly show a
classical-like transition from a bounded moiety to three free particles at a
temperature T ~ 20 K, whereas previous studies of the system were not able to
resolve this transition. Quantum effects, i.e., differences with the purely
classical case manifest themselves in the low-temperature behavior of the mean
energy and specific heat as well as in a slight shift of the transition
temperature. We also discuss the influence of an artificial confinement of the
atoms usually introduced to converge numerical computations. The results show
that restrictive confinements often implemented in studies of clusters can
influence the thermodynamic properties drastically. This finding may have
implications on other studies of atomic clusters.
