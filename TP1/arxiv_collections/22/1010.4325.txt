We investigate theoretically the transfer of excitation along a one
dimensional chain of monomers for a situation in which initially the excitation
is shared coherently by two monomers. We show that depending on the relative
phase between the two monomers strong directionality of the energy transfer is
possible. It is also investigated how dephasing, induced by an environment,
influences this directed transport.
