Evolution of grain mantles in various interstellar environment is studied. We
concentrate mainly on water, methanol, carbon di-oxide, which constitute nearly
90% of the grain mantle. We investigate how the production rates of these
molecules depend on the relative gas phase abundances of oxygen and carbon
monoxide and constrain the relevant parameter space which reproduces these
molecules closed to the observed abundances. Allowing to accrete only H, O and
CO on the grains and using the Monte-Carlo method we follow the chemical
processes for a few million years. We allow formation of multi-layers on the
grains and incorporate the freeze-out effects of accreting O and CO. We find
that the formation of these molecules depends on the initial conditions as well
as the average cloud density. Specifically, when the number density of
accreting O is less than 3 times more than that of CO, methanol is always
over-produced. Using available reaction pathways it appears to be difficult to
match the exact observed abundances of all the three molecules simultaneously.
Only in a narrow region of parameter space all these three molecules are
produced within the observed limit. In addition to this, we found that the
incorporation of the freeze-outs of O and CO leads to almost steady state on
the grain surface. The mantle thickness grows anywhere between 60 to 500 layers
in a period of two million years. In addition, we consider a case where the gas
number density changes with time due to gradual collapse of the molecular cloud
and present the evolution of composition of different species as a function of
radius of the collapsing cloud.
