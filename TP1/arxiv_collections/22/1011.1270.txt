We propose a mechanism of 'beaming' the backreaction of a relativistic source
in the bulk of AdS towards the boundary. Using this beaming mechanism to
estimate the energy distribution from radiation by a circling quark in strongly
coupled field theory, we find remarkable agreement with the previous results of
arXiv:1001.3880. Apart from explaining a puzzling feature of these results and
elucidating the scale/radius duality in AdS/CFT, our proposal provides a useful
computational technique.
