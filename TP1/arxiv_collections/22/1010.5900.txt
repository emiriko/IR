This paper studies theoretically the ultraslow light phenomenon in
Bose-Einstein condensates of alkali-metal atoms. The description is based on
the linear approach that is developed in the framework of the Green function
formalism. It is pointed out that the group velocity of light pulses that are
tuned up close to resonant lines of the alkali atoms' spectrum may strongly
depend on the intensity of the external static magnetic field. The possibility
of filtering optical pulses using the ultraslow light phenomenon in Bose
condensates is discussed.
