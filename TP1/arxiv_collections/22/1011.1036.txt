Craig interpolation has emerged as an effective means of generating candidate
program invariants. We present interpolation procedures for the theories of
Presburger arithmetic combined with (i) uninterpreted predicates (QPA+UP), (ii)
uninterpreted functions (QPA+UF) and (iii) extensional arrays (QPA+AR). We
prove that none of these combinations can be effectively interpolated without
the use of quantifiers, even if the input formulae are quantifier-free. We go
on to identify fragments of QPA+UP and QPA+UF with restricted forms of guarded
quantification that are closed under interpolation. Formulae in these fragments
can easily be mapped to quantifier-free expressions with integer division. For
QPA+AR, we formulate a sound interpolation procedure that potentially produces
interpolants with unrestricted quantifiers.
