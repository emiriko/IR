Neutrino oscillations are studied employing sources of low energy
monoenergetic neutrinos following electron capture by the nucleus and measuring
electron recoils. Since the neutrino energy is very low the oscillation length
appearing in this electronic neutrino disappearance experiment can be so small
that the full oscillation can take place inside the detector. Thus one may
determine very accurately all the neutrino oscillation parameters. In
particular one can measure or set a better limit on the unknown parameter
theta13. One, however, has to pay the price that the expected counting rates
are very small. Thus one needs a very intensive neutrino source and a large
detector with as low as possible energy threshold and high energy and position
resolution. Both spherical gaseous and cylindrical liquid detectors are
studied. Different source candidates are considered
