Using scanning tunneling microscopy, we have imaged local charge density
fluctuations in monolayer graphene. By placing a small gold nanoparticle on the
end of the STM tip, a charge sensor is created. By raster scanning the tip over
the surface and using Coulomb blockade spectroscopy, we map the local charge on
the graphene. We observe a series of electron and hole doped puddles with a
characteristic length scale of about 20 nm. Theoretical calculations for the
correlation length of the puddles based on the number of impurities are in
agreement with our measurements.
