Spherical manifolds yield cosmic spaces with positive curvature. They result
by closing pieces from the sphere used by Einstein for his initial cosmology.
Harmonic analysis on the manifolds aims at explaining the observed low
amplitudes at small multipole orders of the cosmic microwave background. We
analyze assumptions of point symmetry and randomness for spherical spaces.
There emerge four spaces named orbifolds, with low volume fraction from the
sphere and sharp multipole selection rules in their eigenmodes.
