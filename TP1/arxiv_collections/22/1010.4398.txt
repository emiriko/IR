We present an analysis of the magnetic field distribution in the Abrikosov
lattice of high-$\kappa$ superconductors with singlet pairing in the case where
the critical field is mainly determined by the Pauli limit and the superfluid
currents partly come from the paramagnetic interaction of electron spins with
the local magnetic field. The derivation is performed in the frame of the
generalized Clem variational method which is valid not too close to the
critical field and furthermore with the Abrikosov type theory in the vicinity
of it. The found vortex lattice form factor increases with increasing field and
then falls down at approach of the upper critical field where the
superconducting state is suppressed.
