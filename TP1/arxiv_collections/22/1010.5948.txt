A combination of x-ray diffraction, magnetization, and 75As nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) experiments were performed on single-crystal EuFe1.9Co0.1As2.
The strength of the hyperfine interaction between the 75As nuclei and the
Eu^(2+) 4f states suggests a strong coupling between the Eu^(2+) moments and
the Fe1.9Co0.1As2 layers. Such a strong interlayer coupling may be due to an
indirect exchange interaction between the localized Eu^(2+) 4f moments,
mediated by the Fe 3d conduction electrons. Magnetic susceptibility as well as
75As-NMR measurements reveal a decrease of the SDW transition temperature to
T_SDW = 120 K as a result of Co doping. A change of the slope in the
temperature dependence of the NMR frequency of the 75As lower-satellite line
was observed at 225 K. At the same temperature also a change of the satellite
line shape was found. These changes of the NMR spectra may be caused by the
formation of a nematic phase below 225 K in EuFe1.9Co0.1As2.
