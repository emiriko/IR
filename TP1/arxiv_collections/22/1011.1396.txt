A. Dzhumadil'daev classified all irreducible finite dimensional
representations of the simple n-Lie algebra. Using a slightly different
approach, we obtain in this paper a complete classification of all irreducible,
highest weight modules, including the infinite-dimensional ones. As a corollary
we find all primitive ideals of the universal enveloping algebra of this simple
n-Lie algebra.
