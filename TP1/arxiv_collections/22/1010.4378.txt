We propose a polarization modulation scheme of electromagnetic (EM) waves
through reflection of a tunable metamaterial reflector/absorber. By
constructing the metamaterial with resonant unit cells coupled by diodes, we
demonstrate that the EM reflections for orthogonal polarized incident waves can
be tuned independently by adjusting the bias voltages on the corresponding
diodes. Owing to this feature, the reflected EM waves can be electrically
controlled to a linear polarization with continuously tunable azimuth angle
from 0o to 90o at the resonant frequency, or an elliptical polarization with
tunable azimuth angle of the major axis when off the resonant frequency. The
proposed property has been verified through both numerical simulations and
experimental measurements at microwave band, which enables us to electrically
modulate the polarization state of EM waves flexibly.
