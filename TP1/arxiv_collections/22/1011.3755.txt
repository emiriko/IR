We study the infrared (long distance) behavior of the free photon field in de
Sitter spacetime. Using a two-parameter family of gauge fixing terms, we show
that the infrared (IR) behavior of the two-point function is highly
gauge-dependent and ranges from vanishing to growing. This situation is in
disagreement with its counterpart in flat spacetime, where the two-point
function vanishes in the IR for any choice of the gauge fixing parameters. A
criterion to isolate the "physical" part of the two-point function is given and
is shown to lead to a well-behaved two-point function in the IR.
