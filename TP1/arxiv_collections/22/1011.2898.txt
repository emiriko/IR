Unit resolution can simplify a CNF formula or detect an inconsistency by
repeatedly assign the variables occurring in unit clauses. Given any CNF
formula sigma, we show that there exists a satisfiable CNF formula psi with
size polynomially related to the size of sigma such that applying unit
resolution to psi simulates all the effects of applying it to sigma. The
formula psi is said to be the reified counterpart of sigma. This approach can
be used to prove that the failed literal rule, which is an inference rule used
by some SAT solvers, can be entirely simulated by unit resolution. More
generally, it sheds new light on the expressive power of unit resolution.
