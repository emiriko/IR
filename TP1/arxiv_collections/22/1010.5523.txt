We present an efficient local hybrid Monte-Carlo algorithm to investigate
G(2) gluodynamics with and without Higgs field in 3 and 4 dimensions.
Additionaly we implemented a modified version of the multi-level
L\"uscher-Weisz algorithm with exponential error reduction to measure
expectation values of Wilson and Polyakov loops. In three dimensions we show
that at intermediate scales the potential between static charges in the eight
lowest-dimensional representations of G(2) scale with the eigenvalues of the
quadratic Casimir operator. For the fundamental representations we detect
string breaking for larger separations of the charges at precisely the scale
predicted by the mass of the created pair of glue-lumps. In four dimensions we
explored the phase diagram of the G(2) Gauge Higgs model showing that a line of
first order confinement-deconfinement phase transitions connects G(2) and SU(3)
gluodynamics and a line of second order phase transitions separates the two
deconfinement phases.
