We give a simple proof of a result originally due to Dimca and Suciu: a group
that is both Kaehler and the fundamental group of a closed three-manifold is
finite. We also prove that a group that is both the fundamental group of a
closed three-manifold and of a non-Kaehler compact complex surface is infinite
cyclic or the direct product of an infinite cyclic group and a group of order
two.
