Permutation-symmetric quantum states appear in a variety of physical
situations, and they have been proposed for quantum information tasks. This
article builds upon the results of [New J. Phys. 12, 073025 (2010)], where the
maximally entangled symmetric states of up to twelve qubits were explored, and
their amount of geometric entanglement determined by numeric and analytic
means. For this the Majorana representation, a generalization of the Bloch
sphere representation, can be employed to represent symmetric n qubit states by
n points on the surface of a unit sphere. Symmetries of this point distribution
simplify the determination of the entanglement, and enable the study of quantum
states in novel ways. Here it is shown that the duality relationship of
Platonic solids has a counterpart in the Majorana representation, and that in
general maximally entangled symmetric states neither correspond to anticoherent
spin states nor to spherical designs. The usability of symmetric states as
resources for measurement-based quantum computing is also discussed.
