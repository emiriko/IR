A central question in our understanding of the physical world is how our
knowledge of the whole relates to our knowledge of the individual parts. One
aspect of this question is the following: to what extent does ignorance about a
whole preclude knowledge of at least one of its parts? Relying purely on
classical intuition, one would certainly be inclined to conjecture that a
strong ignorance of the whole cannot come without significant ignorance of at
least one of its parts. Indeed, we show that this reasoning holds in any
non-contextual hidden variable model (NC-HV). Curiously, however, such a
conjecture is \emph{false} in quantum theory: we provide an explicit example
where a large ignorance about the whole can coexist with an almost perfect
knowledge of each of its parts. More specifically, we provide a simple
information-theoretic inequality satisfied in any NC-HV, but which can be
\emph{arbitrarily} violated by quantum mechanics. Our inequality has
interesting implications for quantum cryptography.
