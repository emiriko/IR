We introduce several notions of `random fewnomials', i.e. random polynomials
with a fixed number f of monomials of degree N. The f exponents are chosen at
random and then the coefficients are chosen to be Gaussian random, mainly from
the SU(m + 1) ensemble. The results give limiting formulas as N goes to
infinity for the expected distribution of complex zeros of a system of k random
fewnomials in m variables. When k = m, for SU(m + 1) polynomials, the limit is
the Monge-Ampere measure of a toric Kaehler potential on CP^m obtained by
averaging a `discrete Legendre transform' of the Fubini-Study symplectic
potential at f points of the unit simplex in R^m.
