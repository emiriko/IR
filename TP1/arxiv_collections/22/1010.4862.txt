We describe an explicit crystal morphism between Nakajima monomials and
monomials which give a realization of crystal bases for finite dimensional
irreducible modules over the quantized enveloping algebra for Lie algebras of
type A and C. This morphism provides a connection between arbitrary Nakajima
monomials and Nakashima Kashiwara tableaux. This yields a translation of
Nakajima monomials to the Littelmann path model. Furthermore, as an application
of our results we describe an insertion scheme for Nakajima monomials
compatible to the insertion scheme for tableaux.
