We study fundamental string (F-string) dynamics near D5-brane in some limits.
We find that when the angular momentum of the probe is proportional to string
length (l_s) and square root of string coupling constant {g_s}, the F-string
lies in its metastable orbit at a finite distance from D5-branes. We further
study the metastable orbits of a M2-brane in M5-brane background.
