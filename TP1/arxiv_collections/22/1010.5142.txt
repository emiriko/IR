The aim of this paper is in stimulating the use of satellite imagery, in
particular the free service of Google Maps, to investigate the distribution of
the agricultural technique of terraced hills in Andean countries, near Titicaca
Lake. In fact, satellite maps can give a clear view of the overall surface
modified by human work, being then a precious help for on-site archaeological
researches and for historical analysis. Satellite imagery is also able to give
the distribution of burial and worship places. The paper discusses some
examples near the Titicaca Lake.
