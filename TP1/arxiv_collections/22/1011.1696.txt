On the basis of our recent modifications of the Dirac formalism we generalize
the Bargmann-Wigner formalism for higher spins to be compatible with other
formalisms for bosons. Relations with dual electrodynamics, with the
Ogievetskii-Polubarinov notoph and the Weinberg 2(2S+1) theory are found. Next,
we proceed to derive the equations for the symmetric tensor of the second rank
on the basis of the Bargmann-Wigner formalism in a straightforward way. The
symmetric multispinor of the fourth rank is used. It is constructed out of the
Dirac 4-spinors. Due to serious problems with the interpretation of the results
obtained on using the standard procedure we generalize it and obtain the spin-2
relativistic equations, which are consistent with the previous one. We
introduce the dual analogues of the Riemann tensor and derive corresponding
dynamical equations in the Minkowski space. Relations with the Marques-Spehler
chiral gravity theory are discussed. The importance of the 4-vector field (and
its gauge part) is pointed out.
