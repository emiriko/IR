The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a kilometer-scale detector currently
under construction at the South Pole. The full detector will comprise 5,160
photomultipliers (PMTs) deployed on 86 strings from 1.45-2.45 km deep within
the ice. As of the austral summer of 2009-10, 73 out of the total number
strings have been deployed, and the detector is reaching its final construction
phase. A dense sub-array of 6 strings in the center of the detector (DeepCore)
has been already installed for enhancing the sensitivity to low energy
neutrinos. The IceCube de- tection principle is based on the measurement of the
Cherenkov light induced by ultra-relativistic muons and showers produced by
neutrino interactions in the target matter of the detector. The main scientific
goal of the IceCube experiment is the detection of astrophysical neu- trinos
that will help to understand and settle the unresolved questions about the
origin and nature of cosmic rays. In this contribution we will present the
latest results of the experiment concerning the search for neutrino point
sources using the experimental data taken during 2008- 09 where the detector
was operated with a 40-string configuration. The results of the analysis for
steady individual neutrino sources as well as the stacking analysis from
different catalogs will be presented.
