We present the first spectroscopic verification of a bona fide chemically
peculiar (CP) star in the Large Magellanic Cloud. CP stars reside on the upper
main sequence and are characterized by strong global stellar magnetic fields
with a predominant dipole component oriented at random with respect to the
stellar rotation axis and displaced from the star's centre. Overabundances with
respect to the Sun for heavy elements such as silicon, chromium, strontium and
europium are also a common phenomenon. These objects are excellent
astrophysical laboratories by which to investigate many of the processes
connected with star formation and evolution. Several studies comparing the
incidence of CP stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud with that of the Milky Way
have been published. These investigations are based on the photometric
detection of CP stars via the Delta a system which has been tested and
calibrated for objects in the Milky Way. From our spectroscopic observations
made at Las Campanas Observatory, we are able to confirm one classical B8 Si
star among the photometric sample, as well as one early B-type emission-line
star which was also initially detected by its significantly deviating Delta a
value. We conclude that classical extragalactic CP stars do exist and that the
photometric Delta a system is able to detect them in an efficient way.
