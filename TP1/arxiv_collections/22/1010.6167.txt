Single- and double-differential inclusive dijet cross sections in neutral
current deep inelastic ep scattering have been measured with the ZEUS detector
using an integrated luminosity of 374 pb^-1. The measurement was performed at
large values of the photon virtuality, Q^2, between 125 and 20000 GeV^2. The
jets were reconstructed with the k_T cluster algorithm in the Breit reference
frame and selected by requiring their transverse energies in the Breit frame,
E_T,B^jet, to be larger than 8 GeV. In addition, the invariant mass of the
dijet system, M_jj, was required to be greater than 20 GeV. The cross sections
are described by the predictions of next-to-leading-order QCD.
