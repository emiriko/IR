We demonstrate, by giving a specific example, that supersymmetry can be left
unbroken without running into conflict with observation. The key idea is to
employ a discrete form of supersymmetry. Amongst other interesting features,
this construction goes roughly half the way in removing the hierarchy between
the observed cosmological constant and the vacuum energies expected from field
theory.
