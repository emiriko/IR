Energies, wavelengths, transition probabilities, and oscillator strengths
have been calculated for the 4s24p2-4s4p3, 4s24p2-4s24p4d and 4s4p3-4p4 allowed
transitions in heavy Ge-like ions with Z=59-63. The fully relativistic
Multiconfiguration Dirac-Fock (MCDF) method taking into account both the
correlations within the n=4 complex and the quantum electrodynamic (QED)
effects have been used in the calculations. MCDFGME code is used to calculate
electron impact excitation cross sections for the 4s24p2-4s4p3 and
4s24p2-4s24p4d transitions with plane-wave Born approximation. The results of
Pr XXVIII, Nd XXIX, Pm XXX, Sm XXXI and Eu XXXII are compared with HFR method
results.
