The impact of the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope on blazar research is
reviewed. This includes a brief description of the Fermi Large Area Telescope,
a summary of the various classes of extragalactic sources found in the First
Large Area Telescope AGN Catalog, and more detailed discussion of the flat
spectrum radio quasar 3C454.3 and the BL Lac object PKS 2155-304. Some
theoretical studies related to ongoing blazar research with Fermi are
mentioned, including implications of gamma-ray observations of radio galaxies
on blazar unification scenarios, variability in colliding shells, and whether
blazars are sources of ultra-high energy cosmic rays.
