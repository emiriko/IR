A microscopic magnetic model for alpha-Cu2P2O7 is evaluated in a combined
theoretical and experimental study. Despite a dominant intradimer coupling J1,
sizable interdimer couplings enforce long-range magnetic ordering at T_N=27 K.
The spin model for alpha-Cu2P2O7 is compared to the models of the isostructural
beta-Cu2V2O7 and alpha-Cu2As2O7 systems. As a surprise, coupled dimers in
alpha-Cu2P2O7 and alternating chains in alpha-Cu2As2O7 contrast with a
honeycomb lattice in beta-Cu2V2O7. We find that the qualitative difference in
the coupling regime of these isostructural compounds is governed by the nature
of AO4 side groups: d-elements (A = V) hybridize with nearby O atoms forming a
Cu-O-A-O-Cu superexchange path, while for p-elements (A = P, As) the
superexchange is realized via O-O edges of the tetrahedron. Implications for a
broad range of systems are discussed.
