To characterize the magnetic field structure of the outflow and core region
within a prototypical high-mass star-forming region, we analyzed polarized
CO(3-2) - for the first time observed with the Submillimeter Array -- as well
as 880mum submm continuum emission from the high-mass outflow/disk system
IRAS18089-1732. Both emission features with polarization degrees at a few
percent level indicate that the magnetic field structure is largely aligned
with the outflow/jet orientation from the small core scales to the larger
outflow scales. Although quantitative estimates are crude, the analysis
indicates that turbulent energy dominates over magnetic energy. The data also
suggest a magnetic field strength increase from the lower-density envelope to
the higher-density core.
