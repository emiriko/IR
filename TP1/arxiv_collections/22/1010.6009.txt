We describe an algorithm to compute the local component at p of the
Coleman-Gross p-adic height pairing on divisors on hyperelliptic curves. As the
height pairing is given in terms of a Coleman integral, we also provide new
techniques to evaluate Coleman integrals of meromorphic differentials and
present our algorithms as implemented in Sage.
