Results for transport properties, in conjunction with phase behavior and
thermodynamics, are presented at the criticality of a binary Lennard-Jones
fluid from Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations. Evidence for much
stronger finite-size effects in dynamics compared to statics has been
demonstrated. Results for bulk viscosity are the first in the literature that
quantifies critical divergence via appropriate finite-size scaling analysis.
Our results are in accordance with the predictions of mode-coupling and dynamic
renormalization group theoretical calculations.
