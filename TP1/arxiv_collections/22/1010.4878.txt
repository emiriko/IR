The $\phi$(1020) meson leptonic width has been determined from the combined
analysis of 4 major decay modes of the resonance ($\phi\to K^+
K^-,K^0_LK^0_S,\pi^+\pi^-\pi^0,\eta\gamma$) studied with the CMD-2 detector at
the VEPP-2M $e^+e^-$ collider. The following value has been obtained:
$\Gamma(\phi\to e^+e^-) = 1.235\pm 0.006\pm 0.022$ keV.
  The $\phi(1020)$ meson parameters in four main decay channels have been also
recalculated: $B(\phi\to K^+K^-) = 0.493\pm 0.003\pm 0.007$, $B(\phi\to K_LK_S)
= 0.336\pm 0.002\pm 0.006$, $B(\phi\to\pi^+\pi^-\pi^0) = 0.155\pm 0.002\pm
0.005$, $B(\phi\to\eta\gamma) = 0.0138\pm 0.0002\pm 0.0002$.
