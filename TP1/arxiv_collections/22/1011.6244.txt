In the present article we investigate optical near fields in semiconductor
lasers. We perform finite element simulations for two different laser types,
namely a super large optical waveguide (SLOW) laser, which is an edge emitter,
and a vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL). We give the mathematical
formulation of the different eigenvalue problems that arise for our examples
and explain their numerical solution with the finite element method. Thereby,
we also comment on the usage of transparent boundary conditions, which have to
be applied to respect the exterior environment, e.g., the very large substrate
and surrounding air.
  For the SLOW laser we compare the computed near fields to experimental data
for different design parameters of the device. For the VCSEL example a
comparison to simplified 1D mode calculations is carried out.
