The number of conducting channels for one propagating direction is equal to
that for the other direction in ordinary quantum wires. However, they can be
imbalanced in graphene nanoribbons with zigzag edges. Employing the model
system in which a degree of channel-number imbalance can be controlled, we
calculate the shot-noise power at zero frequency by using the
Boltzmann-Langevin approach. The shot-noise power in an ordinary diffusive
conductor is one-third of the Poisson value. We show that with increasing the
degree of channel-number imbalance, the universal one-third suppression breaks
down and a highly nonuniversal behavior of shot noise appears.
