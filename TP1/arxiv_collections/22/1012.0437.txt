By virtue of the technique of integration within an ordered product (IWOP) of
operators and the bipartite entangled state representation we derive some new
identities about operator Hermite polynomials in both single- and two-variable,
we also find a binomial-like theorem between the single-variable Hermite
polynomials and the two-variable Hermite polynomials. Application of these
identities in deriving new integration formulas, but without really doing the
integration in the usual sense, is demonstrated.
