A new, conceptual proof approach for establishing the existence of
regenerative space-time points for symmetric, translation invariant,
finite-range interaction contact processes on survival is shown. The proof is
elementary, complements the original one, and employs symmetry-based coupling
arguments and a new consequence of convergence to equilibrium of the process in
order to circumvent the original block construction.
