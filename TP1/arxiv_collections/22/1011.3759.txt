In the multiple monomers per site (MMS) model, polymeric chains are
represented by walks on a lattice which may visit each site up to K times. We
have solved the unrestricted version of this model, where immediate reversals
of the walks are allowed (RA) for K = 3 on a Bethe lattice with arbitrary
coordination number in the grand-canonical formalism. We found transitions
between a non-polymerized and two polymerized phases, which may be continuous
or discontinuous. In the canonical situation, the transitions between the
extended and the collapsed polymeric phases are always continuous. The
transition line is partly composed by tricritical points and partially by
critical endpoints, both lines meeting at a multicritical point. In the
subspace of the parameter space where the model is related to SASAW's
(self-attracting self-avoiding walks), the collapse transition is tricritical.
We discuss the relation of our results with simulations and previous Bethe and
Husimi lattice calculations for the MMS model found in the literature.
