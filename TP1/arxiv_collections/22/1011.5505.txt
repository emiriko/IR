GJ 758 B is a cold (~600K) companion to a Sun-like star at 29 AU projected
separation, which was recently detected with high-contrast imaging. Here we
present photometry of the companion in seven photometric bands from
Subaru/HiCIAO, Gemini/NIRI and Keck/NIRC2, providing a rich sampling of the
spectral energy distribution in the 1-5 micron wavelength range. A clear
detection at 1.58 micron combined with an upper limit at 1.69 micron shows
methane absorption in the atmosphere of the companion. The mass of the
companion remains uncertain, but an updated age estimate indicates that the
most likely mass range is ~30-40 Mjup. In addition, we present an updated
astrometric analysis that imposes tighter constraints on GJ 758 B's orbit and
identifies the proposed second candidate companion, "GJ 758 C", as a background
star.
