For the purpose of understanding second-order scalar PDEs and their
hydrodynamic integrability, we introduce G-structures that are induced on
hypersurfaces of the space of symmetric matrices (interpreted as the fiber of
second-order jet space) and are defined by non-degenerate scalar
second-order-only (Hessian) PDEs in any number of variables. The fiber group is
a conformal orthogonal group that acts on the space of independent variables,
and it is a subgroup of the conformal orthogonal group for a semi-Riemannian
metric that exists on the PDE. These G-structures are automatically compatible
with the definition of hydrodynamic integrability, so they allow
contact-invariant analysis of integrability via moving frames and the
Cartan--Kaehler theorem. They directly generalize the GL(2)-structures that
arise in the case of Hessian hyperbolic equations in three variables as well as
several related geometries that appear in the literature on hydrodynamic
integrability. Part I primarily discusses the motivation, the definition, and
the solution to the equivalence problem, and Part II will discuss integrability
in detail.
