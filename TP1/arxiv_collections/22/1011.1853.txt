Fluctuations in the initial conditions for relativistic heavy ion collisions
are proving to be crucial to understanding final state flow and jet quenching
observables. The initial geometry has been parametrized in terms of moments in
the spatial anisotropy (i.e. $\epsilon_2, \epsilon_3, \epsilon_4,
\epsilon_5...$), and it has been stated in multiple published articles that the
vector directions of odd moments are uncorrelated with the even moments and the
reaction place angle. In this article, we demonstrate that this is incorrect
and that a substantial correlation exists between the even and odd moments in
peripheral Au+Au collisions. These correlations persist for all centralities,
though at a very small level for the 0-55% most central collisions.
