We report results of 23Na and 75As nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
experiments on a self-flux grown high-quality single crystal of stoichiometric
NaFeAs. The NMR spectra revealed a tetragonal to twinned-orthorhombic
structural phase transition at T_O = 57 K and an antiferromagnetic (AF)
transition at T_AF = 45 K. The divergent behavior of nuclear relaxation rate
near T_AF shows significant anisotropy, indicating that the critical slowing
down of stripe-type AF fluctuations are strongly anisotropic in spin space. The
NMR spectra at low enough temperatures consist of sharp peaks showing a
commensurate stripe AF order with a small moment \sim 0.3 muB. However, the
spectra just below T_AF exhibits highly asymmetric broadening pointing to an
incommensurate modulation. The commensurate-incommensurate crossover in NaFeAs
shows a certain similarity to the behavior of SrFe2As2 under high pressure.
