We present a new semi-classical theory for describing pairing in finite Fermi
systems. It is based in taking the $\hbar \to 0$, i.e. Thomas-Fermi, limit of
the gap equation written in the basis of the mean field (weak coupling). In
addition to the position dependence of the Fermi momentum, the size dependence
of the matrix elements of the pairing force is also taken into account in this
theory. An example typical for the nuclear situation shows the improvement of
this new approach over the standard Local Density Approximation. We also show
that if in this approach some shell fluctuations are introduced in the level
density, the arch structure displayed by the quantal gaps along isotopic chains
is almost recovered. We also point out that in heavy drip line nuclei pairing
is strongly reduced.
