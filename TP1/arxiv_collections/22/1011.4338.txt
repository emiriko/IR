Polarization-sensitive quantum optical coherence tomography (PS-QOCT) makes
use of a Type-II twin-photon light source for carrying out optical sectioning
with polarization sensitivity. A BBO nonlinear optical crystal pumped by a
Ti:sapphire psec-pulsed laser is used to confirm the theoretical underpinnings
of this imaging paradigm. PS-QOCT offers even-order dispersion cancellation
with simultaneous access to the group-velocity dispersion characteristics of
the interstitial medium between the reflecting surfaces of the sample.
