Parton distributions in impact parameter space, which are obtained by Fourier
transforming GPDs, exhibit a significant deviation from axial symmetry when the
target and/or quark are transversely polarized. Connections between this
deformation and transverse single-spin asymmetries as well as with quark-gluon
correlations are discussed. The sign of transverse deformation of impact
parameter dependent parton distributions in a transversely polarized target can
be related to the sign of the contribution from that quark flavor to the
nucleon anomalous magnetic moment. Therefore, the signs of the Sivers function
for $u$ and $d$ quarks, as well as the signs of quark-gluon correlations
embodied in the polarized structure function $g_2$ can be understood in terms
of the proton and neutron anomalous magnetic moments.
