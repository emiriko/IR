This article presents new properties of the mesh array for matrix
multiplication. In contrast to the standard array that requires 3n-2 steps to
complete its computation, the mesh array requires only 2n-1 steps. Symmetries
of the mesh array computed values are presented which enhance the efficiency of
the array for specific applications. In multiplying symmetric matrices, the
results are obtained in 3n/2+1 steps. The mesh array is examined for its
application as a scrambling system.
