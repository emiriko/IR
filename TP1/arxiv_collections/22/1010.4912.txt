The behavior of interacting electrons in a perfect crystal under macroscopic
external electric and magnetic fields is studied. Effective Maxwell equations
for the macroscopic electric and magnetic fields are derived starting from
time-dependent density functional theory. Effective permittivity and
permeability coefficients are obtained.
