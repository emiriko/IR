It is believed that the more we have {\it a priori} information on input
states, the better we can make the quality of clones in quantum cloning
machines. This common sense idea was confirmed several years ago by analyzing a
situation, where the input state is either one of two non-orthogonal states. If
the {\it a priori} information is measured by the Shannon entropy, common sense
predicts that the quality of the clone becomes poorer with increasing $N$,
where $N$ is the number of possible input states. We show, however, that the
{\it a priori} information measured by the Shannon entropy does not affect the
quality of the clones. Instead the no-cloning theorem and `denseness' of the
possible input states play important roles in determining the quality.
Specifically, the factor `denseness' plays a more crucial role than the
no-cloning theorem when $N \geq 3$.
