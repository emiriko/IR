The ESA Gaia mission will provide a multi-epoch database for a billion of
objects, including variable objects that comprise stars, active galactic nuclei
and asteroids. We highlight a few of Gaia's properties that will benefit the
study of variable objects, and illustrate with two examples the work being done
in the preparation of the data processing and object characterization. The
first example relates to the analysis of the nearly simultaneous multi-band
data of Gaia with the Principal Component Analysis techniques, and the second
example concerns the classification of Gaia time series into variability types.
The results of the ground-based processing of Gaia's variable objects data will
be made available to the scientific community through the intermediate and
final ESA releases throughout the mission.
