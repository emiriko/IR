Online Social Networks (OSN) during last years acquired a huge and increasing
popularity as one of the most important emerging Web phenomena, deeply
modifying the behavior of users and contributing to build a solid substrate of
connections and relationships among people using the Web. In this preliminary
work paper, our purpose is to analyze Facebook, considering a significant
sample of data reflecting relationships among subscribed users. Our goal is to
extract, from this platform, relevant information about the distribution of
these relations and exploit tools and algorithms provided by the Social Network
Analysis (SNA) to discover and, possibly, understand underlying similarities
between the developing of OSN and real-life social networks.
