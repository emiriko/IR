In this report arguments are presented to classify this hadron rich event as
an interaction event and the consequences of this statement. For instance the
total invariant mass would be estimated as ~ 61 GeV/c^2 and the pair of hadrons
used for height estimation have invariant mass = 2.2 GeV/c^2. Besides, tables
showing the parametric and non-parametric analysis resulting in a criteria
table and the resulting tables for the discrimination of $\gamma$ or hadron
induced showers were presented at the 16th ISVHECRI, held at Batavia, USA. The
main point of hadron rich and Centauro events is the identification of the
nature of the observed showers. The identification and energy determination of
$\gamma$ or hadron induced showers was made using 2 simulations. Complemented
with the observation of photosensitive material under microscope it was
determined that the event C16S086I037 could be classified as a hadron rich
event. We used 10 reasonable scenarios for $\gamma$/hadron discrimination and
obtained that the event is composed of 25 $\gamma$'s, 36 hadrons and 1
surviving and leading hadron. All these scenarios were reported at the 14th
ISVHECRI, held in Weihai, China and resulted in rather constant values of
physical quantities, like the mean transverse momentum of hadrons,
$<P_{T_{h}}>$, and the mean inelasticity of $\gamma$-ray, $<k_{\gamma}>$.
