The anti-ferromagnetic coupling of a magnetic impurity carrying a spin with
the conduction electrons spins of a host metal is the basic mechanism
responsible for the increase of the resistance of an alloy such as
Cu${}_{0.998}$Fe${}_{0.002}$ at low temperature, as originally suggested by
Kondo . This coupling has emerged as a very generic property of localized
electronic states coupled to a continuum . The possibility to design artificial
controllable magnetic impurities in nanoscopic conductors has opened a path to
study this many body phenomenon in unusual situations as compared to the
initial one and, in particular, in out of equilibrium situations. So far,
measurements have focused on the average current. Here, we report on
\textit{current fluctuations} (noise) measurements in artificial Kondo
impurities made in carbon nanotube devices. We find a striking enhancement of
the current noise within the Kondo resonance, in contradiction with simple
non-interacting theories. Our findings provide a test bench for one of the most
important many-body theories of condensed matter in out of equilibrium
situations and shed light on the noise properties of highly conductive
molecular devices.
