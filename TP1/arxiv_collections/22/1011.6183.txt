Production and space-time evolution of heavy quarks in central and
non-central heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and LHC are studied with the partonic
transport model Boltzmann Approach of MultiParton Scatterings (BAMPS). In
addition to the initially created heavy quarks in hard parton scatterings
during nucleon-nucleon collisions, secondary heavy quark production in the
quark-gluon plasma is investigated and the sensitivity on various parameters is
estimated. In BAMPS heavy quarks scatter with particles of the medium via
elastic collisions, whose cross section is calculated with the running coupling
and a more precise implementation of Debye screening. In this framework, we
compute the elliptic flow and nuclear modification factor of heavy quarks and
compare it to the experimental data.
