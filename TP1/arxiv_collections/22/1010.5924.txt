We study cosmological perturbations and observational aspects for mutated
hilltop model of inflation. Employing mostly analytical treatment, we evaluate
observable parameters during inflation as well as post-inflationary
perturbations. This further leads to exploring observational aspects related to
Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation. This semi-analytical treatment
reduces complications related to numerical computation to some extent for
studying the different phenomena related to CMB angular power spectrum for
mutated hilltop inflation.
