Diffraction in time (DIT) is a fundamental phenomenon in quantum dynamics due
to time-dependent obstacles and slits. It is formally analogous to diffraction
of light, and is expected to play an increasing role to design coherent matter
wave sources, as in the atom laser, to analyze time-of-flight information and
emission from ultrafast pulsed excitations, and in applications of coherent
matter waves in integrated atom-optical circuits. We demonstrate that DIT
emerges robustly in quantum waves emitted by an exponentially decaying source
and provide a simple explanation of the phenomenon, as an interference of two
characteristic velocities. This allows for its controllability and
optimization.
