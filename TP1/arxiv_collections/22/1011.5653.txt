Using recently proposed measures for non-Markovianity [H. P. Breuer, E. M.
Laine, and J. Piilo, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 103}, 210401 (2009)], we study the
dynamics of a qubit coupled to a spin environment via an energy-exchange
mechanism. We show the existence of a point, in the parameter space of the
system, where the qubit dynamics is effectively Markovian and that such a point
separates two regions with completely different dynamical behaviors. Indeed,
our study demonstrates that the qubit evolution can in principle be tuned from
a perfectly forgetful one to a deep non-Markovian regime where the qubit is
strongly affected by the dynamical back-action of the environmental spins. By
means of quantum process tomography, we provide a complete and intuitive
characterization of the qubit channel.
