We study the stable pairs theory of local curves in 3-folds with descendent
insertions. The rationality of the partition function of descendent invariants
is established for the full local curve geometry (equivariant with respect to
the scaling 2-torus) including relative conditions and odd degree insertions
for higher genus curves. The capped 1-leg descendent vertex (equivariant with
respect to the 3-torus) is also proven to be rational. The results are obtained
by combining geometric constraints with a detailed analysis of the poles of the
descendent vertex.
