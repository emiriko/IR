A new Monte Carlo implementation of Djordjevic's dynamical scattering
generalization of the DGLV radiative energy loss opacity series is used with a
hybrid interpolation scheme to compute both light and heavy quark jet quenching
up to third order in opacity. The enhancement of the ratio of bottom to charm
quark energy loss due to perturbative long range color magnetic effects in
nonuniform Bjorken expanding geometries is found to reduce the significance of
the heavy quark jet puzzle posed by the observed near equality (within sizeable
errors) of pion and nonphotonic electron nuclear modification at RHIC. Jet
Flavor Spectroscopy discussed below will be a powerful tool to differentiate
competing dynamical models of the QGP produced in ultra-relativistic nuclear
collisions.
