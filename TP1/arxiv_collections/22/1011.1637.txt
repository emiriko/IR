Not long ago, the definition of eigenspinors of charge-conjugation belonging
to a special Wigner class has lead to the unexpected theoretical discovery of a
form of matter with spin 1/2 and mass dimension 1, called ELKO matter field;
ELKO matter fields defined in flat spacetimes have been later extended to
curved and twisted spacetimes, in order to include in their dynamics the
coupling to gravitational fields possessing both metric and torsional degrees
of freedom: the inclusion of non-commuting spinorial covariant derivatives
allows for the introduction of more general dynamical terms influencing the
behaviour of ELKO matter fields. In this paper, we shall solve the theoretical
problem of finding the most general dynamics for ELKO matter, and we will face
the phenomenological issue concerning how the new dynamical terms may affect
the behaviour of ELKO matter; we will see that new effects will arise for which
the very existence of ELKO matter will be endangered, due to the fact that
ELKOs will turn incompatible with the cosmological principle. Thus we have that
anisotropic universes must be taken into account if ELKOs are to be considered
in their most general form.
