A generalized version of Bertrand's theorem on spherically symmetric curved
spaces is presented. This result is based on the classification of
(3+1)-dimensional (Lorentzian) Bertrand spacetimes, that gives rise to two
families of Hamiltonian systems defined on certain 3-dimensional (Riemannian)
spaces. These two systems are shown to be either the Kepler or the oscillator
potentials on the corresponding Bertrand spaces, and both of them are maximally
superintegrable. Afterwards, the relationship between such Bertrand
Hamiltonians and position-dependent mass systems is explicitly established.
These results are illustrated through the example of a superintegrable
(nonlinear) oscillator on a Bertrand-Darboux space, whose quantization and
physical features are also briefly addressed.
