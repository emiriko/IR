Close-in, giant planets are expected to influence their host stars via tidal
or magnetic interaction. But are these effects strong enough in suitable
targets known so far to be observed with today's instrumentation? The upsilon
And system, an F8V star with a Hot Jupiter, was claimed to undergo cyclic
changes in chromospheric activity indicators with its innermost planet's
period. We want to investigate the stellar chromospheric and coronal activity
over several months. We therefore monitored the star in X-rays as well as at
optical wavelengths to test coronal and chromospheric activity indicators for
planet-induced variability, making use of the Chandra X-ray Observatory as well
as the echelle spectrographs FOCES and HRS at Calar Alto (Spain) and the
Hobby-Eberly Telescope (Texas, US). The stellar activity level is low, as seen
both in X-rays as in Ca II line fluxes; the chromospheric data show variability
with the stellar rotation period. We do not find activity variations in X-rays
or in the optical which can be traced back to the planet. Gaining observational
evidence for star-planet interactions in X-rays remains challenging.
