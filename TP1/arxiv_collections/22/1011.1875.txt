We present and prove a well-known locality bound for the complex-time
dynamics of a general class of one-dimensional quantum spin systems. Then we
discuss how one might hope to extend this same procedure to higher dimensions
using ideas related to the Eden growth process and lattice trees. Finally, we
demonstrate with a specific family of lattice trees in the plane why this
approach breaks down in dimensions greater than one and prove that there exist
interactions for which the complex-time dynamics blows-up in finite imaginary
time.
