We provide a simple class of 2-qudit states for which one is able to
formulate necessary and sufficient conditions for separability. As a byproduct
we generalize well known construction provided by Horodecki et al. for d=3. It
is hoped that these states with known separability/entanglement properties may
be used to test various notions in entanglement theory.
