We revisit the deadlock-prevention problem by focusing on priority digraphs
instead of the traditional wait-for digraphs. This has allowed us to formulate
deadlock prevention in terms of prohibiting the occurrence of directed cycles
even in the most general of wait models (the so-called AND-OR model, in which
prohibiting wait-for directed cycles is generally overly restrictive). For a
particular case in which the priority digraphs are somewhat simplified, we
introduce a Las Vegas probabilistic mechanism for resource granting and analyze
its key aspects in detail.
