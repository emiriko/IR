We examine the possibility that a new strong interaction is accessible to the
Tevatron and the LHC. In an effective theory approach, we consider a scenario
with a new color-octet interaction with strong couplings to the top quark, as
well as the presence of a strongly coupled fourth-generation which could be
responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking. We apply several constraints,
including the ones from flavor physics. We study the phenomenology of the
resulting parameter space at the Tevatron, focusing on the the forward-backward
asymmetry in top pair production, as well as in the production of the
fourth-generation quarks. We show that if the excess in the top production
asymmetry is indeed the result of this new interaction, the Tevatron could see
the first hints of the strongly coupled fourth-generation quarks. Finally, we
show that the LHC with $\sqrt{s}=7~$TeV and $1~{\rm fb}^{-1}$ integrated
luminosity should observe the production of fourth-generation quarks at a level
at least one order of magnitude above the QCD prediction for the production of
these states.
