Gyration radius of individual's trajectory plays a key role in quantifying
human mobility patterns. Of particular interests, empirical analyses suggest
that the growth of gyration radius is slow versus time except the very early
stage and may eventually arrive to a steady value. However, up to now, the
underlying mechanism leading to such a possibly steady value has not been well
understood. In this Letter, we propose a simplified human mobility model to
simulate individual's daily travel with three sequential activities: commuting
to workplace, going to do leisure activities and returning home. With the
assumption that individual has constant travel speed and inferior limit of time
at home and work, we prove that the daily moving area of an individual is an
ellipse, and finally get an exact solution of the gyration radius. The
analytical solution well captures the empirical observation reported in [M. C.
Gonz`alez et al., Nature, 453 (2008) 779]. We also find that, in spite of the
heterogeneous displacement distribution in the population level, individuals in
our model have characteristic displacements, indicating a completely different
mechanism to the one proposed by Song et al. [Nat. Phys. 6 (2010) 818].
