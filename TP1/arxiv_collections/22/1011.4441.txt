The transfer operator for $\Gamma_0(N)$ and trivial character $\chi_0$
possesses a finite group of symmetries generated by permutation matrices $P$
with $P^2=id$. Every such symmetry leads to a factorization of the Selberg zeta
function in terms of Fredholm determinants of a reduced transfer operator.
These symmetries are related to the group of automorphisms in
$GL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ of the Maass wave forms of $\Gamma_0(N)$ . For the group
$\Gamma_0(4)$ and Selberg's character $\chi_\alpha$ there exists just one
non-trivial symmetry operator $P$. The eigenfunctions of the corresponding
reduced transfer operator with eigenvalue $\lambda=\pm 1$ are related to Maass
forms even respectively odd under a corresponding automorphism. It then follows
from a result of Sarnak and Phillips that the zeros of the Selberg function
determined by the eigenvalues $\lambda=-1$ of the reduced transfer operator
stay on the critical line under the deformation of the character. From
numerical results we expect that on the other hand all the zeros corresponding
to the eigenvalue $\lambda=+1$ leave this line for $\alpha$ turning away from
zero.
