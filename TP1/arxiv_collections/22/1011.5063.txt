We consider the Kane-Mele model with spin-orbit coupling supplemented by a
Hubbard U term. On the basis of projective auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo
simulations on lattice sizes up to 15 x 15, we map out the phase diagram. The
quantum spin-liquid state found in the Hubbard model is shown to be robust
against weak spin-orbit interaction, and is not adiabatically connected to the
spin-Hall insulating state. Beyond a critical value of U > U_c both states are
unstable toward magnetic ordering. Within the quantum spin-Hall state we study
the spin, charge and single-particle dynamics of the helical Luttinger liquid
by retaining the Hubbard interaction only on the edge of a ribbon. The Hubbard
interaction greatly suppresses charge currents along the edge, promotes edge
magnetism, but leaves the single-particle signatures of the helical liquid
intact.
