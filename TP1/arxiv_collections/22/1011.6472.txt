Two utmost cases of super-extreme event's influence on the velocity
autocorrelation function (VAF) were considered. The VAF itself was derived
within the hierarchical Weierstrass-Mandelbrot Continuous-Time Random Walk
(WM-CTRW) formalism, which is able to cover a broad spectrum of continuous-time
random walks. Firstly, we studied a super-extreme event in a form of a
sustained drift, whose duration time is much longer than that of any other
event. Secondly, we considered a super-extreme event in the form of a shock
with the size and velocity much larger than those corresponding to any other
event. We found that the appearance of these super-extreme events substantially
changes the results determined by extreme events (the so called "black swans")
that are endogenous to the WM-CTRW process. For example, changes of the VAF in
the latter case are in the form of some instability and distinctly differ from
those caused in the former case. In each case these changes are quite different
compared to the situation without super-extreme events suggesting the
possibility to detect them in natural system if they occur.
