We investigate the problem of secure communication over parallel relay
channel in the presence of a passive eavesdropper. We consider a four terminal
relay-eavesdropper channel which consists of multiple relay-eavesdropper
channels as subchannels. For the discrete memoryless model, we establish outer
and inner bounds on the rate-equivocation region. The inner bound allows mode
selection at the relay. For each subchannel, secure transmission is obtained
through one of two coding schemes at the relay: decoding-and-forwarding the
source message or confusing the eavesdropper through noise injection. For the
Gaussian memoryless channel, we establish lower and upper bounds on the perfect
secrecy rate. Furthermore, we study a special case in which the relay does not
hear the source and show that under certain conditions the lower and upper
bounds coincide. The results established for the parallel Gaussian
relay-eavesdropper channel are then applied to study the fading
relay-eavesdropper channel. Analytical results are illustrated through some
numerical examples.
