The Australia Telescope 20 GHz (AT20G) survey is a blind survey of the whole
Southern sky at 20 GHz with follow-up observations at 4.8, 8.6, and 20 GHz
carried out with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA). In this paper we
present an analysis of radio spectral properties in total intensity and
polarisation, sizes, optical identifications, and redshifts of the sample of
the 5808 extragalactic sources in the survey catalogue of confirmed sources
over the whole Southern sky excluding the strip at Galactic latitude
|b|<1.5deg. The sample has a flux density limit of 40 mJy. Completeness has
been measured as a function of scan region and flux density. Averaging over the
whole survey area the follow-up survey is 78% complete above 50mJy and 93%
complete above 100mJy. 3332 sources with declination <-15deg have good quality
almost simultaneous observations at 4.8, 8.6, and 20GHz. The spectral analysis
shows that the sample is dominated by flat-spectrum sources. The fraction of
flat-spectrum sources decreases from 81% for 20GHz flux densities S>500mJy, to
60% for S<100mJy. There is also a clear spectral steepening at higher
frequencies with the median spectral index decreasing from -0.16 between 4.8
and 8.6GHz to -0.28 between 8.6 and 20GHz. Simultaneous observations in
polarisation are available for all the sources at all the frequencies. 768
sources have a good quality detection of polarised flux density at 20GHz; 467
of them were also detected in polarisation at 4.8 and/or at 8.6GHz so that it
has been possible to compare the spectral behaviour in total intensity and
polarisation. We have found that the polarised fraction increases slightly with
frequency and decreases with flux density. Cross matches and comparisons have
been made with other catalogues at lower radio frequencies, and in the optical,
X-ray and gamma-ray bands. Redshift estimates are available for 825 sources.
