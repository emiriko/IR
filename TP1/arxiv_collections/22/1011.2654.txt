A bottleneck for computational lithography and optical metrology are long
computational times for near field simulations. For design, optimization, and
inverse scatterometry usually the same basic layout has to be simulated
multiple times for different values of geometrical parameters. The reduced
basis method allows to split up the solution process of a parameterized model
into an expensive offline and a cheap online part. After constructing the
reduced basis offline, the reduced model can be solved online very fast in the
order of seconds or below. Error estimators assure the reliability of the
reduced basis solution and are used for self adaptive construction of the
reduced system. We explain the idea of reduced basis and use the finite element
solver JCMsuite constructing the reduced basis system. We present a 3D
optimization application from optical proximity correction (OPC).
