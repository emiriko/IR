The Very Large Array is undergoing a major upgrade that will attain an order
of magnitude improvement in continuum sensitivity across 1 to 50 GHz with
instantaneous bandwidths up to 8 GHz in both polarizations. The new WIDAR
correlator provides a highly flexible spectrometer with up to 16 GHz of
bandwidth and a minimum of 16k channels for each array baseline. The new
capabilities revolutionize the scientific discovery potential of the telescope.
Early science programs are now underway. We provide an update on the status of
the project and a description of early science programs.
