Based on the extended Greenwich-NOAA/USAF catalogue of sunspot groups it is
demonstrated that the parameters describing the latitudinal width of the
sunspot generating zone (SGZ) are closely related to the current level of solar
activity, and the growth of the activity leads to the expansion of SGZ. The
ratio of the sunspot number to the width of SGZ shows saturation at a certain
level of the sunspot number, and above this level the increase of the activity
takes place mostly due to the expansion of SGZ. It is shown that the mean
latitudes of sunspots can be reconstructed from the amplitudes of solar
activity. Using the obtained relations and the group sunspot numbers by Hoyt
and Schatten (1998), the latitude distribution of sunspot groups ("the Maunder
butterfly diagram") for the 18th and the first half of the 19th centuries is
reconstructed and compared with historical sunspot observations.
