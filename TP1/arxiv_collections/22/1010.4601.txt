Observations of GRB 100724B with the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM) find
that the spectrum is dominated by the typical Band functional form, which is
usually taken to represent a non-thermal emission component, but also includes
a statistically highly significant thermal spectral contribution. The
simultaneous observation of the thermal and non-thermal components allows us to
confidently identify the two emission components. The fact that these seem to
vary independently favors the idea that the thermal component is of
photospheric origin while the dominant non-thermal emission occurs at larger
radii. Our results imply either a very high efficiency for the non-thermal
process, or a very small size of the region at the base of the flow, both quite
challenging for the standard fireball model. These problems are resolved if the
jet is initially highly magnetized and has a substantial Poynting flux.
