As an alternative to the LCDM concordance model, Scalar-Tensor-Vector
Modified Gravity (MOG) theory reproduces key cosmological observations without
postulating the presence of an exotic dark matter component. MOG is a field
theory based on an action principle, with a variable gravitational constant and
a repulsive vector field with variable range. MOG yields a phenomenological
acceleration law that includes strong tensorial gravity partially canceled by a
repulsive massive vector force. This acceleration law can be used to model the
CMB acoustic spectrum and the matter power spectrum yielding good agreement
with observation. A key prediction of MOG is the presence of strong baryonic
oscillations, which will be detectable by future surveys. MOG is also
consistent with Type Ia supernova data. We also describe on-going research of
the coupling between MOG and continuous matter, consistent with the weak
equivalence principle and solar system observations.
