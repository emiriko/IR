We analyze the radiative pion decay pi+ -> e+ nu_e gamma within nonlocal
chiral quark models that include wave function renormalization. In this
framework we calculate the vector and axial-vector form factors FV and FA at
q^2=0 --where q^2 is the (e+ \nu_e) squared invariant mass-- and the slope a of
FV(q^2) at q^2 -> 0. The calculations are carried out considering different
nonlocal form factors, in particular those taken from lattice QCD evaluations,
showing a reasonable agreement with the corresponding experimental data. The
comparison of our results with those obtained in the (local) NJL model and the
relation of FV and a with the form factor in pi^0 -> gamma* gamma decays are
discussed.
