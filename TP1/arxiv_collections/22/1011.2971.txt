Stringent limits on the Myers-Pospelov timelike parameter for photons
$\xi<10^{-15}$ coming from astrophysical tests suggest exploring more general
preferred backgrounds, such as spacelike and lightlike. We take some steps in
this direction. We allow the external four vector $n$ characterizing the
Lorentz symmetry breaking to have arbitrary directions in spacetime. We study
the consistency for the effective field theories in each privileged frame by
demanding causality, stability and analyticity. When specializing to a timelike
background we found runaway solutions leading to causality and unitarity
violations. We show that the lightlike theory is a higher-derivative theory
with more degrees of freedom and nonanalytic solutions leading to instabilities
when interactions are turned on. We demonstrate by explicit calculation that
both stability and analyticity are preserved for the purely spacelike case
while microcausality is highly suppressed. This new anisotropic model opens the
possibility to play a role in the search for Planck-scale effects.
