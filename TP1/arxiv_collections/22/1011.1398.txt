Dark matter interacting predominantly with leptons instead of nuclear matter
has received a lot of interest recently. In this talk, we investigate the
signals expected from such 'leptophilic Dark Matter' in direct detection
experiments and in experiments looking for Dark Matter annihilation into
neutrinos in the Sun. In a model-independent framework, we calculate the
expected interaction rates for different scattering processes, including
elastic and inelastic scattering off atomic electron shells, as well as
loop-induced scattering off atomic nuclei. In those cases where the last effect
dominates, leptophilic Dark Matter cannot be distinguished from conventional
WIMPs. On the other hand, if inelastic scattering off the electron shell
dominates, the expected event spectrum in direct detection experiments is
different and would provide a distinct signal. However, we find that the
signals in DAMA and/or CoGeNT cannot be explained by invoking leptophilic DM
because the predicted and observed energy spectra do not match, and because of
neutrino bounds from the Sun.
