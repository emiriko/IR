During the evolution on the AGB, S-type stars are the first objects to
experience s-process nucleosynthesis and third dredge-ups, and therefore to
exhibit sprocess signatures in their atmospheres. Their significant mass loss
rates (10^-7 to 10^-6 M*/year) make them major contributors to the AGB
nucleosynthesis yields at solar metallicity. Precise abundance determinations
in S stars are of the utmost importance for constraining e.g. the third
dredge-up luminosity and efficiency (which has been only crudely parameterized
in all current nucleosynthetic models so far). Here, dedicated S-star model
atmospheres are used to determine precise abundances of key s-process elements,
and to set constraints on nucleosynthesis and stellar evolution models. A
special interest is paid to technetium, an element with no stable isotopes
(99Tc, the only isotope produced by the s-process in AGB stars, has a half-life
of 2.1 x 10^5 years). Its detection is considered as the best signature that
the star effectively populates the thermally-pulsing AGB phase of evolution.
The derived Tc/Zr abundances are compared, as a function of the derived [Zr/Fe]
overabundances, with AGB stellar model predictions. The [Zr/Fe] overabundances
are in good agreement with the model predictions, while the Tc/Zr abundances
are slightly overpredicted. This discrepancy can help to set better constraints
on nucleosynthesis and stellar evolution models of AGB stars.
