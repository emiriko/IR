The correlations between the rest frame peak of the EF_E spectrum of GRBs
Epeak and their isotropic energy (E_iso) or luminosity (L_iso) could have
several implications for the understanding of the GRB prompt emission. These
correlations are presently founded on the time-averaged spectral properties of
a sample of 95 bursts, with measured redshifts, collected by different
instruments in the last 13 years (pre-Fermi). One still open issue is wether
these correlations have a physical origin or are due to instrumental selection
effects. By studying 10 long and 14 short GRBs detected by Fermi we find that a
strong time-resolved correlation between E_peak and the luminosity L_iso is
present within individual GRBs and that it is consistent with the
time-integrated correlation. This result is a direct proof of the existence in
both short and long GRBs of a similar physical link between the hardness and
the luminosity which is not due to instrumental selection effects. The origin
of the E_peak-L_iso correlation should be searched in the radiation mechanism
of the prompt emission.
