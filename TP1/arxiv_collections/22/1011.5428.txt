The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a kilometer-scale detector currently
under construction at the South Pole. In its final configuration the detector
will comprise 5160 Digital Optical Modules (DOMs) deployed on 86 strings
between 1.5-2.5 km deep within the ice. While still incomplete, the detector
has already recorded tens of billions of cosmic ray muons with a median energy
of 20 TeV. This large sample has been used to study the arrival direction
distribution of the cosmic rays. We report the observation of an anisotropy in
the cosmic rays arrival direction at two different angular scales. The observed
large scale anisotropy seems to be a continuation of similar structures
observed in the Northern Sky by several experiments. IceCube observes also
significant features on the angular scale of $20^{\circ} - 30^{\circ}$ that
might be part of the larger scale structure.
