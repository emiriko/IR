Although prospective logistic regression is the standard method of analysis
for case-control data, it has been recently noted that in genetic epidemiologic
studies one can use the ``retrospective'' likelihood to gain major power by
incorporating various population genetics model assumptions such as
Hardy-Weinberg-Equilibrium (HWE), gene-gene and gene-environment independence.
In this article we review these modern methods and contrast them with the more
classical approaches through two types of applications (i) association tests
for typed and untyped single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and (ii)
estimation of haplotype effects and haplotype-environment interactions in the
presence of haplotype-phase ambiguity. We provide novel insights to existing
methods by construction of various score-tests and pseudo-likelihoods. In
addition, we describe a novel two-stage method for analysis of untyped SNPs
that can use any flexible external algorithm for genotype imputation followed
by a powerful association test based on the retrospective likelihood. We
illustrate applications of the methods using simulated and real data.
