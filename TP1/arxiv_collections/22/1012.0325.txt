In-correlator techniques offer the possibility of identifying and/or excising
radio frequency interference (RFI) from interferometric observations at much
higher time and/or frequency resolution than is generally possible with the
final visibility dataset. Due to the considerable computational requirements of
the correlation procedure, cross-correlators have most commonly been
implemented using high-speed digital signal processing boards, which typically
require long development times and are difficult to alter once complete.
"Software" correlators, on the other hand, make use of commodity server
machines and a correlation algorithm coded in a high-level language. They are
inherently much more flexible and can be developed - and modified - much more
rapidly than purpose-built "hardware" correlators. Software correlators are
thus a natural choice for testing new RFI detection and mitigation techniques
for interferometers. The ease with which software correlators can be adapted to
test RFI detection algorithms is demonstrated by the addition of kurtosis
detection and plotting to the widely used DiFX software correlator, which
highlights previously unknown short -duration RFI at the Hancock VLBA station.
