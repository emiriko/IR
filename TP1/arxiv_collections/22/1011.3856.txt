We derive explicit formulas for the Mellin transform and the distribution of
the exponential functional for Levy processes with rational Laplace exponent.
This extends recent results by Cai and Kou on the processes with
hyper-exponential jumps [N. Cai and S. Kou "Prising Asian options under a
general jump diffusion model", (2010)].
