We generalize E. Verlinde's entropic gravity reasoning to a phase-space
noncommutativity set-up. This allow us to impose a bound on the product of the
noncommutative parameters based on the Equivalence Principle. The key feature
of our analysis is an effective Planck's constant that naturally arises when
accounting for the noncommutative features of the phase-space.
