Conformal cyclic cosmology (CCC) posits the existence of an aeon preceding
our Big Bang 'B', whose conformal infinity 'I' is identified, conformally, with
'B', now regarded as a spacelike 3-surface. Black-hole encounters, within bound
galactic clusters in that previous aeon, would have the observable effect, in
our CMB sky, of families of concentric circles over which the temperature
variance is anomalously low, the centre of each such family representing the
point of 'I' at which the cluster converges. These centres appear as fairly
randomly distributed fixed points in our CMB sky. The analysis of Wilkinson
Microwave Background Probe's (WMAP) cosmic microwave background 7-year maps
does indeed reveal such concentric circles, of up to 6{\sigma} significance.
This is confirmed when the same analysis is applied to BOOMERanG98 data,
eliminating the possibility of an instrumental cause for the effects. These
observational predictions of CCC would not be easily explained within standard
inflationary cosmology.
