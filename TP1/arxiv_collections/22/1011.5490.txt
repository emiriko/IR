The extension of the Nambu-Jona-Lasino Model with six and eight quark
interactions to include the Polyakov loop is analysed. Several interesting
features are determined to be an effect of the choice of the regularization
procedure. The use of a Pauli-Villars covariant regularization enables a
coherent and correct description of several quantities.
