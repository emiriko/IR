We demonstrate a quantum dot single photon source at 900 nm triggered at 300
MHz by a continuous wave telecommunications wavelength laser followed by an
electro-optic modulator. The quantum dot is excited by on-chip-generated second
harmonic radiation, resonantly enhanced by a GaAs photonic crystal cavity
surrounding the InAs quantum dot. Our result suggests a path toward the
realization of telecommunications-wavelength-compatible quantum dot single
photon sources with speeds exceeding 1 GHz.
