In this talk, we investigate the cosmic no-hair conjecture for perturbed
Nariai solutions within the class of Gowdy symmetric solutions of Einstein's
field equations in vacuum with a positive cosmological constant. In particular,
we are interested whether these perturbations allow to construct new
cosmological black hole solutions.
