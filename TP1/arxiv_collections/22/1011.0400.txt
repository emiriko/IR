We study the stochastic dynamics of c and b quarks in the hot plasma produced
in nucleus-nucleus collisions at RHIC and LHC, providing results for the
nuclear modification factor R_AA and the elliptic flow coefficient v_2 of the
single-electron spectra arising from their semi-leptonic decays. The initial
QQbar pairs are generated using the POWHEG code, implementing pQCD at NLO. For
the propagation in the plasma we develop a relativistic Langevin equation
(solved in a medium described by hydrodynamics) whose transport coefficients
are evaluated through a first-principle calculation. Finally, at T_c, the heavy
quarks are made hadronize and decay into electrons: the resulting spectra are
then compared with RHIC results. Predictions for LHC are also attempted.
