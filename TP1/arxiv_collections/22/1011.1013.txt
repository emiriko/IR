The oxygen gradient of four dS galaxies has been determined using abundances
for several HII regions determined with four different methods. The gradient
slopes of the three non-barred galaxies in the sample are quite steep, larger
than -0.2 dex/kpc, while the gradient of the barred galaxy is shallower, only
-0.1 dex/kpc. Although these gradients are quite steep they are real, following
all the galaxies the same trend. Moreover, the results obtained here agree with
those marked by the late-type, non-dwarf spirals, particularly the relationship
between the gradient and the absolute magnitude and the optical size for
non-barred galaxies, and the surface density for barred ones.
