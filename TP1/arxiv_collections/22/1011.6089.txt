We introduce the notion of a poset scheme and study the categories of
quasi-coherent sheaves on such spaces. We then show that smooth poset schemes
may be used to obtain categorical resolutions of singularities for usual
singular schemes. We prove that a singular variety $X$ possesses such a
resolution if and only if $X$ has Du Bois singularities. Finally we show that
the de Rham-Du Bois complex for an algebraic variety $Y$ may be defined using
any smooth poset scheme which satisfies the descent over $Y$ in the classical
topology.
