It is possible, for homogeneously broadened lines, to excite selectively the
response signals, which are orders of magnitude narrower than the original
lines. The new type of echo, which allows detecting such signals, and the
formalism, useful for understanding the phenomenon, as well as the experimental
examples from NMR spectroscopy are presented.
