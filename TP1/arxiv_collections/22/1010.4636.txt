We have studied the Hall effect in superconducting tantalum nitride films. We
find a large contribution to the Hall conductivity near the superconducting
transition, which we can track to temperatures well above $T_c$ and magnetic
fields well above the upper critical field, $\text{\text{H}}_{c2}(0)$. This
contribution arises from Aslamazov-Larkin superconducting fluctuations, and we
find quantitative agreement between our data and recent theoretical analysis
based on time dependent Ginzburg-Landau theory.
