Adem and Reichstein introduced the ideal of truncated symmetric polynomials
to present the permutation invariant subring in the cohomology of a finite
product of projective spaces. Building upon their work, I describe a generating
set of the ideal of truncated symmetric polynomials in arbitrary positive
characteristic, and offer a conjecture for minimal generators.
