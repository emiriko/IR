The connection between QCD, a nonlocal Nambu--Jona-Lasinio type model and the
Landau gauge gluon propagator is explored. This two point function is
parameterized by a functional form which is compatible with Dyson-Schwinger and
lattice QCD results. Demanding the nonlocal model to reproduce the experimental
values for the pion mass, the pion decay constant, $\Gamma_{\pi \rightarrow
\gamma\gamma}$ and the light quark condensate we conclude that low energy
physics does not distinguish between the so-called decoupling and scaling
solutions of the Dyson-Schwinger equations. This result means that, provided
that the model parameters are chosen appropriately, one is free to chose any of
the above scenarios. Furthermore, the nonlocal Nambu--Jona-Lasinio quark model
considered here is chiral invariant and satisfies the GMOR relation at the 1%
level of precision.
