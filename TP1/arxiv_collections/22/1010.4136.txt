We consider Andreev reflection in a two dimensional junction between a normal
metal and a heavy fermion superconductor in the Fulde-Ferrell (FF) type of the
Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state. We assume s-wave symmetry of the
superconducting gap. The parameters of the superconductor: the gap magnitude,
the chemical potential, and the Cooper pair center-of-mass momentum Q, are all
determined self-consistently within a mean-field (BCS) scheme. The Cooper pair
momentum Q is chosen as perpendicular to the junction interface. We calculate
the junction conductance for a series of barrier strengths. In the case of
incoming electron with spin \sigma = 1 only for magnetic fields close to the
upper critical field H_{c2}, we obtain the so-called Andreev window i.e. the
energy interval in which the reflection probability is maximal, which in turn
is indicated by a peak in the conductance. The last result differs with other
non-self-consistent calculations existing in the literature.
