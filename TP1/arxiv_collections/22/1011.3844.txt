Experiments aimed at demonstrating Bose-Einstein condensation of excitons in
two types of experiments with bilayer structures (coupled quantum wells) are
reviewed, with an emphasis on the basic effects. Bose-Einstein condensation
implies the existence of a macroscopic coherence, also known as off-diagonal
long-range order, and proposed tests and past claims for coherence in these
excitonic systems are discussed.
