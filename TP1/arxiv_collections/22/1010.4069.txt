The detection of photons above 10 keV through MeV and GeV energies is
challenging due to the penetrating nature of the radiation, which can require
large detector volumes, resulting in correspondingly high background. In this
energy range, most detectors in space are either scintillators or solid-state
detectors. The choice of detector technology depends on the energy range of
interest, expected levels of signal and background, required energy and spatial
resolution, particle environment on orbit, and other factors. This section
covers the materials and configurations commonly used from 10 keV to > 1 GeV.
