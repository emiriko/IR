COMPASS is a multi-purpose fixed-target experiment at the CERN Super Proton
Synchrotron investigating the structure and spectrum of hadrons. One primary
goal is the search for new hadronic states, in particular spin-exotic mesons
and glueballs.
  After a short pilot run in 2004 with a 190 GeV/c $\pi^-$ beam on a Pb target,
which showed a significant spin-exotic $J^{PC} = 1^{-+}$ resonance consistent
with the controversial $\pi_1(1600)$, COMPASS collected large data samples with
negative and positive hadron beams on H$_2$, Ni, W, and Pb targets in 2008 and
2009.
  We present results from a partial-wave analysis of diffractive dissociation
of 190 GeV/c $\pi^-$ into $\pi^-\pi^+\pi^-$ final states on Pb and H$_2$
targets with squared four-momentum transfer in the range 0.1 < t' < 1
(GeV/c)^2. This reaction provides clean access to the light-quark meson
spectrum up to masses of 2.5 GeV/c^2. A first comparison of the data from Pb
and H$_2$ target shows a strong target dependence of the production strength of
states with spin projections $M = 0$ and 1 relative to the $a_2(1320)$.
  The 2004 Pb data were also analyzed in the region of small squared
four-momentum transfer t' < 10^{-2} (GeV/c)^2, where we observe interference of
diffractive production and photoproduction in the Coulomb-field of the Pb
nucleus.
