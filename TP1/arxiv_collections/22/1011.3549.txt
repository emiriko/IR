In the author's paper (Phys.Rev. D80, 041901(R) (2009)), the integrable
structure of the symmetry reduced bosonic dynamics in the low energy heterotic
string effective theory was presented. In that paper, for a complete system of
massless bosonic fields which includes metric, dilaton field, antisymmetric
tensor and any number of Abelian vector gauge fields, considered in the
space-time of $D$ dimensions with $D-2$ commuting isometries, the spectral
problem equivalent to the symmetry reduced dynamical equations was constructed.
However, the soliton generating transformations were described in that paper
only for the case in which all vector gauge fields vanish. In this paper, we
recall the integrability structure of these equations and describe some new
type of soliton generating transformations in which the vector gauge fields can
also enter the background (seed) solution as well as these can be generated
even on vacuum background by an appropriate choice of soliton parameters.
