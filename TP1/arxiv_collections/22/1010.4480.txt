In 1996/7, J. Bernstein observed that smooth or analytic supermanifolds that
mathematicians study are real or (almost) complex ones, while Minkowski
superspaces are completely different objects. They are what we call almost
real-complex supermanifolds, i.e., real supermanifolds with a non-integrable
distribution, the collection of subspaces of the tangent space, and in every
subspace a complex structure is given.
  An almost complex structure on a real supermanifold can be given by an even
or odd operator; it is complex (without "always") if the suitable superization
of the Nijenhuis tensor vanishes. On almost real-complex supermanifolds, we
define the circumcised analog of the Nijenhuis tensor. We compute it for the
Minkowski superspaces and superstrings. The space of values of the circumcised
Nijenhuis tensor splits into (indecomposable, generally) components whose
irreducible constituents are similar to those of Riemann or Penrose tensors.
The Nijenhuis tensor vanishes identically only on superstrings of
superdimension 1|1 and, besides, the superstring is endowed with a contact
structure. We also prove that all real forms of complex Grassmann algebras are
isomorphic although singled out by manifestly different anti-involutions.
