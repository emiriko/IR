We study numerically the SU(2) Landau gauge transverse and longitudinal gluon
propagators at non-zero temperatures T both in confinement and deconfinement
phases. The special attention is paid to the Gribov copy effects in the
IR-region. Applying powerful gauge fixing algorithm we find that the Gribov
copy effects for the transverse propagator D_T(p) are very strong in the
infrared, while the longitudinal propagator D_L(p) shows very weak (if any)
Gribov copy dependence. The value D_T(0) tends to decrease with growing lattice
size; however, D_T(0) is non-zero in the infinite volume limit, in disagreement
with the suggestion made in [1]. We show that in the infrared region D_T(p) is
not consistent with the pole-type formula not only in the deconfinement phase
but also for T < T_c. We introduce new definition of the magnetic infrared mass
scale ('magnetic screening mass') m_M. The electric mass m_E has been
determined from the momentum space longitudinal gluon propagator. We study also
the (finite) volume and temperature dependence of the propagators as well as
discretization errors.
