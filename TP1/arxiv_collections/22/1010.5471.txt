In the theory of social choice the research is focused around the projection
of individual preference orders to the social preference order. Also, the
justification of the preference order formalism begins with the concept of
utility i.e. an alternative is preferred to another one if the utility over the
first is higher then the utility over the second. In this paper is proposed an
ideal model of measuring utilities by considering individuals and alternatives
no more as atomic concepts but as being composed by other entities. Furthermore
is proposed a formal definition of evaluation processes based on utilities.
