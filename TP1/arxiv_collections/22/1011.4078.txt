We describe a new numerical algorithm for ray tracing in the external
spacetimes of spinning compact objects characterized by arbitrary quadrupole
moments. Such spacetimes describe non-Kerr vacuum solutions that can be used to
test the no-hair theorem in conjunction with observations of accreting black
holes. They are also appropriate for neutron stars with spin frequencies in the
300-600 Hz range, which are typical of the bursting sources in low-mass X-ray
binaries. We use our algorithm to show that allowing for the quadrupole moment
of the spacetime to take arbitrary values leads to observable effects in the
profiles of relativistic broadened fluorescent iron lines from geometrically
thin accretion disks.
