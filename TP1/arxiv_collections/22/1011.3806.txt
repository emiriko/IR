It was shown in [T. Morimae, Phys. Rev. A {\bf81}, 060307(R) (2010)] that the
gate fidelity of an inaccurate one-way quantum computation is upper bounded by
a decreasing function of the amount of entanglement in the register. This means
that a strong entanglement causes the low gate fidelity in the one-way quantum
computation with inaccurate measurements. In this paper, we derive similar
entanglement-fidelity relations for the inaccurate ancilla-driven quantum
computation. These relations again imply that a strong entanglement in the
register causes the low gate fidelity in the ancilla-driven quantum computation
if the measurements on the ancilla are inaccurate.
