We report meson spectra obtained by using valence overlap fermion propagators
generated on a background of 2+1 flavor domain wall fermion gauge
configurations on 16^3 X 32, 24^3 X 64 and 32^3 X 64 lattices. We use
many-to-all correlators with Z3 grid source and low eigenmode substitution
which is efficient in reducing errors for the hadron correlators. The
preliminary results on meson spectrum, a0 correlators, and charmonium hyperfine
splitting for three sea quark masses are reported here.
