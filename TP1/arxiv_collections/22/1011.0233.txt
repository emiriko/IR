The cardinal direction calculus (CDC) proposed by Goyal and Egenhofer is a
very expressive qualitative calculus for directional information of extended
objects. Early work has shown that consistency checking of complete networks of
basic CDC constraints is tractable while reasoning with the CDC in general is
NP-hard. This paper shows, however, if allowing some constraints unspecified,
then consistency checking of possibly incomplete networks of basic CDC
constraints is already intractable. This draws a sharp boundary between the
tractable and intractable subclasses of the CDC. The result is achieved by a
reduction from the well-known 3-SAT problem.
