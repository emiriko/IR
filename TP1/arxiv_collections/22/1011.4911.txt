The course of the Nile in northern Sudan follows a contorted path through
bedrocks, creating the Great Bend. Few years ago, the satellite images showed a
fertile strip of land with villages, where paleochannels of the river hosted
many fields with cultivations and archaeological sites. Now, a huge part of
this valley is under the waters of Merowe Dam reservoir. Comparing the images
of the region before and after the dam gates were closed, we can see that the
reservoir created itself through flooding the paleochannels.
