Lepton number violating processes are a typical problem in theories with a
low quantum gravity scale. In this paper we examine lepton number violation
(LNV) in theories with a saturated black hole bound on a large number of
species. Such theories have been advocated recently as a possible solution to
the hierarchy problem and an explanation of the smallness of neutrino masses.
Naively one would expect black holes to introduce TeV scale LNV operators, thus
generating unacceptably large rates of LNV processes. We show, however, that
this does not happen in this scenario due to a complicated compensation
mechanism between contributions of different Majorana neutrino states to these
processes. As a result rates of LNV processes are extremely small and far
beyond experimental reach, at least for the left-handed neutrino states.
