We study the evolution of entanglement, quantum correlation and classical
correlation for the one dimensional XY model in external transverse magnetic
field. The system is initialized in the full polarized state along the z axis,
after annealing, different sites will become entangled. We study the three
kinds of correlation for both the nearest and the next-nearest neighbor sites.
We find that for large anisotropy parameter the quantum phase transition can be
indicated by the dynamics of classical correlation between the nearest neighbor
sites. We find that the dynamics of entanglement for both the nearest and
next-nearest neighbor sites show significantly different behaviors with
different values of magnetic field. We also find that the evolution of quantum
correlation and classical correlation of the nearest neighbor sites are
obviously different from those of the next-nearest neighbor sites.
