In this paper, we consider rendering color videos using a non-photo-realistic
art form technique commonly called stippling. Stippling is the art of rendering
images using point sets, possibly with various attributes like sizes,
elementary shapes, and colors. Producing nice stippling is attractive not only
for the sake of image depiction but also because it yields a compact vectorial
format for storing the semantic information of media. Moreover, stippling is by
construction easily tunable to various device resolutions without suffering
from bitmap sampling artifacts when resizing. The underlying core technique for
stippling images is to compute a centroidal Voronoi tessellation on a
well-designed underlying density. This density relates to the image content,
and is used to compute a weighted Voronoi diagram. By considering videos as
image sequences and initializing properly the stippling of one image by the
result of its predecessor, one avoids undesirable point flickering artifacts
and can produce stippled videos that nevertheless still exhibit noticeable
artifacts. To overcome this, our method improves over the naive scheme by
considering dynamic point creation and deletion according to the current scene
semantic complexity, and show how to effectively vectorize video while
adjusting for both color and contrast characteristics. Furthermore, we explain
how to produce high quality stippled ``videos'' (eg., fully dynamic
spatio-temporal point sets) for media containing various fading effects, like
quick motions of objects or progressive shot changes. We report on practical
performances of our implementation, and present several stippled video results
rendered on-the-fly using our viewer that allows both spatio-temporal dynamic
rescaling (eg., upscale vectorially frame rate).
