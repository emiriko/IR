The rapid rotation (P=0.44 d) of the M dwarf V374Peg (M4) along with its
intense magnetic field point toward magneto-centrifugal acceleration of a
coronal wind. In this work, we investigate the structure of the wind of V374Peg
by means of 3D magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) numerical simulations. For the first
time, an observationally derived surface magnetic field map is implemented in
MHD models of stellar winds for a low mass star. We show that the wind of
V374Peg deviates greatly from a low-velocity, low-mass-loss rate solar-type
wind. We find general scaling relations for the terminal velocities, mass-loss
rates, and spin-down times of highly magnetized M dwarfs. In particular, for
V374Peg, our models show that terminal velocities across a range of stellar
latitudes reach ~(1500-2300) n_{12}^{-1/2} km/s, where n_{12} is the coronal
wind base density in units of 10^{12} cm^{-3}, while the mass-loss rates are
about 4 x 10^{-10} n_{12}^{1/2} Msun/yr. We also evaluate the angular-momentum
loss of V374Peg, which presents a rotational braking timescale ~28
n_{12}^{-1/2} Myr. Compared to observationally derived values from period
distributions of stars in open clusters, this suggests that V374Peg may have
low coronal base densities (< 10^{11} cm^{-3}). We show that the wind ram
pressure of V374Peg is about 5 orders of magnitude larger than for the solar
wind. Nevertheless, a small planetary magnetic field intensity (~ 0.1G) is able
to shield a planet orbiting at 1 AU against the erosive effects of the stellar
wind. However, planets orbiting inside the habitable zone of V374Peg, where the
wind ram pressure is higher, might be facing a more significant atmospheric
erosion. In that case, higher planetary magnetic fields of, at least, about
half the magnetic field intensity of Jupiter, are required to protect the
planet's atmosphere.
