Mechanisms of the formation and stability of sunspots are among the
longest-standing and intriguing puzzles of solar physics and astrophysics.
Sunspots are controlled by subsurface dynamics hidden from direct observations.
Recently, substantial progress in our understanding of the physics of the
turbulent magnetized plasma in strong-field regions has been made by using
numerical simulations and local helioseismology. Both the simulations and
helioseismic measurements are extremely challenging, but it becomes clear that
the key to understanding the enigma of sunspots is a synergy between models and
observations. Recent observations and radiative MHD numerical models have
provided a convincing explanation to the Evershed flows in sunspot penumbrae.
Also, they lead to the understanding of sunspots as self-organized magnetic
structures in the turbulent plasma of the upper convection zone, which are
maintained by a large-scale dynamics. Local helioseismic diagnostics of
sunspots still have many uncertainties, some of which are discussed in this
review. However, there have been significant achievements in resolving these
uncertainties, verifying the basic results by new high-resolution observations,
testing the helioseismic techniques by numerical simulations, and comparing
results obtained by different methods. For instance, a recent analysis of
helioseismology data from the Hinode space mission has successfully resolved
several uncertainties and concerns (such as the inclined-field and phase-speed
filtering effects) that might affect the inferences of the subsurface
wave-speed structure of sunspots and the flow pattern. It becomes clear that
for the understanding of the phenomenon of sunspots it is important to further
improve the helioseismology methods and investigate the whole life cycle of
active regions, from magnetic-flux emergence to dissipation.
