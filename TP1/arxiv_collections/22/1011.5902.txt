A numerical study is presented of one-dimensional and two-dimensional random
lasers as a function of the pumping rate above the threshold for lasing.
Depending on the leakiness of the cavity modes, we observe that the stationary
lasing regime becomes unstable above a second threshold. Coherent instabilities
are observed as self pulsation of the total output intensity, population
inversion, and polarization.
