We use the color-spin and flavor-spin interaction Hamiltonians with SU(3)
flavor symmetry breaking to obtain meson and baryon mass formulas. Adjusting
these masses with experimental masses we determine the constituent quark
masses. We discuss the constituent quark masses obtained from meson and baryon
mass fits. The results for constituent quark masses are very similar in case of
two different phenomenological models: Fermi-Breit and Glozman-Riska hyperfine
interactions.
