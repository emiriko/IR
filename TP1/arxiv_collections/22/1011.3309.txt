Boundary distance (BD) plotting is a technique for making orientation
invariant comparisons of the spatial distribution of biochemical markers within
and across cells/nuclei. Marker expression is aggregated over points with the
same distance from the boundary. We present a suite of tools for improved data
analysis and statistical inference using BD plotting. BD is computed using the
Euclidean distance transform after presmoothing and oversampling of nuclear
boundaries. Marker distribution profiles are averaged using smoothing with
linearly decreasing bandwidth. Average expression curves are scaled and
registered by x-axis dilation to compensate for uneven lighting and errors in
nuclear boundary marking. Penalized discriminant analysis is used to
characterize the quality of separation between average marker distributions. An
adaptive piecewise linear model is used to compare expression gradients in
intra, peri and extra nuclear zones. The techniques are illustrated by the
following: (a) a two sample problem involving a pair of voltage gated calcium
channels (Cav1.2 and AB70) marked in different cells; (b) a paired sample
problem of calcium channels (Y1F4 and RyR1) marked in the same cell.
