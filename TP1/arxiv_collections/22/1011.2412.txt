We consider the minimization of a p-Ginzburg-Landau energy functional over
the class of radially symmetric functions of degree one. We prove the existence
of a unique minimizer in this class, and show that its modulus is monotone
increasing and concave. We also study the asymptotic limit of the minimizers as
p \rightarrow \infty. Finally, we prove that the radially symmetric solution is
locally stable for $p$ in the interval $(2,4]$.
