A resolution of the St. Petersburg paradox is presented. In contrast to the
standard resolution, utility is not required. Instead, the time-average
performance of the lottery is computed. The final result can be phrased
mathematically identically to Daniel Bernoulli's resolution, which uses
logarithmic utility, but is derived using a conceptually different argument.
The advantage of the time resolution is the elimination of arbitrary utility
functions.
