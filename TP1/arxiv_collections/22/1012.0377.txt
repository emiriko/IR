The dynamics of the surface and inner atmosphere of the red supergiant star
Betelgeuse are the subject of numerous high angular resolution and
spectroscopic studies. Here, we present three-telescope interferometric data
obtained at 11.15 microns wavelength with the Berkeley Infrared Spatial
Interferometer (ISI), that probe the stellar surface continuum. We find
striking variability in the size, effective temperature, and degree of
asymmetry of the star over the years 2006-2009. These results may indicate an
evolving shell of optically thick material close to the stellar photosphere.
