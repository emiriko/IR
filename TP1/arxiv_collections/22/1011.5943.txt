In this paper, by virtue of the entangled state representation we concisely
derive some new operator identities regarding to two-variable Hermite
polynomial (TVHP). By them and the technique of integration within an ordered
product (IWOP) of operators we further derive new generating function formulas
of TVHP. They are useful in quantum optical theoretical calculations. It is
seen from this work that by combining the IWOP technique and quantum mechanical
representations one can derive some new integration formulas even without
really performing the integration.
