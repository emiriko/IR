It is generally recognized that main-belt asteroids (MBAs) and nuclei of
extinct comets are the two main sources for the Near-Earth-Asteroids (NEAs).
Theoretical studies of NEAs dynamics and numerical modelling of their orbital
motions showed that the resonance mechanism for supplying NEAs is quite
sufficient to sustain this population. Asteroid 1983 SA, also known as 3552 Don
Quixote, is one of Near Earth Asteroids (NEAs) and the most probable candidates
for NEAs of the cometary origin. In this work, an investigation on the
evolution of the orbit is done by using the SWIFT subroutine package, where the
gravitational perturbations of eight planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars,
Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune are considered. Migration of asteroid 3552
Don Quixote from Near Earth Asteroids (NEAs) to Jovian-crosser asteroid is
found.
