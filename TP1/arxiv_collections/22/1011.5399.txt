We present the full set of analytical solutions of the geodesic equations of
charged test particles in the Reissner-Nordstr\"om space-time in terms of the
Weierstra{\ss} $\wp$, $\sigma$ and $\zeta$ elliptic functions. Based on the
study of the polynomials in the $\vartheta$ and $r$ equations we characterize
the motion of test particles and discuss their properties. The motion of
charged test particles in the Reissner-Nordstr\"om space-time is compared with
the motion of neutral test particles in the field of a gravitomagnetic
monopole. Electrically or magnetically charged particles in the
Reissner-Nordstr\"om space-time with magnetic or electric charges,
respectively, move on cones similar to neutral test particles in the Taub-NUT
space-times.
