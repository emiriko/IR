We present a minimal model in which the Inverse See Saw is realized
dynamically. The two unity lepton number breaking term is induced at two-loop
level and is naturally around the keV scale, while right-handed neutrinos are
at the TeV scale. An interesting extension of the model is obtained by gauging
B-L: in this case anomaly cancellation has as direct consequence the presence
of a sterile neutrino at the MeV scale that may be a good Dark Matter
candidate. Moreover the new gauge boson Z' and the new neutral scalars may have
characteristic signatures at LHC.
