The Extended Burrows Wheeler transform (EBWT) helps to find the distance
between two sequences. Implementation of an existing algorithm takes
considerable amount of time for small size sequences. In this paper, we give a
parallel implementation of this algorithm using NVIDIA Compute Unified Device
Architecture (CUDA). We have obtained, on an average, a 2X improvement in the
performance.
