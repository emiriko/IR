We demonstrate that non-Abelian rotations within the degenerate groundstate
manifold of a set of Majorana fermions can be realized by the addition or
removal of single electrons, and propose an implementation using Coulomb
blockaded quantum dots. The exchange of electrons generates rotations similar
to braiding, though not in real space. Unlike braiding operations, rotations by
a continuum of angles are possible, while still being partially robust against
perturbations. The quantum dots can also be used for readout of the state of
the Majorana system via a charge measurement.
