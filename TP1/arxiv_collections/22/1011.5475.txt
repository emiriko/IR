We present the first stationary, axisymmetric neutron star models with
meridional circulation in general relativity. For that purpose, we developed
GRNS, a new code based on a fixed point iteration. We find a two-dimensional
set of meridional circulation modes, which differ by the number of vortices in
the stream lines of the neutron star fluid. For expected maximal meridional
circulation velocities of about 1000 km/s, the vortices cause surface
deformations of about a percent. The deformations depend on the shape of the
vortices close to the surface and increase with the meridional circulation
velocity. We also computed models of rotating neutron stars with meridional
circulation, where neither the surface rotates nor does the rotation velocity
exceed the circulation velocity.
