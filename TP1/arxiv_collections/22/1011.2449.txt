We study CP violation in the two-body decay of a scalar tau into a neutralino
and a tau, which should be probed at the LHC and ILC. From the normal tau
polarization, a CP asymmetry is defined which is sensitive to the CP phases of
the trilinear scalar coupling parameter $A_\tau$, the gaugino mass parameter
$M_1$, and the higgsino mass parameter $\mu$ in the stau-neutralino sector of
the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model. Asymmetries of more than 70% are
obtained in scenarios with strong stau mixing. As a result, detectable CP
asymmetries in stau decays at the LHC are found, motivating further detailed
experimental studies for probing the SUSY CP phases.
