In this paper we generalized the slave-particle technique to study the phase
diagram of the Hubbard model on honeycomb lattice which may contain charge
fluctuations. For large $U$, we have antiferromagnetic order phase. As we
decrease $U$ below $U_{c2}\simeq 3t$, the system undergoes a first order phase
transition into a gapped spin rotation invariant phase. Under a semiclassical
approximation of the slave-particle approach, we find that such phase breaks
the translation symmetry, the parity and the lattice rotation symmetry.
However, beyond the semiclassical approximation, a $Z_2$ spin liquid that does
not break any lattice symmetry is also possible.
