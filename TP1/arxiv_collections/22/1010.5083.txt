The adsorption of a single polymer to a flat surface in shear is investigated
using Brownian hydrodynamics simulations and scaling arguments. Competing
effects are disentangled: in the absence of hydrodynamic interactions, shear
drag flattens the chain and thus enhances adsorption. Hydrodynamic lift on the
other hand gives rise to long-ranged repulsion from the surface which preempts
the surface-adsorbed state via a discontinuous desorption transition, in
agreement with theoretical arguments. Chain flattening is dominated by
hydrodynamic lift, so overall, shear flow weakens the adsorption of flexible
polymers. Surface friction due to small-wavelength surface potential
corrugations is argued to weaken the surface attraction as well.
