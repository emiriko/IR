We construct Green's functions for divergence form, second order parabolic
systems in non-smooth time-varying domains whose boundaries are locally
represented as graph of functions that are Lipschitz continuous in the spatial
variables and 1/2-H\"older continuous in the time variable, under the
assumption that weak solutions of the system satisfy an interior H\"older
continuity estimate. We also derive global pointwise estimates for Green's
function in such time-varying domains under the assumption that weak solutions
of the system vanishing on a portion of the boundary satisfy a certain local
boundedness estimate and a local H\"older continuity estimate. In particular,
our results apply to complex perturbations of a single real equation.
