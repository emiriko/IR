The $\Delta^{++}$ and the $\Omega^-$ baryons have been used as the original
reason for the construction of the Quantum Chromodynamics theory of Strong
Interactions. The present analysis relies on the multiconfiguration structure
of states which are made of several Dirac particles. It is shown that this
property, together with the very strong spin-dependent interactions of quarks
provide an acceptable explanation for the states of these baryons and removes
the classical reason for the invention of color within Quantum Chromodynamics.
This explanation is supported by several examples that show a Quantum
Chromodynamics' inconsistency with experimental results. The same arguments
provide an explanation for the problem called the proton spin crisis.
