Flicker or 1/f noise in metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors
(MOSFETs) has been identified as the main source of noise at low frequency. It
often originates from an ensemble of a huge number of charges trapping and
detrapping. However, a deviation from the well-known model of 1/f noise is
observed for nanoscale MOSFETs and a new model is required. Here, we report the
observation of one-by-one trap activation controlled by the gate voltage in a
nanowire MOSFET and we propose a new low-frequency-noise theory for nanoscale
FETs. We demonstrate that the Coulomb repulsion between electronically charged
trap sites avoids the activation of several traps simultaneously. This effect
induces a noise reduction by more than one order of magnitude. It decreases
when increasing the electron density in the channel due to the electrical
screening of traps. These findings are technologically useful for any FETs with
a short and narrow channel.
