Some extensions of standard particle physics postulate that dark matter may
be partially composed of weakly interacting sterile neutrino particles that
have so far eluded detection. We use a short (~5 ks) archival X-ray observation
of Segue 1 obtained with the X-ray Telescope (XRT) onboard the Swift satellite
to exclude the presence of sterile neutrinos in the 1.6 - 14 keV mass range
down to a flux limit of 6 x 10^{-12} erg cm-2 s-1 within 67 pc of its centre.
With an estimated mass-to-light ratio of ~3400 Msun/Lsun, Segue 1 is the
darkest ultrafaint dwarf galaxy currently measured. Spectral analysis of the
Swift XRT data fails to find any non-instrumental spectral feature possibly
connected with the radiative decay of a dark matter particle. Accordingly, we
establish upper bounds on the sterile neutrino parameter space based on the
non-detection of emission lines in the spectrum. The present work provides the
most sensitive X-ray search for sterile neutrinos in a region with the highest
dark matter density yet measured.
