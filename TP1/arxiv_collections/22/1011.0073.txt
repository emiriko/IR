We have measured the differential cross section for the
$\gamma$$^3$He$\rightarrow \pi^+ t$ reaction. This reaction was studied using
the CEBAF Large Acceptance Spectrometer (CLAS) at Jefferson Lab. Real photons
produced with the Hall-B bremsstrahlung tagging system in the energy range from
0.50 to 1.55 GeV were incident on a cryogenic liquid $^3$He target. The
differential cross sections for the $\gamma$$^3$He$\rightarrow \pi^+ t$
reaction were measured as a function of photon-beam energy and pion-scattering
angle. Theoretical predictions to date cannot explain the large cross sections
except at backward angles, showing that additional components must be added to
the model.
