The process of dynamical reduction of the Vlasov-Maxwell equations leads to
the introduction of classical {\it zitterbewegung} effects in reduced plasma
dynamics. These effects manifest themselves in the form of an asymmetric
canonical energy-momentum tensor involving the decoupling of the reduced
kinetic momentum ${\bf p}$ from the reduced velocity ${\bf u}$ (i.e., ${\bf
u}\btimes{\bf p} \neq 0$) as well as reduced polarization and magnetization
effects. The reduced intrinsic torque generated by the antisymmetric part of
the canonical energy-momentum tensor, which is calculated from the reduced
ponderomotive potential, acts as the source for the intrinsic (spin) angular
momentum.
