Massive stars influence their parental molecular cloud, and it has long been
suspected that the development of hydrodynamical instabilities can compress or
fragment the cloud. Identifying such instabilities has proved difficult. It has
been suggested that elongated structures (such as the `pillars of creation')
and other shapes arise because of instabilities, but alternative explanations
are available. One key signature of an instability is a wave-like structure in
the gas, which has hitherto not been seen. Here we report the presence of
`waves' at the surface of the Orion molecular cloud near where massive stars
are forming. The waves seem to be a Kelvin-Helmholtz instability that arises
during the expansion of the nebula as gas heated and ionized by massive stars
is blown over pre-existing molecular gas.
