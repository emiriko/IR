We synthesize large-area graphene via atmospheric-pressure (AP) chemical
vapor deposition (CVD) on copper, and transfer to SiO2 wafers. In contrast to
low-pressure (LP) CVD on copper, optical contrast and atomic force microscopy
measurements show AP-CVD graphene contains significant multi-layer areas. Raman
spectroscopy always shows a single Lorentzian 2D peak, however systematic
differences are observed in the 2D peak energy, width, and intensity for
single- and multi-layer regions. We conclude that graphene multi-layers grown
by AP-CVD on Cu are rotationally disordered.
