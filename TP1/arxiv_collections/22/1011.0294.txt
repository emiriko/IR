We study phase separation and transient gelation in a mixture consisting of
polydisperse colloids and non-adsorbing polymers, where the ratio of the
average size of the polymer to that of the colloid is approximately 0.063.
Unlike what has been reported previously for mixtures with somewhat lower
colloid polydispersity, the addition of polymers does not expand the
fluid-solid coexistence region. Instead, we find a region of fluid-solid
coexistence which has an approximately constant width but an unexpected
re-entrant shape. We detect the presence of a metastable gas-liquid binodal,
which gives rise to two-stepped crystallization kinetics that can be
rationalized as the effect of fractionation. Finally, we find that the
separation into multiple coexisting solid phases at high colloid volume
fractions predicted by equilibrium statistical mechanics is kinetically
suppressed before the system reaches dynamical arrest.
