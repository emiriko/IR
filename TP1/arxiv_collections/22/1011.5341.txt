We discuss the distribution of the quark number over the gauge fields for QCD
at nonzero quark chemical potential. As the quark number operator is
non-hermitian, the distribution is over the complex plane. Moreover, because of
the fermion determinant, the distribution is not real and positive. The
computation is carried out within leading order chiral perturbation theory and
gives direct insight into the delicate cancellations that take place in
contributions to the total baryon number.
