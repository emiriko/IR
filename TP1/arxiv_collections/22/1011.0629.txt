Standard solar physics cannot account for the X-ray emission and other
puzzles, the most striking example being the solar corona mystery. The corona
temperature rise above the non-flaring magnetized sunspots, while the
photosphere just underneath becomes cooler, makes this mystery more intriguing.
The paradoxical Sun is suggestive of some sort of exotic solution, axions being
the (only?) choice for the missing ingredient. We present atypical axion
signatures, which depict solar axions with a rest mass max ~17 meV/c2. Then,
the Sun has been for decades the overlooked harbinger of new particle physics.
