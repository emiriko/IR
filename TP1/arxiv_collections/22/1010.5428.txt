The lattice implementation of monopole creation operator proves to have
problems related to bulk transitions that can possibly affect the
interpretation of its mean value as an order parameter for monopole
condensation. Preliminary evidence is presented that these unexpected
behaviours are in fact only due to lattice artefacts and do not spoil the
physical interpretation of the monopole operator.
