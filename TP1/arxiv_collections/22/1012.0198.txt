Phase-resolved observations of the solar-type star Ksi Bootis A were obtained
using the NARVAL spectropolarimeter at the Telescope Bernard Lyot (Pic du Midi,
France) during years 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010. The data sets enable us to
study both the rotational modulation and the long-term evolution of various
magnetic and activity tracers. Here, we focus on the large-scale photospheric
magnetic field (reconstructed by Zeeman-Doppler Imaging), the Zeeman broadening
of the FeI 846.84 nm magnetic line, and the chromospheric CaII H and H alpha
emission.
