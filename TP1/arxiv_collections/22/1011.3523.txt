Hierarchical models predict that massive early-type galaxies (mETGs) derive
from the most massive and violent merging sequences occurred in the Universe.
However, the role of wet, mixed, and dry major mergers in the assembly of mETGs
is questioned by some recent observations. We have developed a semi-analytical
model to test the feasibility of the major-merger origin hypothesis for mETGs,
just accounting for the effects on galaxy evolution of the major mergers
strictly reported by observations. The model proves that it is feasible to
reproduce the observed number density evolution of mETGs since z~1, just
accounting for the coordinated effects of wet/mixed/dry major mergers. It can
also reconcile the different assembly redshifts derived by hierarchical models
and by mass downsizing data for mETGs, just considering that a mETG observed at
a certain redshift is not necessarily in place since then. The model predicts
that wet major mergers have controlled the mETGs buildup since z~1, although
dry and mixed mergers have also played an essential role in it. The bulk of
this assembly took place at 0.7<z<1, being nearly frozen at z<~0.7 due to the
negligible number of major mergers occurred per existing mETG since then. The
model suggests that major mergers have been the main driver for the
observational migration of mass from the massive end of the blue galaxy cloud
to that of the red sequence in the last ~8 Gyr.
