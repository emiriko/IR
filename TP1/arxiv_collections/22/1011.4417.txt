We explore the consequences of treating the X(3872) meson as a tetraquark
bound state. As dynamical framework we employ a relativistic constituent quark
model which includes infrared confinement in an effective way. We calculate the
hadronic decay widths of the observed channels. For reasonable values of the
size parameter of the X(3872) we find consistency with the available
experimental data.
