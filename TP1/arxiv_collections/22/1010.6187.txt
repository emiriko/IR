From CCD observations of a fixed and large star field that contained the
binary TNO Orcus, we have been able to derive high-precision relative
astrometry and photometry of the Orcus system with respect to background stars.
The RA residuals of an orbital fit to the astrometric data revealed a
periodicity of 9.7+-0.3 days, which is what one would expect to be induced by
the known Orcus companion. The residuals are also correlated with the
theoretical positions of the satellite with regard to the primary. We therefore
have revealed the presence of Orcus' satellite in our astrometric measurements.
The photocenter motion is much larger than the motion of Orcus around the
barycenter, and we show here that detecting some binaries through a carefully
devised astrometric technique might be feasible with telescopes of moderate
size. We also analyzed the system's mid-term photometry to determine whether
the rotation could be tidally locked to the satellite's orbital period. We
found that a photometric variability of 9.7+-0.3 days is clear in our data, and
is nearly coincident with the orbital period of the satellite. We believe this
variability might be induced by the satellite's rotation. There is also a
slight hint for an additional small variability in the 10 hr range that was
already reported in the literature. This short-term variability would indicate
that the primary is not tidally locked and therefore the system would not have
reached a double synchronous state. Implications for the basic physical
properties of the primary and its satellite are discussed. From angular
momentum considerations we suspect that the Orcus satellite might have formed
from a rotational fission. This requires that the mass of the satellite would
be around 0.09 times that of the primary, close to the value that one derives
by using an albedo of 0.12 for the satellite and assuming equal densities for
both objects.
