We investigate whether a circumbinary gas disc can coalesce a supermassive
black hole binary system in the centre of a galaxy. This is known to be
problematic for a prograde disc. We show that in contrast, interaction with a
retrograde circumbinary disc is considerably more effective in shrinking the
binary because there are no orbital resonances. The binary directly absorbs
negative angular momentum from the circumbinary disc by capturing gas into a
disc around the secondary black hole, or discs around both holes if the binary
mass ratio is close to unity. In many cases the binary orbit becomes eccentric,
shortening the pericentre distance as the eccentricity grows. In all cases the
binary coalesces once it has absorbed the angular momentum of a gas mass
comparable to that of the secondary black hole. Importantly, this conclusion is
unaffected even if the gas inflow rate through the disc is formally
super--Eddington for either hole. The coalescence timescale is therefore always
$\sim M_2/\dot M$, where $M_2$ is the secondary black hole mass and $\dot M$
the inflow rate through the circumbinary disc.
