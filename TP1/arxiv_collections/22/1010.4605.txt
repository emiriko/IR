We present an implementation of the iterative flux-conserving Lucy-Richardson
(L-R) deconvolution method of image restoration for maps produced by the
Balloon-borne Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (BLAST). We have analyzed
its performance and convergence extensively through simulations and
cross-correlations of the deconvolved images with available highresolution
maps. We present new science results from two BLAST surveys, in the Galactic
regions K3-50 and IC 5146, further demonstrating the benefits of performing
this deconvolution.
  We have resolved three clumps within a radius of 4.'5 inside the star-forming
molecular cloud containing K3-50. Combining the well-resolved dust emission map
with available multi-wavelength data, we have constrained the Spectral Energy
Distributions (SEDs) of five clumps to obtain masses (M), bolometric
luminosities (L), and dust temperatures (T). The L-M diagram has been used as a
diagnostic tool to estimate the evolutionary stages of the clumps. There are
close relationships between dust continuum emission and both 21-cm radio
continuum and 12CO molecular line emission.
  The restored extended large scale structures in the Northern Streamer of IC
5146 have a strong spatial correlation with both SCUBA and high resolution
extinction images. A dust temperature of 12 K has been obtained for the central
filament. We report physical properties of ten compact sources, including six
associated protostars, by fitting SEDs to multi-wavelength data. All of these
compact sources are still quite cold (typical temperature below ~ 16 K) and are
above the critical Bonner-Ebert mass. They have associated low-power Young
Stellar Objects (YSOs). Further evidence for starless clumps has also been
found in the IC 5146 region.
