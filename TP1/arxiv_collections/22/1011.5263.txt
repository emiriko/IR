To take full advantage of the September 2008 opposition passage of the M-type
asteroid (216) Kleopatra, we have used near-infrared adaptive optics (AO)
imaging with the W.M. Keck II telescope to capture unprecedented high
resolution images of this unusual asteroid. Our AO observations with the W.M.
Keck II telescope, combined with Spitzer/IRS spectroscopic observations and
past stellar occultations, confirm the value of its IRAS radiometric radius of
67.5 km as well as its dog-bone shape suggested by earlier radar observations.
Our Keck AO observations revealed the presence of two small satellites in orbit
about Kleopatra (see Marchis et al., 2008). Accurate measurements of the
satellite orbits over a full month enabled us to determine the total mass of
the system to be 4.64+/-0.02 10^18 Kg. This translates into a bulk density of
3.6 +/-0.4 g/cm3, which implies a macroscopic porosity for Kleopatra of ~
30-50%, typical of a rubble-pile asteroid. From these physical characteristics
we measured its specific angular momentum, very close to that of a spinning
equilibrium dumbbell.
