The heavy-fermion metal YbRh2Si2 displays a field-driven quantum phase
transition where signatures of a Fermi-surface reconstruction have been
identified, often interpreted as breakdown of the Kondo effect. We argue that
instead many properties of the material can be consistently described assuming
a Zeeman-driven Lifshitz transition of narrow heavy-fermion bands. Using a
suitable quasiparticle model, we find a smeared jump in the Hall constant and
lines of maxima in susceptibility and specific heat, very similar to
experimental data. An intermediate non-Fermi liquid regime emerges due to the
small effective Fermi energy near the transition. Further experiments to
discriminate the different scenarios are proposed.
