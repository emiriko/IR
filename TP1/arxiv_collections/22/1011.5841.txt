This article concerns the resolution of impartial combinatorial games, and in
particular games that can be split in sums of independent positions. We prove
that in order to compute the outcome of a sum of independent positions, it is
always more efficient to compute separately the nimbers of each independent
position than to develop directly the game tree of the sum. The concept of
nimber is therefore inevitable to solve impartial games, even when we only try
to determinate the winning or losing outcome of a starting position. We also
describe algorithms to use nimbers efficiently and finally, we give a review of
the results obtained on two impartial games: Sprouts and Cram.
