A novel method for the direct correlation at the nanoscale of structural and
optical properties of single GaAs nanowires is reported. Nanowires consisting
of 100% wurtzite and nanowires presenting zinc-blende/wurtzite polytypism are
investigated by photoluminescence spectroscopy and transmission electron
microscopy. The photoluminescence of wurtzite GaAs is consistent with a band
gap of 1.5 eV. In the polytypic nanowires, it is shown that the regions that
are predominantly composed of either zinc-blende or wurtzite phase show
photoluminescence emission close to the bulk GaAs band gap, while regions
composed of a nonperiodic superlattice of wurtzite and zinc-blende phases
exhibit a redshift of the photoluminescence spectra as low as 1.455 eV. The
dimensions of the quantum heterostructures are correlated with the light
emission, allowing us to determine the band alignment between these two
crystalline phases. Our first-principles electronic structure calculations
within density functional theory, employing a hybrid-exchange functional,
predict band offsets and effective masses in good agreement with experimental
results.
