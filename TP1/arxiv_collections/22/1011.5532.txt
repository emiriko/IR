We analyze numerically localization of light in linear square waveguide
arrays restricted in one dimension (``ribbons''), whose boundaries are
disordered in propagation constant and/or coupling. We find that the disordered
boundary induces a localization tendency in the bulk even for relatively wide
ribbons.
