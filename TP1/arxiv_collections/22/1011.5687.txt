We consider propositional modal logic with two modal operators $\Box$ and
$\D$. In topological semantics $\Box$ is interpreted as an interior operator
and $\D$ as difference. We show that some important topological properties are
expressible in this language. In addition, we present a few logics and proofs
of f.m.p. and of completeness theorems.
