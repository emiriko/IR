We investigate the chromospheric evaporation in the flare of 2007 January 16
using line profiles observed by the EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) onboard
Hinode. Three points at flare ribbons of different magnetic polarities are
analyzed in detail. We find that the three points show different patterns of
upflows and downflows in the impulsive phase of the flare. The spectral lines
at the first point are mostly blue shifted, with the hotter lines showing a
dominant blue-shifted component over the stationary one. At the second point,
however, only weak upflows are detected; in stead, notable downflows appear at
high temperatures (up to 2.5-5.0 MK). The third point is similar to the second
one only that it shows evidence of multi-component downflows. While the
evaporated plasma falling back down as warm rain is a possible cause of the
redshifts at points 2 and 3, the different patterns of chromospheric
evaporation at the three points imply existence of different heating mechanisms
in the flaring active region.
