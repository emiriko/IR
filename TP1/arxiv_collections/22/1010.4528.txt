The results of Monte-Carlo simulations of electron-positron-photon cascades
initiated by slow electrons in circularly polarized fields of ultra-high
strength are presented and discussed. Our results confirm previous qualitative
estimations [A.M. Fedotov, et al., PRL 105, 080402 (2010)] of the formation of
cascades. This sort of cascades has revealed the new property of the
restoration of energy and dynamical quantum parameter due to the acceleration
of electrons and positrons by the field and may become a dominating feature of
laser-matter interactions at ultra-high intensities. Our approach incorporates
radiation friction acting on individual electrons and positrons.
