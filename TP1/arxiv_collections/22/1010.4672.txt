In this paper, we consider the problem of controller design using
approximately bisimilar abstractions with an emphasis on safety and
reachability specifications. We propose abstraction-based approaches to solve
both classes of problems. We start by synthesizing a controller for an
approximately bisimilar abstraction. Then, using a concretization procedure, we
obtain a controller for our initial system that is proved "correct by design".
We provide guarantees of performance by giving estimates of the distance of the
synthesized controller to the maximal (i.e the most permissive) safety
controller or to the time-optimal reachability controller. Finally, we use the
presented techniques combined with discrete approximately bisimilar
abstractions of switched systems developed recently, for switching controller
synthesis.
