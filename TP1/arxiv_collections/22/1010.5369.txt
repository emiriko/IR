Mass loss of red supergiants (RSG) is important for the evolution of massive
stars, but is not fully explained. Several empirical prescriptions have been
proposed, trying to express the mass-loss rate (Mdot) as a function of
fundamental stellar parameters (mass, luminosity, effective temperature). Our
goal is to test whether the de Jager et al. (1988) prescription, used in some
stellar evolution models, is still valid in view of more recent mass-loss
determinations. By considering 40 Galactic RSGs presenting an infrared excess
and an IRAS 60-mu flux larger than 2 Jy, and assuming a gas-to-dust mass ratio
of 200, it is found that the de Jager rate agrees within a factor 4 with most
Mdot estimates based on the 60-mu signal. It is also in agreement with 6 of the
only 8 Galactic RSGs for which Mdot can be measured more directly through
observations of the circumstellar gas. The two objects that do not follow the
de Jager prescription (by an order of magnitude) are mu Cep and NML Cyg. We
have also considered the RSGs of the Magellanic Clouds. Thanks to the works of
Groenewegen et al. (2009) and Bonanos et al. (2010), we find that the RSGs of
the SMC have Mdots consistent with the de Jager rate scaled by
(Z/Zsun)**(alpha), where Z is the metallicity and alpha is 0.7. The situation
is less clear for the LMC RSGs. In particular, for luminosties larger than
1.6E+05 Lsun, one finds numerous RSGs (except WOH-G64) having Mdot
significantly smaller than the de Jager rate, and indicating that Mdot would no
longer increase with L. Before this odd situation is confirmed through further
analysis of LMC RSGs, we suggest to keep the de Jager prescription unchanged at
solar metallicity in the stellar evolutionary models and to apply a
(Z/Zsun)**0.7 dependence.
