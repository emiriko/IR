We investigate the long-time properties of the Ising-Glauber model on a
periodic cubic lattice after a quench to zero temperature. In contrast to the
conventional picture from phase-ordering kinetics, we find: (i) Domains at long
time are highly interpenetrating and topologically complex, with average genus
growing algebraically with system size. (ii) The long-time state is almost
never static, but rather contains "blinker" spins that can flip ad infinitum
with no energy cost. (iii) The energy relaxation has a complex time dependence
with multiple characteristic time scales, the longest of which grows
exponentially with system size.
