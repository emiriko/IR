In this work we study an ultrastrong coupled qubit-cavity system subjected to
slow repeated measurements. We demonstrate that even under a few imperfect
measurements it is possible to detect transitions of the qubit from its free
ground state to the excited state. The excitation probability grows
exponentially fast in analogy with the quantum anti-Zeno effect. The dynamics
and physics described in this paper is accessible to current superconducting
circuit technology.
