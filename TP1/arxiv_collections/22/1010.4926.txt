This paper introduces QOperAv v1.5, a Java application available for free.
(Source code included in the distribution.) QOperAv is a "code generator" for
generating quantum circuits. The quantum circuits generated by QOperAv can be
used to evaluate with polynomial efficiency the average of $f(A)$ for some
simple (that is, computable with polynomial efficiency) function $f$ and a
Hermitian operator $A$, provided that we know how to compile $\exp(iA)$ with
polynomial efficiency. QOperAv implements an algorithm described in earlier
papers, that combines various standard techniques such as quantum phase
estimation and quantum multiplexors.
