We investigate the feasible limits for realising a continuously evaporated
atom laser with high-temperature sources. A plausible scheme for realising a
truly continuous atom laser is to outcouple atoms from a partially condensed
Bose gas, whilst continuously reloading the system with non-condensed thermal
atoms and performing evaporative cooling. Here we use quantum kinetic theory to
model this system and estimate feasible limits for the operation of such a
scheme. For sufficiently high temperatures, the figure of merit for the source
is shown to be the phase-space flux. The dominant process limiting the usage of
sources with low phase-space flux is the three-body loss of the condensed gas.
We conclude that certain double-magneto-optical trap (MOT) sources may produce
substantial mean condensate numbers through continuous evaporation, and provide
an atom laser source with a narrow linewidth and reasonable flux.
