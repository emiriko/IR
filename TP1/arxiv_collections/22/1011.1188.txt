We analyze a sample of 82850 stars from the RAVE survey, with well-determined
velocities and stellar parameters, to isolate a sample of 18026
high-probability thin-disc dwarfs within 600 pc of the Sun. We derive space
motions for these stars, and deduce the solar space velocity with respect to
the Local Standard of Rest. The peculiar solar motion we derive is in excellent
agreement in radial $U_{\odot}$ and vertical $W_{\odot}$ peculiar motions with
other recent determinations. Our derived tangential peculiar velocity,
$V_{\odot}$ agrees with very recent determinations, which favour values near 13
km s$^{-1}$, in disagreement with earlier studies. The derived values are not
significantly dependent on the comparison sample chosen, or on the method of
analysis. The local galaxy seems very well dynamically relaxed, in a near
symmetric potential.
