We interpret the dynamics of Supersymmetric QCD (SQCD) in terms of ideas
familiar from the hadronic world. Some mysterious properties of the
supersymmetric theory, such as the emergent magnetic gauge symmetry, are shown
to have analogs in QCD. On the other hand, several phenomenological concepts,
such as "hidden local symmetry" and "vector meson dominance," are shown to be
rigorously realized in SQCD. These considerations suggest a relation between
the flavor symmetry group and the emergent gauge fields in theories with a
weakly coupled dual description.
