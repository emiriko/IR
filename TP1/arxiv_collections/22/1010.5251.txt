We analyze the effect of a linear time-variation of the interaction strength
on a trapped one-dimensional Bose gas confined to an optical lattice. The
evolution of different observables such as the experimentally accessible onsite
particle distribution are studied as a function of the ramp time using
time-dependent exact diagonalization and density-matrix renormalization group
techniques. We find that the dynamics of a trapped system typically display two
regimes: for long ramp times, the dynamics are governed by density
redistribution, while at short ramp times, local dynamics dominate as the
evolution is identical to that of an homogeneous system. In the homogeneous
limit, we also discuss the non-trivial scaling of the energy absorbed with the
ramp time.
