We discuss results from simulations of black hole formation in failing
core-collapse supernovae performed with the code GR1D, a new open-source
Eulerian spherically-symmetric general-relativistic hydrodynamics code. GR1D
includes rotation in an approximate way (1.5D), comes with multiple
finite-temperature nuclear equations of state (EOS), and treats neutrinos in
the post-core-bounce phase via a 3-flavor leakage scheme and a heating
prescription. We chose the favored K_0=220 MeV-variant of the Lattimer & Swesty
(1990) EOS and present collapse calculations using the progenitor models of
Limongi & Chieffi (2006). We show that there is no direct (or ``prompt'') black
hole formation in the collapse of ordinary massive stars (8 M_Sun ~< M_ZAMS ~<
100 M_Sun) and present first results from black hole formation simulations that
include rotation.
