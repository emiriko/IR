We study the thermodynamic properties of horizons using the dynamical
description of the gravitational degrees of freedom at a horizon found in a
previous work. We use the action of the horizon degrees of freedom to posit an
ansatz Liouville action in the near-horizon region, and calculate the horizon
entropy using the Cardy formula. We also couple the gravitational degrees of
freedom at the horizon to a classical scalar background, and show that Hawking
radiation is produced.
