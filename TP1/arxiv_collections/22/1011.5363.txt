Jet-matter interaction remains a central question and a theoretical challenge
in heavy-ion physics and might become important in high-multiplicity events in
proton-proton collisions at LHC energies. Full jet measurement at LHC offer the
proper tool to investigate energy loss process and fragmentation of hard parton
in the medium. Since jet reconstruction will be constrained to small cone
sizes, then study of the connection between jets and surrounding environment
provides a further possibility to extend our exploration. We study jets at s =
(14 TeV)^2 and pp collisions at s = (7 TeV)^2. We analyze the flavor components
in jet-like environments. We introduce a definition for surrounding cones/belts
and investigate flavor dependence and correlation of different hadron species
produced in jets. Here, we focus on proton-triggered correlations. Our analysis
can be extended for heavy ion collisions.
