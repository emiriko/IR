We report the transport measurements on the InAs self-assembled quantum dots
(SAQDs) which have a unique structural zero-dimensionality, coupled to a
superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID). Owing to the SQUID
geometry, we directly observe a {\pi} phase shift in the current phase relation
and the negative supercurrent indicating {\pi} junction behavior by not only
tuning the energy level of SAQD by back-gate but also controlling the coupling
between SAQD and electrodes by side-gate. Our results inspire new future
quantum information devices which can link optical, spin, and superconducting
state.
