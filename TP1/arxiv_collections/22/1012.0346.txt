We analyze coordinated Hinode XRT and EIS observations of a non-flaring
active region to investigate the thermal properties of coronal plasma taking
advantage of the complementary diagnostics provided by the two instruments. In
particular we want to explore the presence of hot plasma in non-flaring
regions. Independent temperature analyses from the XRT multi-filter dataset,
and the EIS spectra, including the instrument entire wavelength range, provide
a cross-check of the different temperature diagnostics techniques applicable to
broad-band and spectral data respectively, and insights into cross-calibration
of the two instruments. The emission measure distribution, EM(T), we derive
from the two datasets have similar width and peak temperature, but show a
systematic shift of the absolute values, the EIS EM(T) being smaller than XRT
EM(T) by approximately a factor 2. We explore possible causes of this
discrepancy, and we discuss the influence of the assumptions for the plasma
element abundances. Specifically, we find that the disagreement between the
results from the two instruments is significantly mitigated by assuming
chemical composition closer to the solar photospheric composition rather than
the often adopted "coronal" composition (Feldman 1992). We find that the data
do not provide conclusive evidence on the high temperature (log T[K] >~ 6.5)
tail of the plasma temperature distribution, however, suggesting its presence
to a level in agreement with recent findings for other non-flaring regions.
