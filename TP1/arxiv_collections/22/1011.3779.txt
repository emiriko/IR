We study the orbits of vector spaces of skew-symmetric matrices of constant
rank 2r and type (N+1)x(N+1) under the natural action of SL(N+1), over an
algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. We give a complete
description of the orbits for vector spaces of dimension 2, relating them to
some 1-generic matrices of linear forms. We also show that, for each rank two
vector bundle on P^2 defining a triple Veronese embedding of P^2 in G(1,7),
there exists a vector space of 8 x 8 skew-symmetric matrices of constant rank 6
whose kernel bundle is the dual of the given rank two vector bundle.
