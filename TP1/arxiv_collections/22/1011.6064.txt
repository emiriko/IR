Inferring dynamic biochemical networks is one of the main challenges in
systems biology. Given experimental data, the objective is to identify the
rules of interaction among the different entities of the network. However, the
number of possible models fitting the available data is huge and identifying a
biologically relevant model is of great interest. Nested canalyzing functions,
where variables in a given order dominate the function, have recently been
proposed as a framework for modeling gene regulatory networks. Previously we
described this class of functions as an algebraic toric variety. In this paper,
we present an algorithm that identifies all nested canalyzing models that fit
the given data. We demonstrate our methods using a well-known Boolean model of
the cell cycle in budding yeast.
