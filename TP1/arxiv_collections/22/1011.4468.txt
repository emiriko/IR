In this talk, the performance comparison among superbeams (SB), beta beams
(BB), and the Neutrino Factory (NF) is discussed. The ingredients to such a
comparison are described, as well as we the optimization and status of BB and
NF are addressed. Finally, one example for the performance comparison is shown.
