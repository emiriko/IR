We present results of monomer-resolved Monte Carlo simulations for a system
of amphiphilic dendrimers of second generation. Our investigations validate a
coarse-grained level description based on the zero-density limit effective
pair-interactions for low and intermediate densities, which predicted the
formation of stable, finite aggregates in the fluid phase. Indeed, we find that
these systems form a homogeneous fluid for low densities, which on increasing
the density spontaneously transforms into a fluid of clusters of dendrimers.
Although these clusters are roughly spherical in nature for intermediate
densities, also more complex structures are detected for the highest densities
considered.
