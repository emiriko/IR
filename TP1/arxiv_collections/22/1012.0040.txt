A two dimensional spring-block type model is used to model capillarity driven
self-organization of nanobristles. The model reveals the role of capillarity
and van der Waals forces in the pattern formation mechanism. By taking into
account the relevant interactions several type of experimentally observed
patterns are qualitatively well reproduced. The model offers the possibility to
generate on computer novel nanobristle based structures, offering hints for
designing further experiments.
