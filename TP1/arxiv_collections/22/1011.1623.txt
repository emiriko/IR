We analyze the paper by Wazwaz and Mehanna [Wazwaz A.M., Mehanna M.S., A
variety of exact travelling wave solutions for the (2+1) -- dimensional Boiti
-- Leon -- Pempinelli equation, Appl. Math. Comp. 217 (2010) 1484 -- 1490].
Using the tanh -- coth method and the Exp -- function method the authors claim
that they have found exact solutions of the (2+1) -- dimensional Boiti -- Leon
-- Pempinelli equation. We demonstrate that the authors have obtained the exact
solutions of the well known nonlinear ordinary differential equation. We
illustrate that all solutions presented by the authors can be reduced to the
well-known solutions. Wazwaz and Mehanna made a number of typical mistakes in
finding exact solutions of nonlinear differential equations. Taking the results
of this paper we introduce the definition of unnecessary exact solutions for
the nonlinear ordinary differential equations.
