Density functional perturbation theory is used to analyze electron-phonon
interaction in bilayer graphene. The results show that phonon scattering in
bilayer graphene bears more resemblance with bulk graphite than monolayer
graphene. In particular, electron-phonon scattering in the lowest conduction
band is dominated by six lowest (acoustic and acoustic-like) phonon branches
with only minor contributions from optical modes. The total scattering rate at
low/moderate electron energies can be described by a simple two-phonon model in
the deformation potential approximation with effective constants Dac $\approx$
15 eV and Dop $\approx 2.8 \times 108$ eV/cm for acoustic and optical phonons,
respectively. With much enhanced acoustic phonon scattering, the low field
mobility of bilayer graphene is expected to be significantly smaller than that
of monolayer graphene.
