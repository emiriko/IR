Recently, we proposed an enhancement of the Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli formalism
for first-order perturbations about a Schwarzschild background that includes
first-order corrections due to the background black-hole spin. Using this
formalism, we investigate gravitational wave recoil effects from a spinning
black-hole binary system analytically. This allows us to better understand the
origin of the large recoils observed in full numerical simulation of spinning
black hole binaries.
