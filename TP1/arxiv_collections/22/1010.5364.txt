An ultra-high-energy cosmic ray (UHECR) colliding with the Earth's atmosphere
gives rise to an Extensive Air Shower (EAS). Due to different charge separation
mechanisms within the thin shower front coherent electromagnetic radiation will
be emitted within the radio frequency range. A small deviation of the index of
refraction from unity will give rise to Cherenkov radiation up to distances of
100 meters from the shower core and therefore has to be included in a complete
description of the radio emission from an EAS. Interference between the
different radiation mechanisms, in combination with different polarization
behavior will reflect in a lateral distribution function (LDF) depending on the
orientation of the observer and a non-trivial fall-off of the radio signal as
function of distance to the shower core.
