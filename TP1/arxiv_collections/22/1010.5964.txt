The present chapter [submitted for publication in "Fourier Transforms, Theory
and Applications", G. Nikolic (Ed.), InTech (Open Access Publisher), Vienna,
2011] is concerned with the introduction and study of a quadratic discrete
Fourier transform. This Fourier transform can be considered as a two-parameter
extension, with a quadratic term, of the usual discrete Fourier transform. In
the case where the two parameters are taken to be equal to zero, the quadratic
discrete Fourier transform is nothing but the usual discrete Fourier transform.
The quantum quadratic discrete Fourier transform plays an important role in the
field of quantum information. In particular, such a transformation in prime
dimension can be used for obtaining a complete set of mutually unbiased bases.
