We introduce a system of two linearly coupled discrete nonlinear
Schr\"{o}dinger equations (DNLSEs), with the coupling constant subject to a
rapid temporal modulation. The model can be realized in bimodal Bose-Einstein
condensates (BEC). Using an averaging procedure based on the multiscale method,
we derive a system of averaged (autonomous) equations, which take the form of
coupled DNLSEs with additional nonlinear coupling terms of the four-wave-mixing
type. We identify stability regions for fundamental onsite discrete symmetric
solitons (single-site modes with equal norms in both components), as well as
for two-site in-phase and twisted modes, the in-phase ones being completely
unstable. The symmetry-breaking bifurcation, which destabilizes the fundamental
symmetric solitons and gives rise to their asymmetric counterparts, is
investigated too. It is demonstrated that the averaged equations provide a good
approximation in all the cases. In particular, the symmetry-breaking
bifurcation, which is of the pitchfork type in the framework of the averaged
equations, corresponds to a Hopf bifurcation in terms of the original system.
