We present an effective theory approach for a model with a left-right
symmetric flavour group broken only by the Yukawa couplings. An underlying
SU(2)_L x SU(2)_R x U(1)_{B-L} global symmetry is assumed without specifying
the fundamental theory. The model is motivated by the fact that the |V_{ub}|
problem can be solved by assuming the existence of right-handed (RH) currents.
In this framework the flavour mixing in the RH sector is given by a new mixing
matrix. After a short introduction of the model, we show how this RH mixing
matrix can be determined by theory, experimental data and phenomenological
constraints. We summarize the results of the RH contribution to flavour mixing
in Delta F=2 processes. Furthermore we briefly discuss Z -> b bbar and the rare
decays B_{s,d} -> mu+ mu-, B -> {X_s,K,K*} nu nubar and K -> pi nu nubar with
corresponding correlations.
