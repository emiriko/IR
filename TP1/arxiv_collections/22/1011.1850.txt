The technique of projecting the four-dimensional two-body Bethe-Salpeter
equation onto the three-dimensional Light-Front hypersurface, combined with the
quasi-potential approach, is briefly illustrated, by placing a particular
emphasis on the relation between the projection method and the effective
dynamics of the valence component of the Light-Front wave function. Some
details on how to construct the Fock expansion of both i) the Light-Front
effective interaction and ii) the electromagnetic current operator, satisfying
the proper Ward-Takahashi identity, will be presented, addressing the relevance
of the Fock content in the operators living onto the Light-Front hypersurface.
  Finally, the generalization of the formalism to the three-particle case will
be outlined.
