The analysis of complex multiphysics astrophysical simulations presents a
unique and rapidly growing set of challenges: reproducibility, parallelization,
and vast increases in data size and complexity chief among them. In order to
meet these challenges, and in order to open up new avenues for collaboration
between users of multiple simulation platforms, we present yt (available at
http://yt.enzotools.org/), an open source, community-developed astrophysical
analysis and visualization toolkit. Analysis and visualization with yt are
oriented around physically relevant quantities rather than quantities native to
astrophysical simulation codes. While originally designed for handling Enzo's
structure adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) data, yt has been extended to work
with several different simulation methods and simulation codes including Orion,
RAMSES, and FLASH. We report on its methods for reading, handling, and
visualizing data, including projections, multivariate volume rendering,
multi-dimensional histograms, halo finding, light cone generation and
topologically-connected isocontour identification. Furthermore, we discuss the
underlying algorithms yt uses for processing and visualizing data, and its
mechanisms for parallelization of analysis tasks.
