Epitaxial graphene grown on transition metal surfaces typically exhibits a
moir\'e pattern due to the lattice mismatch between graphene and the underlying
metal surface. We use both scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and atomic force
microscopy (AFM) experiments to probe the electronic and topographic contrast
of the graphene moir\'e on the Ir(111) surface. While STM topography is
influenced by the local density of states close to the Fermi energy and the
local tunneling barrier height, AFM is capable of yielding the 'true' surface
topography once the background force arising from the van der Waals (vdW)
interaction between the tip and the substrate is taken into account. We observe
a moir\'e corrugation of 35$\pm$10 pm, where the graphene-Ir(111) distance is
the smallest in the areas where the graphene honeycomb is atop the underlying
iridium atoms and larger on the fcc or hcp threefold hollow sites.
