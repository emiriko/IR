High-rate space-time block codes (STBC with code rate > 1) in multi-input
multi-output (MIMO) systems are able to provide both spatial multiplexing gain
and diversity gain, but have high maximum likelihood (ML) decoding complexity.
Since group-decodable (quasi-orthogonal) code structure can reduce the decoding
complexity, we present in this paper systematic methods to construct
group-decodable high-rate STBC with full symbol-wise diversity gain for
arbitrary transmit antenna number and code length. We show that the proposed
group-decodable STBC can achieve high code rate that increases almost linearly
with the transmit antenna number, and the slope of this near-linear dependence
increases with the code length. Comparisons with existing low-rate and
high-rate codes (such as orthogonal STBC and algebraic STBC) are conducted to
show the decoding complexity reduction and good code performance achieved by
the proposed codes.
