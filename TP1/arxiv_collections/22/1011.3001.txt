We study the electric conductivity of the vacuum of quenched SU(2) lattice
gauge theory induced by the magnetic field B as a function of the bare quark
mass m. The conductivity grows as the quark mass decreases. Simplest power-like
fit indicates that the conductivity behaves as B/sqrt(m). We discuss the
implications of this result for dilepton angular distributions in heavy ion
collisions.
