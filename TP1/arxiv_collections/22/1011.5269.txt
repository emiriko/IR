We consider wall-crossing phenomena associated to the counting of D2-branes
attached to D4-branes wrapping lagrangian cycles in Calabi-Yau manifolds, both
from M-theory and matrix model perspective. Firstly, from M-theory viewpoint,
we review that open BPS generating functions in various chambers are given by a
restriction of the modulus square of the open topological string partition
functions. Secondly, we show that these BPS generating functions can be
identified with integrands of matrix models, which naturally arise in the free
fermion formulation of corresponding crystal models. A parameter specifying a
choice of an open BPS chamber has a natural, geometric interpretation in the
crystal model. These results extend previously known relations between open
topological string amplitudes and matrix models to include chamber dependence.
