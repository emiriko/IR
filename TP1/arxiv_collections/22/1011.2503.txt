We show that if G is a finite group then no chain of modular elements in its
subgroup lattice L(G) is longer than a chief series. Also, we show that if G is
a nonsolvable finite group then every maximal chain in L(G) has length at least
two more than that of the chief length of G, thereby providing a converse of a
result of J. Kohler. Our results enable us to give a new characterization of
finite solvable groups involving only the combinatorics of subgroup lattices.
Namely, a finite group G is solvable if and only if L(G) contains a maximal
chain X and a chain M consisting entirely of modular elements, such that X and
M have the same length.
