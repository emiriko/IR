We consider the possible pattern of the overall spiral structure of the
Galaxy, using data on the distribution of neutral (atomic), molecular, and
ionized hydrogen, on the base of the hypothesis of the spiral structure being
symmetric, i.e. the assumption that spiral arms are translated into each other
for a rotation around the galactic center by 180{\deg} (a two-arm pattern) or
by 90{\deg} (a four-arm pattern). We demonstrate that, for the inner region,
the observations are best represented with a four-arm scheme of the spiral
pattern, associated with all-Galaxy spiral density waves. The basic position is
that of the Carina arm, reliably determined from distances to HII regions and
from HI and H2 radial velocities. This pattern is continued in the quadrants
III and IV with weak outer HI arms; from their morphology, the Galaxy should be
considered an asymmetric multi-arm spiral. The kneed shape of the outer arms
that consist of straight segments can indicate that these arms are transient
formations that appeared due to a gravitational instability in the gas disk.
The distances between HI superclouds in the two arms that are the brightest in
neutral hydrogen, the Carina arm and the Cygnus (Outer) arm, concentrate to two
values, permitting to assume the presence of a regular magnetic field in these
arms.
