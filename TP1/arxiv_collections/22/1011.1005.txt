Highly sensitive and precise X-ray imaging from Chandra, combined with the
superb spatial resolution of HST optical images, dramatically enhances our
empirical understanding of compact binaries such as cataclysmic variables and
low mass X-ray binaries, their progeny, and other stellar X-ray source
populations deep into the cores of globular clusters. Our Chandra X-ray images
of the globular cluster NGC 362 reveal 100 X-ray sources, the bulk of which are
likely cluster members. Using HST color-magnitude and color-color diagrams, we
quantitatively consider the optical content of the NGC 362 Chandra X-ray error
circles, especially to assess and identify the compact binary population in
this condensed-core globular cluster. Despite residual significant crowding in
both X-rays and optical, we identify an excess population of H{\alpha}-emitting
objects that is statistically associated with the Chandra X-ray sources. The
X-ray and optical characteristics suggest that these are mainly cataclysmic
variables, but we also identify a candidate quiescent low mass X-ray binary. A
potentially interesting and largely unanticipated use of observations such as
these may be to help constrain the macroscopic dynamic state of globular
clusters.
