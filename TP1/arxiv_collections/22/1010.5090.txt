Semi-classical states for the Wheeler-DeWitt equation of a Bianchi type I
model in the presence of a scalar field are analyzed. It is outlined how this
scheme can effectively describe more general situations, where the curvature of
the Bianchi type IX model and a proper potential term for the scalar field are
present. The introduction of a cosmological constant term accounts for the
quasi-isotropization mechanism which bridges the proposed framework with a late
isotropic phase. This result makes the semi-classical Bianchi I model a
plausible scenario for the Universe pre-inflationary phase.
