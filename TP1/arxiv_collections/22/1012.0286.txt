We perform a global chi^2-analysis of nuclear parton distribution functions
using data from charged current neutrino-nucleus deep-inelastic scattering
(DIS), charged-lepton-nucleus DIS, and the Drell-Yan (DY) process. We show that
the nuclear corrections in nu-A DIS are not compatible with the predictions
derived from l^+A DIS and DY data. We quantify this result using a
hypothesis-testing criterion based on the chi^2 distribution which we apply to
the total chi^2 as well as to the chi^2 of the individual data sets. We find
that it is not possible to accommodate the data from nu-A and l^+A DIS by an
acceptable combined fit. Our result has strong implications for the extraction
of both nuclear and proton parton distribution functions using combined
neutrino and charged-lepton data sets.
