Discharging a liquid from a nozzle at sufficient large velocity leads to a
continuous jet that due to capillary forces breaks up into droplets. Here we
investigate the formation of microdroplets from the breakup of micron-sized
jets with ultra high-speed imaging. The diminutive size of the jet implies a
fast breakup time scale $\tau_\mathrm{c} = \sqrt{\rho r^3 / \gamma}$ of the
order of 100\,ns{}, and requires imaging at 14 million frames per second. We
directly compare these experiments with a numerical lubrication approximation
model that incorporates inertia, surface tension, and viscosity [Eggers and
Dupont, J. Fluid Mech. 262, 205 (1994); Shi, Brenner, and Nagel, Science 265,
219 (1994)]. The lubrication model allows to efficiently explore the parameter
space to investigate the effect of jet velocity and liquid viscosity on the
formation of satellite droplets. In the phase diagram we identify regions where
the formation of satellite droplets is suppressed. We compare the shape of the
droplet at pinch-off between the lubrication approximation model and a boundary
integral (BI) calculation, showing deviations at the final moment of the
pinch-off. Inspite of this discrepancy, the results on pinch-off times and
droplet and satellite droplet velocity obtained from the lubrication
approximation agree with the high-speed imaging results.
