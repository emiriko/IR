Temperature-dependent, in-plane, thermoelectric power (TEP) data are
presented for Ba(Fe1-xRux)2As2 (0 < x < 0.36) single crystals. The previously
outlined x - T phase diagram for this system is confirmed. The analysis of TEP
evolution with Ru-doping suggests significant changes in the electronic
structure, correlations and/or scattering occurring near ~7% and ~30% of
Ru-doping levels. These results are compared with an extended set of TEP data
for the electron-doped Ba(Fe1-xCox)2As2 series.
