The gluonic action density is calculated in static mesons at finite
temperature just below the deconfinement point. Our focus is to elucidate the
role of vacuum ultraviolet fluctuations which are filtered using an improved
smearing algorithm. In the intermediate source separation distance, where the
free string picture poorly describes the flux tube width profile, we find upon
reducing the vacuum action towards the classical instanton vacuum, the
characteristics of the flux tube converge and compare favorably with the
predictions of the free bosonic string. This result establishes a connection
between the free string action and vacuum gauge fields and reveals the
important role of ultraviolet physics in understanding the lattice data at this
temperature scale. As a by-product of these calculations, we find the
broadening of the QCD flux tube to be independent of the ultraviolet filtering
at large distances. Our results exhibit a linearly divergent pattern in
agreement with the string picture predictions.
