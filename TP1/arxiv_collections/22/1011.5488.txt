We present two issues here: (i) that in situation when total energy is kept
constant recently proposed fluctuations of volume ensemble is equivalent to the
approach using Tsallis statistics with fluctuating temperature and (ii) that
the later (in which fluctuations are described by the nonextensivity parameter
q) leads to the observed experimentally sum rule connecting fluctuations of
different physical observables.
