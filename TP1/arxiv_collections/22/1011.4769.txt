We investigate the resonant leptogenesis scenario in the minimal B-L extended
standard model(SM) with the B-L symmetry breaking at the TeV scale. Through
detailed analysis of the Boltzmann equations, we show how much the resultant
baryon asymmetry via leptogenesis is enhanced or suppressed, depending on the
model parameters, in particular, the neutrino Dirac Yukawa couplings and the
TeV-scale Majorana masses of heavy degenerate neutrinos. In order to consider a
realistic case, we impose a simple ansatz for the model parameters and analyze
the neutrino oscillation parameters and the baryon asymmetry via leptogenesis
as a function of only a single CP-phase. We find that for a fixed CP-phase all
neutrino oscillation data and the observed baryon asymmetry of the present
universe can be simultaneously reproduced.
