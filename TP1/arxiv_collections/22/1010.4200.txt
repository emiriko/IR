The latest results from PAMELA and FERMI experiments confirm the necessity to
improve theoretical models of production and propagation of galactic electrons
and positrons. There are many possible explanations for the positron excess
observed at energies larger than 10 GeV and for some features around 1 TeV in
the total flux of electrons and positrons. Supernovae are astrophysical objects
with the potential to explain these observations. In this work, we present an
updated study of the astrophysical sources of lepton cosmic rays and the
possible and the possible explanation of the anomalies in terms of
astrophysical sources.
