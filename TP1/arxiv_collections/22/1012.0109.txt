For a generic anti-canonical hypersurface in each smooth toric Fano 4-fold
with rank 2 Picard group, we prove there exist three isolated rational curves
in it. Moreover, for all these 4-folds except one, the contractions of generic
anti-canonical hypersurfaces along the three rational curves can be deformed to
smooth threefolds diffeomorphic to connected sums of S^{3} \times S^{3}. In
this manner, we obtain complex structures with trivial canonical bundles on
some connected sums of S^{3} \times S^{3}. This construction is an analogue of
that in Friedman [7], Lu and Tian [12] which used only quintics in P^{4}.
