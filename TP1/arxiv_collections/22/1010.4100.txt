Brownian motion of single particles with various masses M and diameters D is
studied by molecular dynamics simulations. Besides the momentum
auto-correlation function of the Brownian particle the memory function and the
fluctuating force which enter the generalized Langevin equation of the Brownian
particle are determined and their dependence on mass and diameter are
investigated for two different fluid densities. Deviations of the fluctuating
force distribution from a Gaussian form are observed for small particle
diameters. For heavy particles the deviations of the fluctuating force from the
total force acting on the Brownian particle decrease linearly with the mass
ratio m/M where m denotes the mass of a fluid particle.
