The bulk viscosity of cold, dense three-flavor quark matter is studied as a
function of temperature and the amplitude of density oscillations. The study is
also extended to the case of two different types of anharmonic oscillations of
density. We point several qualitative effects due to the anharmonicity,
although quantitatively they appear to be relatively small. We also find that,
in most regions of the parameter space, with the exception of the case of a
very large amplitude of density oscillations (i.e. 10% and above), nonlinear
effects and anharmonicity have a small effect on the interplay of the
nonleptonic and semileptonic processes in the bulk viscosity.
