An experimental scheme is suggested that permits a direct measure of
entanglement in a two-qubit cavity system. It is realized in the cavity-QED
technology utilizing atoms as flying qubits. With this scheme we generate two
different measures of entanglement, namely logarithmic negativity and
concurrence. The phenomenon of sudden death entanglement (ESD) in a bipartite
system subjected to dissipative environment is examined. We show that the
sudden death time of the entangled states depends on the initial preparation of
the entangled state and the temperature of the reservoir.
