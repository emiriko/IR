Recent observational results provide possible evidence that binary black
holes (BBHs) exist in the center of giant galaxies and may merge to form a
supermassive black hole in the process of their evolution. We first detected a
periodic flux variation on a cycle of $93\pm1$ days from the 3-mm monitor
observations of a giant elliptical galaxy \object{3C 66B} for which an orbital
motion with a period of $1.05\pm0.03$ years had been already observed. The
detected signal period being shorter than the orbital period can be explained
by taking into consideration the Doppler-shifted modulation due to the orbital
motion of a BBH. Assuming that the BBH has a circular orbit and that the jet
axis is parallel to the binary angular momentum, our observational results
demonstrate the presence of a very close BBH that has the binary orbit with an
orbital period of $1.05\pm0.03$ years, an orbital radius of $(3.9\pm1.0) \times
10^{-3}$ pc, an orbital separation of $(6.1^{+1.0}_{-0.9}) \times 10^{-3}$ pc,
the larger black hole mass of $(1.2^{+0.5}_{-0.2}) \times 10^9$ $M_{\sun}$, and
the smaller black hole mass of $(7.0^{+4.7}_{-6.4}) \times 10^8$ $M_{\sun}$.
The BBH decay time of $(5.1^{+60.5}_{-2.5})\times 10^2$ years provides evidence
for the occurrence of black hole mergers. This Letter will demonstrate the
interesting possibility of black hole collisions to form a supermassive black
hole in the process of evolution, one of the most spectacular natural phenomena
in the universe.
