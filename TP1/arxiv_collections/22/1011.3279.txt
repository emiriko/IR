Spam messes up user's inbox, consumes network resources and spread worms and
viruses. Spam is flooding of unsolicited, unwanted e mail. Spam in blogs is
called blog spam or comment spam.It is done by posting comments or flooding
spams to the services such as blogs, forums,news,email archives and guestbooks.
Blog spams generally appears on guestbooks or comment pages where spammers fill
a comment box with spam words. In addition to wasting user's time with unwanted
comments, spam also consumes a lot of bandwidth. In this paper, we propose a
software tool to prevent such blog spams by using Bayesian Algorithm based
technique. It is derived from Bayes' Theorem. It gives an output which has a
probability that any comment is spam, given that it has certain words in it.
With using our past entries and a comment entry, this value is obtained and
compared with a threshold value to find if it exceeds the threshold value or
not. By using this concept, we developed a software tool to block comment spam.
The experimental results show that the Bayesian based tool is working well.
This paper has the major findings and their significance of blog spam filter.
