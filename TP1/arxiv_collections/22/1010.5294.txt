Magnetic measurements up to 1000 K have been performed on hydrothermally
synthesized $\alpha$-Fe$_{2}$O$_{3}$ nanoparticles (60 nm) using a Quantum
Design vibrating sample magnetometer. A high vacuum environment
(1$\times$10$^{-5}$ torr) during the magnetic measurement up to 1000 K leads to
a complete reduction of $\alpha$-Fe$_{2}$O$_{3}$ to Fe$_{3}$O$_{4}$. This
precludes the determination of the N\'eel temperature for the
$\alpha$-Fe$_{2}$O$_{3}$ nanoparticles. In contrast, coating
$\alpha$-Fe$_{2}$O$_{3}$ nanoparticles with SiO$_{2}$ stabilizes the
$\alpha$-Fe$_{2}$O$_{3}$ phase up to 930 K, which allows us to determine the
N\'eel temperature of the $\alpha$-Fe$_{2}$O$_{3}$ nanoparticles for the first
time. The N\'eel temperature of the 60-nm $\alpha$-Fe$_{2}$O$_{3}$
nanoparticles is found to be 945 K, about 15 K below the bulk value. The small
reduction of the N\'eel temperature of the $\alpha$-Fe$_{2}$O$_{3}$
nanoparticles is consistent with a finite-size scaling theory. Our current
results also show that coating nanoparticles with SiO$_{2}$ can effectively
protect nanoparticles from oxidation or reduction, which is important to
technological applications.
