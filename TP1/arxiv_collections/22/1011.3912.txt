The semi-automatic or automatic synthesis of robot controller software is
both desirable and challenging. Synthesis of rather simple behaviors such as
collision avoidance by applying artificial evolution has been shown multiple
times. However, the difficulty of this synthesis increases heavily with
increasing complexity of the task that should be performed by the robot. We try
to tackle this problem of complexity with Artificial Homeostatic Hormone
Systems (AHHS), which provide both intrinsic, homeostatic processes and
(transient) intrinsic, variant behavior. By using AHHS the need for pre-defined
controller topologies or information about the field of application is
minimized. We investigate how the principle design of the controller and the
hormone network size affects the overall performance of the artificial
evolution (i.e., evolvability). This is done by comparing two variants of AHHS
that show different effects when mutated. We evolve a controller for a robot
built from five autonomous, cooperating modules. The desired behavior is a form
of gait resulting in fast locomotion by using the modules' main hinges.
