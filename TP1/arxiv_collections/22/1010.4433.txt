Valence-shell nucleon knock-out experiments, such as 12C(e,e'p)11B, measure
less strength then is predicted by independent particle shell model
calculations. The theoretical solution to this problem is to include the
correlations between the nucleons in the nucleus in the calculations. Motivated
by these results, many electron scattering experiments have tried to directly
observe these correlations in order to gain new insight into the short-range
part of the nucleon-nucleon potential. Unfortunately, many competing mechanisms
can cause the same observable final-state as an initial-state correlation,
making truly isolating the signal extremely challenging. This paper reviews the
recent experimental evidence for short-range correlations, as well as explores
the possibility that such correlations are responsible for the EMC effect in
the 0.3 < xB < 0.7 deep inelastic scattering ratios.
