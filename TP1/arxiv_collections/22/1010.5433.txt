We present our implementation of the RHMC algorithm for staggered fermions on
Graphics Processing Units using the NVIDIA CUDA programming language. While
previous studies exclusively deal with the Dirac matrix inversion problem, our
code performs the complete MD trajectory on the GPU. After pointing out the
main bottlenecks and how to circumvent them, we discuss the performance of our
code.
