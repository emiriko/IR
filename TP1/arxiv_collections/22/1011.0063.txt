The central problem of fully developed turbulence is the energy cascading
process. It has revisited all attempts at a full physical understanding or
mathematical formulation. The main reason for this failure are related to the
large hierarchy of scales involved, the highly nonlinear character inherent in
the Navier-Stokes equations, and the spatial intermittency of the dynamically
active regions. Richardson has described the interplay between large and small
scales and the phenomena so described are known as the Richardson cascade. This
local interplay also forms the basis of a theory by Kolmogorov. In this letter,
we use the explicit map method to analyze the nonlinear dynamical behavior for
cascade in isotropic turbulence. This deductive scale analysis is shown to
provide the first visual evidence of the celebrated Richardson cascade, and
reveals in particular its multiscale character. The results also indicate that
the energy cascading process has remarkable similarities with the deterministic
construction rules of the logistic map. Cascade of period-doubling bifurcations
have been seen in this isotropic turbulent systems that exhibit chaotic
behavior. The `cascade' appears as an infinite sequence of period-doubling
bifurcations.
