Supersymmetry (SUSY) and supersymmetric field theories are an interesting
topic for numerical lattice simulations. Similar to the chiral symmetry there
is also no local realization of (interacting) supersymmetry on the lattice. I
briefly review the basic reasons for the breaking of supersymmetry. One attempt
to solve the problem uses a Ginsparg-Wilson relation for supersymmetry.
However, apart from the free theory, a solution of this relation has so far not
been found. For supersymmetric Yang-Mills (SYM) theory a fine-tuning of the
bare gluino mass is enough to arrive at a supersymmetric continuum limit. The
last part of this work contains a short status report of recent SYM
simulations.
