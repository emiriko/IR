We give one more interpretation of the symbolic formulae $U(-N)=U(N)$ and
$Sp(-2N)=SO(2N)$ by comparing the values of certain Casimir operators in the
corresponding tensor representations. We show also that such relations can be
extended to the classical symmetric spaces using Macdonald duality for Jack and
Jacobi symmetric functions.
