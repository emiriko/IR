Strange quark content of the nucleon is calculated in dynamical lattice QCD
employing the overlap fermion formulation. For this quantity, exact chiral
symmetry guaranteed by the Ginsparg-Wilson relation is crucial to avoid large
contamination due to a possible operator mixing with $\bar{u}u+\bar{d}d$. Gauge
configurations are generated with two dynamical flavors on a 16^3 x 32 lattice
at a lattice spacing a \simeq 0.12fm. We directly calculate the relevant
three-point function on the lattice including a disconnected strange quark loop
utilizing the techniques of all-to-all quark propagator and low-mode averaging.
Our result f_{T_s} = 0.032(8)(22), is in good agreement with our previous
indirect estimate using the Feynman-Hellmann theorem.
