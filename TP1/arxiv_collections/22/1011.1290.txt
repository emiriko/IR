Since 2004, Saturn Electrostatic Discharges (SEDs), which are the radio
signatures of lightning in Saturn's atmosphere, have been observed by the
Cassini Radio and Plasma Wave Science instrument (RPWS). Despite their
important time coverage, these observations lack the resolution and positioning
given by imaging around visible wavelengths. Amateur observations from Earth
have been increasing in quality and coverage since a few years, bringing
information on positions, drift rates and shape evolutions of large visible
white spots in Saturn's atmosphere. Combining these two complementary sources
has brought better analysis of Saturn's storms evolutions.
