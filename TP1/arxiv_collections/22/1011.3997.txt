Some statements concerning the distribution of imaginary parts of zeros of
the Riemann zeta\,-function are established. These assertions are connected
with so\,-called `Gram's law' or `Gram's rule'. In particular, we give a proof
of several Selberg's formulae stated him without proof in his paper `The Zeta
Function and the Riemann Hypothesis' (1946), and some of their equivalents.
