We report on a new phenomenon of `alignment' of supergranulation cells in the
polar regions of the Sun. Recent high-resolution datasets obtained by the Solar
Optical Telescope onboard the Hinode satellite enabled us to investigate
supergranular structures in high-latitude regions of the Sun. We have carried
out a local helioseismology time-distance analysis of the data, and detected
acoustic travel-time variations due to the supergranular flows. The
supergranulation cells in both the north and south polar regions show
systematic alignment patterns in the north-south direction. The south-pole
datasets obtained in a month-long Hinode campaign indicate that the
supergranulation alignment property may be quite common in the polar regions.
We also discuss the latitudinal dependence of the supergranulation cell sizes;
the data show that the east-west cell size decreases towards higher latitudes.
