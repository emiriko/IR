The theoretical basis of the thermal response of the fluid-saturated porous
materials in undrained condition is presented. It has been demonstrated that
the thermal pressurization phenomenon is controlled by the discrepancy between
the thermal expansion of the pore fluid and of the solid phase, the
stress-dependency of the compressibility and the non-elastic volume changes of
the porous material. For evaluation of the undrained thermo-poro-elastic
properties of saturated porous materials in conventional triaxial cells, it is
important to take into account the effect of the dead volume of the drainage
system. A simple correction method is presented to correct the measured pore
pressure change and also the measured volumetric strain during an undrained
heating test. It is shown that the porosity of the tested material, its drained
compressibility and the ratio of the volume of the drainage system to the one
of the tested sample, are the key parameters which influence the most the error
induced on the measurements by the drainage system. An example of the
experimental evaluation of undrained thermoelastic parameters is presented for
an undrained heating test performed on a fluid-saturated granular rock.
