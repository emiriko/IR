We study some of the physics potential of an intense $1\,\mathrm{MCi}$
$^{51}\mathrm{Cr}$ source combined with the {\sc Majorana Demonstrator}
enriched germanium detector array. The {\sc Demonstrator} will consist of
detectors with ultra-low radioactive backgrounds and extremely low energy
thresholds of~$\sim 400\,\mathrm{eV}$. We show that it can improve the current
limit on the neutrino magnetic dipole moment. We briefly discuss physics
applications of the charged-current reaction of the $^{51}\mathrm{Cr} neutrino
with the $^{73}\mathrm{Ge} isotope. Finally, we argue that the rate from a
realistic, intense tritium source is below the detectable limit of even a
tonne-scale HPGe experiment
