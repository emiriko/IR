Active Learning Method (ALM) is a soft computing method which is used for
modeling and control, based on fuzzy logic. Although ALM has shown that it acts
well in dynamic environments, its operators cannot support it very well in
complex situations due to losing data. Thus ALM can find better membership
functions if more appropriate operators be chosen for it. This paper
substituted two new operators instead of ALM original ones; which consequently
renewed finding membership functions in a way superior to conventional ALM.
This new method is called Extended Active Learning Method (EALM).
