Confined states of an electron-positron pair in the spherical quantum dot
(QD) are theoretically investigated in three size-quantization (SQ) regimes:
strong, weak and intermediate. In the strong SQ regime, analytical expressions
for the wave functions (WFs) and energy of the pair are obtained. In the weak
SQ regime, the positronium energy and binding energy are analytically
calculated. To calculate the positronium energy in the intermediate SQ regime,
variational and numerical methods are used. It is shown that, in the
corresponding limits, the results obtained by variational method agree with
those obtained in the strong and weak SQ regimes.
