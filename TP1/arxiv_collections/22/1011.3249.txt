We propose a new construction of two-dimensional natural bi-Hamiltonian
systems associated with a very simple Lie algebra. The presented construction
allows us to distinguish three families of super-integrable monomial potentials
for which one additional first integral is quadratic, and the second one can be
of arbitrarily high degree with respect to the momenta. Many integrable systems
with additional integrals of degree greater than two in momenta are given.
Moreover, an example of a super-integrable system with first integrals of
degree two, four and six in the momenta is found.
