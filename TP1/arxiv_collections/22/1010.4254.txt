In the heavy quark limit of Coulomb gauge QCD and by truncating the
Yang-Mills sector to include only dressed two-point functions, an analytic
nonperturbative solution to the Faddeev equation for three-quark bound states
in the case of equal quark separations is presented. A direct connection
between the temporal gluon propagator and the three-quark confinement potential
is provided and it is shown that only color singlet qqq (baryon) states are
physically allowed.
