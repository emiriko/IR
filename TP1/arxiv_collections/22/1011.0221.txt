This paper addresses the symbolic representation of non-convex real
polyhedra, i.e., sets of real vectors satisfying arbitrary Boolean combinations
of linear constraints. We develop an original data structure for representing
such sets, based on an implicit and concise encoding of a known structure, the
Real Vector Automaton. The resulting formalism provides a canonical
representation of polyhedra, is closed under Boolean operators, and admits an
efficient decision procedure for testing the membership of a vector.
