Transverse breathing mode oscillations in a particle beam can couple energy
into longitudinal oscillations in a bunch of finite length and cause
significant losses. We develop a model that illustrates this effect and explore
the dependence on mismatch size, space-charge tune depression, longitudinal
focusing strength, bunch length, and RF bucket length.
