The existence of random attractors for a large class of stochastic partial
differential equations (SPDE) driven by general additive noise is established.
The main results are applied to various types of SPDE, as e.g. stochastic
reaction-diffusion equations, the stochastic $p$-Laplace equation and
stochastic porous media equations. Besides classical Brownian motion, we also
include space-time fractional Brownian Motion and space-time L\'evy noise as
admissible random perturbations. Moreover, cases where the attractor consists
of a single point are considered and bounds for the speed of attraction are
obtained.
