Delays in biological systems may be used to model events for which the
underlying dynamics cannot be precisely observed, or to provide abstraction of
some behavior of the system resulting more compact models. In this paper we
enrich the stochastic process algebra Bio-PEPA, with the possibility of
assigning delays to actions, yielding a new non-Markovian process algebra:
Bio-PEPAd. This is a conservative extension meaning that the original syntax of
Bio-PEPA is retained and the delay specification which can now be associated
with actions may be added to existing Bio-PEPA models. The semantics of the
firing of the actions with delays is the delay-as-duration approach, earlier
presented in papers on the stochastic simulation of biological systems with
delays. These semantics of the algebra are given in the Starting-Terminating
style, meaning that the state and the completion of an action are observed as
two separate events, as required by delays. Furthermore we outline how to
perform stochastic simulation of Bio-PEPAd systems and how to automatically
translate a Bio-PEPAd system into a set of Delay Differential Equations, the
deterministic framework for modeling of biological systems with delays. We end
the paper with two example models of biological systems with delays to
illustrate the approach.
