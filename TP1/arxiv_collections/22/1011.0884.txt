We report a simple, reliable method to grow high quality
BaFe$_{2-x}$Co$_x$As$_2$ single crystal samples without using any fluxing
agent. The starting materials for the single crystal growth come from
well-crystallized polycrystalline samples and the highest growing temperature
can be 1493 K. The as-grown crystals have typical dimensions of
4$\times3\times$0.5 mm$^3$ with c-axis perpendicular to the shining surface. We
find that the samples have very large current carrying ability, indicating that
the samples have good potential technological applications.
