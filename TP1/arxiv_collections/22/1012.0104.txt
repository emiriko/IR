Here we demonstrate the Altshuler-Aronov-Spivak (AAS) interference of the
topological surface states on the exfoliated Bi2Te3 microflakes by a flux
period of h/2e in their magnetoresistance oscillations and its weak field
character. Both the osillations with the period of h/e and h/2e are observed.
The h/2e-period AAS oscillation gradually dominates with increasing the sample
widths and the temperatures. This reveals the transition of the Dirac Fermions'
transport to the diffusive regime.
