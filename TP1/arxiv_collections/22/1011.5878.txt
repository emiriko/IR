We investigate the critical behaviour of a probabilistic mixture of cellular
automata (CA) rules 182 and 200 (in Wolfram's enumeration scheme) by mean-field
analysis and Monte Carlo simulations. We found that as we switch off one CA and
switch on the other by the variation of the single paramenter of the model the
probabilistic CA (PCA) goes through an extinction-survival-type phase
transition, and the numerical data indicate that it belongs to the directed
percolation universality class of critical behaviour. The PCA displays a
characteristic stationary density profile and a slow, diffusive dynamics close
to the pure CA 200 point that we discuss briefly. Remarks on an interesting
related stochastic lattice gas are addressed in the conclusions.
