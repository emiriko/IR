We consider a scattering formulation of radiative momentum transfer to a
Magneto-Chiral system that is subjected to a constant background magnetic
field. The system takes the form of a collection magnetic dipoles that exhibit
the Faraday effect. It is shown that the first non-trivial contribution of the
momentum transfer to the object from the radiation field occurs at fourth order
in the Born series.
