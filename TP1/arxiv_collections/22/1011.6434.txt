We consider models of CSP based on recording what events are available as
possible alternatives to the events that are actually performed. We present
many different varieties of such models. For each, we give a compositional
semantics, congruent to the operational semantics, and prove full abstraction
and no-junk results. We compare the expressiveness of the different models.
