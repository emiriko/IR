The problem of computing Craig interpolants in SAT and SMT has recently
received a lot of interest, mainly for its applications in formal verification.
Efficient algorithms for interpolant generation have been presented for some
theories of interest ---including that of equality and uninterpreted functions,
linear arithmetic over the rationals, and their combination--- and they are
successfully used within model checking tools. For the theory of linear
arithmetic over the integers (LA(Z)), however, the problem of finding an
interpolant is more challenging, and the task of developing efficient
interpolant generators for the full theory LA(Z) is still the objective of
ongoing research. In this paper we try to close this gap. We build on previous
work and present a novel interpolation algorithm for SMT(LA(Z)), which exploits
the full power of current state-of-the-art SMT(LA(Z)) solvers. We demonstrate
the potential of our approach with an extensive experimental evaluation of our
implementation of the proposed algorithm in the MathSAT SMT solver.
