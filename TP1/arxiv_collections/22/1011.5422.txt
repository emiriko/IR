The $\cos\phi_h$ and $\cos2\phi_h$ azimuthal modulations of the unpolarized
hadron Semi-Inclusive Deep Inelastic Scattering cross section are sensitive to
the quark intrinsic transverse momentum and transverse spin. These modulations
have been measured at HERMES in a fully differential way by means of a
4-dimensional unfolding procedure to correct for instrumental effects. Results
have been extracted for hydrogen and deuterium targets and separately for
positively and negatively charged pions and kaons, to access flavor-dependent
information about the nucleon internal transverse degrees of freedom.
