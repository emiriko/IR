Quantum Hadrodynamics provides a useful framework for investigating dense
matter, yet it breaks down easily when strangeness carrying baryons are
introduced into the calculations, as the baryon effective masses become
negative due to large meson field potentials. The Quark-Meson Coupling model
overcomes this issue by incorporating the quark structure of the nucleon, thus
allowing for a feedback between the the nuclei and the interaction with the
meson fields. With the inclusion of this feature, QMC provides a successful
description of finite nuclei and nuclear matter. We present the latest
parameterization of QMC and discuss the predictions for dense nuclear matter
and `neutron' stars.
