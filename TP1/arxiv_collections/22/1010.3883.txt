We investigate the possibility of a fourth sequential generation in the
lepton sector. Assuming neutrinos to be Majorana particles and starting from a
recent - albeit weak - evidence for a non-zero admixture of a fourth generation
neutrino from fits to weak lepton and meson decays we discuss constraints from
neutrinoless double beta decay, radiative lepton decay and like-sign di-lepton
production at hadron colliders.
