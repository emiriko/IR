In this paper we introduce a class of regular bipartite graphs whose
biadjacency matrices are circulant matrices and we describe some of their
properties. Notably, we compute upper and lower bounds for the zero forcing
number for such a graph based only on the parameters that describe its
biadjacency matrix. The main results of the paper characterize the bipartite
circulant graphs that achieve equality in the lower bound.
