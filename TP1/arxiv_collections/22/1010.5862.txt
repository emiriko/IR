We propose and analyze an interface between a topological qubit and a
superconducting flux qubit. In our scheme, the interaction between Majorana
fermions in a topological insulator is coherently controlled by a
superconducting phase that depends on the quantum state of the flux qubit. A
controlled phase gate, achieved by pulsing this interaction on and off, can
transfer quantum information between the topological qubit and the
superconducting qubit.
