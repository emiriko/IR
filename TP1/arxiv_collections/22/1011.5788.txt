An interesting class of automatic sequences emerges from iterated
paperfolding. The sequences generate curves in the plane with an almost
periodic structure. We generalize the results obtained by Davis and Knuth on
the self-avoiding and planefilling properties of these curves, giving simple
geometric criteria for a complete classification. Finally, we show how the
automatic structure of the sequences leads to self-similarity of the curves,
which turns the planefilling curves in a scaling limit into fractal tiles. For
some of these tiles we give a particularly simple formula for the Hausdorff
dimension of their boundary.
