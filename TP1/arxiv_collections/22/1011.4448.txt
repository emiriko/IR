Significant proton fluxes were detected in the near wake region of the Moon
by an ion mass spectrometer on board Chandrayaan-1. The energy of these
nightside protons is slightly higher than the energy of the solar wind protons.
The protons are detected close to the lunar equatorial plane at a $140^{\circ}$
solar zenith angle, i.e., ~50$^{\circ}$ behind the terminator at a height of
100 km. The protons come from just above the local horizon, and move along the
magnetic field in the solar wind reference frame. We compared the observed
proton flux with the predictions from analytical models of an electrostatic
plasma expansion into a vacuum. The observed velocity was higher than the
velocity predicted by analytical models by a factor of 2 to 3. The simple
analytical models cannot explain the observed ion dynamics along the magnetic
field in the vicinity of the Moon.
