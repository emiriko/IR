It has been proposed that the superconductivity of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ is
characterized by pairing that is unconventional and, furthermore, spontaneously
breaks time-reversal symmetry. However, one of the key expected consequences,
viz., that the ground state should exhibit chiral charge currents localized
near the boundaries of the sample, has not been observed, to date. We explore
an alternative implication of time-reversal symmetry breaking: the existence of
walls between domains of opposing chirality. Via a general phenomenological
approach, we derive an effective description of the superconductivity in terms
of the relevant topological variables (i.e., domain walls and vortices). Hence,
by specializing to the in the in-plane rotationally invariant limit, we show
that a domain wall that is translationally invariant along the z axis and
includes a bend through an angle $\Theta$ is accompanied by a nonintegral (and
possibly nonquantized) magnetic {\it bend flux} of
$\big((\Theta/\pi)+n\big)\Phi_0$, with integral $n$, that penetrates the
superconductor, localized near the bend. We generalize this result to the
situation in which gauge transformations and rotations about the z axis are
degenerate transformations of the chiral superconducting order. On the basis of
the specialized result and its generalization, we note that any observation of
localized, nonquantized flux penetrating a z-axis surface (e.g., via
scanned-probe magnetic imaging) can be interpreted in terms of the presence of
bent walls between domains of opposing chirality, and hence is suggestive of
the existence of time-reversal symmetry-breaking superconductivity.
