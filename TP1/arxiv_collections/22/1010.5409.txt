Water dispersed graphene oxide sheets were used to prepare
graphene-polyethylenglycol diacrylate resin composites by photopolymerization.
It was found that graphene sheets undergo excellent morphological distribution
within the resin system, giving rise to transparent composites with unaltered
thermal properties with respect to the neat resin, that are electrically
conductive at loading ratios as low as 0.02 %wt of graphene oxide . The
proposed strategy based on photopolymerization provides an easy, energy-saving
and environmental friendly technique that can find a wide application in
coating technology, mainly for electromagnetic shielding and antistatic
coatings.
