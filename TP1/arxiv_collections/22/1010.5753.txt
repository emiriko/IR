The dissipative heat engine (DHE) is based on a Carnot cycle with external
heat Qin received at temperature Ts and released at To < Ts. In contrast to the
classical Carnot engine, mechanical work Ad in the DHE is not exported to
external environment but dissipates to heat within the engine. Makarieva et al.
(2010, hereafter MGLN) asserted that the laws of thermodynamics prohibit an
increase of Ad beyond the Carnot limit: Ad <= epsilon Qin, epsilon = (Ts -
To)/Ts. Bister et al. (2010, hereafter BRPE) counterargued that such an
increase is possible and that hurricanes can be viewed as a natural DHE. Here
we show that the arguments of BRPE are not consistent with the energy
conservation law and thus do not refute MGLN's claims.
