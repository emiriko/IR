Brou\'e, Malle and Michel have shown that the automizer of an abelian Sylow
p-subgroup in a finite simple Chevalley group is an irreducible complex
reflection group, for p not too small and different from the defining
characteristic.
  The aim is this note is to show that a suitable version of this property
holds for general finite groups. As an example, the automizer of an 11-Sylow
subgroup in the Monster is the 2-dimensional complex reflection group G_{16}.
