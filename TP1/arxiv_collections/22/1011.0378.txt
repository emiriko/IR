A kinematic model based on the superposition of p+p collisions, relativistic
geometry and final-state hadronic rescattering is used to predict various
hadronic observables in \surd sNN = 2.76 TeV Pb+Pb collisions. Predictions for
rapidity and transverse momentum distributions, elliptic flow, and two-boson
femtoscopy are presented. A short proper time for hadronization is assumed.
Previous calculations using this model which were performed for \surd sNN = 200
GeV Au+Au collisions were shown to describe reasonably well the trends of
observables in experiments carried out at that energy, giving the present
predictions for Pb+Pb at higher energy some degree of credibility.
