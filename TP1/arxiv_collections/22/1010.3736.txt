We construct and analyze theories with a gauge symmetry in the ultraviolet of
the form $G \otimes G_b$, in which the vectorial, asymptotically free $G_b$
gauge interaction becomes strongly coupled at a scale where the $G$ interaction
is weakly coupled and produces bilinear fermion condensates that dynamically
break the $G$ symmetry. Comparisons are given between Higgs and dynamical
symmetry breaking mechanisms for various models.
