We propose a theoretical scheme to generate a controllable and switchable
coupling between two double-quantum-dot (DQD) spin qubits by using a
transmission line resonator (TLR) as a bus system. We study dynamical behaviors
of quantum correlations described by entanglement correlation (EC) and discord
correlation (DC) between two DQD spin qubits when the two spin qubits and the
TLR are initially prepared in $X$-type quantum states and a coherent state,
respectively. We demonstrate that in the EC death regions there exist DC
stationary states in which the stable DC amplification or degradation can be
generated during the dynamical evolution. It is shown that these DC stationary
states can be controlled by initial-state parameters, the coupling, and
detuning between qubits and the TLR. We reveal the full synchronization and
anti-synchronization phenomena in the EC and DC time evolution, and show that
the EC and DC synchronization and anti-synchronization depends on the
initial-state parameters of the two DQD spin qubits. These results shed new
light on dynamics of quantum correlations.
