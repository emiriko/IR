This note investigates the properties of the traveling waves solutions of the
nonlocal Fisher equation. The existence of such solutions has been proved
recently in \cite{BNPR} but their asymptotic behavior was still unclear. We use
here a new numerical approximation of these traveling waves which shows that
some traveling waves connect the two homogeneous steady states $0$ and $1$,
which is a striking fact since $0$ is dynamically unstable and $1$ is unstable
in the sense of Turing.
