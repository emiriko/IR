We have analyzed experimental evidence for an anomalous transfer of spectral
weight from high to low energy scales in both electron and hole doped cuprates
as a function of doping. X-ray scattering, optical and photoemission spectra
are all found to show that the high energy spectral weight decreases with
increasing doping at a rate much faster than predictions of the large $U-$limit
calculations. The observed doping evolution is however well-described by an
intermediate coupling scenario where the effective Hubbard $U$ is comparable to
the bandwidth. The experimental spectra across various spectroscopies are
inconsistent with fixed-$U$ exact diagonalization or quantum Monte Carlo
calculations, and suggest a significant doping dependence of the effective $U$
in the cuprates.
