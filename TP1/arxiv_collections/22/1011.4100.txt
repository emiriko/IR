In this thesis, the behavior of the electromagnetic field is studied, at
optical frequencies, in the one-dimensional photonic crystals, using the theory
of "Quasi-Normal Modes (QNM). The following thesis is inspired by the QNM
theory, recently developed for homogeneous cavity open just on one side. It is
stressed that any 1D-PBG is an open cavity on both sides which allows the
confinement of the e.m. field, but that causes radiation losses; the em field
initially present within it, on the passing of time, can only propagate
outwards. In general, the 1D-PBG is not a conservative system and the natural
evolution of the e.m. field can not be described by a Hermitian operator: in
short, a discussion in terms of normal modes of the field radiation is
abandoned. The method of QNM uses, as tools of analysis, the Green's function
and biorthogonal spaces. The 1D-PBG is studied in a more realistic way : a
finite structure, immersed in an unlimited space. The renunciation of energy
conservation for the system under consideration has important consequences,
both numerical and conceptual: it goes from real autofrequencies to complex
quasi-autofrequencies. Moreover, as the operator describing the evolution of
space-time is not hermitian, the modes are no longer normal, but quasi-normal:
in fact, only under appropriate conditions, they not only provide a basis
orthogonal, but their space-time evolution is similar to that of the Hermitian
normal modes.
