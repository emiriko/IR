We explore the effects of random link removal on the photonic band gaps of
honeycomb networks. Missing or incomplete links are expected to be common in
practical realizations of this class of connected network structures due to
unavoidable flaws in the fabrication process. We focus on the collapse of the
photonic band gap due to the defects induced by the link removal. We show that
the photonic band gap is quite robust against this type of random decimation
and survives even when almost 58% of the network links are removed.
