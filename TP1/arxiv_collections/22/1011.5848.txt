In recent years, there has been increasing recognition of the potential of
the galactic center as a probe of general relativity in the strong field. There
is almost certainly a black hole at Sgr A* in the galactic center, and this
would allow us the opportunity to probe dynamics near the exterior of the black
hole. In the last decade, there has been research into extreme gravitational
lensing in the galactic center. Unlike in most applications of gravitational
lensing, where the bending angle is of the order of several arc seconds, very
large bending angles are possible for light that closely approaches a black
hole. Photons may even loop multiple times around a black hole before reaching
the observer. There have been many proposals to use light's close approach to
the black hole as a probe of the black hole metric. Of particular interest is
the property of light lensed by the S stars orbiting in the galactic center.
This paper will review some of the attempts made to study extreme lensing as
well as extend the analysis of lensing by S stars. In particular, we are
interested in the effect of a Reissner-Nordstrom like 1/r^2 term in the metric
and how this would affect the properties of relativistic images.
