We present a systematic study of the electronic structure in A-site ordered
manganites as function of doping and temperature. The energy dependencies
observed with soft x-ray resonant diffraction (SXRD) at the Mn L_{2,3} edges
are compared with structural investigations using neutron powder diffraction as
well as with cluster calculations. The crystal structures obtained with neutron
powder diffraction reflect the various orbital and charge ordered phases and
show an increase of the Mn-O-Mn bond angle as function of doping and
temperature. Cluster calculations show that the observed spectral changes in
SXRD as a function of doping are more pronounced than expected from an increase
in bandwitdh due to the increase in Mn-O-Mn bond angle, and are best described
by holes that are distributed at the neighbouring oxygen ions. These holes are
not directly added to the Mn 3d shell, but centered at the Mn site. In
contrast, the spectral changes in SXRD as function of temperature are best
described by an increase of magnetic correlations. This demonstrates the strong
correlations between orbitals and magnetic moments of the 3d states.
