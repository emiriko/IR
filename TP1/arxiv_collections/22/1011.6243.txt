Maintaining quantum coherence is a crucial requirement for quantum
computation; hence protecting quantum systems against their irreversible
corruption due to environmental noise is an important open problem. Dynamical
decoupling (DD) is an effective method for reducing decoherence with a low
control overhead. It also plays an important role in quantum metrology, where
for instance it is employed in multiparameter estimation. While a sequence of
equidistant control pulses (CPMG) has been ubiquitously used for decoupling,
Uhrig recently proposed that a non-equidistant pulse sequence (UDD) may enhance
DD performance, especially for systems where the spectral density of the
environment has a sharp frequency cutoff. On the other hand, equidistant
sequences outperform UDD for soft cutoffs. The relative advantage provided by
UDD for intermediate regimes is not clear. In this paper, we analyze the
relative DD performance in this regime experimentally, using solid-state
nuclear magnetic resonance. Our system-qubits are 13C nuclear spins and the
environment consists of a 1H nuclear spin-bath whose spectral density is close
to a normal (Gaussian) distribution. We find that in the presence of such a
bath, the CPMG sequence outperforms the UDD sequence. An analogy between
dynamical decoupling and interference effects in optics provides an intuitive
explanation as to why the CPMG sequence performs superior to any
non-equidistant DD sequence in the presence of this kind of environmental
noise.
