We have produced a fluid dynamics video with data from Direct Numerical
Simulation (DNS) of a jet in crossflow at several low values of the velocity
inflow ratio R. We show that, as the velocity ratio R increases, the flow
evolves from simple periodic vortex shedding (a limit cycle) to more
complicated quasi-periodic behavior, before finally exhibiting asymmetric
chaotic motion. We also perform a stability analysis just above the first
bifurcation, where R is the bifurcation parameter. Using the overlap of the
direct and the adjoint eigenmodes, we confirm that the first instability arises
in the shear layer downstream of the jet orifice on the boundary of the
backflow region just behind the jet.
