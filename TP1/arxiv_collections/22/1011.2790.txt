In the paper I sketch a theory of massively parallel proofs using cellular
automata presentation of deduction. In this presentation inference rules play
the role of cellular-automatic local transition functions. In this approach we
completely avoid axioms as necessary notion of deduction theory and therefore
we can use cyclic proofs without additional problems. As a result, a theory of
massive-parallel proofs within unconventional computing is proposed for the
first time.
