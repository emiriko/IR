We use an approach to estimate galaxy morphologies based on an ellipticity
(e) vs. Bulge-to-Total ratio (B/T) plane. We have calibrated this plane by
comparing with Dressler's classifications. With the aid of our calibration, we
have classified 635 galaxies in 18 Abell clusters (0.02 < z < 0.08). Our
approach allowed us to recover the Kormendy's relation. We found that
ellipticals and Spirals are slightly brighter than S0 in R band. As S0 bulges
are brighter than spirals bulges, we believe that ram pressure is not the main
mechanism to generate S0s. In our sample, cluster radio galaxies morphologies
cover the range S0-E-cD and their bulges have absolutes magnitudes distributed
within -21 mag < M < -24.5 mag. If we believe Ferrarese & Merrit's relation,
these radio sources have 10^8-10^9 M black hole mass.
