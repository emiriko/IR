This is a tutorial on finite automata. We present the standard material on
determinization and minimization, as well as an account of the equivalence of
finite automata and monadic second-order logic. We conclude with an
introduction to the syntactic monoid, and as an application give a proof of the
equivalence of first-order definability and aperiodicity.
