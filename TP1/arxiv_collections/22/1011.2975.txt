The microlensing technique has found 10 exoplanets to date and promises to
discover more in the near future. While planetary transit light curves all show
a familiar shape, planetary perturbations to microlensing light curves can
manifest a wide variety of morphologies. We present a graphical guide that may
be useful when understanding microlensing events showing planetary caustic
perturbations.
