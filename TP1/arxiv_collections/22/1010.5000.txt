The critical behavior of a family of fully connected mean-field models with
quenched disorder, the $M-p$ Ising spin glass, is analyzed, displaying a
crossover between a continuous and a random first order phase transition as a
control parameter is tuned. Due to its microscopic properties the model is
straightforwardly extendable to finite dimensions in any geometry.
