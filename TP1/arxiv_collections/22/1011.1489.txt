Stavskaya's model is a one-dimensional probabilistic cellular automaton (PCA)
introduced in the end of the 1960's as an example of a model displaying a
nonequilibrium phase transition. Although its absorbing state phase transition
is well understood nowadays, the model never received a full numerical
treatment to investigate its critical behavior. In this short article we
characterize the critical behavior of Stavskaya's PCA by means of Monte Carlo
simulations and finite-size scaling analysis. The critical exponents of the
model are calculated and indicate that its phase transition belongs to the
directed percolation universality class of critical behavior, as it would be
expected on the basis of the directed percolation conjecture. We also
explicitly establish the relationship of the model with the Domany-Kinzel PCA
on its directed site percolation line, a connection that seems to have gone
unnoticed in the literature so far.
