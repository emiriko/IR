To be the fittest is central to proliferation in evolutionary games.
Individuals thus adopt the strategies of better performing players in the hope
of successful reproduction. In structured populations the array of those that
are eligible to act as strategy sources is bounded to the immediate neighbors
of each individual. But which one of these strategy sources should potentially
be copied? Previous research dealt with this question either by selecting the
fittest or by selecting one player uniformly at random. Here we introduce a
parameter $u$ that interpolates between these two extreme options. Setting $u$
equal to zero returns the random selection of the opponent, while positive $u$
favor the fitter players. In addition, we divide the population into two
groups. Players from group $A$ select their opponents as dictated by the
parameter $u$, while players from group $B$ do so randomly irrespective of $u$.
We denote the fraction of players contained in groups $A$ and $B$ by $v$ and
$1-v$, respectively. The two parameters $u$ and $v$ allow us to analyze in
detail how aspirations in the context of the prisoner's dilemma game influence
the evolution of cooperation. We find that for sufficiently positive values of
$u$ there exist a robust intermediate $v \approx 0.5$ for which cooperation
thrives best. The robustness of this observation is tested against different
levels of uncertainty in the strategy adoption process $K$ and for different
interaction networks. We also provide complete phase diagrams depicting the
dependence of the impact of $u$ and $v$ for different values of $K$, and
contrast the validity of our conclusions by means of an alternative model where
individual aspiration levels are subject to evolution as well. Our study
indicates that heterogeneity in aspirations may be key for the sustainability
of cooperation in structured populations.
