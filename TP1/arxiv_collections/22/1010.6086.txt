We present electronic transport measurements of GaAs nanowires grown by
catalyst-free metal-organic chemical vapor deposition. Despite the nanowires
being doped with a relatively high concentration of substitutional impurities,
we find them inordinately resistive. By measuring sufficiently high
aspect-ratio nanowires individually in situ, we decouple the role of the
contacts and show that this semi-insulating electrical behavior is the result
of trap-mediated carrier transport. We observe Poole-Frenkel transport that
crosses over to phonon-assisted tunneling at higher fields, with a tunneling
time found to depend predominantly on fundamental physical constants as
predicted by theory. By using in situ electron beam irradiation of individual
nanowires we probe the nanowire electronic transport when free carriers are
made available, thus revealing the nature of the contacts.
