The Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x high-temperature superconductor represents a natural
metamaterial, composed of metallic CuO bilayers sandwiched between ionic BiO
planes. Each pair of CuO bilayers forms an atomic-scale Josephson junction.
Here we employ the intrinsic Josephson effect for in situ generation and
detection of electromagnetic waves in Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x single crystals. We
observe that electromagnetic waves form polaritons with several transverse
optical phonons. This indicates the presence of unscreened polar response in
cuprates, which may lead to strong electronphonon interaction. Our technique
can provide intense local sources of coherent, monochromatic phonon-polaritons
with kW/cm2 power densities.
