In this paper, after a short introduction to the physics of neutrino
telescopes, we will report on first performances of the IceCube detector and a
selection of preliminary results obtained from data taken while IceCube
operated in a partially completed configuration (22 strings and 40 strings). We
will emphasize new analysis methods recently developed for the study of the
Southern Hemisphere as well as for extended regions. Based on the long term
experience of AMANDA and IceCube, the South Pole ice has proven to be an ideal
site for astroparticle physics. New ideas and projects about the future beyond
IceCube will conclude this presentation.
