Around several single DAZ and DBZ white dwarfs metal-rich disks have been
observed, which are mostly believed to originate from disruption of smaller
rocky planetesimals. In some cases the material does not (only) form a dusty
but gaseous disk. In the case of SDSS J122859.93+104032.9 the double peaked
infrared Ca II triplet at about 8500 angstrom, one of only two emission
features of the spectra, exhibits a strong red/violet asymmetry. Assuming a
composition similar to a chondrite-like asteroid, being the most prominent type
in our own solar system, we calculated the spectrum and vertical structure of
the disk using the Tuebingen NLTE accretion disk code "AcDc". Modified to
simulate different non axis-symmetrical disk geometries, the first preliminary
results are in good agreement with the observed asymmetric line profile.
