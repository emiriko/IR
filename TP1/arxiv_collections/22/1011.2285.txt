The traditional metaphysical debate between static and dynamic views in the
philosophy of time is examined in light of considerations concerning the nature
of time in physical theory. Adapting the formalism of Rovelli (1995, 2004), I
set out a precise framework in which to characterise the formal structure of
time that we find in physical theory. This framework is used to provide a new
perspective on the relationship between the metaphysics of time and the special
theory of relativity by emphasising the dual representations of time that we
find in special relativity. I extend this analysis to the general theory of
relativity with a view to prescribing the constraints that must be heeded for a
metaphysical theory of time to remain within the bounds of a naturalistic
metaphysics.
