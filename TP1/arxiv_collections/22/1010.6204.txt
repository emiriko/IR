We have used polarized-neutron inelastic scattering to resolve the spin
fluctuations in superconducting FeSe0.5Te0.5 into components parallel and
perpendicular to the layers. A spin resonance at an energy of 6.5 meV is
observed to develop below T_c in both fluctuation components. The resonance
peak is anisotropic, with the in-plane component slightly larger than the
out-of-plane component. Away from the resonance peak the magnetic fluctuations
are isotropic in the energy range studied. The results are consistent with a
dominant singlet pairing state with s^{\pm} symmetry, with a possible minority
component of different symmetry.
