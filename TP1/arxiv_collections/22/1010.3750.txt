Using an exactly soluble one-dimensional atomic model we explore the idea
that the recently observed high-order nonlinearity in optical filaments is due
to virtual transitions involving the continuum states. We show that the model's
behavior is qualitatively comparable with the experimentally observed
cross-over from self-focusing to de-focusing at high intensities, and only
occurs at intensities which result in significant ionization. Based on these
observations, we conjecture that this continuum electron nonlinear refraction
exhibits strong memory effects, and most importantly, the change of its sign is
effectively masked by the de-focusing due to free electrons.
