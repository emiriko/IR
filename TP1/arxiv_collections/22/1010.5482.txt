Phase separated perovskite manganites have competing phases with different
crystal structures, magnetic and electronic properties. Hence, strain effects
play a critical role in determining the magnetic properties of manganite thin
films. Here we report the effect of anisotropic stress on the magnetic
properties of the phase separated manganite
(La$_{0.4}$Pr$_{0.6}$)$_{0.67}$Ca$_{0.33}$MnO$_{3}$. Thin films of
(La$_{0.4}$Pr$_{0.6}$)$_{0.67}$Ca$_{0.33}$MnO$_{3}$ grown under anisotropic
in-plane stress on (110) NdGaO$_{3}$ substrates display in-plane mangetic
anisotropy and single domain to multidomain transition as a function of
temperature. Angle dependent magnetization measurements also show that the
magnetization reversal occurs mainly through the nucleation $&$ propagation
mechanism. By comparing the results with
(La$_{0.4}$Pr$_{0.6}$)$_{0.67}$Ca$_{0.33}$MnO$_{3}$ thin films grown on (001)
SrLaGaO$_{4}$ substrates, we have confirmed that the magnetic anisotropy is
mainly due to substrate induced anisotropic stress. Our results suggest novel
avenues for storing magnetic information in nanoscale magnetic media.
