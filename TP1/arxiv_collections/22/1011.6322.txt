The state of the art in dibaryons with strangeness is reviewed, including the
K^{-}pp dibaryon which signals the onset of antikaon-nuclear binding. A new
type of strange dibaryons is highlighted, where the primary binding mechanism
is provided by strong p-wave pion interactions, as demonstrated by a quasibound
(I=3/2,JP=2+) pion-hyperon-nucleon dibaryon calculation.
