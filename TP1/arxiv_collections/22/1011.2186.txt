In this paper we study events with W+jets final state, produced in double
parton (DP) interactions, as a background to the associated Higgs boson (H) and
W production, with H->bbar decay, at the Tevatron. We have found that the event
yield from the DP background can be quite sizable, which necessitates a choice
of selection criteria to separate the HW and DP production processes. We
suggest a set of variables sensitive to the kinematics of DP and HW events. We
show that these variables, being used as an input to the artificial neural
network, allow one to significantly improve a sensitivity to the Higgs boson
production.
