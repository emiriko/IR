On the basis of recent precise measurements of the electric form factor of
the proton, the Zemach moments, needed as input parameters for the
determination of the proton rms radius from the measurement of the Lamb shift
in muonic hydrogen, are calculated. It turns out that the new moments give an
uncertainty as large as the presently stated error of the recent Lamb shift
measurement of Pohl et al.. De Rujula's idea of a large Zemach moment in order
to reconcile the five standard deviation discrepancy between the muonic Lamb
shift determination and the result of electronic experiments is shown to be in
clear contradiction with experiment. Alternative explanations are touched upon.
