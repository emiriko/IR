Let $R$ be a 2-dimensional normal excellent henselian local domain in which 2
is invertible and let $L$ and $k$ be respectively its fraction field and
residue field. Let $\Omega_R$ be the set of rank 1 discrete valuations of $L$
corresponding to codimension 1 points of regular proper models of $\Spec R$. We
prove that a quadratic form $q$ over $L$ satisfies the local-global principle
with respect to $\Omega_R$ in the following two cases: (1) $q$ has rank 3 or 4;
(2) $q$ has rank $\ge 5$ and $R=A[y]$, where $A$ is a complete discrete
valuation ring with a not too restrictive condition on the residue field $k$,
which is satisfied when $k$ is $C_1$.
