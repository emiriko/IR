We discuss carefully the blackbody approximation, stressing what it is (a
limit case of radiative transfer), and what it is not (the assumption that the
body is perfectly absorbing, i.e. black). Furthermore, we derive the Planck
spectrum without enclosing the field in a box, as is done in most textbooks.
Athough convenient, this trick conceals the nature of the idealization
expressed in the concept of a blackbody: first, the most obvious examples of
approximate blackbodies, stars, are definitely not enclosed in boxes; second,
the Planck spectrum is continuous, while the stationary modes of radiation in a
box are discrete. Our derivation, although technically less elementary, is
conceptually more consistent, and brings the opportunity to introduce to
students the important concept of local density of states, via the resolvent
formalism.
