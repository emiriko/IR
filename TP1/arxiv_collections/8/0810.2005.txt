We present studies of the behavior of the permittivity of such liquid systems
as pure distilled water, alcohol and 50%-aqueous solutions of alcohol as
affected by the inerton field generated by a special signal generator contained
within a wrist-watch or bracelet made by so-called Teslar technology. It has
been found that the changes in fact are significant. The method employed has
allowed us to fix the value of frequency of the field generated by the Teslar
chip. The frequency has been determined to be approximately 8 Hz. The
phenomenological consideration and submicroscopic foundations of a significant
increase of the permittivity are studied taking into account an additional
interaction, namely the mass interaction between polar water molecules, which
is caused by the inerton field of the Teslar chip. This is one more proof of
Krasnoholovets' concept regarding the existence of a substructure of the matter
waves of moving/vibrating entities, i.e. the inerton field, which has been
predicted in a series of his previous works.
