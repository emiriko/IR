We calculate the magnetic dipole moment of the Delta baryon using a
background magnetic field on 2+1-flavors of clover fermions on anisotropic
lattices. We focus on the finite volume effects that can be significant in
background field studies, and thus we use two different spatial volumes in
addition to several quark masses.
