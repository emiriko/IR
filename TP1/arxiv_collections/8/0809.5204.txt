WLAN is one of the most successful applications of wireless communications in
daily life because of low cost and ease of deployment. The enabling technique
for this success is the use of random access schemes for the wireless channel.
Random access requires minimal coordination between the nodes, which
considerably reduces the cost of the infrastructure. Recently, cooperative
communication in wireless networks has been of increasing interest because it
promises higher rates and reliability. An additional MAC overhead is necessary
to coordinate the nodes to allow cooperation and this overhead can possibly
cancel out the cooperative benefits. In this work, a completely distributed
protocol is proposed that allows nodes in the network to cooperate via Two-Hop
and Decode-and-Forward for transmitting their data to a common gateway node. It
is shown that high throughput gains are obtained in terms of the individual
throughput that can be guaranteed to any node in the network. These results are
validated by Monte Carlo simulations.
