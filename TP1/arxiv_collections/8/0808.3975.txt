We are discussing the present situation with neutron lifetime measurements.
There is a serious discrepancy between the previous experiments and the recent
precise experiment [1]. The possible reason of the discrepancy can be connected
with a quasi-elastic scattering of UCN on the surface of liquid fomblin which
was used for most of the previous experiments. The Monte Carlo simulation of
one of the previous experiments [2] shows that the result of this experiment
[2] has to be corrected and instead of the previous result 887.6 +/- 3 s the
new result 880.4 +/- 3 s has to be claimed. [1] A.P. Serebrov et al., Phys.
