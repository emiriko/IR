Heun's equation naturally appears as special cases of Fuchsian system of
differential equations of rank two with four singularities by introducing the
space of initial conditions of the sixth Painlev\'e equation. Middle
convolutions of the Fuchsian system are related with an integral transformation
of Heun's equation.
