Vacuum can be defined with exact mathematical precision as the state which
remains when a fermion, with all its special characteristics, is created out of
absolutely nothing. The definition leads to a special form of relativistic
quantum mechanics, which only requires the construction of a creation operator.
This form of quantum mechanics is especially powerful for analytic calculation,
at the same time as explaining, from first principles, many aspects of the
Standard Model of particle physics. In particular, the characteristics of the
weak, strong and electric interactions can be derived from the structure of the
creation operator itself.
