Experiments with cold atoms trapped in optical lattices offer the potential
to realize a variety of novel phases but suffer from severe spatial
inhomogeneity that can obscure signatures of new phases of matter and phase
boundaries. We use a high temperature series expansion to show that
compressibility in the core of a trapped Fermi-Hubbard system is related to
measurements of changes in double occupancy. This core compressibility filters
out edge effects, offering a direct probe of compressibility independent of
inhomogeneity. A comparison with experiments is made.
