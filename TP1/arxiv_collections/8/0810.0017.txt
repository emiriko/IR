We report STAR measurements of mid-rapidity yields for the $\Lambda$,
$\bar{\Lambda}$, $K^{0}_{S}$, $\Xi^{-}$, $\bar{\Xi}^{+}$, $\Omega^{-}$, and
$\bar{\Omega}^{+}$ particles in Cu+Cu and Au+Au $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ GeV
collisions. We show that at a given number of participating nucleons, bulk
strangeness production is higher in Cu+Cu collisions compared to Au+Au
collisions at the same center of mass energy, counter to predictions from the
Canonical formalism. We compare both the Cu+Cu and Au+Au yields to AMPT and
EPOS predictions, and find they reproduce key qualitative aspects of the data.
Finally, we investigate other scaling parameters and find bulk strangeness
production for both the measured data and theoretical predictions, scales
better with the number participants that undergo more than one collision.
