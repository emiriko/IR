We compute global log canonical thresholds of a large class of quasismooth
well-formed del Pezzo weighted hypersurfaces in
$\mathbb{P}(a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},a_{4})$. As a corollary we obtain the existence
of orbifold K\"ahler--Einstein metrics on many of them, and classify
exceptional and weakly exceptional quasismooth well-formed del Pezzo weighted
hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{P}(a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},a_{4})$.
