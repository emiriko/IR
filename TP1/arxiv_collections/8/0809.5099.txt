In this work, double-gated field effect transistors manufactured from
monolayer graphene are investigated. Conventional top-down CMOS-compatible
processes are applied except for graphene deposition by manual exfoliation.
Carrier mobilities in single- and double gated graphene field effect
transistors are compared. Even in double-gated graphene FETs, the carrier
mobility exceeds the universal mobility of silicon over nearly the entire
measured range. At comparable dimensions, reported mobilities for ultra thin
body silicon-on-insulator MOSFETs can not compete with graphene FET values.
