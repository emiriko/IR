In this short note we deal with a constructive scheme to decompose a
continuous family of matrices $A(\rho)$ asymptotically as $\rho\to0$ into
blocks corresponding to groups of eigenvalues of the limit matrix A(0). We also
discuss the extension of the scheme to matrix families depending upon
additional parameters and operators on Hilbert spaces.
