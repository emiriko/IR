We show results of Monte Carlo simulations of an array of monodispersed
magnetic monodomain particles, in a square lattice with dipolar interactions
and perpendicular uniaxial anisotropy. We first show the equilibrium phase
diagram of the system, which shows three phases, superparamagnetic (SP),
out-of-plane antiferromagnetic and in-plane antiferromagnetic with a
reorientation transition between the last two. We then employ a recently
introduced time quantified Monte Carlo method to study the relaxation of
autocorrelations of the particle array for different ratios of dipolar to
anisotropy energies. In the non-interacting case we show that relaxation is
exponential in time with characteristic times obeying a classic result by
Brown. When dipolar interactions are switched on, the relaxation is very well
described by stretched exponential forms in the whole time window and in both
the SP and ordered phases. Relaxation times still obey a nearly Arrhenius
behaviour, with a single effective energy barrier that decreases as the dipolar
interaction increases, a result that must be interpreted within the dynamics
protocol. No signs of glassy behaviour were found, in agreement with the
absence of disorder in the model system.
