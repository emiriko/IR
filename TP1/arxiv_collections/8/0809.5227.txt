Lattice QCD at finite chemical potential is difficult due to the sign
problem. We use stochastic quantization and complex Langevin dynamics to study
this issue. First results for QCD in the hopping expansion are encouraging.
U(1) and SU(3) one link models are used to gain further insight into why the
method appears to be successful.
