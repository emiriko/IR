We model tri-bimaximal lepton mixing from first principles in a way that
avoids the problem of the vacuum alignment characteristic of such models. This
is achieved by using a softly broken A4 symmetry realized with an isotriplet
fermion, also triplet under A4. No scalar A4-triplet is introduced. This
represents one possible realization of general schemes characterized by the
minimal set of either three or five physical parameters. In the three parameter
versions mee vanishes, while in the five parameter schemes the absolute scale
of neutrino mass, although not predicted, is related to the two Majorana
phases. The model realization we discuss is potentially testable at the LHC
through the peculiar leptonic decay patterns of the fermionic and scalar
triplets.
