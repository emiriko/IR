As a pure quantum state is being approached via linear feedback, and the
occupation number approaches and eventually goes below unity, optimal control
becomes crucial. We obtain theoretically the optimal feedback controller that
minimizes the uncertainty for a general linear measurement process, and show
that even in the absence of classical noise, a pure quantum state is not always
achievable via feedback. For Markovian measurements, the deviation from minimum
Heisenberg Uncertainty is found to be closely related to the extent to which
the device beats the free-mass Standard Quantum Limit for force measurement. We
then specialize to optical Markovian measurements, and demonstrate that a
slight modification to the usual input-output scheme -- either injecting
frequency independent squeezed vacuum or making a homodyne detection at a
non-phase quadrature -- allows controlled states of kilogram-scale mirrors in
future LIGO interferometers to reach occupation numbers significantly below
unity.
