A parameter estimation problem is considered for a one-dimensional stochastic
wave equation driven by additive space-time Gaussian white noise.
  The estimator is of spectral type and utilizes a finite number of the spatial
Fourier coefficients of the solution. The asymptotic properties of the
estimator are studied as the number of the Fourier coefficients increases,
while the observation time and the noise intensity are fixed.
