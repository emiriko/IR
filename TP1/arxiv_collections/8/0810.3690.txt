Many new physics models predict mechanisms that could produce a photon and
jets signature. We search in the photon + jets channel, independent of any
model, for new physics using CDF Run II data collected at the Fermilab Tevatron
from p-pbar collisions at a center of mass energy of 1.96 TeV. A variety of
techniques are applied to estimate the standard model expectation and
non-collision backgrounds. We examine several kinematic distributions including
transverse energy of the photon and invariant masses for discrepancies with the
standard model.
