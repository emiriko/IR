We study the dynamics of the adoption of new products by agents with
continuous opinions and discrete actions (CODA). The model is such that the
refusal in adopting a new idea or product is increasingly weighted by neighbor
agents as evidence against the product. Under these rules, we study the
distribution of adoption times and the final proportion of adopters in the
population. We compare the cases where initial adopters are clustered to the
case where they are randomly scattered around the social network and
investigate small world effects on the final proportion of adopters. The model
predicts a fat tailed distribution for late adopters which is verified by
empirical data.
