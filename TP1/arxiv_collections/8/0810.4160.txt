We study (0,2) deformations of N=2 Liouville field theory and its mirror
duality. A gauged linear sigma model construction of the ultraviolet theory
connects (0,2) deformations of Liouville field theory and (0,2) deformations of
N=2 SL(2,R)/U(1) coset model as a mirror duality. Our duality proposal from the
gauged linear sigma model completely agrees with the exact CFT analysis. In the
context of heterotic string compactifications, the deformation corresponds to
the introduction of a non-trivial gauge bundle. This non-compact
Landau-Ginzburg construction yields a novel way to study the gauge bundle
moduli for non-compact Calabi-Yau manifolds.
