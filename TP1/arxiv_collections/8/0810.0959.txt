In this article, I show that a recent family of quantum algorithms, based on
the quantum amplitude amplification algorithm, can be used to describe a
cognitive heuristic called availability bias. The amplitude amplification
algorithm is used to define quantitatively the ease of a memory task, while the
quantum amplitude estimation and the quantum counting algorithms to describe
cognitive tasks such as estimating probability or approximate counting.
