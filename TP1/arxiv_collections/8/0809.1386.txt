This survey, which contains very few proofs, addresses the general question:
Over a given type of field, is there a natural class of varieties which
automatically have a rational point? Fields under consideration here include:
finite fields, p-adic fields, function fields in one or two variables over an
algebraically closed field. Classical answers are given by the
Chevalley-Warning theorem and by Tsen's theorem. More general answers were
provided by a theorem of Graber, Harris and Starr and by a theorem of Esnault.
The latter results apply to rationally connected varieties. We discuss these
varieties from various angles : weak approximation, R-equivalence, Chow group
of zero-cycles. Ongoing work on `rationally simply connected' varieties over
function fields in two variables is also mentioned. A common thread in this
report is the study of the special fibre of a scheme over a discrete valuation
ring: if the generic fibre has a simple geometry, what does it imply for the
special fibre?
