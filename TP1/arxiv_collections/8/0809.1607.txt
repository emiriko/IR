We study the potential observation at the LHC of CP-violating effects in stop
production and subsequent cascade decays, g g -> tilde{t}_i tilde{t}_i,
tilde{t}_i -> t tilde{chi}^0_j, tilde{chi}^0_j -> tilde{\chi}^0_1 l^+ l^-,
within the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model. We study T-odd asymmetries
based on triple products between the different decay products. There may be a
large CP asymmetry at the parton level, but there is a significant dilution at
the hadronic level after integrating over the parton distribution functions.
Consequently, even for scenarios where large CP intrinsic asymmetries are
expected, the measurable asymmetry is rather small. High luminosity and precise
measurements of masses, branching ratios and CP asymmetries may enable
measurements of the CP-violating parameters in cascade decays at the LHC.
