Recent advances in neurosciences and psychology have provided evidence that
affective phenomena pervade intelligence at many levels, being inseparable from
the cognitionaction loop. Perception, attention, memory, learning,
decisionmaking, adaptation, communication and social interaction are some of
the aspects influenced by them. This work draws its inspirations from
neurobiology, psychophysics and sociology to approach the problem of building
autonomous robots capable of interacting with each other and building
strategies based on temperamental decision mechanism. Modelling emotions is a
relatively recent focus in artificial intelligence and cognitive modelling.
Such models can ideally inform our understanding of human behavior. We may see
the development of computational models of emotion as a core research focus
that will facilitate advances in the large array of computational systems that
model, interpret or influence human behavior. We propose a model based on a
scalable, flexible and modular approach to emotion which allows runtime
evaluation between emotional quality and performance. The results achieved
showed that the strategies based on temperamental decision mechanism strongly
influence the system performance and there are evident dependency between
emotional state of the agents and their temperamental type, as well as the
dependency between the team performance and the temperamental configuration of
the team members, and this enable us to conclude that the modular approach to
emotional programming based on temperamental theory is the good choice to
develop computational mind models for emotional behavioral Multi-Agent systems.
