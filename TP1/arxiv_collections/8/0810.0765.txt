We study cosmological implications of a Lorentz invariance violating
DGP-inspired braneworld scenario. A minimally coupled scalar field and a
single, fixed-norm, Lorentz-violating timelike vector field within an
interactive picture provide a wide parameter space which accounts for late-time
acceleration and transition to phantom phase of the scalar field.
