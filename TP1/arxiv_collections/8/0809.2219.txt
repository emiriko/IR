We determine the phase diagrams of conservative diffusive contact processes
by means of numerical simulations. These models are versions of the ordinary
diffusive single-creation, pair-creation and triplet-creation contact processes
in which the particle number is conserved. The transition between the frozen
and active states was determined by studying the system in the subcritical
regime and the nature of the transition, whether continuous or first order, was
determined by looking at the fractal dimension of the critical cluster. For the
single-creation model the transition remains continuous for any diffusion rate.
For pair- and triplet-creation models, however, the transition becomes first
order for high enough diffusion rate. Our results indicate that in the limit of
infinite diffusion rate the jump in density equals 2/3 for the pair-creation
model and 5/6 for the triplet-creation model.
