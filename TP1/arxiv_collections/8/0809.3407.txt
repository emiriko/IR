We investigate the propagation of a dark beam in a defocusing medium in the
strong nonlinear regime. We observe for the first time a shock fan filled with
non-interacting one-dimensional grey solitons that emanates from a gradient
catastrophe developing around a null of the optical intensity. Remarkably this
scenario turns out to be very robust, persisting also when the material
nonlocal response averages the nonlinearity over dimensions much larger than
the emerging soliton filaments.
