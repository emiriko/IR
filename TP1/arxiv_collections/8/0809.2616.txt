Deflecting an asteroid from an Earth impact trajectory requires only small
velocity changes, typically of the order of microns per second, if done many
years ahead of time. For this, a highly precise method of determining the need,
magnitude, and direction of a deflection is required. Although the required
precision can be achieved by much less accurate extended observations, an
intrinsic resolution of $\mu $m/s permits the live monitoring of
nongravitational orbital perturbations (Yarkovsky effect), and of a deflection
effort itself. Here, it is proposed to deploy on the asteroid's surface
multiple radio units to form a phased array capable of measuring radial
velocities relative to Earth to about 1 $\mu$m/s and ranges to 5 m. The same
technology can also be used for scientific applications such as very-long
baseline radio astronomy, milli-Hertz gravitational wave detection, or mapping
of the solar wind.
