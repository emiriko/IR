The mechanism of magnetization reversal in single-domain ferromagnetic
particles is of interest in many applications, in most of which losses must be
minimized. In cancer therapy by hyperthermia the opposite requirement prevails:
the specific loss power should be maximized. Of the mechanisms of dissipation,
here we study the effect of Neel relaxation on magnetic nanoparticles unable to
move or rotate and compare the losses in linearly and circularly polarized
field. We present exact analytical solutions of the Landau-Lifshitz equation as
derived from the Gilbert equation and use the calculated time-dependent
magnetizations to find the energy loss per cycle. In frequencies lower than the
Larmor frequency linear polarization is found to be the better source of heat
power, at high frequencies (beyond the Larmor frequency) circular polarization
is preferable.
