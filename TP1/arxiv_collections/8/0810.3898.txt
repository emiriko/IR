In this paper we consider structurally damped plate and wave equations with
point and distributed random forces. In order to treat space dimensions more
than one, we work in the setting of $L^q$--spaces with (possibly small)
$q\in(1,2)$. We establish existence, uniqueness and regularity of mild and weak
solutions to the stochastic equations employing recent theory for stochastic
evolution equations in UMD Banach spaces.
