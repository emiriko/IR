We analyze the spatial distributions of two groups of benthic foraminifera
(Adelosina spp. + Quinqueloculina spp. and Elphidium spp.), along Sicilian
coast, and their correlation with six different heavy metals, responsible for
the pollution. Samples were collected inside the Gulf of Palermo, which has a
high level of pollution due to heavy metals, and along the coast of Lampedusa
island (Sicily Channel, Southern Mediterranean), which is characterized by
unpolluted sea waters. Because of the environmental pollution we find: (i) an
anticorrelated spatial behaviour between the two groups of benthic foraminifera
analyzed; (ii) an anticorrelated (correlated) spatial behaviour between the
first (second) group of benthic foraminifera with metal concentrations; (iii)
an almost uncorrelated spatial behaviour between low concentrations of metals
and the first group of foraminifera in clean sea water sites. We introduce a
two-species model based on the generalized Lotka-Volterra equations in the
presence of a multiplicative noise, which models the interaction between
species and environmental pollution due to the presence in top-soft sediments
of heavy metals. The interaction coefficients between the two species are kept
constant with values in the coexistence regime. Using proper values for the
initial conditions and the model parameters, we find for the two species a
theoretical spatial distribution behaviour in a good agreement with the data
obtained from the 63 sites analyzed in our study.
