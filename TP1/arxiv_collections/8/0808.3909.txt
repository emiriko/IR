The light quark masses are determined using a new QCD Finite Energy Sum Rule
(FESR) in the pseudoscalar channel. This FESR involves an integration kernel
designed to reduce considerably the contribution of the (unmeasured) hadronic
resonance spectral functions. The QCD sector of the FESR includes perturbative
QCD (PQCD) to five loop order, and the leading non-perturbative terms. In the
hadronic sector the dominant contribution is from the pseudoscalar meson pole.
Using Contour Improved Perturbation Theory (CIPT) the results for the quark
masses at a scale of 2 GeV are $m_u(Q= 2 {GeV}) = 2.9 \pm 0.2 {MeV}$, $m_d(Q= 2
{GeV}) = 5.3 \pm 0.4 {MeV}$, and $m_s(Q= 2 {GeV}) = 102 \pm 8 {MeV}$, for
$\Lambda = 381 \pm 16 {MeV}$, corresponding to $\alpha_s(M_\tau^2) = 0.344
  \pm0.009$. In this framework the systematic uncertainty in the quark masses
from the unmeasured hadronic resonance spectral function amounts to less than 2
- 3 %. The remaining uncertainties above arise from those in $\Lambda$, the
unknown six-loop PQCD contribution, and the gluon condensate, which are all
potentially subject to improvement.
