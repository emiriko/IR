We study flavor violation in the quark sector in a purely 4D, two-site
effective field theory description of the Standard Model and just their first
Kaluza-Klein excitations from a warped extra dimension. The warped 5D framework
can provide solutions to both the Planck-weak and flavor hierarchies of the SM.
It is also related (via the AdS/CFT correspondence) to partial compositeness of
the SM. We focus on the dominant contributions in the two-site model to two
observables which we argue provide the strongest flavor constraints, namely,
epsilon_K and BR(b -> s gamma), where contributions in the two-site model occur
at tree and loop-level, respectively. In particular, we demonstrate that a
"tension" exists between these two observables in the sense that they have
opposite dependence on composite site Yukawa couplings, making it difficult to
decouple flavor-violating effects using this parameter. We choose the size of
the composite site QCD coupling based on the relation of the two-site model to
the 5D model (addressing the Planck-weak hierarchy), where we match the 5D QCD
coupling to the 4D coupling at the loop-level and assuming negligible
tree-level brane-localized kinetic terms. We estimate that a larger size of the
5D gauge coupling is constrained by the requirement of 5D perturbativity. We
find that \sim O(5) TeV mass scale for the new particles in the two-site model
can then be consistent with both observables. We also compare our analysis of
epsilon_K in the two-site model to that in 5D models, including both the cases
of a brane-localized and bulk Higgs.
