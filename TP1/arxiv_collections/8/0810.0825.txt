The concept of plasma relaxation as a constrained energy minimization is
reviewed. Recent work by the authors on generalizing this approach to partially
relaxed three-dimensional plasma systems in a way consistent with chaos theory
is discussed, with a view to clarifying the thermodynamic aspects of the
variational approach used. Other entropy-related approaches to finding
long-time steady states of turbulent or chaotic plasma systems are also briefly
reviewed.
