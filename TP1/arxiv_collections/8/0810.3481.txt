We investigate spin-one color superconductivity of a single quark flavor
using the Ginzburg-Landau theory. First we examine the classic analysis of
Bailin and Love and show that by restricting to the so-called inert states, it
misses the true ground state in a part of the phase diagram. This suggests the
use of the more general, noninert states in particular within three-flavor
quark matter where the color neutrality constraint imposes stress on the
spin-one pairing and may disfavor the symmetric color-spin-locked state. In the
second part of the paper we show that, in analogy to some ferromagnetic
materials, lack of space-inversion symmetry leads to a new term in the
Ginzburg-Landau functional, which favors a spatially nonuniform long-range
ordering with a spiral structure. In color superconductors, this new
parity-violating term is a tiny effect of weak-interaction physics. The
modified phase diagram is determined and the corresponding ground states for
all the phases constructed. At the end, we estimate the coefficient of the new
term in the free energy functional, and discuss its relevance for the
phenomenology of dense quark matter.
