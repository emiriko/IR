On the basis of the Green function method, analytical solutions of the
diffusion equation which describes nonstationary migration of nonequilibrium
interstitial impurity atoms have been derived. It is supposed that the initial
distribution of nonequilibrium impurity interstitials is formed due to ion
implantation and, therefore, is described by the Gaussian function. The
condition of the constant concentration of impurity interstitials (the
Dirichlet boundary condition) or reflecting boundary condition was imposed on
the surface of a semiconductor. The Dirichlet boundary condition was also
enforced for the concentration of impurity interstitials in the infinity, i.e.,
in the bulk of a semiconductor. On the basis of the solutions derived the
redistribution of ion-implanted boron in silicon substrate during
low-temperature thermal treatment has been simulated. The calculated profile of
boron atoms after annealing agrees well with experimental data. It means that
the analytical solutions derived can be used both for verifying the numerical
results and for modeling the long-range migration of nonequilibrium impurity
interstitials during low-temperature thermal treatments.
