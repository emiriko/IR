We construct the general vortex solution in a fully-Higgsed, color-flavor
locked vacuum of a non-Abelian gauge theory, where the gauge group is taken to
be the product of an arbitrary simple group and U(1), with a Fayet-Iliopoulos
term. The strict correspondence between vortices and lumps in the associated
Non-Linear Sigma-Model which arise in the limit of strong coupling is pointed
out. The construction of the vortex moduli space is derived here as a
consequence of this correspondence.
