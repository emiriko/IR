In formal language theory, one of the most fundamental tools, known as
pumping lemmas, is extremely useful for regular and context-free languages.
However, there are natural properties for which the pumping lemmas are of
little use. One of such examples concerns a notion of advice, which depends
only on the size of an underlying input. A standard pumping lemma encounters
difficulty in proving that a given language is not regular in the presence of
advice. We develop its substitution, called a swapping lemma for regular
languages, to demonstrate the non-regularity of a target language with advice.
For context-free languages, we also present a similar form of swapping lemma,
which serves as a technical tool to show that certain languages are not
context-free with advice.
