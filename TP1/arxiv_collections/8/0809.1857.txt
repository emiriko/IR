We investigate entanglement of solitons in the continuum-limit of the
nonlinear Frenkel-Kontorova chain. We find that the entanglement of solitons
manifests particle-like behavior as they are characterized by localization of
entanglement. The von-Neumann entropy of solitons mixes critical with
noncritical behaviors. Inside the core of the soliton the logarithmic increase
of the entropy is faster than the universal increase of a critical field,
whereas outside the core the entropy decreases and saturates the constant value
of the corresponding massive noncritical field. In addition, two solitons
manifest long-range entanglement that decreases with the separation of the
solitons more slowly than the universal decrease of the critical field.
Interestingly, in the noncritical regime of the Frenkel-Kontorova model,
entanglement can even increase with the separation of the solitons. We show
that most of the entanglement of the so-called internal modes of the solitons
is saturated by local degrees of freedom inside the core, and therefore we
suggest using the internal modes as carriers of quantum information.
