A new improved quark mass density-dependent model including u, d quarks,
$\sigma$ mesons, $\omega$ mesons and $\rho$ mesons is presented. Employing this
model, the properties of nuclear matter, neutron matter and neutron star are
studied. We find that it can describe above properties successfully. The
results given by the new improved quark mass density- dependent model and by
the quark meson coupling model are compared.
