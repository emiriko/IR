The prospects for electroweak measurements at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)
are discussed. In addition to high-luminosity results, special emphasis is
placed on early start-up measurements with a total luminosity ranging from
10/pb to 100/pb, using the general-purpose detectors ATLAS and CMS and their
initially larger calibration and alignment uncertainties. Topics discussed here
include inclusive W and Z production, W-boson mass, Z forward-backward
asymmetry, Z-plus-jets production and di-boson production, the latter
constraining trilinear electroweak gauge couplings. (Invited talk at the 34th
ICHEP, Philadelphia, USA, July/August 2008)
