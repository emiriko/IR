Let f be a rational function such that the multipliers of all repelling
periodic points are real. We prove that the Julia set of such a function
belongs to a circle. Combining this with a result of Fatou we conclude that
whenever J(f) belongs to a smooth curve, it also belongs to a circle. Then we
discuss rational functions whose Julia sets belong to a circle.
