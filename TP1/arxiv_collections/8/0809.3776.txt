Thermodynamic properties of charge-stabilised colloidal suspensions depend
sensitively on the effective charge of the macroions, which can be
substantially lower than the bare charge in the case of strong
counterion-macroion association. A theory of charge renormalization is
proposed, combining an effective one-component model of charged colloids with a
thermal criterion for distinguishing between free and associated counterions.
The theory predicts, with minimal computational effort, osmotic pressures of
deionized suspensions of highly charged colloids in close agreement with
large-scale simulations of the primitive model.
