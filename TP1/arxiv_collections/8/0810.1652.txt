We study the conditions under which a K\"ahlerian structure $(G,J)$ of
general natural lift type on the cotangent bundle $T^*M$ of a Riemannian
manifold $(M,g)$ has constant holomorphic sectional curvature. We obtain that a
certain parameter involved in the condition for $(T^*M,G,J)$ to be a
K\"ahlerian manifold, is expressed as a rational function of the other two,
their derivatives, the constant sectional curvature of the base manifold
$(M,g)$, and the constant holomorphic sectional curvature of the general
natural K\"ahlerian structure $(G,J)$.
