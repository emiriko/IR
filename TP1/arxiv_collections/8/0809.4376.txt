The standard interpretation of the Stern-Gerlach experiment assumes that the
atomic center-of-mass plays the role of "quantum apparatus" for the atomic
spin. Following a recent, decoherence-based, model fitting with this
interpretation, we investigate whether or not such model can be constructed.
Our conclusions are somewhat surprising: only if the screen capturing the atoms
in the experiment brings the information about the atomic-nucleus
center-of-mass, one may construct the model desired. The nucleus $CM$ system is
monitored by the nucleus "relative system ($R$)". There appear the effective
(the electrons-mediated) interaction between $CM$ and $R$ that is possibly
responsible for decoherence. For larger atoms, the interaction scales as $Z^2$
($Z$ is the "atomic number"), being totally independent on the atomic mass. The
interaction selects the $CM$-wave-packet states as the approximate pointer
basis. Interestingly enough, the model stems nonoccurrence of decoherence due
to the internal environment for the larger systems (such as the macromolecules
and the macroscopic systems). Certainly, disproving this model (e.g. in an
experiment) stems the active role of the screen, which becomes responsible for
the "$CM$ + spin"-state "reduction" ("collapse"), i.e. for the irreversible
retrieval of the classical information from the quantum world.
