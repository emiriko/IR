The nonlinear $\sigma$-model in (2+1) dimensions admits topological
configurations called skyrmions. The topological charge of skyrmions turn out
to be the fermionic number and the fermionic current is dictated by the
skyrmion field configuration. The peculiar feature of this model is that a Hopf
term introduced into the Lagrangian can lead to exotic spin and fractional
statistics.
