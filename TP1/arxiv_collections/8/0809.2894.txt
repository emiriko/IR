We investigate the electronic properties of graphene upon water adsorption
and study the influence of the SiO2 substrate in this context using density
functional calculations. Perfect suspended graphene is rather insensitive to
H2O adsorbates, as doping requires highly oriented H2O clusters. For graphene
on a defective SiO2 substrate, we find a strongly different behavior: H2O
adsorbates can shift the substrate's impurity bands and change their
hybridization with the graphene bands. In this way, H2O can lead to doping of
graphene for much lower adsorbate concentrations than for free hanged graphene.
The effect depends strongly on the microscopic substrate properties.
