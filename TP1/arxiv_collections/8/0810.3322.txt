I show how to associate a Clifford algebra to a graph. I describe the
structure of these Clifford graph algebras and provide many examples and
pictures. I describe which graphs correspond to isomorphic Clifford algebras
and also discuss other related sets of graphs. This construction can be used to
build models of representations of simply-laced compact Lie groups.
