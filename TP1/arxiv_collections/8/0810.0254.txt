Wilson loops in large N gauge theory exhibit a weak to strong coupling
transition as the loop is dilated. A multiplicative matrix model captures the
universal behavior associated with this transition. A universal scaling
function is obtained in a double scaling limit. Numerical studies show that
both large N QCD in three dimensions and the SU(N) principal chiral model in
two dimensions are in the same universality class.
