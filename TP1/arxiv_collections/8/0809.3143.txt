Quantum impurity models describe interactions between some local degrees of
freedom and a continuum of non-interacting fermionic or bosonic states. The
investigation of quantum impurity models is a starting point towards the
understanding of more complex strongly correlated systems, but quantum impurity
models also provide the description of various correlated mesoscopic
structures, biological and chemical processes, atomic physics and describe
phenomena such as dissipation or dephasing. Prototypes of these models are the
Anderson impurity model, or the single- and multi-channel Kondo models. The
numerical renormalization group method (NRG) proposed by Wilson in mid 70's has
been used in its original form for a longtime as one of the most accurate and
powerful methods to deal with quatum impurity problems. Recently, a number of
new developments took place: First, a spectral sum-conserving density matrix
NRG approach (DM-NRG) has been developed, which has also been generalized for
non-Abelian symmetries. In this manual we introduce some of the basic concepts
of the NRG method and present recently developed Flexible DM-NRG code. This
code uses user-defined non-Abelian symmetries dynamically, computes spectral
functions, expectation values of local operators for user-defined impurity
models. The code can also use a uniform density of states as well as a
user-defined density of states. The current version of the code assumes
fermionic bath's and it uses any number of U(1), SU(2) charge SU(2) or Z(2)
symmetries. The Flexible DM-NRG code can be downloaded from
