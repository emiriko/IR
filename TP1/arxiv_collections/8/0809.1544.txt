A two level model of a single molecule undergoing spectral diffusion dynamics
and interacting with a sequence of two short laser pulses is investigated.
Analytical solution for the probability of n=0,1,2 photon emission events for
the telegraph and Gaussian processes are obtained. We examine under what
circumstances the photon statistics emerging from such pump-probe set up
provides new information on the stochastic process parameters, and what are the
measurement limitations of this technique. The impulsive and selective limits,
the semiclassical approximation, and the fast modulation limit, exhibit general
behaviors of this new type of spectroscopy. We show, that in the fast
modulation limit, where one has to use impulsive pulses in order to obtain
meaningful results, the information on the photon statistics is contained in
the molecule's dipole correlation function, equivalently to continuous wave
experiments. In contrast, the photon statistics obtained within the selective
limit depends on the both spectral shifts and rates and exhibits oscillations,
which are not found in the corresponding line-shape.
