We consider a self-interacting scalar field in a de Sitter background and
deal with the associated infrared divergences in a purely diagrammatic way
using the in-in formalism. In the particular case of a large N O(N) invariant
scalar field theory with quartic self-interactions we recover the result that
the connected four-point correlation function, which is a signal of
non-Gaussianity, is non-perturbatively enhanced with respect to its tree-level
value.
