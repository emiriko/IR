We present a self-consistent analysis of the photoemission spectral function
A(k, w) of graphene monolayers grown epitaxially on SiC(0001). New information
derived from spectral intensity anomalies (in addition to linewidths and peak
positions) confirms that sizeable kinks in the electronic dispersion at the
Dirac energy ED and near the Fermi level EF arise from many-body interactions,
not single-particle effects such as substrate bonding or extra bands. The
relative electron-phonon scattering rate from phonons at different energy
scales evolves with doping. The electron-phonon coupling strength is extracted
and found to be much larger (~3.5-5 times) than predicted.
