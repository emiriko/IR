Some of the most outstanding questions in the field of gravitation and
geometry remain unsolved as a result of our limited understanding of the global
structure of the spacetime geometry and the role played by global spacetime
diffeomorphism group in quantum gravity. Some insight into these important
questions may be gained by looking at certain aspects of general covariance and
observables in classical gravitational theory.
  In this paper I shall define as set of classical geometric observables of the
gravitational field by which I mean Diff(M)-gauge invariant cohomology classes
defined on a Lorentzian structure. They represent global characteristics of the
physical gravitational phenomena, are linked to the topology of the spacetime,
and can be used in constructing new Lagrangians.
  The problem of finding a complete set of data out of observables is related
perhaps to the fact that at present moment, manifolds in dimension 4 and above
cannot be effectively classified. One could interpret this result as a pointer
to the possibility that there might be spacetimes with different topologies
(i.e., different global characteristics) which have indistinguishable local
spacetime geometry.
