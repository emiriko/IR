Direct photons are ideal tools to investigate kinematical and thermodynamical
conditions of heavy ion collisions since they are emitted from all stages of
the collision and once produced they leave the interaction region without
further modification by the medium. The PHENIX experiment at RHIC has measured
direct photon production in p+p and Au+Au collisions at 200 GeV over a wide
transverse momentum ($p_T$) range. The $p$ + $p$ measurements allow a
fundamental test of QCD, and serve as a baseline when we try to disentangle
more complex mechanisms producing high $p_T$ direct photons in Au+Au. As for
thermal photons in Au+Au we overcome the difficulties due to the large
background from hadronic decays by measuring "almost real" virtual photons
which appear as low invariant mass $e^+e^-$ pairs: a significant excess of
direct photons is measured above the above next-to-leading order perturbative
quantum chromodynamics calculations. Additional insights on the origin of
direct photons can be gained with the study of the azimuthal anisotropy which
benefits from the increased statistics and reaction plane resolution achieved
in RHIC Year-7 data.
