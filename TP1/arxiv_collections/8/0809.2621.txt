We discuss the results of several small perturbations to the thermodynamic
properties of Kagome Lattice Heisenberg Model (KLHM) at high and intermediate
temperatures, including Curie impurities, dilution, in-plane and out of plane
Dzyaloshinski-Moria (DM) anisotropies and exchange anisotropy. We examine the
combined role of Curie impurities and dilution in the behavior of uniform
susceptibility. We also study the changes in specific heat and entropy with
various anisotropies. Their relevance to newly discovered materials
ZnCu3(OH)6Cl2 is explored. We find that the magnetic susceptibility is well
described by about 6 percent impurity and dilution. We also find that the
entropy difference between the material and KLHM is well described by the DM
parameter D_z/J~0.1.
