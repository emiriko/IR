The ideals generated by pfaffians of mixed size contained in a subladder of a
skew-symmetric matrix of indeterminates define arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay,
projectively normal, reduced and irreducible projective varieties. We show that
these varieties belong to the G-biliaison class of a complete intersection. In
particular, they are glicci.
