We investigate the evolution of superconducting properties by doping
non-magnetic impurity in single crystals of YNi2-xPtxB2C (x=0-0.2). With
increasing Pt doping the critical temperature (Tc) monotonically decreases from
15.85K and saturates to a value ~13K for x>0.14. However, unlike conventional
s-wave superconductors, the upper critical field (HC2) along both
crystallographic directions a and c decreases with increasing Pt doping.
Specific heat measurements show that the density of states (N(EF)) at the Fermi
level (EF) and the Debye temperatures (Theta_D) in this series remains constant
within the error bars of our measurement. We explain our results based on the
increase in intraband scattering in the multiband superconductor YNi2B2C.
