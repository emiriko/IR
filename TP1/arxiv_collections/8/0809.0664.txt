Grover's algorithm has achieved great success. But quantum search algorithms
still are not complete algorithms because of Grover's Oracle. We concerned on
this problem and present a new quantum search algorithm in adiabatic model
without Oracle. We analyze the general difficulties in quantum search
algorithms and show how to solve them in the present algorithm. As well this
algorithm could deal with both single-solution and multi-solution searches
without modification. We also implement this algorithm on NMR quantum computer.
It is the first experiment which perform a real quantum database search rather
than a marked-state search.
