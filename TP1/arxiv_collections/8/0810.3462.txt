The HeH$^+$ cation undergoes dissociative recombination with a free electron
to produce neutral He and H fragments. We present calculations using ab initio
quantum defects and Fano's rovibrational frame transformation technique, along
with the methodology of PRL 89, 263003 (2002), to obtain the recombination rate
both in the low-energy (1-300 meV) and high-energy (ca. 0.6 hartree) regions.
We obtain very good agreement with experimental results, demonstrating that
this relatively simple method is able to reproduce observed rates for both
indirect dissociative recombination, driven by rovibrationally autoionizing
states in the low-energy region, and direct dissociative recombination, driven
by electronically autoionizing Rydberg states attached to higher-energy excited
cation channels.
