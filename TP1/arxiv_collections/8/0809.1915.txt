We investigate the possibility that the observed behavior of test particles
outside galaxies, which is usually explained by assuming the presence of dark
matter, is the result of the dynamical evolution of particles in higher
dimensional space-times. Hence, dark matter may be a direct consequence of the
presence of an extra force, generated by the presence of extra-dimensions,
which modifies the dynamic law of motion, but does not change the intrinsic
properties of the particles, like, for example, the mass (inertia). We discuss
in some detail several possible particular forms for the extra force, and the
acceleration law of the particles is derived. Therefore, the constancy of the
galactic rotation curves may be considered as an empirical evidence for the
existence of the extra dimensions.
