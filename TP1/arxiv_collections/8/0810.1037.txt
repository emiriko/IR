A joint analysis of solar neutrino data together with the new KamLAND data is
presented in the RSFP framework. It is investigated that how the new KamLAND
data effects the allowed regions at different $\mu B$ values. A limit on $\mu
B$ value is found at the different confidence level intervals. It is shown that
the RSFP scenerio does not have a crucial role on the solar neutrino data.
