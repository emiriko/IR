In this pedagogically motivated work, the process of migration in reflection
seismics has been considered from a rigorously mathematical viewpoint. An
inclined subsurface reflector with a constant dipping angle has been shown to
cause a shift in the normal moveout equation, with the peak of the moveout
curve tracing an elliptic locus. Since any subsurface reflector actually has a
non-uniform spatial variation, the use of a more comprehensive principle of
migration, by adopting the wave equation, has been argued to be necessary. By
this approach an expression has been derived for both the amplitude and the
phase of a subsurface wavefield with vertical velocity variation. This
treatment has entailed the application of the WKB approximation, whose
self-consistency has been established by the fact that the logarithmic
variation of the velocity is very slow in the vertical direction, a feature
that is much more strongly upheld at increasingly greater subsurface depths.
Finally, it has been demonstrated that for a planar subsurface wavefield, there
is an equivalence between the constant velocity Stolt Migration algorithm and
the stationary phase approximation method (by which the origin of the reflected
subsurface signals is determined).
