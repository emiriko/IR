An effort is made to study the contrast in magnetic behavior resulting from
minimal disorder introduced by substitution of 2.5% Ga or Al in Mn-site of
La${_{0.9}}$Sr$_{0.1}$MnO${_3}$. It is considered that Ga or Al selectively
creates disorder within the orbital domains or on its walls, causing
enhancement of Griffiths phase (GP) singularity for the former and
disappearance of it in the later case. It is shown that Ga replaces Mn$^{3+}$
which is considered to be concentrated within the domains, whereas Al replaces
Mn$^{4+}$ which is segregated on the hole-rich walls, without causing any
significant effect on structure or ferromagnetic transition temperatures. Thus,
it is presumed that the effect of disorder created by Ga extend across the bulk
of the domain having correlation over similar length-scale resulting in
enhancement of GP phenomenon. On the contrary, effect of disorder created by Al
remains restricted to the walls resulting in the modification of the dynamics
arising from the domain walls and suppresses the GP. Moreover contrasting
features are observed in the low temperature region of the compounds; a
re-entrant spin glass like behavior is observed in the Ga doped sample, while
the observed characteristics for the Al doped sample is ascribed only to
modified domain wall dynamics with the absence of any glassy phase. Distinctive
features in third order susceptibility measurements reveals that the magnetic
ground state of the entire series comprises of orbital domain states. These
observations bring out the role of the nature of disorder on GP phenomenon and
also reconfirms the character of self-organization in low-doped manganites.
