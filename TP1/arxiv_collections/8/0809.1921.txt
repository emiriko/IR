This paper presents an experimental and modeling study of the oxidation of
large linear akanes (from C10) representative from diesel fuel from low to
intermediate temperature (550-1100 K) including the negative temperature
coefficient (NTC) zone. The experimental study has been performed in a
jet-stirred reactor at atmospheric pressure for n-decane and a
n-decane/n-hexadecane blend. Detailed kinetic mechanisms have been developed
using computer-aided generation (EXGAS) with improved rules for writing
reactions of primary products. These mechanisms have allowed a correct
simulation of the experimental results obtained. Data from the literature for
the oxidation of n-decane, in a jet-stirred reactor at 10 bar and in shock
tubes, and of n-dodecane in a pressurized flow reactor have also been correctly
modeled. A considerable improvement of the prediction of the formation of
products is obtained compared to our previous models. Flow rates and
sensitivity analyses have been performed in order to better understand the
influence of reactions of primary products. A modeling comparison between
linear alkanes for C8 to C16 in terms of ignition delay times and the formation
of light products is also discussed.
