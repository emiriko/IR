Sound emergence in clarinetlike instruments is investigated in terms of
instability of the static regime. Various models of reed-bore coupling are
considered, from the pioneering work of Wilson and Beavers ["Operating modes of
the clarinet", J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 56, 653--658 (1974)] to more recent modeling
including viscothermal bore losses and vena contracta at the reed inlet. The
pressure threshold above which these models may oscillate as well as the
frequency of oscillation at threshold are calculated. In addition to Wilson and
Beavers' previous conclusions concerning the role of the reed damping in the
selection of the register the instrument will play on, the influence of the
reed motion induced flow is also emphasized, particularly its effect on playing
frequencies, contributing to reduce discrepancies between Wilson and Beavers'
experimental results and theory, despite discrepancies still remain concerning
the pressure threshold. Finally, analytical approximations of the oscillating
solution based on Fourier series expansion are obtained in the vicinity of the
threshold of oscillation. This allows to emphasize the conditions which
determine the nature of the bifurcation (direct or inverse) through which the
note may emerge, with therefore important consequences on the musical playing
performances.
