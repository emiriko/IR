We report measurement of the inelastic and elastic collision rates for
^{88}Sr atoms in the (5s5p)^3P_0 state in a crossed-beam optical dipole trap.
This is the first measurement of ultracold collision properties of a ^3P_0
level in an alkaline-earth atom or atom with similar electronic structure.
Since the (5s5p)^3P_0 state is the lowest level of the triplet manifold, large
loss rates indicate the importance of principle-quantum-number-changing
collisions at short range. We also provide an estimate of the collisional loss
rates for the (5s5p){^3P_2} state.
