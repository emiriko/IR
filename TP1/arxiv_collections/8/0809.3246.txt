Band calculations for supercells of La$_{(2-x)}$Ba$_x$CuO$_4$ show that the
rigid band model for doping is less adequate than what is commonly assumed. In
particular, weak ferromagnetism (FM) can appear locally around clusters of high
Ba concentration. The clustering is important at large dilution and averaged
models for magnetism, such as the virtual crystal approximation, are unable to
stabilize magnetic moments. These results give a support to the idea that weak
FM can be the cause of the destruction of superconductivity at high hole
doping.
