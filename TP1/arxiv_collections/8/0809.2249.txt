This paper reviews a result of Jensen on characters of some tilting modules
for $\SL_3(k)$, where $k$ has characteristic at least five and fills in some
gaps in the proof of this result. We then apply the result to finding some
decomposition numbers for three part partitions for the symmetric group and the
Hecke algebra. We review what is known for characteristic two and three. The
quantum case is also considered: analogous results hold for the mixed quantum
group where $q$ is an $l$th root of unity with $l$ at least three and thus also
hold for the associated Hecke algebra.
