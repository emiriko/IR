Scintillator detectors can be used in experiments searching for neutrinoless
double beta decay. A wide variety of double beta decay candidate isotopes can
be made into scintillators or can be loaded into scintillators. Experimental
programs developing liquid xenon, inorganic crystals, and Nd-loaded liquid
scintillator are described in this review. Experiments with 48Ca and 150Nd
benefit from their high endpoint which places the neutrinoless double beta
decay signal above most backgrounds from natural radioactivity.
