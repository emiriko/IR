We present preliminary results on a search for squarks and gluinos in
proton-antiproton collisions with a center-of-mass energy of 1.96 TeV and based
on about 2.0 fb-1 of data collected by the CDF detector in the Tevatron Run II.
Events with multiple jets of hadrons and large missing transverse energy in the
final state are studied within the framework of minimal supergravity (mSUGRA)
and assuming R-parity conservation. The results are compared to Standard Model
predictions and limits on gluino and squark masses are extracted. A specific
search for the supersymmetric partner of the bottom quark produced from gluino
decays is carried out using a sample of events with missing transverse energy
and two or more jets, at least one of them b-tagged. Good agreement is found
between data and Standard Model predictions, and limits on gluino and sbottom
masses are extracted.
