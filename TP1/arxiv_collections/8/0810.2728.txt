This work reviews foundations and applications of the complex-energy
continuum shell model that provides a consistent many-body description of bound
states, resonances, and scattering states. The model can be considered a
quasi-stationary open quantum system extension of the standard configuration
interaction approach for well-bound (closed) systems.
