Motivated by possible applications to the antiferromagnetic precursor of the
high-temperature superconductor Na$_x$CoO$_2\cdot$yH$_2$O, we use a systematic
low-energy effective field theory for magnons and holes to study different
phases of doped antiferromagnets on the honeycomb lattice. The effective action
contains a leading single-derivative term, similar to the Shraiman-Siggia term
in the square lattice case, which gives rise to spirals in the staggered
magnetization. Depending on the values of the low-energy parameters, either a
homogeneous phase with four or a spiral phase with two filled hole pockets is
energetically favored. Unlike in the square lattice case, at leading order the
effective action has an accidental continuous spatial rotation symmetry.
Consequently, the spiral may point in any direction and is not necessarily
aligned with a lattice direction.
