Exclusive pi0 electroproduction from nucleons can be related to transversity,
the tensor charge, and other quantities related to transversity. This process
isolates C-parity odd and chiral odd combinations of t-channel exchange quantum
numbers. In a hadronic picture the meson production amplitudes for intermediate
energy and Q are determined by C-odd Regge exchanges with final state
interactions. The helicity structure for this C-odd process relates to the
quark helicity flip, or chiral odd generalized parton distributions
(GPDs).Various cross sections and asymmetries will be sensitive to the
transversity.
