We study dependence of jet quenching on matter density, using "tomography" of
the fireball provided by RHIC data on azimuthal anisotropy $v_2$ of high $p_t$
hadron yield at different centralities. Slicing the fireball into shells with
constant (entropy) density, we derive a "layer-wise geometrical limit"
$v_2^{max}$ which is indeed above the data $v_2<v_2^{max}$. Interestingly, the
limit is reached only if quenching is dominated by shells with the entropy
density exactly in the near-$T_c$ region. We show two models that
simultaneously describe the high $p_t$ $v_2$ and $R_{AA}$ data and conclude
that such a description can be achieved only if the jet quenching is few times
stronger in the near-$T_c$ region relative to QGP at $T>T_c$. One possible
reason for that may be recent indications that the near-$T_c$ region is a
magnetic plasma of relatively light color-magnetic monopoles.
