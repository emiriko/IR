Focusing electromagnetic energy to sub-wavelength dimensions has become an
increasingly active field of research for a variety of applications such as
Heat Assisted Magnetic Recording (HAMR), nanolithography, and nanoscale optical
characterization of biological cells and single molecules using near-field
scanning optical microscopy (NSOM) technique. Double-sided surface plasmons in
a metal-insulator-metal (MIM) geometry have been shown to have very small
wavelengths for dielectric of thickness of less than 10 nm. A tapered
dielectric structure sandwiched between metal, can be used to efficiently
couple electromagnetic energy from free space photons to the plasmonic
wavelengths at the nanoscale. In this paper, we present the fabrication and
characterization of a novel MIM plasmonic lens structure.
