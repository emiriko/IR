We give several new moduli interpretations of the fibers of certain Shimura
varieties over several prime numbers. As a corollary we obtain that for every
prescribed odd prime characteristic $p$ every bounded symmetric domain
possesses quotients by arithmetic groups whose models have good reduction at a
prime divisor of $p$.
