After more than 15 years, the operation of the world's unique electron-proton
collider HERA ended in June 2007. The data collected by the H1 experiment
correspond to a total integrated luminosity of about 0.5 fb$^{-1}$. In 2007
dedicated runs were taken at lower proton beam energies to measure the
longitudinal proton structure function $F_L$. In this talk new results, many of
them exploiting data taken after the HERA upgrade in the year 2000, and the
first measurement of $F_L$ are presented.
