The NEMO 3 experiment searches for neutrinoless double beta decay and makes
precision measurements of two-neutrino double beta decay in seven isotopes. The
latest two-neutrino half-life results are presented, together with the limits
on neutrinoless half-lives and the corresponding effective Majorana neutrino
masses. Also given are the limits obtained on neutrinoless double beta decay
mediated by Rp-violating SUSY, right-hand currents and different Majoron
emission modes.
