In the first part of this expository article, the most important
constructions and classification results concerning totally geodesic
submanifolds in Riemannian symmetric spaces are summarized. In the second part,
I describe the results of my classification of the totally geodesic
submanifolds in the Riemannian symmetric spaces of rank 2.
