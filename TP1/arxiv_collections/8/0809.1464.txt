The fermionic Hubbard model plays a fundamental role in the description of
strongly correlated materials. Here we report on the realization of this
Hamiltonian using a repulsively interacting spin mixture of ultracold $^{40}$K
atoms in a 3D optical lattice. We have implemented a new method to directly
measure the compressibility of the quantum gas in the trap using in-situ
imaging and independent control of external confinement and lattice depth.
Together with a comparison to ab-initio Dynamical Mean Field Theory
calculations, we show how the system evolves for increasing confinement from a
compressible dilute metal over a strongly-interacting Fermi liquid into a band
insulating state. For strong interactions, we find evidence for an emergent
incompressible Mott insulating phase.
