In previous work, the author proved that there is a countably infinite family
of N=2 superconformal equivalence classes of DeWitt N=2 superconformal
super-Riemann surfaces with closed, genus-zero body. In this paper, we
determine the automorphism groups for these N=2 superconformal super-Riemann
surfaces, and analyze the Lie structure of these groups. Under the
correspondence between N=2 superconformal and N=1 superanalytic structures, the
results extend to the determination of automorphism groups of N=1 superanalytic
DeWitt super-Riemann surfaces with closed, genus-zero body.
