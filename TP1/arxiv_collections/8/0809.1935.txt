LISA is a joint space mission of the NASA and the ESA for detecting low
frequency gravitational waves (GW) in the band $10^{-5} - 0.1$ Hz. The proposed
mission will use coherent laser beams which will be exchanged between three
identical spacecraft forming a giant (almost) equilateral triangle of side $5
\times 10^6$ kilometres. The plane of the triangle will make an angle of $\sim
60^{\circ}$ with the plane of the ecliptic. The spacecraft constituting LISA
will be freely floating in the ambient gravitational field of the Sun and other
celestial bodies. To achieve the requisite sensitivity, the spacecraft
formation should remain stable, one requirement being, the distances between
spacecraft should remain as constant as possible - that is the flexing of the
arms should be minimal. In this paper we present a solution - the projectile
solution - which constrains the flexing of the arms to below 5.5 metres/sec in
a three year mission period. This solution is obtained in the field of the Sun
and Earth only, which principally affect the motion of the spacecraft,
especially the flexing of LISA's arms.
