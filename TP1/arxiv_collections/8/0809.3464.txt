The possibility of building all particles from spinless constituents is
explored. Composite fermions are formed from bosonic carriers of electric and
magnetic charge of a composite abelian gauge field. Internal attributes are
accounted for by dimensional reduction from a higher-dimensional space-time in
which the abelian gauge field is replaced by a composite higher-rank
antisymmetric tensor field. The problem of building magnetically neutral
fermions is considered.
