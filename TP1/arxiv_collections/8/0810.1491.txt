The Data and Diagnostics Subsystem of the LTP hardware and software are at
present essentially ready for delivery. In this presentation we intend to
describe the scientific and technical aspects of this subsystem, which includes
thermal diagnostics, magnetic diagnostics and a Radiation Monitor, as well as
the prospects for their integration within the rest of the LTP. We also sketch
a few lines of progress recently opened up towards the more demanding
diagnostics requirements which will be needed for LISA.
