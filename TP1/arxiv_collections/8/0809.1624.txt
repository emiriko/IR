We study the potential of future high energy e+e- colliders to probe excited
neutrino signals in different channels coming from the single production
process via gauge interactions. We calculate the production cross section,
decay widths and branching ratios of excited spin-3/2 neutrinos according to
their effective currents and we compare them with that of the spin-1/2 ones.
The signals and corresponding backgrounds are examined in detail to get
accessible limits on the masses and couplings of excited spin-3/2 neutrinos.
