In this paper we present a method of discrete modeling and analysis of
multi-level dynamics of complex large-scale hierarchical dynamic systems
subject to external dynamic control mechanism. In a model each state describes
parallel dynamics and simultaneous trends of changes in system parameters. The
essence of the approach is in analysis of system state dynamics while it is in
the control loop.
