We consider laser alignment of ortho and para spin isomers of water molecules
by using strong and short off-resonance laser pulses. A single pulse is found
to create a distinct transient alignment and antialignment of the isomeric
species. We suggest selective alignment of one isomeric species (leaving the
other species randomly aligned) by a pair of two laser pulses.
