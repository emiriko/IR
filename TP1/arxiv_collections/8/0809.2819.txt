We analyze atomic photoelectron momentum distributions induced by bichromatic
and monochromatic laser fields within the strong field approximation (SFA),
separable Coulomb-Volkov approximation (SCVA), and ab initio treatment. We
focus on the high frequency regime -- the smallest frequency used is larger
than the ionization potential of the atom. We observe a remarkable agreement
between the ab initio and velocity gauge SFA results while the velocity gauge
SCVA fails to agree. Reasons of such a failure are discussed.
