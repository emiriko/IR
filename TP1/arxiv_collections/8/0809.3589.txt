We consider scattering theory for one-dimensional Jacobi operators with
respect to steplike quasi-periodic finite-gap backgrounds and show how the
transmission coefficient can be reconstructed from minimal scattering data.
This generalizes the Poisson-Jensen formula for the classical constant
background case.
