The main focus of this paper is to study multi-valued linear monotone
operators in the contexts of locally convex spaces via the use of their
Fitzpatrick and Penot functions. Notions such as maximal monotonicity,
uniqueness, negative-infimum, and (dual-) representability are studied and
criteria are provided.
