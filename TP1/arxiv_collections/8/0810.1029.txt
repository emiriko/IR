It is shown that the ratio of branching ratios in Higgs boson decay $r =
\Gamma(H \to \tau^+\tau^-)/\Gamma(H\to \mu^+\mu^-)$ in a simplified ($T^{'}
\times Z_2$) model is $(r)_{T^{'} \times Z_2} \simeq 0.001$. This prediction is
on a footing with the successful one in $(s, d)$ mixing, $\tan 2 \Theta_{12} =
{1/3}(\sqrt{2})$. This value for $r$ differs from that of the minimal standard
model by a very large factor (over 250,000) and can provide a smoking gun for
($T^{'} \times Z_2$) flavor symmetry.
