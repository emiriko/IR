We report on the extrapolation of scalar mass parameters in the lepton sector
to reconstruct SO(10) scenarios close to the unification scale. The method is
demonstrated for an example in which SO(10) is broken directly to the Standard
Model, based on the expected precision from coherent LHC and ILC collider
analyses. In addition to the fundamental scalar mass parameters at the
unification scale, the mass of the heaviest right-handed neutrino can be
estimated in the seesaw scenario.
