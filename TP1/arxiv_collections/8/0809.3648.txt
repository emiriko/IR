It is pointed out that if a neutrino mass matrix for right-handed neutrinos
in seesaw mechanism has mu -tau symmetry and total lepton number L_{e}+L_{\mu
}+L_{\tau} remains constant (not zero), exact tribimaximal neutrino mixing in
this sector is produced. The same follows for the effective Majorana light
neutrino mass matrix provided that Yukawa couplings (multiplied by the
corresponding Higgs vacuum expectation values) in Dirac mass matrix satisfy
some constraints which in general implies zero leptongenesis asymmetry. However
this can be avoided when two of the heavy right-hand neutrinos [the third one
is irrelevant when mu -tau symmetry is assumed] are (nearly) degenerate.
