We present Dalitz-plot analyses of $B^+\to K^+\pi^-\pi^+$ and $B^0\to
K^+\pi^-\pi^0$ using the data sample collected at the $\Upsilon(4S)$ by the
BABAR detector. We have found evidence for direct CP-violation in the decay
$B^\pm\to\rho^0 K^\pm$, with a CP-violation parameter ${\cal
A}_{CP}={\Gamma_{B^+}-\Gamma_{B^-}\over \Gamma_{B^+}+\Gamma_{B^-}}=
(+44\pm10\pm4^{+5}_{-13})%$, where $\Gamma_{B^\pm}$ are the decay rates. The
uncertainties are statistical, systematic, and model-dependent, respectively.
We also search for the suppressed decays $B^+\to K^-\pi^+\pi^+$ and
$K^+K^+\pi^-$ and improve upper limits on the decay branching fractions.
