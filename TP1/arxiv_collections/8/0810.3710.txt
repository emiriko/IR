The method of using concepts and insight from quantum information theory in
order to solve problems in reversible classical computing (introduced in Ref.
[1]) have been generalized to irreversible classical computing. The method have
been successfully tested on two computational tasks. Several basic logic gates
have been analyzed and the nonlocal content of the associate quantum
transformations have been calculated. The results provide us with new
interesting insight into the notion of complexity of logic operations.
