In this work we study the noise induced effects on the dynamics of short
polymers crossing a potential barrier, in the presence of a metastable state.
An improved version of the Rouse model for a flexible polymer has been adopted
to mimic the molecular dynamics by taking into account both the interactions
between adjacent monomers and introducing a Lennard-Jones potential between all
beads. A bending recoil torque has also been included in our model. The polymer
dynamics is simulated in a two-dimensional domain by numerically solving the
Langevin equations of motion with a Gaussian uncorrelated noise. We find a
nonmonotonic behaviour of the mean first passage time and the most probable
translocation time, of the polymer centre of inertia, as a function of the
polymer length at low noise intensity. We show how thermal fluctuations
influence the motion of short polymers, by inducing two different regimes of
translocation in the molecule transport dynamics. In this context, the role
played by the length of the molecule in the translocation time is investigated.
