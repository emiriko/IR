We study the fully entangled fraction of quantum states. An upper bound is
obtained for arbitrary dimensional bipartite systems. This bound is shown to be
exact for the case of two-qubit systems. An inequality related the fully
entangled fraction of two qubits in a three-qubit mixed state has been also
presented.
