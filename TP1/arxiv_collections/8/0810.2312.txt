Quasiperiodic structures possess long range positional order, but are freed
of constraints imposed by translational invariance. For spins interacting via
Heisenberg couplings, one may expect therefore to find novel magnetic
configurations in such structures. We have studied magnetic properties for
simple two dimensional models, as a first step towards understanding
experimentally studied magnetic quasicrystals such as the Zn-Mg-R(rare earth)
compounds. We analyse properties of the antiferromagnetic ground state and
magnon excitation modes for bipartite tilings such as the octagonal and Penrose
tilings. In the absence of frustration, one has an inhomogeneous Neel-ordered
ground state, with local quantum fluctuations of the local staggered magnetic
order parameter. We study the spin wave spectrum and wavefunctions of such
antiferromagnets within the linear spin wave approximation. Some results for
spin-spin correlations in these systems are discussed.
