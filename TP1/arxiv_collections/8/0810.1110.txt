We present an experimental study of the power spectrum of current-driven
magnetization oscillations in MgO tunnel junctions under low bias. We find the
existence of narrow spectral lines, down to 8 MHz in width at a frequency of
10.7 GHz, for small applied fields with clear evidence of an auto-oscillation
threshold. Micromagnetics simulations indicate that the excited mode
corresponds to an edge mode of the synthetic antiferromagnet.
