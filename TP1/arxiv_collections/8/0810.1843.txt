We compute the static-light meson spectrum with N_f = 2 flavours of sea
quarks using Wilson twisted mass lattice QCD. We consider five different values
for the light quark mass corresponding to 300 MeV < m_PS < 600 MeV and we
present results for angular momentum j = 1/2, j = 3/2 and j = 5/2 and for
parity P = + and P = -. We extrapolate our results to physical quark masses and
make predictions regarding the spectrum of B and B_s mesons.
