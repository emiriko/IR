Studies about the constructive aspects of noise and fluctuations in different
non-linear systems have shown that the addition of external noise to systems
with an intrinsic noise may result in a less noisy response. Recently, the
possibility to reduce the diffusion noise in semiconductor bulk materials by
adding a random fluctuating contribution to the driving static electric field
has been tested. The present work extends the previous theories by considering
the noise-induced effects on the electron transport dynamics in low-doped
n-type GaAs samples driven by a high-frequency periodic electric field
(cyclostationary conditions). By means of Monte Carlo simulations, we calculate
the changes in the spectral density of the electron velocity fluctuations
caused by the addition of an external correlated noise source. The results
reported in this paper confirm that, under specific conditions, the presence of
a fluctuating component added to an oscillating electric field can reduce the
total noise power. Furthermore, we find a nonlinear behaviour of the spectral
density with the noise intensity. Our study reveals that, critically depending
on the external noise correlation time, the dynamical response of electrons
driven by a periodic electric field receives a benefit by the constructive
interplay between the fluctuating field and the intrinsic noise of the system.
