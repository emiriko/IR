This paper deals with a new planar parallel mechanism with variable actuation
and its kinetostatic performance. A drawback of parallel mechanisms is the non
homogeneity of kinetostatic performance within their workspace. The common
approach to solve this problem is the introduction of actuation redundancy,
that involves force control algorithms. Another approach, highlighted in this
paper, is to select the actuated joint in each limb with regard to the pose of
the end-effector. First, the architecture of the mechanism and two kinetostatic
performance indices are described. Then, the actuating modes of the mechanism
are compared.
