Modal abundances of Ca,Al-rich inclusions (CAIs) are poorly known and
reported data scatter across large ranges. We combine reported CAI modal
abundances and our own set, and present a complete list of CAI modal abundances
in carbonaceous chondrites. This includes (in area%): CV: 2.98, CM: 1.21, Acfer
094: 1.12, CO: 0.99, CK/CV (Ningqiang & DaG 055): 0.77, CK: 0.2, CR: 0.12 and
CB: 0.1. CAIs are Poisson distributed and if only small areas (<1000 mm2) are
studied, the data are probably not representative of the true CAI modal
abundances, explaining their reported large scatter in a single chondrite
group. Carbonaceous chondrites have excess bulk Al concentrations when compared
to the CI-chondritic value. We find a correlation between this excess and CAI
modal abundances and conclude that the excess Al was delivered by CAIs. The
excess Al is only a minor fraction (usually ~10 rel%, but 25 rel% in case of
CVs) of the bulk chondrite Al and cannot have contributed much 26Al to heat the
chondrite parent body. Ordinary, enstatite, R- and K-chondrites have an Al
deficit relative to CI chondrites and only very low CAI modal abundances, if
any are present at all. Carbonaceous chondrites also had an initial Al deficit
if the contribution of Al delivered by CAIs is subtracted. Therefore all
chondrites probably lost a refractory rich high-T component. Only minor amounts
of CAIs are present in the matrix or have been present in the chondrule
precursor aggregates. Most CAI size distributions contain more than one size
population, indicating that CAIs from within a single meteorite group had
different origins.
