In a series of essays, beginning with this article, we are going to develop a
new formulation of micro-phenomena based on the principles of reality and
causality. The new theory provides with us a new depiction of micro-phenomena
assuming an unified concept of information, matter and energy. So, we suppose
that in a definite micro-physical context (including other interacting
particles), each particle is enfolded by a probability field whose existence is
contingent upon the existence of the particle, but it can locally affect the
physical status of the particle in a context-dependent manner. The dynamics of
the whole particle-field system obeys deterministic equations in a manner that
when the particle is subjected to a conservative force, the field also
experiences a conservative complex force which its form is determined by the
dynamics of particle. So, the field is endowed with a given amount of energy,
but its value is contingent upon the physical conditions the particle is
subjected to. Based on the energy balance of the particle and its associated
field, we argue why the field has a probabilistic objective nature. In such a
way, the basic elements of this new formulation, its application for some
stationary states and its nonlinear generalization for conservative systems are
discussed here.
