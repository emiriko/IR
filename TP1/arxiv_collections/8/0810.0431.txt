We present results from a lattice study of SU(2) color, N=1 supersymmetric
Yang-Mills theory using domain wall fermions. Supersymmetry in this particular
lattice formulation is expected to emerge in the continuum and chiral limits
without any fine-tuning of operators. Preliminary results for the static quark
potential, residual mass, chiral condensate and spectrum--a potential indicator
of supersymmetry restoration--are presented and discussed.
