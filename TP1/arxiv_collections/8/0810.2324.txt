We prove the annealed Central Limit Theorem for random walks in bistochastic
random environments on $Z^d$ with zero local drift. The proof is based on a
"dynamicist's interpretation" of the system, and requires a much weaker
condition than the customary uniform ellipticity. Moreover, recurrence is
derived for $d \le 2$.
