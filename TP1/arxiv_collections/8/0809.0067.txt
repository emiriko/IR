In this work we describe a protocol by which two of three parties generate
two bipartite entangled state among themselves without involving third party,
from a non maximal W state or W - type state
$|X>=\alpha|001>_{123}+\beta|010>_{123}+\gamma|100>_{123}, \alpha^{2} +
\beta^{2} + \gamma^{2} = 1$ shared by three distant partners. Also we have
considered the case $\beta=\gamma$, to obtain a range for $\alpha^2$, for which
the local output states are separable and non local output states are
inseparable. We also find out the dependence of the mixed ness of inseparable
states with their amount of inseparability, for that range of $\alpha^2$.
