We have extracted 565 neutron spectroscopic factors of sd and fp shell nuclei
by systematically analyzing more than 2000 measured (d,p) angular
distributions. We are able to compare 125 of the extracted spectroscopic
factors to values predicted by large-basis shell-model calculations and
evaluate the accuracies of spectroscopic factors predicted by different
shell-model interactions in these regions. We find that the spectroscopic
factors predicted for most excited states of sd-shell nuclei using the latest
USDB or USDA interactions agree with the experimental values. For fp shell
nuclei, the inability of the current models to account for the core excitation
and fragmentation of the states leads to considerable discrepancies. In
particular, the agreement between data and shell-model predictions for Ni
isotopes is not better than a factor of two using either the GXPF1A or the XT
interaction.
