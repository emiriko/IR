Genetic robustness, the preservation of an optimal phenotype in the face of
mutations, is critical to the understanding of evolution as phenotypically
expressed genetic variation is the fuel of natural selection. The origin of
genetic robustness, whether it evolves directly by natural selection or it is a
correlated byproduct of other phenotypic traits, is, however, unresolved.
Examining microRNA (miRNA) genes of several eukaryotic species, Borenstein and
Ruppin (Borenstein et al. 2006, PNAS 103: 6593), showed that the structure of
miRNA precursor stem-loops exhibits significantly increased mutational
robustness in comparison with a sample of random RNA sequences with the same
stem-loop structure. The observed robustness was found to be uncorrelated with
traditional measures of environmental robustness -- implying that miRNA
sequences show evidence of the direct evolution of genetic robustness. These
findings are surprising as theoretical results indicate that the direct
evolution of robustness requires high mutation rates and/or large effective
population sizes only found among RNA viruses, not multicellular eukaryotes.
Introducing a novel measure of environmental robustness based on the
equilibrium thermodynamic ensemble of secondary structures of the miRNA
precursor sequences we demonstrate that the biophysics of RNA folding, induces
a high level of correlation between genetic (mutational) and environmental
(thermodynamic) robustness, as expected from the theory of plastogenetic
congruence introduced by Ancel and Fontana (Ancel et al. 2000, J. Exp. Zool.
288: 242). In light of theoretical considerations we believe that this
correlation strongly suggests that genetic robustness observed in miRNA
sequences is the byproduct of selection for environmental robustness.
