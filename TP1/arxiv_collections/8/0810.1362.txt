We examine the predictions for both the spin dependent and spin independent
direct detection rates in a variety of new particle physics models with dark
matter candidates. We show that a determination of both spin independent and
spin dependent amplitudes on protons and neutrons can in principle discriminate
different candidates of dark matter up to a few ambiguities. We emphasize the
importance of making measurements with different spin dependent sensitive
detector materials and the need for significant improvement of the detector
sensitivities. Scenarii where exchange of new coloured particles contributes
significantly to the elastic scattering cross sections are often the most
difficult to identify, the LHC should give an indication whether such scenarii
are relevant for direct detection.
