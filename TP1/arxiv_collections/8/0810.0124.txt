Photonic crystals with a two-dimensional triangular lattice have a conical
singularity in the spectrum. Close to this so-called Dirac point, Maxwell's
equations reduce to the Dirac equation for an ultrarelativistic spin-1/2
particle. Here we show that the half-integer spin and the associated Berry
phase remain observable in the presence of disorder in the crystal. While
constructive interference of a scalar (spin-zero) wave produces a coherent
backscattering peak, consisting of a doubling of the disorder-averaged
reflected photon flux, the destructive interference caused by the Berry phase
suppresses the reflected intensity at an angle which is related to the angle of
incidence by time-reversal symmetry. We demonstrate this extinction of coherent
backscattering by a numerical solution of Maxwell's equations and compare with
analytical predictions from the Dirac equation.
