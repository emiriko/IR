The Standard Model of particle physics has a number of asymmetries suggestive
of a more fundamental theory, where the symmetries are restored. If the
symmetry breaking scale is the electroweak scale, new Higgs bosons beyond that
of the Standard Model could be observed at the Tevatron. Recent Tevatron
searches have set the most stringent limits on new Higgs bosons in a variety of
models.
