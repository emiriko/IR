Graphene two-dimensional nature combined with today lithography allows to
achieve nanoelectronics devices smaller than the Dirac electrons wavelength.
Here we show that in these graphene subwavelength nanodevices the electronic
quantum transport properties present deep analogies with classical phenomena of
subwavelength optics. By introducing the concept of electronic diffraction
barrier to represent the effect of constrictions, we can easily describe the
rich transport physics in a wealth of nanodevices: from Bethe and Kirchhoff
diffraction in graphene slits, to Fabry-Perot interference oscillations in
nanoribbons. The same concept applies to graphene quantum dots and gives new
insigth into recent experiments on these systems.
