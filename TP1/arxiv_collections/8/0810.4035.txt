A novel explanation of the relativistic self-induced transparency effect
during superintense laser interaction with an overdense plasma is proposed. We
studied it analytically and verified with direct modeling by both PIC and
kinetic equation simulations. Based on this treatment, a method of ultrashort
high-energy electron bunch generation with durations on a few femtosecond time
scale is also proposed and studied via numerical simulation
