The intrinsic double helix conformation of the DNA strands is known to be the
key ingredient of control of the electric current through the DNA by the
perpendicular (gate) electric field. We show theoretically that Bloch
oscillations in the DNA are also strongly affected by such lateral field; the
oscillation frequency splits into a manifold of several generally
non-commensurate frequencies leading to a complicated pattern of the charge
motion. The frequency of the oscillations falls in the THz domain, providing
for a possibility to design a nano-scale source of THz radiation.
