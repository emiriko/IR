Electroweak scale active right-handed neutrinos such as those proposed in a
recent model necessitate the enlargement of the SM Higgs sector to include
Higgs triplets with doubly charged scalars. The search for and constraints on
such Higgs sector has implications not only on the nature of the electroweak
symmetry breaking but also on the possibility of testing the seesaw mechanism
at colliders such as the LHC and the ILC.
