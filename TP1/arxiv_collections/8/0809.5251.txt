Topics related to the construction, phenomenological determination, and
effects of the effective three-body forces within the traditional nuclear shell
model approach are discussed. The manifestations of the three-body forces in
realistic nuclei in the 0f7/2 and 1s0d shell model valence spaces are explored.
