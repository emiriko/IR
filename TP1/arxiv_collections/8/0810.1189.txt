We consider self-similar statistical ensembles with the phase space whose
volume is invariant under the deformation that squeezes (expands) the
coordinate and expands (squeezes) the momentum. Related probability
distribution function is shown to possess a discrete symmetry with respect to
manifold action of the Jackson derivative to be a homogeneous function with a
self-similarity degree $q$ fixed by the condition of invariance under
$(n+1)$-fold action of the dilatation operator related. In slightly deformed
phase space, we find the homogeneous function is defined with the linear
dependence at $n=0$, whereas the self-similarity degree equals the gold mean at
$n=1$, and $q\to n$ in the limit $n\to\infty$. Dilatation of the homogeneous
function is shown to decrease the self-similarity degree $q$ at $n>0$.
