A scenario for stabilization of axionic moduli fields in the context of type
IIB Calabi-Yau flux compactifications is discussed in detail. We consider the
case of a Calabi-Yau orientifold with h^{1,1}_- \neq 0 which allows for the
presence of B_2 and C_2-moduli. In an attempt to generalize the KKLT and the
Large Volume Scenario, we show that these axions can also be stabilized - some
already at tree level, and others when we include perturbative
\alpha'-corrections to the Kaehler potential K and nonperturbative D3-instanton
contributions to the superpotential W. At last, we comment on the possible
influence of worldsheet instantons on the process of moduli stabilization.
