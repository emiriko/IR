One of the most interesting properties of solid materials is the ability to
form different collective quantum states, such as superconductivity and
magnetic order. This paper presents a model of perfectly elastic collisions
(p.e.c.) as the universal origin of these collective quantum states. The superb
agreement between calculated values and experimental data for critical
temperatures, moreover, the explanation of the isotope effect in
superconductivity and magnetic order confirms that this model successfully
describes these two quantum states.
