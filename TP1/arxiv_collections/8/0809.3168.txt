These notes survey some aspects of discrete-time chaotic calculus and its
applications, based on the chaos representation property for i.i.d. sequences
of random variables. The topics covered include the Clark formula and
predictable representation, anticipating calculus, covariance identities and
functional inequalities (such as deviation and logarithmic Sobolev
inequalities), and an application to option hedging in discrete time.
