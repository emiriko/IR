We compute the finite renormalisation of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM)
matrix induced by gluino-squark diagrams in the MSSM with non-minimal sources
of flavour violation. Subsequently we derive bounds on the flavour-off-diagonal
elements of the squark mass matrices by requiring that the radiative
corrections to the CKM elements do not exceed the experimental values. Our
constraints on the associated dimensionless quantities delta^{d LR}_{ij}, j>i,
are stronger than the bounds from flavour-changing neutral current (FCNC)
processes if gluino and squarks are heavier than 500 GeV. Our bound on
|delta^{u LR}_{12}| is stronger than the FCNC bound from D-D-bar mixing for
superpartner masses above 900 GeV. We further find a useful bound on
|delta_{13}^{u LR}|, for which no FCNC constraint is known. Our results imply
that it is still possible to generate all observed flavour violation from the
soft supersymmetry-breaking terms without conflicting with present-day data on
FCNC processes. We suggest that a flavour symmetry renders the Yukawa sector
flavour-diagonal and the trilinear supersymmetry-breaking terms are the spurion
fields breaking this flavour symmetry. We further derive the dominant
supersymmetric radiative corrections to the couplings of charged Higgs bosons
and charginos to quarks and squarks.
