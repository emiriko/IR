We review recent work on understanding the next to leading order corrections
to the classical fields that dominate the initial stages of a heavy ion
collision. We have recently shown that the leading ln(1/x) divergences of these
corrections to gluon multiplicities can be factorized into the JIMWLK evolution
of the color charge density distributions.
