By using the gluing formulae of the Seiberg-Witten invariant, we show the
nonexistence of Einstein metric on manifolds obtained from a 4-manifold with
nontrivial Seiberg-Witten invariant by performing sufficiently many connected
sums or appropriate surgeries along circles or homologically trivial 2-spheres
with closed oriented 4-manifolds with negative definite intersection form.
