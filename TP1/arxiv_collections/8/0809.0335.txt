Based on the synergetic equations and its application, we propose the
equations on the rule of law. From these equations we may prove mathematically
that a society of the rule of law cannot lack any aspect for three types of the
legislation, the administration and the judicature. Otherwise, we propose an
equation of corruption, and discuss quantitatively some threshold values for a
system into corruption. Moreover, from synergetics we obtain the Lorenz model,
which may be a visualized two-party mechanism as a type of stable structure in
democracy. A developed direction of society should be the combination from
macroscopic to microscopic order, from an actual capable handling to an ideal
pursuance.
