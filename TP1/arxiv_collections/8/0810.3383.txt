We compare the properties of subwavelength imaging in the visible wavelength
range for metal-dielectric multilayers operating in the canalization and the
resonant tunnelling regimes. The analysis is based on the transfer matrix
method and time domain simulations. We show that Point Spread Functions for the
first two resonances in the canalization regime are approximately Gaussian in
shape. Material losses suppress transmission for higher resonances, regularise
the PSF but do not compromise the resolution. In the resonant tunnelling
regime, the MTF may dramatically vary in their phase dependence. Resulting PSF
may have a sub-wavelength thickness as well as may be broad with multiple
maxima and a rapid phase modulation. We show that the width of PSF may be
reduced by further propagation in free space, and we provide arguments to
explain this surprising observation.
