We consider trimaximal lepton mixing, defined by |U_{alpha 2}|^2 = 1/3 for
all alpha = e, mu, tau. This corresponds to a two-parameter lepton mixing
matrix U. We present a model for the lepton sector in which trimaximal mixing
is enforced by softly broken discrete symmetries; one version of the model is
based on the group Delta(27). A salient feature of our model is that no vacuum
alignment is required.
