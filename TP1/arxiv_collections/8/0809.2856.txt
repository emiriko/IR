By numerically investigating the conservation law of the supercurrent, we
confirm the restoration of supersymmetry in Sugino's lattice formulation of the
two-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ supersymmetric SU(2) Yang-Mills theory with
a scalar mass term. Subtlety in the case without the scalar mass term, that
appears to ruin perturbative power counting, is also pointed out.
