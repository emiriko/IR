The scalar susceptibility (chi_s) of QCD, which represents the response of
the chiral condensate to a small perturbation of explicit chiral-symmetry
breaking, is investigated within the nonlocal chiral quark model (NLchiQM)
based on the instanton vacuum configuration for N_f = 2. We also take into
account 1/N_c meson-loop (ML) corrections including scalar and pseudoscalar
mesons. It turns out that the chiral condensate is modified to a large extend
by the ML corrections in the vicinity of m = 0, whereas its effect becomes weak
beyond m ~ 100 MeV. As numerical results, we find that chi_s = -0.34 GeV^2 with
the ML corrections and 0.18 GeV^2 without it, respectively. From these
observations, we conclude that the ML corrections play an important role in the
presence of finite current-quark mass.
