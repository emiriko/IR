The diffusion and low vibrational motions of adsorbates on surfaces can be
well described by a purely stochastic model, the so-called interacting single
adsorbate model, for low-moderate coverages (\theta \lesssim 0.12). Within this
model, the effects of thermal surface phonons and adsorbate-adsorbate
collisions are accounted for by two uncorrelated noise functions which arise in
a natural way from a two-bath model based on a generalization of the one-bath
Caldeira-Leggett Hamiltonian. As an illustration, the model is applied to the
diffusion of Na atoms on a Cu(001) surface with different coverages.
