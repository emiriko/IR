We investigate spherically symmetric, static matter configurations with
polytropic equation of state for a class of f(R) models in Palatini formalism
and show that the surface singularities recently reported in the literature are
not physical in the case of Planck scale modified lagrangians. In such cases,
they are just an artifact of the idealized equation of state used. In fact, we
show that for the models f(R)=R\pm\lambda R^2, with \lambda on the order of the
Planck length squared, the presence of a single electron in the Universe would
be enough to cure all stellar singularities of this type. From our analysis it
also follows that the stellar structure derived from these lagrangians is
virtually undistinguishable from that corresponding to General Relativity. For
ultraviolet corrected models far from the Planck scale, however, the surface
singularities may indeed arise in the region of validity of the polytropic
equation of state. This fact can be used to place constraints on the parameters
of particular models.
