We consider flux vacua attractor equations in type IIA string theory
compactified on generalized geometries with orientifold projections. The
four-dimensional N=1 superpotential in this compactification can be written as
the sum of the Ramond-Ramond superpotential and a term described by
(non)geometric flux charges. We exhibit a simple model in which supersymmetric
AdS and Minkowski solutions are classified by means of discriminants of the two
superpotentials. We further study various configurations without Ramond-Ramond
flux charges. In this case we find supersymmetric AdS vacua both in the case of
compactifications on generalized geometries with SU(3) x SU(3) structures and
on manifolds with an SU(3)-structure without nongeometric flux charges. In the
latter case, we have to introduce correction terms into the prepotential in
order to realize consistent vacua.
