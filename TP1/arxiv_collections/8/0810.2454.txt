Kinematical correlations between outgoing partons (elementary particles) are
discussed in the framework of $k_t$-factorization. Different unintegrated gluon
distributions are used. I discuss correlations between charm-anticharm, jets,
photon and jet, and between leptons from semileptonic decays of heavy quarks as
well as leptons produced in the Drell-Yan mechanism. Both correlations in
azimuth as well as in the length of transverse momenta are shown. General
conclusions are drawn.
