At the end of 2008, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) will come into operation
and the two experiments ATLAS and CMS will start taking data from proton-proton
collisions at a center-of-mass energy of \sqrt{s}=14 TeV. In preparation for
the data taking period, the discovery potential for Higgs bosons beyond the
Standard Model has been updated by both experiments and is reviewed here. In
addition, the prospects for measuring the properties of a Higgs boson like its
mass and width, its CP eigenvalues and its couplings to fermions and gauge
bosons are discussed.
