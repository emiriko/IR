The calculation of correlation functions for $\beta=1$ random matrix
ensembles, which can be carried out using Pfaffians, has the peculiar feature
of requiring a separate calculation depending on the parity of the matrix size
N. This same complication is present in the calculation of the correlations for
the Ginibre Orthogonal Ensemble of real Gaussian matrices. In fact the methods
used to compute the $\beta=1$, N odd, correlations break down in the case of N
odd real Ginibre matrices, necessitating a new approach to both problems. The
new approach taken in this work is to deduce the $\beta=1$, N odd correlations
as limiting cases of their N even counterparts, when one of the particles is
removed towards infinity. This method is shown to yield the correlations for N
odd real Gaussian matrices.
