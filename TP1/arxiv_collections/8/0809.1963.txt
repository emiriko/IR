XML data warehouses form an interesting basis for decision-support
applications that exploit complex data. However, native XML database management
systems currently bear limited performances and it is necessary to design
strategies to optimize them. In this paper, we propose an automatic strategy
for the selection of XML materialized views that exploits a data mining
technique, more precisely the clustering of the query workload. To validate our
strategy, we implemented an XML warehouse modeled along the XCube
specifications. We executed a workload of XQuery decision-support queries on
this warehouse, with and without using our strategy. Our experimental results
demonstrate its efficiency, even when queries are complex.
