A systematic study of the microscopic and thermodynamical properties of pure
neutron matter at finite temperature within the Self-Consistent Green's
Function approach is performed. The model dependence of these results is
analyzed by both comparing the results obtained with two different microscopic
interactions, the CD-BONN and the Argonne V18 potentials, and by analyzing the
results obtained with other approaches, such as the Brueckner--Hartree--Fock
approximation, the variational approach and the virial expansion.
