This is a technical report on the proceedings of the workshop held July 21 to
July 25, 2008 at the American Institute of Mathematics, Palo Alto, California,
organized by Joseph Landsberg, Lek-Heng Lim, Jason Morton, and Jerzy Weyman. We
include a list of open problems coming from applications in 4 different areas:
signal processing, the Mulmuley-Sohoni approach to P vs. NP, matchgates and
holographic algorithms, and entanglement and quantum information theory. We
emphasize the interactions between geometry and representation theory and these
applied areas.
