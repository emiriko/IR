We numerically demonstrate that a supersolid phase exists in a frustrated
hard-core boson system on a triangular lattice over a wide range of interaction
strength. In the infinite repulsion (Ising) limit, we establish a mapping to
the same problem with unfrustrated hopping, which connects the supersolid to
the known results in that case. The weak superfluidity can be destroyed or
strongly enhanced by a next nearest neighbor hopping term, which provides
valuable information for experimental realization of a supersolid phase on
optical lattice.
