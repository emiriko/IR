We construct integrable pseudopotentials with an arbitrary number of fields
in terms of elliptic generalization of hypergeometric functions in several
variables. These pseudopotentials yield some integrable (2+1)-dimensional
hydrodynamic type systems. An interesting class of integrable (1+1)-dimensional
hydrodynamic type systems is also generated by our pseudopotentials.
