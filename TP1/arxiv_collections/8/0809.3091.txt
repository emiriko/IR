Recent mobile equipment (as well as the norm IEEE 802.21) now offers the
possibility for users to switch from one technology to another (vertical
handover). This allows flexibility in resource assignments and, consequently,
increases the potential throughput allocated to each user. In this paper, we
design a fully distributed algorithm based on trial and error mechanisms that
exploits the benefits of vertical handover by finding fair and efficient
assignment schemes. On the one hand, mobiles gradually update the fraction of
data packets they send to each network based on the rewards they receive from
the stations. On the other hand, network stations send rewards to each mobile
that represent the impact each mobile has on the cell throughput. This reward
function is closely related to the concept of marginal cost in the pricing
literature. Both the station and the mobile algorithms are simple enough to be
implemented in current standard equipment. Based on tools from evolutionary
games, potential games and replicator dynamics, we analytically show the
convergence of the algorithm to solutions that are efficient and fair in terms
of throughput. Moreover, we show that after convergence, each user is connected
to a single network cell which avoids costly repeated vertical handovers.
Several simple heuristics based on this algorithm are proposed to achieve fast
convergence. Indeed, for implementation purposes, the number of iterations
should remain in the order of a few tens. We also compare, for different loads,
the quality of their solutions.
