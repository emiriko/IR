We present searches for dijet and ttbar mass resonances using between 0.68
and 2.1 fb-1 of Tevatron Run II data collected by the CDF and D0 detectors. No
evidence of new physics is found, and 95% C.L. limits are set on a number of
new physics hypotheses, such as excited quark, Randal-Sundrum graviton, Z', W',
color-octet technirho, axigluon and flavor-universal coloron, E6 diquark, quark
compositeness, ADD and TeV-1-sized LED, massive gluon.
