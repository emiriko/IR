Quantum classification is defined as the task of predicting the associated
class of an unknown quantum state drawn from an ensemble of pure states given a
finite number of copies of this state. By recasting the state discrimination
problem within the framework of Machine Learning (ML), we can use the notion of
learning reduction coming from classical ML to solve different variants of the
classification task, such as the weighted binary and the multiclass versions.
