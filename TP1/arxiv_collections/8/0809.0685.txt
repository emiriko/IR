The baryon-number density formed in relativistic nuclear collisions, versus
the chemical potential of the freeze-out states, is systematically studied on
the basis of existing measurements. A remarkable power-law behaviour of the
baryon-number susceptibility is found at the SPS, consistent with the existence
of a QCD critical point at $\mu_{B,c}\simeq 214$ MeV, $T_c\simeq 155$ MeV. The
equation of state in different asymptotic regimes of the critical region is
also examined and confronted with freeze-out states in these experiments.
