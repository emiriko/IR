Aim: To assess the frequency of secondary transmissions of primary pneumonic
plague relative to the onset of fever. Methods: A simple backcalculation method
was employed to estimate the frequency of secondary transmissions relative to
disease-age. A likelihood-based procedure was taken using observed
distributions of the serial interval (n = 177) and incubation period (n = 126).
Furthermore, an extended model was developed to account for the survival
probability of cases. Results: The simple backcalculation suggested that 31.0%
(95% confidence intervals (CI): 11.6, 50.4) and 28.0 % (95% CI: 10.2, 45.8) of
the total number of secondary transmissions had occurred at second and third
days of the disease, respectively, and more than four-fifths of the secondary
transmission occurred before the end of third day of disease. The
survivorship-adjusted frequency of secondary transmissions was obtained,
demonstrating that the infectiousness in later stages of illness was not
insignificant and indicates that the obtained frequencies were likely biased on
underlying factors including isolation measures. Conclusion: The simple
exercise suggests a need to implement countermeasures during pre-clinical stage
or immediately after onset. Further information is needed to elucidate the
finer details of the disease-age specific infectiousness.
