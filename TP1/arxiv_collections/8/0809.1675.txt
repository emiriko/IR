The energy spectrum for three species of identical fermionic atoms close to a
Feshbach resonance is computed by use of a nonperturbative flow equation.
Already a simple truncation shows that for large scattering length $|a|$ the
lowest energy state is a "trion" (or trimer) bound state of three atoms. At the
location of the resonance, for $|a|\to\infty$, we find an infinite set of
trimer bound states, with exponentially decreasing binding energy. This feature
was pointed out by Efimov. It arises from limit cycle scaling, which also leads
to a periodic dependence of the three body scattering coupling on $\ln |a|$.
Extending our findings by continuity to nonzero density and temperature we find
that a "trion phase" separates a BEC and a BCS phase, with interesting quantum
phase transitions for T=0.
