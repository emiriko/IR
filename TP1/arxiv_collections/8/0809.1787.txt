A theorem of Howe states that every 3-dimensional lattice polytope $P$ whose
only lattice points are its vertices, is a Cayley polytope, i.e. $P$ is the
convex hull of two lattice polygons with distance one. We want to generalize
this result by classifying 3-dimensional lattice polytopes without interior
lattice points. The main result will be, that they are up to finite many
exceptions either Cayley polytopes or there is a projection, which maps the
polytope to the double unimodular 2-simplex. To every such polytope we
associate a smooth projective surface of genus 0.
