Finite time blow-up is shown to occur for radially symmetric solutions to a
critical quasilinear Smoluchowski-Poisson system provided that the mass of the
initial condition exceeds an explicit threshold. In the supercritical case,
blow-up is shown to take place for any positive mass. The proof relies on a
novel identity of virial type.
