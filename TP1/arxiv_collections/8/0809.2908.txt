We have used density functional theory to study the structural stability of
surface alloys. Our systems consist of a single pseudomorphic layer of
$M_xN_{1-x}$ on the Ru(0001) surface, where $M$ = Fe or Co, and $N$ = Pt, Au,
Ag, Cd, or Pb. Several of the combinations studied by us display a preference
for atomically mixed configurations over phase-segregated forms. We have also
performed further {\it ab initio} calculations to obtain the parameters
describing the elastic interactions between atoms in the alloy layer, including
the effective atomic sizes at the surface. We find that while elastic
interactions favor alloying for all the systems considered by us, in some cases
chemical interactions disfavor atomic mixing. We show that a simple criterion
(analogous to the Hume-Rothery first law for bulk alloys) need not necessarily
work for strain-stabilized surface alloys, because of the presence of
additional elastic contributions to the alloy heat of formation, that will tend
to oppose phase segregation.
