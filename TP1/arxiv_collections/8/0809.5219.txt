We review Quasielastic (QE) inclusive and semi--inclusive
neutrino/antineutrino Charged Current (CC) and Neutral Current (NC) induced
nuclear reactions at intermediate energies. We pay special attention to nuclear
corrections besides Pauli blocking: Long and Short range nuclear correlations
(RPA and SRC) and particle and hole Spectral Functions (SF). We also critically
review the use of the Plane and Distorted Wave Impulse approximations (PWIA and
DWIA) to describe inclusive one nucleon knockout reactions off nuclei. In this
context, we present results from a Monte Carlo cascade method to account for
the rescattering of the outgoing nucleon. Finally, we examine the effects of
chiral non-resonant terms in neutrino pion production off the nucleon, and
present some preliminary results on nuclear coherent pion production induced by
neutrinos.
