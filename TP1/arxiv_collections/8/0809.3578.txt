Researches are focused on the elaboration of enzymatic microconductometric
device for heavy metal ions detection in water solutions. The manuscript
includes a general introduction, the first chapter contains bibliographic
review, the second chapter described the fundamentals of conductometric
transducers, the third chapter examining the possibility to create and to
optimize conductometric biosensor based on bovine alkaline phosphatase for
heavy metals ions detection, the fourth chapter devoted to creation and
optimization of conductometric biosensor based on alkaline phosphatase active
microalgae and sol gel technology, the last chapter described application of
the proposed algal biosensor for measurements of heavy metal ions toxicity of
waste water, general conclusions stating the progresses achieved in the field
of environmental monitoring
