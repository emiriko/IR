We examine the stochastic dynamics of entanglement for an uncoupled two-qubit
system, undergoing continuous parity measurement. Starting with a fully mixed
state, the entanglement is zero for a finite amount of time, when it is
suddenly created, which we refer to as entanglement genesis. There can be
further entanglement sudden death/birth events culminating in the formation of
a fully entangled state. We present numerical investigations of this effect
together with statistics of the entanglement genesis time in the weak
measurement limit as well as the quantum Zeno limit. An analytic treatment of
the physics is presented, aided by the derivation of a simple concurrence
equation for Bell basis X-states. The probability of entanglement border
crossing and mean first passage times are calculated for the case of
measurement dynamics alone. We find that states with almost the same
probability of entanglement border crossing can have very different average
crossing times. Our results provide insights on the optimization of
entanglement generation by measurement.
