Quantum transport properties in quantum Hall wires in the presence of
spatially correlated disordered magnetic fields are investigated numerically.
It is found that the correlation drastically changes the transport properties
associated with the edge state, in contrast to the naive expectation that the
correlation simply reduces the effect of disorder. In the presence of
correlation, the separation between the successive conductance plateau
transitions becomes larger than the bulk Landau level separation determined by
the mean value of the disordered magnetic fields. The transition energies
coincide with the Landau levels in an effective magnetic field stronger than
the mean value of the disordered magnetic field. For a long wire, the strength
of this effective magnetic field is of the order of the maximum value of the
magnetic fields in the system. It is shown that the effective field is
determined by a part where the stronger magnetic field region connects both
edges of the wire.
