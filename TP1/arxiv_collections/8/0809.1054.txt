We propose a gravimeter based on a matter-wave resonant cavity loaded with a
Bose-Einstein condensate and closed with a sequence of periodic Raman pulses.
The gravimeter sensitivity increases quickly with the number of cycles
experienced by the condensate inside the cavity. The matter wave is refocused
thanks to a spherical wave-front of the Raman pulses. This provides a
transverse confinement of the condensate which is discussed in terms of a
stability analysis. We develop the analogy of this device with a resonator in
momentum space for matter waves.
