In this Letter, we present a study of the confinement properties of
point-defect resonators in finite-size photonic-bandgap structures composed of
aperiodic arrangements of dielectric rods, with special emphasis on their use
for the design of cavities for particle accelerators. Specifically, for
representative geometries, we study the properties of the fundamental mode (as
a function of the filling fraction, structure size, and losses) via 2-D and 3-D
full-wave numerical simulations, as well as microwave measurements at room
temperature. Results indicate that, for reduced-size structures, aperiodic
geometries exhibit superior confinement properties by comparison with periodic
ones.
