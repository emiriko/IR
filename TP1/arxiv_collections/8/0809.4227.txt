We study the influence of the electromagnetic vacuum force on the behaviour
of a model device based on materials, like germanium tellurides, that undergo
fast and reversible metal-insulator transitions on passing from the crystalline
to the amorphous phase. The calculations are performed at finite temperature
and fully accounting for the behaviour of the material dielectric functions.
The results show that the transition can be exploited to extend the distance
and energy ranges under which the device can be operated without undergoing
stiction phenomena. We discuss the approximation involved in adopting the
Casimir expression in simulating nano- and micro- devices at finite
temperature.
