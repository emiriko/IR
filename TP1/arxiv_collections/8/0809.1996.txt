We discuss the phonon-assisted scattering of electrons by defects, i.e., the
so-called Koshino-Taylor effect, in graphene. The two-dimensional character of
graphene implies that the strength of the Koshino-Taylor effect can be
considerably larger than in ordinary metals. We show that at finite
temperatures the defect-induced resistivity formally diverges in the
thermodynamic limit, having a non-analytic $T\ln T$ component when finite size
effects are taken into account.
