We study the effect of strong radio-frequency (rf) fields on a chromium
Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), in a regime where the rf frequency is much
larger than the Larmor frequency. We use the modification of the Land\'{e}
factor by the rf field to bring all Zeeman states to degeneracy, despite the
presence of a static magnetic field of up to 100 mG. This is demonstrated by
analyzing the trajectories of the atoms under the influence of dressed magnetic
potentials in the strong field regime. We investigate the problem of
adiabaticity of the rf dressing process, and relate it to how close the dressed
states are to degeneracy. Finally, we measure the lifetime of the rf dressed
BECs, and identify a new rf-assisted two-body loss process induced by
dipole-dipole interactions.
