We present a preliminary analysis of the photon beam asymmetry observable
(Sigma) from the photoproduction reaction channel gamma+ n -> p + pi-. This new
data was obtained using the near-4pi CEBAF Large Acceptance Spectrometer (CLAS)
at Jefferson Laboratory, USA, employing a linearly polarised photon beam with
an energy range 1.1 - 2.3 GeV. The measurement will provide new data to address
the poorly established neutron excitation spectrum and will greatly expand the
sparse world data-set both in energy and angle.
