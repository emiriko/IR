We show that the fundamental 4-form on a quaternionic contact manifold of
dimension at least eleven is closed if and only if the torsion endomorphism of
the Biquard connection vanishes. This condition characterizes quaternionic
contact structures which are locally qc homothetic to 3-Sasakian structures.
