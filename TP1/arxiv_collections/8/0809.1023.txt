Within an exactly solvable model I discuss an influence of the medium
dependent finite width of QGP bags on their equation of state. It is shown that
inclusion of such a width allows one to naturally resolve two conceptual
problems of the QGP statistical description. On the basis of the proposed
simple kinetic model for a sequential decay of heavy QGP bags formed in high
energy elementary particle collisions it is argued that by measuring the energy
dependence of life time of these bags it is possible to distinguish the case of
critical point existence from the case of tricritical point.
