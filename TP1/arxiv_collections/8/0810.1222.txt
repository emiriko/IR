A Poincare' covariant Faddeev equation is presented, which enables the
simultaneous prediction of meson and baryon observables using the leading-order
in a truncation of the Dyson-Schwinger equations that can systematically be
improved. The solution describes a nucleon's dressed-quark core. The evolution
of the nucleon mass with current-quark mass is discussed. A nucleon-photon
current, which can produce nucleon form factors with realistic Q^2-evolution,
is described. Axial-vector diquark correlations lead to a neutron Dirac form
factor that is negative, with r_1^{nu}>r_1^{nd}. The proton electric-magnetic
form factor ratio falls with increasing Q^2.
