Results for the complete NLO electroweak corrections to Standard Model Higgs
production via gluon fusion are included in the total cross section for
hadronic collisions. Artificially large threshold effects are avoided working
in the complex-mass scheme. The numerical impact at LHC (Tevatron) energies is
explored for Higgs mass values up to 500 GeV (200 GeV). Assuming a complete
factorization of the electroweak corrections, one finds a +5 % shift with
respect to the NNLO QCD cross section for a Higgs mass of 120 GeV both at the
LHC and the Tevatron. Adopting two different factorization schemes for the
electroweak effects, an estimate of the corresponding total theoretical
uncertainty is computed.
