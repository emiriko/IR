We report recently published results on central exclusive production of
di-jets and di-photons, and exclusive QED production of e+e- pairs. In
addition, we discuss preliminary results on exclusive photoproduction of
charmonium and bottomonium, exclusive QED production of mu+mu- pairs, and
single diffractive W/Z production. All the presented results were extracted
from data collected by the CDF II detector from proton-antiproton collisions at
a c.m.s. energy of 1.96 TeV. The implications of these results for the Large
Hadron Collider are briefly examined.
