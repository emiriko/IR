We show conditions for HFGW detection, employing an entropy concept written
up by Jack Ng, and Steinhard's proceedure for reconstructing tensorial
representations for relic HFGW from the onset of the big bang. The issue of the
reality of gravitons as a measurable physical object which was raised by
Rothman in 2006 is indirectly answered via a proceedure obtained from
Weinberg's 1972 book on gravitation, and all the methodologies so obtained are
referenced with respect to engineering specifications of the Li-Baker HFGW
detector. In addition, the document also refers to entanglement entropy, and
its possible aid in refining measurement predictions. Finally, commentary about
HFGW and relic neutrino physics data sets is included, with regards to
inflationary model candidates
