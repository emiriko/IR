Vibronic polarons (charge carriers coupled to their produced Jahn-Teller
distortions) have been extended for some time in relevance to the buildup of
matter and the breakdown of supersymmetry at the early stages of the universe,
as well as to a number of well established though not fully understood
phenomena of everyday life, such as helical propagation, colossal
magneto-resistance, etc. We review some of the advances and suggest new ones.
Many of them can be verified by Large Hadron Collider (LHC) experiments.
