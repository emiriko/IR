We find the exact solution of graphene s carriers under electromagnetic
radiation. To obtain such solution, we combine Floquet theory with a trial
solution. Then the energy spectrum is obtained without using any approximation.
Using such results, we prove that the energy spectrum presents a gap opening
which depends on de radiation frequency and electric wave intensity, whereas
the current shows a strongly non-linear behaviour.
