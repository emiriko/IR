With already demonstrated in previous work the equations that describe the
space dependence of the electric potential are determined by the solution of
the equation of Poisson-Boltzmann. In this work we consider these solutions for
the membrane of the human neuron, using a model simplified for this structure
considering the distribution of electrolytes in each side of the membrane, as
well as the effect of glycocalyx and the lipidic bilayer. It was assumed that
on both sides of the membrane the charges are homogeneously distributed and
that the potential depends only on coordinate z.
