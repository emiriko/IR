We present results on CP violation from approximately 2.8 fb^{-1} of data
collected by the D0 Experiment at the Fermilab Tevatron. The results presented
are: (i) an improved measurement of the B_s^0 CP-violating phase from a
flavor-tagged analysis of B_s^0 --> J/\psi \phi decays; (ii) a search for
direct CP violation in B^{+-} --> J/\psi K^{+-} (\pi^{+-}) decays from a
measurement of the charge asymmetry A_{CP}(B^{+-} --> J/\psi K^{+-}); and (iii)
a search for indirect CP violation from searches for anomalous charge
asymmetries in semileptonic B_s^0 decays.
