These proceedings review recent results from two and three particle
correlations in heavy ion collisions. In particular we discuss the modified
structure of the away side jet correlations. Under the assumption that the away
side can be decomposed into a punch through component at $\Delta\phi=\pi$ and a
shoulder component with a peak displaced from $\pi$ many similar properties are
observed between the ridge and shoulder. The particle ratios, yields and $p_T$
spectra are in near agreement. We also highlight important future measurements,
including investigating if the decomposition of the away side jet correlations
remains reasonable with high $p_T$ triggers and technical improvements to the
extraction of jet induced correlations.
