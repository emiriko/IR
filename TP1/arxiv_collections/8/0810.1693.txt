The material presented here is supplementary to the article entitled:
"Density-functional investigation of the rhombohedral to simple cubic phase
transition of arsenic"; it deals with the convergence issues involved in
studying a semi-metal to metal structural phase transition such as the A7 to sc
transition of arsenic.
