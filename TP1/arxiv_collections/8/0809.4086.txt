The Baum-Welsh algorithm together with its derivatives and variations has
been the main technique for learning Hidden Markov Models (HMM) from
observational data. We present an HMM learning algorithm based on the
non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) of higher order Markovian statistics
that is structurally different from the Baum-Welsh and its associated
approaches. The described algorithm supports estimation of the number of
recurrent states of an HMM and iterates the non-negative matrix factorization
(NMF) algorithm to improve the learned HMM parameters. Numerical examples are
provided as well.
