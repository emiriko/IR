We report on the usage of a linear optics phase gate for distinguishing all
four Bell states simultaneously in a quantum teleportation and entanglement
swapping protocol. This is demonstrated by full state tomography of the one and
two qubit output states of the two protocols, yielding average state fidelities
of about 0.83 and 0.77, respectively. In addition, the performance of the
teleportation channel is characterised by quantum process tomography. The non
classical properties of the entanglement swapping output states are further
confirmed by the violation of a CHSH-type Bell inequality of 2.14 on average.
