When $k<n$, we study the coherent systems that come from a BGN extension in
which the quotient bundle is strictly semistable. In this case we describe a
stratification of the moduli space of coherent systems. We also describe the
strata as complements of determinantal varieties and we prove that these are
irreducible and smooth. These descriptions allow us to compute the Hodge
polynomials of this moduli space in some cases. In particular, we give explicit
computations for the cases in which $(n,d,k)=(3,d,1)$ and $d$ is even,
obtaining from them the usual Poincar\'e polynomials.
