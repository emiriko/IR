We address criticism of the Letter "Exposed-Key Weakness of $\alpha \eta$" in
the Comment by Nair and Yuen. The Comment claims that the Letter does not show
insecurity of $\alpha \eta$ because our approximation for the eavesdropper's
entropy on the encrypted key is invalid. We present simulations which show
that, on the contrary, our estimate is in close agreement with numerical
calculations of the actual entropy over the applicable domain. We additionally
discuss some ways in which our views on security requirements differ from the
views given in the Comment.
