We consider parsimonious construction of empirical equations, to promote
interest in them as a stepping-stone model to the physical law. To this end, we
provide a variety of historical examples and simulate a parsimonious empirical
calculation of Planck law, and of van der Waals equation. Thereby we provide a)
Empirical forms of Planck law, and b) Collation of verified symmetries and
catastrophes-like properties of empirical P-T surface of real gases. An
empirical equation of state for a real gas should take account of these
properties.
