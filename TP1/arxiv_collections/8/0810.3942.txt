We review the use of laser cooling and trapping for Standard Model tests,
focusing on trapping of radioactive isotopes. Experiments with neutral atoms
trapped with modern laser cooling techniques are testing several basic
predictions of electroweak unification. For nuclear $\beta$ decay, demonstrated
trap techniques include neutrino momentum measurements from beta-recoil
coincidences, along with methods to produce highly polarized samples. These
techniques have set the best general constraints on non-Standard Model scalar
interactions in the first generation of particles. They also have the promise
to test whether parity symmetry is maximally violated, to search for tensor
interactions, and to search for new sources of time reversal violation. There
are also possibilites for exotic particle searches. Measurements of the
strength of the weak neutral current can be assisted by precision atomic
experiments using traps of small numbers of radioactive atoms, and sensitivity
to possible time-reversal violating electric dipole moments can be improved.
