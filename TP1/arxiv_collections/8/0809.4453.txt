We establish a correspondence (or duality) between the characters and the
crystal bases of finite-dimensional representations of quantum groups
associated to Langlands dual semi-simple Lie algebras. This duality may also be
stated purely in terms of semi-simple Lie algebras. To explain this duality, we
introduce an "interpolating quantum group" depending on two parameters which
interpolates between a quantum group and its Langlands dual. We construct
examples of its representations, depending on two parameters, which interpolate
between representations of two Langlands dual quantum groups.
