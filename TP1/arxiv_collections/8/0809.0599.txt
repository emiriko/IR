We develop a quasiclassical theory of the synchrotron-like gluon radiation.
Our calculations show that the parton energy loss due to the synchrotron gluon
emission may be important in the jet quenching phenomenon if the plasma
instabilities generate a sufficiently strong chromomagnetic field. Our gluon
spectrum disagrees with that obtained by Shuryak and Zahed within the
Schwinger's proper time method.
