The Feynman amplitude associated to a graph is a period of a certain motive.
The sum of these motive classes over all connected graphs with no multiple
edges or tadpoles and n vertices is defined in the Grothendieck ring of
varieties. This sum is shown to lie in the subring generated by the affine
line. It follows from work of Belkale and Brosnan that motives of individual
graphs do not lie in this subring.
