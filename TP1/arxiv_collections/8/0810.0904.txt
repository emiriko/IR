We calculate the density of states (DOS) in a diffusive
superconducting/ferromagnetic bilayer with a spin-active interface. We use a
self-consistent numerical treatment to make a systematic study of the effects
of the Spin-Dependence of Interfacial Phase Shifts (SDIPS) on the
self-consistent superconducting gap and the DOS. Strikingly, we find that the
SDIPS can induce a double gap structure (DGS) in the DOS of the ferromagnet,
even when the superconducing layer is much thicker than the superconducting
coherence lenght. We thus obtain DOS curves which have interesting similarities
with those of Phys. Rev. Lett. 100, 237002 (2008).
