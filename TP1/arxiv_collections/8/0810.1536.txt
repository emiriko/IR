I discuss particular solutions of the integrable systems, starting from
well-known dispersionless KdV and Toda hierarchies, which define in most
straightforward way the generating functions for the Gromov-Witten classes in
terms of the rational complex curve. On the ``mirror'' side these generating
functions can be identified with the simplest prepotentials of complex
manifolds, and I present few more exactly calculable examples of them. For the
higher genus curves, corresponding in this context to the non Abelian gauge
theories via the topological gauge/string duality, similar solutions are
constructed using extended basis of Abelian differentials, generally with extra
singularities at the branching points of the curve.
