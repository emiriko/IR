The paper studies a class of three user Gaussian interference channels. A new
layered lattice coding scheme is introduced as a transmission strategy. The use
of lattice codes allows for an "alignment" of the interference observed at each
receiver. The layered lattice coding is shown to achieve more than one degree
of freedom for a class of interference channels and also achieves rates which
are better than the rates obtained using the Han-Kobayashi coding scheme.
