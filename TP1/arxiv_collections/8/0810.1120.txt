We examine a large class of inhomogeneous spherically symmetric spacetimes
that generalize the Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi dust solutions to nonzero pressure
("LTB spacetimes"). Local covariant LTB objects can be expressed as
perturbations of covariant quasi-local (QL) scalars that satisfy evolution
equations of equivalent Friedman-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) scalars.
Thus, the dynamics of these spacetimes can be rigorously described as
non-linear, gauge invariant and covariant perturbations on a formal FLRW
background given by the QL scalars. Since LTB spacetimes are compatible with a
wide variety of "equations of state" and theoretical assumptions, they provide
an ideal framework for numerical models of cosmological sources under idealized
but fully non-linear conditions. As an illustrative example, we briefly examine
the formation of a black hole in an expanding Chaplygin gas universe.
