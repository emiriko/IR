We present results from calculations of different quark number and hadronic
susceptibilities on 2+1-flavor dynamical domain wall ensembles. We find that
the iso-spin and electric charge susceptibilities are especially well suited to
determine the transition temperature, as these quantities show only small
statistical errors. Moreover, the transition values of the coupling obtained
from iso-spin and electrical charge susceptibilities are in good agreement with
the one obtained from the chiral condensate.
