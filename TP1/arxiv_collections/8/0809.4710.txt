The paper discusses the transformation of decorated Ising models into an
effective \textit{undecorated} spin models, using the most general Hamiltonian
for interacting Ising models including a long range and high order
interactions. The inverse of a Vandermonde matrix with equidistant nodes
$[-s,s]$ is used to obtain an analytical expression of the transformation. This
kind of transformation is very useful to obtain the partition function of
decorated systems. The method presented by Fisher is also extended, in order to
obtain the correlation functions of the decorated Ising models transforming
into an effective undecorated Ising models. We apply this transformation to a
particular mixed spin-(1/2,1) and (1/2,2) square lattice with only nearest site
interaction. This model could be transformed into an effective uniform spin-$S$
square lattice with nearest and next-nearest interaction, furthermore the
effective Hamiltonian also include combinations of three-body and four-body
interactions, particularly we considered spin 1 and 2.
