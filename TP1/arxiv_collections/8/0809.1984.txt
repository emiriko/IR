Quantum fluctuations of a cavity field coupled into the motion of ultracold
bosons can be strongly amplified by a mechanism analogous to the Petermann
excess noise factor in lasers with unstable cavities. For a Bose-Einstein
condensate in a stable optical resonator, the excess noise effect amounts to a
significant depletion on long timescales.
