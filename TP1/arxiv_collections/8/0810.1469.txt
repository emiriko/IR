The effectiveness of various dilution schemes in the evaluation of baryonic
two-point functions is compared. The error of a representative set of
observables as a function of the number of Dirac matrix inversions is used as a
basis for comparison. To achieve an equivalent reduction in error, we
demonstrate that an increase in the number of dilution projectors on a single
noise source usually requires fewer inversions than the use of multiple noise
sources. This exploratory study was performed on 100 quenched gauge
configurations and will be applied to the calculation of low-lying hadron
spectra.
