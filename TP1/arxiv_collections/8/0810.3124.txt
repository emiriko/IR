We report the filling of single walled carbon nanotubes with an electron
spin-active fullerene species where a nitroxide radical is functionalized on
the fullerene cage. High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM),
optical absorption and electron spin resonance (ESR) are used to determine the
rotational behavior of the encapsulated molecules and determine the polar
nature of the nanotube interior.
