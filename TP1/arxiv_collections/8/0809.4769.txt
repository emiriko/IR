For the Stout Link Non-perturbative Clover (SLiNC) action we determine in
one-loop lattice perturbation theory the critical hopping parameter $\kappa_c$
and the clover parameter $c_{SW}$ which is needed for $\mathcal{O}(a)$
improvement. Performing this calculation off-shell we are also able to compute
the non gauge invariant quark field improvement coefficient $c_{NGI}$.
Additionally, we present first results for the renormalization factors of the
scalar, pseudoscalar, vector and axial vector currents. We discuss mean field
improvement for the SLiNC action.
