We generalize the connection between 2t physics and noncommutative geometry.
In particular, we apply our formalism to a target spacetime of signature (2+2).
Specifically, we compute an algebra of a generalized SL(2, R)-Hamiltonian
constraint, showing that it satisfies a kind of algebra associated with the
noncommutative group $U_{\star}(1,1)$. We also comment about a possible
connection between our formalism and nonsymmetric gravitational theory.
