In this paper we introduce, for the first time, the Weibull-Geometric
distribution which generalizes the exponential-geometric distribution proposed
by Adamidis and Loukas (1998). The hazard function of the last distribution is
monotone decreasing but the hazard function of the new distribution can take
more general forms. Unlike the Weibull distribution, the proposed distribution
is useful for modeling unimodal failure rates. We derive the cumulative
distribution and hazard functions, the density of the order statistics and
calculate expressions for its moments and for the moments of the order
statistics. We give expressions for the R\'enyi and Shannon entropies. The
maximum likelihood estimation procedure is discussed and an algorithm EM
(Dempster et al., 1977; McLachlan and Krishnan, 1997) is provided for
estimating the parameters. We obtain the information matrix and discuss
inference. Applications to real data sets are given to show the flexibility and
potentiality of the proposed distribution.
