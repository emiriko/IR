The analytic solution of the general relativity equations for spherically
symmetric wormholes are given. We investigate the special case of a
"traversable" wormhole i.e., one allowing the signal to pass through it. The
energy-momentum tensor of wormhole matter is represented as a superposition of
a spherically symmetric magnetic field and dust matter with negative matter
density. The dynamics of the model are investigated. We discuss both the
solution of the equation with a Lambda-term and without it. Superposing enough
dust matter, a magnetic field, and a Lambda-term can produce a static solution,
which turns out to be a spherical Multiverse model with an infinite number of
wormholes connected spherical universes. Corresponding solution can be static
and dynamic.
