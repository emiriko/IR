We consider the elementary radiative-correction terms in loop quantum
gravity. These are a two-vertex "elementary bubble" and a five-vertex "ball";
they correspond to the one-loop self-energy and the one-loop vertex correction
of ordinary quantum field theory. We compute their naive degree of (infrared)
divergence.
