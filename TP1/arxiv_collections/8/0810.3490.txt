We describe a method for measuring CP-violation parameters from which the
Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa angle $\gamma$ may be extracted. The method makes use
of the total decay rates in $B^\pm \to DK^\pm$ decays, where the neutral $D$
meson decays to multibody final states. We analyze the error of the method
using experimental CP-violation analysis variables that enable straightforward
sensitivity comparison with other methods for extracting $\gamma$, and discuss
the use of $B$-factory and charm-factory data to obtain the relevant charm
decay information needed for this measurement. Measurement sensitivities are
estimated for the currently available $B$-factory data sample, and $D$ decay
modes for which use of this method can make a significant contribution toward
reducing the total error on $\gamma$ are identified.
