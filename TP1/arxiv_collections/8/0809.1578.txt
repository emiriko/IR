In many epidemiological models a nonlinear transmission function is used in
the form of power law relationship. It is constantly argued that such form
reflects population heterogeneities including differences in the mixing
pattern, susceptibility, and spatial patchiness, although the function itself
is considered phenomenological. Comparison with large-scale simulations show
that models with this transmission function accurately approximate data from
highly heterogeneous sources. In this note we provide a mechanistic derivation
of the power law transmission function, starting with a simple heterogeneous
susceptibles--infectives (SI) model, which is based on a standard mass action
assumption. We also consider the simplest SI model with separable mixing and
compare our results with known results from the literature.
