Spatial correlations for sheared isothermal elastic liquids and granular
liquids are theoretically investigated. Using the generalized fluctuating
hydrodynamics, correlation functions for both the microscopic scale and the
macroscopic scale are obtained. The existence of the long-range correlation
functions obeying power laws has been confirmed. The validity of our
theoretical predictions have been verified from the molecular dynamics
simulation.
