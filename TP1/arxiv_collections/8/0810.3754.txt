Measurements of differential photon + c jet and photon + b jet production
cross sections are presented using approximately 1 fb-1 of data collected by
the D0 detector at the Tevatron proton-antiproton collider at a center-of-mass
energy of 1.96 TeV. Isolated photons are selected in the rapidity range |y| <
1.0 and jets selected with rapidities |y| < 0.8. The measurements are compared
to next-to-leading order theoretical predictions.
