We present a study of the spectral properties of photon pairs generated
through the process of spontaneous four wave mixing (SFWM) in single mode
fiber. Our analysis assumes narrowband pumps, which are allowed to be
frequency-degenerate or non-degenerate. Based on this analysis, we derive
conditions on the pump frequencies and on the fiber dispersion parameters which
guarantee the generation of ultra-broadband photon pairs. Such photon pairs are
characterized by: i) a very large degree of entanglement, and ii) a very high
degree of temporal synchronization between the signal and idler photons.
Through a numerical exercise, we find that the use of photonic crystal fiber
(PCF) facilitates the fulfilment of the conditions for ultra-broadband photon
pair generation; in particular, the spectral region in which emission occurs
can be adjusted to particular needs through an appropriate choice of the PCF
parameters. In addition, we present a novel quantum interference effect,
resulting from indistinguishable pathways to the same outcome, which can occur
when pumping a SFWM source with multiple spectral lines.
