The stabilization of steady states is studied in a modified Lang-Kobayashi
model of a semiconductor laser. We show that multiple time-delayed feedback,
realized by a Fabry-Perot resonator coupled to the laser, provides a valuable
tool for the suppression of unwanted intensity pulsations, and leads to stable
continuous-wave operation. The domains of control are calulated in dependence
on the feedback strength, delay time (cavity round trip time), memory parameter
(mirror reflectivity), latency time, feedback phase, and bandpass filtering,
Due to the optical feedback, multistable behavior can also occur in the form of
delay-induced intensity pulsations or other modes for certain choices of the
control parameters. Control may then still be achieved by slowly ramping the
injection current during turn-on.
