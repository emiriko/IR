We have employed the constrained variational method to study the influence of
spin polarization on the ground state properties of liquid $^3{\rm He}$. The
spin polarized phase, we have found, has stronger correlation with respect to
the unpolarized phase. It is shown that the internal energy of liquid $^3{\rm
He}$ increases by increasing polarization with no crossing point between
polarized and unpolarized energy curves over the liquid density range. The
obtained internal energy curves show a bound state, even in the case of fully
spin polarized matter. We have also investigated the validity of using a
parabolic formula for calculating the energy of spin polarized liquid $^3{\rm
He}$. Finally, we have compared our results with other calculations.
