The logit model is often used to analyze experimental data. However,
randomization does not justify the model, so the usual estimators can be
inconsistent. A consistent estimator is proposed. Neyman's non-parametric setup
is used as a benchmark. In this setup, each subject has two potential
responses, one if treated and the other if untreated; only one of the two
responses can be observed. Beside the mathematics, there are simulation
results, a brief review of the literature, and some recommendations for
practice.
