The holographic dark energy with Ricci scalar as IR cutoff called Ricci dark
energy(RDE) probes the nature of dark energy with respect to the holographic
principle of quantum gravity theory. The scalar field dark energy models like
quintom are often viewed as effective description of the underlying field
theory of dark energy. In this letter, we assume RDE model as the underlying
field theory to find how the generalized ghost condensate model(GGC) that can
easily realize quintom behavior can be used to effectively describe it and
reconstruct the function $h(\phi)$ of the generalized ghost condensate model.
