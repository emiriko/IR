The higher-power derivative terms involved in both Faddeev and Skyrme energy
functionals correspond to $\sigma_2$-energy, introduced by Eells and Sampson.
The paper provides a detailed study of the first and second variation formulae
associated to this energy. Some classes of (stable) critical maps are outlined.
