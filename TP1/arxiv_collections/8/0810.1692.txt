We report on our investigation of the crystal structure of arsenic under
compression, focusing primarily on the pressure-induced A7 to simple cubic (sc)
phase transition. The two-atom rhombohedral unit cell is subjected to pressures
ranging from 0 GPa to 200 GPa; for each given pressure, cell lengths and
angles, as well as atomic positions, are allowed to vary until the fully
relaxed structure is obtained. We find that the nearest and next-nearest
neighbor distances give the clearest indication of the occurrence of a
structural phase transition. Calculations are performed using the local density
approximation (LDA) and the PBE and PW91 generalized gradient approximations
(GGA-PBE and GGA-PW91) for the exchange-correlation functional. The A7 to sc
transition is found to occur at 21+/-1 GPa in the LDA, at 28+/-1 GPa in the
GGA-PBE and at 29+/-1 GPa in the GGA-PW91; no volume discontinuity is observed
across the transition in any of the three cases. We use k-point grids as dense
as 66X66X66 to enable us to present reliably converged results for the A7 to sc
transition of arsenic.
