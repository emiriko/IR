We explicitly construct infinite families of MSTD (more sums than
differences) sets. There are enough of these sets to prove that there exists a
constant C such that at least C / r^4 of the 2^r subsets of {1,...,r} are MSTD
sets; thus our family is significantly denser than previous constructions
(whose densities are at most f(r)/2^{r/2} for some polynomial f(r)). We
conclude by generalizing our method to compare linear forms epsilon_1 A + ... +
epsilon_n A with epsilon_i in {-1,1}.
