Recent results from HERA and TevaTron on precision tests of QCD with jets, W
and Z bosons and photons associated with jets and heavy flavours are presented.
The measurements were used to probe QCD at the highest energies, to provide
experimental constraints on SM processes that constitute background to new
physics, to extract values of the coupling of the strong interaction and to
constrain the proton parton distribution functions. The implications of the
results on LHC physics are discussed.
