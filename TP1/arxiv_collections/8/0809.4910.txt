Baryons containing two heavy quarks are important and interesting systems to
study the quark-diquark structure of baryons and to understand the dynamics of
QCD at hadronic scale. The Selex Collaboration has recently reported the
discovery of $\Xi_{cc}$ with a mass of 3.519 Ge$V$. However, other groups such
as Babar, Belle and Focus have all failed to confirm this state. So there is a
demand to review this state both theoretically and experimentally. We report
here the spectra and magnetic moments of $ccq(q\in u,d,s)$ systems using
coulomb plus Martin potential. Here the two heavy quarks are considered for the
diquark states. The same potential form is used for the diquark interaction as
well as for the quark-diquark interaction. The chromomagnetic one gluon
exchange interaction are perturbatively treated here to get the masses of
$J^P={{1/2}}^{+}$ and $J^P={{3/2}}^{+}$ states. Accordingly, we obtain
$\Xi^{++}_{cc}$ (3519, 3555), $\Xi^{+}_{cc}$ (3527, 3562) and $\Omega^{+}_{cc}$
(3648,3688) states of the $ccq$ $({1/2}^{+},{3/2}^{+})$ combinations. Our
predictions are in accordance with the SELEX result for $\Xi^{++}_{cc}$ (3519)
and other model predictions. Predictions of other properties of these $ccq$
systems will be presented in detail.
