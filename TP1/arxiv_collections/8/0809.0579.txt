Simplest quantum teleportation algorithms can be represented in geometric
terms in spaces of dimensions 3 (for real state-vectors) and 4 (for complex
state-vectors). The geometric representation is based on geometric-algebra
coding, a geometric alternative to the tensor-product coding typical of quantum
mechanics. We discuss all the elementary ingredients of the geometric version
of the algorithm: Geometric analogs of states and controlled Pauli gates. Fully
geometric presentation is possible if one employs a nonstandard representation
of directed magnitudes, formulated in terms of colors defined via stereographic
projection of a color wheel, and not by means of directed volumes.
