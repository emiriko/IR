Orientation selectivity is the most striking feature of simple cell coding in
V1 which has been shown to emerge from the reduction of higher-order
correlations in natural images in a large variety of statistical image models.
The most parsimonious one among these models is linear Independent Component
Analysis (ICA), whereas second-order decorrelation transformations such as
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) do not yield oriented filters. Because of
this finding it has been suggested that the emergence of orientation
selectivity may be explained by higher-order redundancy reduction. In order to
assess the tenability of this hypothesis, it is an important empirical question
how much more redundancies can be removed with ICA in comparison to PCA, or
other second-order decorrelation methods. This question has not yet been
settled, as over the last ten years contradicting results have been reported
ranging from less than five to more than hundred percent extra gain for ICA.
Here, we aim at resolving this conflict by presenting a very careful and
comprehensive analysis using three evaluation criteria related to redundancy
reduction: In addition to the multi-information and the average log-loss we
compute, for the first time, complete rate-distortion curves for ICA in
comparison with PCA. Without exception, we find that the advantage of the ICA
filters is surprisingly small. Furthermore, we show that a simple spherically
symmetric distribution with only two parameters can fit the data even better
than the probabilistic model underlying ICA. Since spherically symmetric models
are agnostic with respect to the specific filter shapes, we conlude that
orientation selectivity is unlikely to play a critical role for redundancy
reduction.
