We introduce the notion of a half-ribbon Hopf algebra, which is a ribbon Hopf
algebra along with a distinguished element $t$ corresponding to twisting a
ribbon by 180 degrees (the half-twist). We show that U_q(g) is a (topological)
half-ribbon Hopf algebra, but only if one uses a modified ribbon element. We
then discuss some consequences of using this modified ribbon element.
