In this article we present a closed analytical description for few-cycle,
focused electromagnetic pulses of arbitrary duration and carrier-envelope-phase
(CEP). Because of the vectorial character of light, not all thinkable
one-dimensional (1D) shapes for the transverse electric field or vector
potential can be realized as finite energy three-dimensional (3D) structures.
We cope with this problem by using a second potential, which is defined as a
primitive to the vector potential. This allows to construct fully consistent 3D
wave-packet solutions for the Maxwell equations, given a solution of the scalar
wave equation. The wave equation is solved for ultrashort, Gaussian and related
pulses in paraxial approximation. The solution is given in a closed and
numerically convenient form, based on the complex error function. All results
undergo thorough numerical testing, validating their correctness and accuracy.
A reliable and accurate representation of few-cycle pulses is e.g. crucial for
analytical and numerical theory of vacuum particle acceleration.
