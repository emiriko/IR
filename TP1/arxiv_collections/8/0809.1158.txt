We apply the graph complex method to vector fields depending naturally on a
set of vector fields and a linear symmetric connection. We characterize all
possible systems of generators for such vector-field valued operators including
the classical ones given by normal tensors and covariant derivatives. We also
describe the size of the space of such operators and prove the existence of an
`ideal' basis consisting of operators with given leading terms which satisfy
the (generalized) Bianchi-Ricci identities without the correction terms.
