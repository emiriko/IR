We have investigated the accuracies of calculations made by omitting the
higher partial waves of nuclear wave functions and the elementary relativistic
terms in the hypertriton electroproduction. We found that an accurate
calculation would still be obtained if we used at least three lowest partial
waves with isospin T = 0. Furthermore, we found that the omission of the
relativistic terms in the elementary process amplitude could lead to a large
deviation from the full calculation. We also present the cpu-times required to
calculate the cross sections. For future consideration the use of these lowest
partial waves is suggested, since the calculated cross section deviates only
about 0.17 nb/sr (approximately 4%), at most, from the full calculation,
whereas the cpu-time is reduced by a factor of 60. Comparison of our result
with the available experimental data supports these findings.
