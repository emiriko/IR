We investigate theoretically the performance advantages of all-graphene
nanoribbon field-effect transistors (GNRFETs) whose channel and source/drain
(contact) regions are patterned monolithically from a two-dimensional single
sheet of graphene. In our simulated devices, the source/drain and interconnect
regions are composed of wide graphene nanoribbon (GNR) sections that are
semimetallic, while the channel regions consist of narrow GNR sections that
open semiconducting bandgaps. Our simulation employs a fully atomistic model of
the device, contact and interfacial regions using tight-binding theory. The
electronic structures are coupled with a self-consistent three-dimensional
Poisson's equation to capture the nontrivial contact electrostatics, along with
a quantum kinetic formulation of transport based on non-equilibrium Green's
functions (NEGF). Although we only consider a specific device geometry, our
results establish several general performance advantages of such monolithic
devices (besides those related to fabrication and patterning), namely the
improved electrostatics, suppressed short-channel effects, and Ohmic contacts
at the narrow-to-wide interfaces.
