The concept of matter wave radiation is put forward, and its equation is
established for the first time. The formalism solution shows that the
probability density is a function of displacement and time. A free particle and
a two-level system are reinvestigated considering the effect of matter wave
radiation. Three feasible experimental designs, especially a modified
Stern-Gerlach setup, are proposed to verify the existence of matter wave
radiation. Matter wave radiation effect in relativity has been formulated in
only a raw formulae, which offers another explanation of Lamb shift. A possible
mechanics of matter teleportation is predicted due to the effect of matter wave
radiation.
