In this paper we study some applications of the L\'evy logarithmic Sobolev
inequality to the study of the regularity of the solution of the fractal heat
equation, i. e. the heat equation where the Laplacian is replaced with the
fractional Laplacian. It is also used to the study of the asymptotic behaviour
of the L\'evy-Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.
