Graphene field-effect transistors with Co contacts as source and drain
electrodes show anomalous distorted transfer characteristics. The anomaly
appears only in short-channel devices (shorter than approximately 3
micrometers) and originates from a contact-induced effect. Band alteration of a
graphene channel by the contacts is discussed as a possible mechanism for the
anomalous characteristics observed.
