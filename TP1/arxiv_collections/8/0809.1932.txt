We present a family of entanglement measures R_m which act as indicators for
separability of n-qubit quantum states into m subsystems for arbitrary 2 \leq m
\leq n. The measure R_m vanishes if the state is separable into m subsystems,
and for m = n it gives the Meyer-Wallach measure while for m = 2 it reduces, in
effect, to the one introduced recently by Love et al. The measures R_m are
evaluated explicitly for the GHZ state and the W state (and its modifications,
the W_k states) to show that these globally entangled states exhibit rather
distinct behaviors under the measures, indicating the utility of the measures
R_m for characterizing globally entangled states as well.
