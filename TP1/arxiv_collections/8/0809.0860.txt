We report systematic quantum Hall transport experiments on Fabry-Perot
electron interferometers at ultra-low-temperatures. The GaAs/AlGaAs
heterostructure devices consist of two constrictions defined by etch trenches
in 2D electron layer, enclosing an approximately circular island. Front gates
deposited in etch trenches allow to fine-tune the device for symmetry and to
change the constriction filling, relative to the bulk. The low-field
longitudinal and Hall magnetotransport shows Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations and
integer quantum Hall plateaus. A systematic variation of front-gate voltage
affects the constriction and the island electron density, while the bulk
density remains unaffected. This results in quantized plateaus in longitudinal
resistance, while the Hall resistance is dominated by the low-density,
low-filling constriction. At lower fields, when the quantum Hall plateaus fail
to develop, we observe bulk Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations in series
corresponding to an integer filling of the magnetoelectric subbands in the
constrictions. This indicates that the whole interferometer region is still
quantum-coherent at these lower fields at 10 mK. Analyzing the data within a
Fock-Darwin model, we obtain the constriction electron density as a function of
the front gate bias and, extrapolating to the zero field, the number of
electric subbands (conductance channels) resulting from the electron
confinement in the constrictions.
