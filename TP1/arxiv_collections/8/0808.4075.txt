We use Pade approximants to systematically approximate scalar unparticle
propagators and their associated phase factors by a finite number of ordinary
particles. This is possible for conformal dimensions 1<d<2, and also for d>2 if
we add local terms. A small number of particles can, in some cases, mimic
unparticle signals. We also discuss how the approximants capture basic
unparticle properties.
