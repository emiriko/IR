Initial offset placement in p2p streaming systems is studied in this paper.
Proportional placement (PP) scheme is proposed. In this scheme, peer places the
initial offset as the offset reported by other reference peer with a shift
proportional to the buffer width or offset lag of this reference peer. This
will introduce a stable placement that supports larger buffer width for peers
and small buffer width for tracker. Real deployed placement method in PPLive is
studied through measurement. It shows that, instead of based on offset lag, the
placement is based on buffer width of the reference peer to facilitate the
initial chunk fetching. We will prove that, such a PP scheme may not be stable
under arbitrary buffer occupation in the reference peer. The required average
buffer width then is derived. A simple good peer selection mechanism to check
the buffer occupation of reference peer is proposed for a stable PP scheme
based on buffer width
