This paper proposes a novel Nyquist-rate analog-to-digital (A/D) conversion
algorithm which achieves exponential accuracy in the bit-rate despite using
imperfect components. The proposed algorithm is based on a robust
implementation of a beta-encoder where the value of the base beta is equal to
golden mean. It was previously shown that beta-encoders can be implemented in
such a way that their exponential accuracy is robust against threshold offsets
in the quantizer element. This paper extends this result by allowing for
imperfect analog multipliers with imprecise gain values as well. A formal
computational model for algorithmic encoders and a general test bed for
evaluating their robustness is also proposed.
