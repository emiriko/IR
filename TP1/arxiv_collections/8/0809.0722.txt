Doped one-dimensional (1D) conjugated polymers, such as polyacetylene, have a
conductivity of some metals, like copper. We show that when this polymer is
asymmetrically doped, unexpected properties are revealed, when compared to the
behavior of the symmetrically standard doped systems (SDS). Depending on the
level of imbalance between the chemical potentials of the two involved
fermionic species, the polymer can be converted into a 1D partially or fully
spin polarized organic conductor.
