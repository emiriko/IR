We consider an anisotropic brane-world model with Bianchi type I and V
geometry, without mirror symmetry or any form of junction conditions. The
generalized Chaplygin gas, which interpolates between a high density
relativistic era and a non-relativistic matter phase, is a popular candidate
for the present accelerated expansion of the universe. Considering the
generalized Chaplygin gas as a geometrical dark energy, we obtain the general
solutions in an exact parametric form for both Bianchi type I and V
space-times. Finally, we study the behavior of the observationally important
parameters such as the shear, anisotropic and deceleration parameter in this
model.
