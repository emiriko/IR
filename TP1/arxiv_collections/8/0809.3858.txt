In a recent paper (Phys.Rev.A78, 020101(R) (2008)), Kim at al. have reported
a large anomaly in the scaling law of the electrostatic interaction between a
sphere and a plate, which was observed during the calibration of their Casimir
force set-up. Here we experimentally demonstrate that in proper electrostatic
calibrations the scaling law follows the behavior expected from elementary
electrostatic arguments, even when the electrostatic voltage that one must
apply to minimize the force (typically ascribed to contact potentials) depends
on the separation between the surfaces.
