We report new measurements of the linear polarization of thermal radiation
emitted by incandescent thin tungsten wires, with thicknesses ranging from five
to hundred microns. Our data show very good agreement with theoretical
predictions, based on Drude-type fits to measured optical properties of
tungsten.
