We review results which explicitly depend on the entanglement of neutral
meson pairs produced at the psi(3770) and Upsilon(4S). Time-dependent
CP-violation analyses at the B-factories use the flavour-singlet final state at
the Upsilon(4S), but by assuming its quantum-mechanical evolution; Belle on the
other hand has tested the time-dependent flavour correlation of the B-mesons,
comparing predictions of quantum mechanics, spontaneous disentanglement, and
Pompili-Selleri models. At the psi(3770), decay rates are modulated by various
combinations of the charm mixing parameters: this has been exploited by CLEO-c
to provide the first effective constraint on the strong-phase difference delta.
Finally, the goal of a "model-independent" phi_3/Dalitz analysis is now within
reach, using D-mesons from the psi(3770) to constrain the D0 -> K_S pi+ pi-
decay amplitude. Manifestly entangled events psi(3770) -> (K_S pi+pi-)_D (K_S
pi+ pi-)_D, rather than just "CP-tagged" decays, turn out to be crucial.
