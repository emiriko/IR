A high luminosity energy recovery linac on ring type electron-positron
collider operating as super charm factory is proposed. It is shown that the
luminosity L=2.3 10^35 cm^-2s^-1 can be achieved for center of mass energy 3.77
GeV. The physics goals of this machine in investigation for charmed particles
properties are briefly discussed.
