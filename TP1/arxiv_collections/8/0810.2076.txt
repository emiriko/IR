We present a conjecture generalizing the Cauchy formula for Macdonald
polynomials. This conjecture encodes the mixed Hodge polynomials of the
character varieties of representations of the fundamental group of a Riemann
surface of genus g to GL_n(C) with fixed generic semi-simple conjugacy classes
at k punctures. Using the character table of GL_n(F_q) we calculate the
E-polynomial of these character varieties and confirm that it is as predicted
by our main conjecture. Then, using the character table of gl_n(F_q), we
calculate the E-polynomial of certain associated comet-shaped quiver varieties,
the additive analogues of our character variety, and find that it is the pure
part of our conjectured mixed Hodge polynomial. Finally, we observe that the
pure part of our conjectured mixed Hodge polynomial also equals certain
multiplicities in the tensor product of irreducible representations of
GL_n(F_q). This implies a curious connection between the representation theory
of GL_n(F_q) and Kac-Moody algebras associated with comet-shaped, typically
wild, quivers.
