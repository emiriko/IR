In this paper, we report on findings from an ethnographic study of how people
use their calendars for personal information management (PIM). Our participants
were faculty, staff and students who were not required to use or contribute to
any specific calendaring solution, but chose to do so anyway. The study was
conducted in three parts: first, an initial survey provided broad insights into
how calendars were used; second, this was followed up with personal interviews
of a few participants which were transcribed and content-analyzed; and third,
examples of calendar artifacts were collected to inform our analysis. Findings
from our study include the use of multiple reminder alarms, the reliance on
paper calendars even among regular users of electronic calendars, and wide use
of calendars for reporting and life-archival purposes. We conclude the paper
with a discussion of what these imply for designers of interactive calendar
systems and future work in PIM research.
