A nonequilibrium Green's functions (NEGF) approach for spatially
inhomogeneous, strongly correlated artificial atoms is presented and applied to
compute the time-dependent properties while starting from a (correlated)
initial few-electron state at finite temperatures. In the regime of moderate to
strong coupling, we consider the Kohn mode of a three-electron system in a
parabolic confinement excited by a short pulsed classical laser field treated
in dipole approximation. In particular, we numerically confirm that this mode
is preserved within a conserving (e.g. Hartree-Fock or second Born) theory.
