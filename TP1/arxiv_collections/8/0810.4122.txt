Manin's conjecture for the asymptotic behavior of the number of rational
points of bounded height on del Pezzo surfaces can be approached through
universal torsors. We prove several auxiliary results for the estimation of the
number of integral points in certain regions on universal torsors. As an
application, we prove Manin's conjecture for a singular quartic del Pezzo
surface.
