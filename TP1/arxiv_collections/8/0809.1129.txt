This paper is the sequel of the paper "Continuity of volumes on arithmetic
varieties", in which we established the arithmetic volume function of smooth
hermitian Q-invertible sheaves and proved its continuity. The continuity of the
volume function has a lot of applications as treated in the paper as above. In
this paper, we would like to consider its continuous extension over R.
