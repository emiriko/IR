The precise momentum dependence of the superconducting gap in the
iron-arsenide superconductor with Tc = 32K (BKFA) was determined from
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) via fitting the distribution
of the quasiparticle density to a model. The model incorporates finite lifetime
and experimental resolution effects, as well as accounts for peculiarities of
BKFA electronic structure. We have found that the value of the superconducting
gap is practically the same for the inner Gamma-barrel, X-pocket, and
"blade"-pocket, and equals 9 meV, while the gap on the outer Gamma-barrel is
estimated to be less than 4 meV, resulting in 2Delta/kT_c=6.8 for the large
gap, and 2Delta/kT_c<3 for the small gap. A large (77 \pm 3%)
non-superconducting component in the photoemission signal is observed below
T_c. Details of gap extraction from ARPES data are discussed in Appendix.
