Let M_n be the collection of n x n complex matrices equipped with operator
norm. Suppose U, V \in M_n are two unitary matrices, each possessing a gap
larger than \Delta in their spectrum, which satisfy ||UV-VU|| \le \epsilon.
Then it is shown that there are two unitary operators X and Y satisfying XY-YX
= 0 and ||U-X|| + ||V-Y|| \le E(\Delta^2/\epsilon) (\epsilon/\Delta^2)^(1/6),
where E(x) is a function growing slower than x^(1/k) for any positive integer
k.
