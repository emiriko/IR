We have generalized the gravity solutions presented in arXiv:0808.1725 and
arXiv:0808.3232 to arbitrary but even space time dimensions with the scaling
symmetry $r \to \f{r}{\lambda}, x_i \to \lambda^b x_i, t \to \lambda^a t$.
However, for $b=0$, we have the solution in arbitrary space time dimension, not
restricted to even dimensional. The physical meaning of this particular choice
of $b$ is that we can have a solution with only temporal scale invariance. From
the dual field theory point of view, the BF bound and the unitarity bound for
operators dual to scalar field is discussed.
