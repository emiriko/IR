The origin of long-range letter correlations in natural texts is studied
using random walk analysis and Jensen-Shannon divergence. It is concluded that
they result from slow variations in letter frequency distribution, which are a
consequence of slow variations in lexical composition within the text. These
correlations are preserved by random letter shuffling within a moving window.
As such, they do reflect structural properties of the text, but in a very
indirect manner.
