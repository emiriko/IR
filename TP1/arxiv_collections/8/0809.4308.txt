We propose a new method for extracting neutron structure functions from
inclusive structure functions of nuclei. Unlike earlier approaches, the new
method is applicable to both spin-averaged and spin-dependent structure
functions. We test the reliability of the method on unpolarized F_2 and
polarized g_1 structure functions of the deuteron in both the nucleon resonance
and deep inelastic regions. The new method is able to reproduce known input
functions of almost arbitrary shape to very good accuracy with only several
iterations.
