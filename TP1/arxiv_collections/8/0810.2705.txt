We propose a simple scheme for expanding a polarization-entangled W state. By
mixing a single photon and one of the photons in an n-photon W state at a
polarization-dependent beam splitter (PDBS), we can obtain an (n+1)-photon W
state after post-selection. Our scheme also opens the door for generating
n-photon W states using single photons and linear optics.
