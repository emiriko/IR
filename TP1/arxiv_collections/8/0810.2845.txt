We re-investigate the vector and axial-vector vacuum susceptibilities by
taking advantage of the vector and axial-vector Ward-Takahashi identities. We
show analytically that, in the chiral limit, the vector vacuum susceptibility
is zero and the axial-vector vacuum susceptibility equals three fourths of the
square of the pion decay constant. Besides, our analysis reproduces the
Weinberg sum rule.
