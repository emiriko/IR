A large variety of transport properties have been observed at the interface
between the insulating oxides SrTiO3 and LaAlO3 such as insulation, 2D
interface metallicity, 3D bulk metallicity, Kondo scattering, magnetism and
superconductivity. The relation between the structure and the properties of the
SrTiO3-LaAlO3 interface can be explained in a meaningful way by taking into
account the relative contribution of three structural aspects: oxygen
vacancies, structural deformations (including cation disorder) and electronic
interface reconstruction. The emerging phase diagram is much richer than for
related bulk oxides due to the occurrence of interface electronic
reconstruction. The observation of this interface phenomenon is a display of
recent advances in thin film deposition and characterization techniques, and
provides an extension to the range of exceptional electronic properties of
complex oxides.
