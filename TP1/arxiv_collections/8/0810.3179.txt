We investigate a special class of cellular automata (CA) evolving in a
environment filled by an electromagnetic wave. The rules of the Conway's Game
of Life are modified to account for the ability to retrieve life-sustenance
from the field energy. Light-induced self-structuring and self-healing
abilities and various dynamic phases are displayed by the CA. Photo-driven
genetic selection and the nonlinear feedback of the CA on the electromagnetic
field are included in the model, and there are evidences of self-organized
light-localization processes. The evolution of the electromagnetic field is
based on the Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) approach. Applications are
envisaged in evolutionary biology, artificial life, DNA replication, swarming,
optical tweezing and field-driven soft-matter.
