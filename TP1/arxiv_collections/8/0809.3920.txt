In this Chapter, we give an introduction into experiments with Feshbach
molecules and their applications. In particular, we discuss the various
creation and detection methods, and the internal-state manipulation of such
molecules. We highlight two topics, namely Feshbach molecules in the halo
regime and the application of Feshbach molecule to achieve ultracold gases of
molecules in the rovibrational ground state. Our illustrative examples are
mainly based on work performed at Innsbruck University.
