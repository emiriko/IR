Counting the number of ground states for a spin-glass or NP-complete
combinatorial optimization problem is even more difficult than the already hard
task of finding a single ground state. In this paper the entropy of minimum
vertex-covers of random graphs is estimated through a set of iterative
equations based on the cavity method of statistical mechanics. During the
iteration both the cavity entropy contributions and cavity magnetizations for
each vertex are updated. This approach overcomes the difficulty of iterative
divergence encountered in the zero temperature first-step
replica-symmetry-breaking (1RSB) spin-glass theory. It is still applicable when
the 1RSB mean-field theory is no longer stable. The method can be extended to
compute the entropies of ground-states and metastable minimal-energy states for
other random-graph spin-glass systems.
