We report polarized neutron scattering and piezoresponse force microscopy
studies of millimeter-sized single crystals of multiferroic BiFeO$_3$. The
crystals, grown below the Curie temperature, consist of a single ferroelectric
domain. Two unique electric polarization directions, as well as the populations
of equivalent spiral magnetic domains, can be switched reversibly by an
electric field. A ferroelectric monodomain with a single-$q$ single-helicity
spin spiral can be obtained. This level of control, so far unachievable in thin
films, makes single-crystal BiFeO$_3$ a promising object for multiferroics
research.
