We study the conditions under which the cotangent bundle $T^*M$ of a
Riemaannian manifold $(M,g)$, endowed with a K\"ahlerian structure $(G,J)$ of
general natural lift type (see \cite{Druta1}), is Einstein. We first obtain a
general natural K\"ahler-Einstein structure on the cotangent bundle $T^*M$. In
this case, a certain parameter, $\lambda$ involved in the condition for
$(T^*M,G,J)$ to be a K\"ahlerian manifold, is expressed as a rational function
of the other two, the value of the constant sectional curvature, $c$, of the
base manifold $(M,g)$ and the constant $\rho$ involved in the condition for the
structure of being Einstein. This expression of $\lambda$ is just that involved
in the condition for the K\"ahlerian manifold to have constant holomorphic
sectional curvature (see \cite{Druta2}). In the second case, we obtain a
general natural K\"ahler-Einstein structure only on $T_0M$, the bundle of
nonzero cotangent vectors to $M$. For this structure, $\lambda$ is expressed as
another function of the other two parameters, their derivatives, $c$ and
$\rho$.
