In microfluidic technologies, direct patterning of liquid without resorting
to micromachined solid structures has various advantages including reduction of
the frictional dissipation and the fabrication cost. This fluid dynamics video
illustrates the method to micropattern a liquid on a solid surface with drop
impact. We experimentally show that a water drop impacting with the
wettability-patterned solid retracts fast on the hydrophobic regions while
being arrested on the hydrophilic areas.
