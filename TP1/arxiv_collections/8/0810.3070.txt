Let us consider the process $(X_t^{(\alpha)})_{t\in[0,T)}$ given by the SDE
$dX_t^{(\alpha)} = -\frac{\alpha}{T-t}X_t^{(\alpha)} dt+ dB_t$, $t\in[0,T)$,
where $\alpha\in R$, $T\in(0,\infty)$, and $(B_t)_{t\geq 0}$ is a standard
Wiener process. In case of $\alpha>0$ the process $X^{(\alpha)}$ is known as an
$\alpha$-Wiener bridge, in case of $\alpha=1$ as the usual Wiener bridge. We
prove that for all $\alpha,\beta\in R$, $\alpha\ne\beta$, the probability
measures induced by the processes $X^{(\alpha)}$ and $X^{(\beta)}$ are singular
on C[0,T). Further, we investigate regularity properties of $X_t^{(\alpha)}$ as
$t\uparrow T$.
