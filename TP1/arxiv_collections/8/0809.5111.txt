The 4He3 system is studied using the adiabatic hyperspherical representation.
We adopt the current state-of-the-art helium interaction potential including
retardation and the nonadditive three-body term, to calculate all low-energy
properties of the triatomic 4He system. The bound state energies of the 4He
trimer are computed as well as the 4He+4He2 elastic scattering cross sections,
the three-body recombination and collision induced dissociation rates at finite
temperatures. We also treat the system that consists of two 4He and one 3He
atoms, and compute the spectrum of the isotopic trimer 4He2 3He, the 3He+4He2
elastic scattering cross sections, the rates for three-body recombination and
the collision induced dissociation rate at finite temperatures. The effects of
retardation and the nonadditive three-body term are investigated. Retardation
is found to be significant in some cases, while the three-body term plays only
a minor role for these systems.
