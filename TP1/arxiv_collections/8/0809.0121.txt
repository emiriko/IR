Probabilistic estimates on linear combinations of eigenvalues of the one
dimensional Anderson model are derived. So far only estimates on the density of
eigenvalues and of pairs were found by Wegner and by Minami. Our work was
motivated by perturbative explorations of the Nonlinear Schroedinger Equation,
where linear combinations of eigenvalues are the denominators and evaluation of
their smallness is crucial.
