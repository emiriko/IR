Based on the interaction between a three-level system and a microtoroidal
resonator, we present a scheme for long-distance quantum communication in which
entanglement generation with near 0.5 success probability and swaps can be
implemented by accurate state detection via measuring about 100 photons. With
this scheme the average time of successful entanglement distribution over 2500
km with high fidelity can be decreased to only about 30 ms, by 7 orders of
magnitude smaller compared with famous Duan-Lukin-Cirac-Zoller (DLCZ) protocol
[L.-M. Duan {\it et al.} Nature (London) {\bf414}, 413 (2001)].
