In this paper we continue the development of the differential calculus
started by Aragona-Ferandez-Juriaans. Guided by the topology introduced
recently by those authors we introduce the notion of membranes and extend the
definition of integrals given in [2] to integrals defined on membranes. We use
this to prove a generalized version of teh Cauchy formula and to obtain the
Goursat Theorem for generalized holomorphic functions. We also show that the
generalized transport equation can be solved giving an explicit solution
