This article investigates the effect of equal and unequal received powers on
the performances of different MIMO-OFDM schemes for terrestrial digital TV.
More precisely, we focus on three types of non-orthogonal schemes: the BLAST
scheme, the Linear Dispersion (LD) code and the Golden code, and we compare
their performances to that of Alamouti scheme. Using two receiving antennas, we
show that for moderate attenuation on the second antenna and high spectral
efficiency, Golden code outperforms other schemes. However, Alamouti scheme
presents the best performance for low spectral efficiency and equal received
powers or when one antenna is dramatically damaged. When three antennas are
used, we show that Golden code offers the highest robustness to power unbalance
at the receiving side
