The architecture scalability afforded by recent proposals of a large scale
photonic based quantum computer, utilizing the theoretical developments of
topological cluster states and the photonic chip, allows us to move on to a
discussion of massively scaled Quantum Information Processing (QIP). In this
letter we introduce the model for a secure and unsecured topological cluster
mainframe. We consider the quantum analogue of High Performance Computing,
where a dedicated server farm is utilized by many users to run algorithms and
share quantum data. The scaling structure of photonics based topological
cluster computing leads to an attractive future for server based QIP, where
dedicated mainframes can be constructed and/or expanded to serve an
increasingly hungry user base with the ideal resource for individual quantum
information processing.
