In this latest of our series of Skyrme-HFB mass models, HFB-16, we introduce
the new feature of requiring that the contact pairing force reproduce at each
density the $^1S_0$ pairing gap of neutron matter as determined in microscopic
calculations with realistic nucleon-nucleon forces. We retain the earlier
constraints on the Skyrme force of reproducing the energy-density curve of
neutron matter, and of having an isoscalar effective mass of $0.8M$ in
symmetric infinite nuclear matter at the saturation density; we also keep the
recently adopted device of dropping Coulomb exchange. Furthermore, the
correction term for the spurious energy of collective motion has a form that is
known to favour fission barriers that are in good agreement with experiment.
Despite the extra constraints on the effective force, we have achieved a better
fit to the mass data than any other mean field model, the rms error on the 2149
measured masses of nuclei with $N$ and $Z \ge$ 8 having been reduced to 0.632
MeV; the improvement is particularly striking for the most neutron-rich nuclei.
Moreover, it turns out that even with no flexibility at all remaining for the
pairing force, the spectral pairing gaps that we find suggest that level
densities in good agreement with experiment should be obtained. This new force
is thus particularly well-suited for astrophysical applications, such as
stellar nucleosynthesis and neutron-star crusts.
