Using special capacitors three experiments to search for a permanent electric
dipole moment (EDM) of Cesium atom were completed. The electric susceptibility
xe of Cs vapor varies in direct proportion to the density N, where xe =70 when
N=7.37*1022 m-3! The relationship between xe of Cs vapor and the absolute
temperatures T is xe =B/T, where the slope B=320(k) as polar molecules
H2O(B=1.50(k)). Its capacitance C at different voltage V was measured. The C-V
curve shows that the saturation polarization of Cs vapor has be observed when
the field E=7.4*104V/m. Our measurements give the EDM of an Cs atom :
dCs=2.97*10-29 C.m=1.86*10-8 e.cm. New example of CP (charge conjugation and
parity) violation occurred in Cs atoms. Our results are easy to be repeated
because the details of the experiment are described in the article.
