In this chapter, a study of the glass transitions in colloidal systems is
presented, in connection with gelation, mainly from theoretical and simulation
results. Mode Coupling Theory, which anticipated the existence of attraction
driven glasses, is reviewed, and its predictions concerning attractive glasses
discussed. Results from computer simulations will be presented for different
models and the predictions of the theory will be tested. Starting from high
density, where reasonable agreement is found, the study will be extended to low
density, where new modes for the decay of density correlation functions appear.
In all cases, the results will be also be brought into connection with
experiments, and we will conclude with a discussion of the present
understanding of the mechanisms leading to gelation.
