Electron transmission through chiral molecules induced by circularly
polarized light can be very different for mirror-image structures, a peculiar
fact given that the electronic energy spectra of the systems are identical. We
propose that this asymmetry - as large as 10% for resonance transport- arises
from different dynamical responses of the mirrored structures to coherent
excitation. This behaviour is described in the context of a general novel
phenomenon, current transfer, transfer of charge with its momentum information,
that is outlined in terms of a simple tight binding model. This analysis makes
it possible to account for the observed asymmetry in and off resonance, to
characterize its dependence on the length of the molecular bridge and to
examine effects of dephasing processes.
