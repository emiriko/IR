We study theoretically the localization of relativistic particles in
disordered one-dimensional chains. It is found that the relativistic particles
tend to dislocation in comparison with the non-relativistic particles with the
same disorder strength. More intriguingly, we reveal that the massless Dirac
particles are entirely delocalized for any energy due to the inherent chiral
symmetry, leading to a well-known result that particles are always localized in
one-dimensional system for arbitrary weak disorders to break down. Furthermore,
we propose a feasible scheme to simulate and detect the delocalization feature
of the Dirac particles with cold atoms..
