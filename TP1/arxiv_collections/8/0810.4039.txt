The theme of this paper is to `solve' an absolutely irreducible differential
module explicitly in terms of modules of lower dimension and finite extensions
of the differential field $K$. Representations of semi-simple Lie algebras and
differential Galois theory are the main tools. The results extend the classical
work of G. Fano.
