A novel method for the precise identification and determination of the
energies that contribute in the spectral decomposition of lattice correlators
is presented. The method is based on statistical concepts and it relies heavily
on simulation techniques.
  The $\eta_c$ correlator is analyzed within this method and the results
obtained are compared to a previous analysis based on Bayesian statistics.
  An analysis of the nucleon local two-point correlators leads to the
identification of the excited states in the positive and negative channels. A
discussion on the Roper is included.
