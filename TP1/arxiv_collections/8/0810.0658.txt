For $\mu \in (0,1), c> 0,$ we identify the quantum group $SO_\mu(3)$ as the
universal object in the category of compact quantum groups acting by
`orientation and volume preserving isometries' in the sense of \cite{goswami2}
on the natural spectral triple on the Podles sphere $S^2_{\mu, c}$ constructed
by Dabrowski, D'Andrea, Landi and Wagner in \cite{{Dabrowski_et_al}}.
