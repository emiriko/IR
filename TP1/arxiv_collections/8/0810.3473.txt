Configurations for efficient free space coherent addition of four separate
fiber lasers arranged in two dimensional array are presented. They include
compact and robust interferometric combiners that can be inserted either inside
or outside the cavity of the combined lasers system. The results reveal that
over 85% combining efficiency can be obtained.
