We calculate the critical temperature for Bose-Einstein condensation in a gas
of bosonic atoms across a Feshbach resonance, and show how medium effects at
negative scattering lengths give rise to pairs reminiscent of the ones
responsible for fermionic superfluidity. We find that the formation of pairs
leads to a large suppression of the critical temperature. Within the formalism
developed by Nozieres and Schmitt-Rink the gas appears mechanically stable
throughout the entire crossover region, but when interactions between pairs are
taken into account we show that the gas becomes unstable close to the critical
temperature. We discuss prospects of observing these effects in a gas of
ultracold Cs133 atoms where recent measurements indicate that the gas may be
sufficiently long-lived to explore the many-body physics around a Feshbach
resonance.
