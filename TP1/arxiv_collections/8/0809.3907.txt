Samples of third-generation cylindrical dendrimers with molar masses ranging
in the interval 20000...60000 have been studied by the methods of equilibrium
and non-equilibrium electrical birefringence, molecular hydrodynamics and
optics. It was found that the absolute values of Kerr and flow birefringence
constants exceed the values obtained for analogous dendrimers of lower
generations. The mechanism of reorientation has proven to be strongly dependent
on the physical and chemical properties of the solvent. In chloroform
solutions, the studied dendrimers align to the microwave-frequency electric
fields according to large-scale mechanism. In dichloroacetic acid solutions,
the observed reorientation mechanism is low-scale, which is explained by
degradation of intermolecular hydrogen bonds. Terminal dendritic substituents
of the macromolecules have experimentally proven to be oriented mainly along
the primary polymer chain.
