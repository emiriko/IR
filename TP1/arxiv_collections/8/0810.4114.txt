We review the recent experimental results on the exotic charmoniumlike
states. Among them we discuss the X(3872), Y(3940), Z^\pm(4430) and Z^\pm_{1,2}
states found in B-meson decays, the X(3940) and X(4160) states produced in
double charmonium production and the Y(4260), Y(4325), Y(4660) and X(4630)
states produced with initial-state radiation in e^+e^- annihilation.
