QCD sum rules for D and B mesons embedded in cold nuclear matter are
evaluated. We quantify the mass splitting of D - D-bar and B - B-bar mesons as
a function of the nuclear matter density; extrapolated to saturation density it
is in the order of 60 and 130 MeV driven essentially by the condensates
<q-adjoint q>, <q-adjoint g sigma G q> and <q-bar q>. The genuine chiral
condensate <q-bar q>, amplified by heavy-quark masses, enters the Borel
transformed sum rules for the mass splitting beyond linear density dependence.
Including strange quark condensates reveals a umerically smaller and opposite
effect for the Ds - Ds-bar mass splitting.
