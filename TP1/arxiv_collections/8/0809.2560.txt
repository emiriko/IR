We prove the existence of minimizers for Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) energy
functionals with attractive two-body interactions given by Newtonian gravity.
This class of HFB functionals serves as model problem for self-gravitating
relativistic Fermi systems, which are found in neutron stars and white dwarfs.
Furthermore, we derive some fundamental properties of HFB minimizers such as a
decay estimate for the minimizing density. A decisive feature of the HFB model
in gravitational physics is its failure of weak lower semicontinuity. This fact
essentially complicates the analysis compared to the well-studied Hartree-Fock
theories in atomic physics.
