We use the Linear Sigma Model to test the convergence of different sequences
of Pade Approximants when used to unitarize the low energy pi-pi scattering
amplitude. We find that, in this particular case, diagonal sequences reproduce
the sigma pole with high accuracy, as opposed to other sequences that have been
discussed extensively.
