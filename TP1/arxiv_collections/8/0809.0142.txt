Usually reason of irreversibility in open quantum-mechanical system is
interaction with a thermal bath, consisting form infinite number of degrees of
freedom. Irreversibility in the system appears due to the averaging over all
possible realizations of the environment states. But, in case of open
quantum-mechanical system with few degrees of freedom situation is much more
complicated. Should one still expect irreversibility, if external perturbation
is just an adiabatic force without any random features? Problem is not clear
yet. This is main question we address in this review paper. We prove that key
point in the formation of irreversibility in chaotic quantum-mechanical systems
with few degrees of freedom, is the complicated structure of energy spectrum.
We shall consider quantum mechanical-system with parametrically dependent
energy spectrum. In particular, we study energy spectrum of the
Mathieu-Schrodinger equation. Structure of the spectrum is quite non-trivial,
consists from the domains of non-degenerated and degenerated stats, separated
from each other by branch points.
