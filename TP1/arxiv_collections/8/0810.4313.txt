By using the Cheng, Sher and Yuan's anzats, we study the light Higgs Boson
production associated with $b$ quark production at TEVATRON using the 2HDM type
III.
  We compare the simulations with experimental results coming from TEVATRON,
finding valid ranges for the $bb$ coupling. By using these results, we
calculate the cross section for the process $pp \to b\bar bh(b\bar b)$ for the
LHC collider.
