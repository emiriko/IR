A new approach for the description of phenomena of social aggregation is
suggested. On the basis of psychological concepts (as for instance social norms
and cultural coordinates), we deduce a general mechanism for the social
aggregation in which different clusters of individuals can merge according to
the cooperation among the agents. In their turn, the agents can cooperate or
defect according to the clusters distribution inside the system. The fitness of
an individual increases with the size of its cluster, but decreases with the
work the individual had to do in order to join it. In order to test the
reliability of such new approach, we introduce a couple of simple toy models
with the features illustrated above. We see, from this preliminary study, how
the cooperation is the most convenient strategy only in presence of very large
clusters, while on the other hand it is not necessary to have one hundred
percent of cooperators for reaching a totally ordered configuration with only
one megacluster filling the whole system.
