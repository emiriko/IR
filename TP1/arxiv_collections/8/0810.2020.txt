In a celebrated paper ([Phys. Rev. A 58, 883 (1998)]), K. Zyczkowski, P.
Horodecki, A. Sanpera,and M. Lewenstein proved for the frst time a very
interesting theorem that the volume of separable quantum states is nonzero.
Inspired by their ideas, we obtain a general analytical lower bound of the
volume of separable states (VOSS) for arbitrary N-dimensional system. Our
results give quite simple and computable suffcient conditions for separability.
Moreover, for bipartite system, an upper bound of the VOSS is also presented.
