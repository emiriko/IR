We study the Zeeman splitting in induced ballistic 1D quantum wires aligned
along the [233] and [011] axes of a high mobility (311)A undoped
heterostructure. Our data shows that the g-factor anisotropy for magnetic
fields applied along the high symmetry [011] direction can be explained by the
1D confinement only. However when the magnetic field is along [233] there is an
interplay between the 1D confinement and 2D crystal anisotropy. This is
highlighted for the [233] wire by an unusual non-monotonic behavior of the
g-factor as the wire is made narrower.
