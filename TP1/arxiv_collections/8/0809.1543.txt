Confined acoustic and optical phonons in Si nanoclusters embedded in
sapphire, synthesized using ion-beam implantation are investigated using Raman
spectroscopy. The l = 0 and l = 2 confined acoustic phonons, found at low Raman
shift, are analyzed using complex frequency model and the size of the
nanoparticles are estimated as 4 and 6 nm. For the confined optical phonon, in
contrast to expected red shift, the Raman line shape shows a substantial blue
shift, which is attributed to size dependent compressive stress in the
nanoparticles. The calculated Raman line shape for the stressed nanoparticles
fits well to data. The sizes of Si nanoparticles obtained using complex
frequency model are consistent with the size estimated from the fitting of
confined optical phonon line shapes and those found from X-ray diffraction and
TEM.
