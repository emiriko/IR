Brane world oscillations manifest themselves as massive vector gauge fields.
Their coupling to the Standard Model is deduced using the method of nonlinear
realizations of the spontaneously broken higher dimensional space-time
symmetries. Brane vectors are stable and weakly interacting, and therefore
escape particle detectors unnoticed. LEP and Tevatron data on the production of
a single photon in conjunction with missing energy are used to delineate
experimentally excluded regions of brane vector parameter space. The additional
region of parameter space accessible to the LHC as well as a future lepton
linear collider is also determined by means of this process.
