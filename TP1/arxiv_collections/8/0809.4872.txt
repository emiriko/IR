In this paper, we study the effects of the unparticles on the
parity-violating asymmetry for the low energy electron-electron scattering,
  $e^-e^-\to e^-e^-$. Using the data from the E158 experiment at SLAC we
extract the limits on the unparticle coupling $\lambda_{AV}$, and on the the
energy scale $\Lambda$ at 95% C.L. for various values of the scaling dimension
$d$.
