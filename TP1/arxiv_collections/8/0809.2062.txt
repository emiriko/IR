We study singlet and triplet correlation functions of static quark anti-quark
pair defined through gauge invariant time-like Wilson loops and Polyakov loop
correlators in finite temperature SU(2) gauge theory. We use the Luescher-Weisz
multilevel algorithm, which allows to calculate these correlators at very low
temperatures. We observe that the naive separation of singlet and triplet
states in general does not hold non-perturbatively, however, is recovered in
the limit of small separation and the temperature dependence of the
corresponding correlators is indeed very different.
