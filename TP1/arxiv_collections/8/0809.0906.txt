This paper concerns the reconstruction of the absorption and scattering
parameters in a time-dependent linear transport equation from full knowledge of
the albedo operator at the boundary of a bounded domain of interest. We present
optimal stability results on the reconstruction of the absorption and
scattering parameters for a given error in the measured albedo operator.
