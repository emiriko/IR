We consider heavy-quark energy loss and pT-broadening in a strongly-coupled
N=4 Super Yang Mills (SYM) plasma, and the problem of finite-extend matter is
addressed. When expressed in terms of the appropriate saturation momentum, one
finds identical parametric forms for the energy loss in pQCD and SYM theory,
while pT-broadening is radiation dominated in SYM theory and multiple
scattering dominated in pQCD.
