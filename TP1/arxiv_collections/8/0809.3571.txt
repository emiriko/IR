An integral part of spreadsheet auditing is navigation. For sufferers of
Repetitive Strain Injury who need to use voice recognition technology this
navigation can be highly problematic. To counter this the authors have
developed an intelligent voice navigation system, iVoice, which replicates
common spreadsheet auditing behaviours through simple voice commands. This
paper outlines the iVoice system and summarizes the results of a study to
evaluate iVoice when compared to a leading voice recognition technology.
