We critically review heavy quark mass effects in DIS and their impact on
global analyses. We lay out all elements of a properly defined general mass
variable flavor number scheme (GM VFNS) that are shared by all modern
formulations of the problem. We then explain the freedom in choosing specific
implementations and spell out, in particular, the current formulations of the
CTEQ and MSTW groups. We clarify the approximations in the still widely-used
zero mass variable flavor scheme (ZM VFNS), mention the inherent flaws in its
conventional implementation, and consider the possibility of mending some of
these flaws. We discuss practical issues concerning the use of parton
distributions in various physical applications, in view of the different
schemes. And we comment on the possible presence of intrinsic heavy flavors.
