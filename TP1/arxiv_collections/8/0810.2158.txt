In this note, we address the following question: Which 1-formal groups occur
as fundamental groups of both quasi-K\"ahler manifolds and closed, connected,
orientable 3-manifolds. We classify all such groups, at the level of Malcev
completions, and compute their coranks. Dropping the assumption on
realizability by 3-manifolds, we show that the corank equals the isotropy index
of the cup-product map in degree one. Finally, we examine the formality
properties of smooth affine surfaces and quasi-homogeneous isolated surface
singularities. In the latter case, we describe explicitly the
positive-dimensional components of the first characteristic variety for the
associated singularity link.
