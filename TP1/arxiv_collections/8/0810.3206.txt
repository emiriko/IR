We study one-dimensional itinerant electron models with ferromagnetic
coupling to investigate the origin of 0.7 anomaly in quantum point contacts.
Linear conductance calculations from the quantum Monte Carlo technique for spin
interactions of different spatial range suggest that $0.7(2e^{2}/h)$ anomaly
results from a strong interaction of low-density conduction electrons to
ferromagnetic fluctuations formed across the potential barrier. The conductance
plateau appears due to the strong incoherent scattering at high temperature
when the electron traversal time matches the time scale of dynamic
ferromagnetic excitations.
