It is often argued that entanglement is at the root of the speedup for
quantum compared to classical computation, and that one needs a sufficient
amount of entanglement for this speedup to be manifest. In measurement-based
quantum computing (MBQC), the need for a highly entangled initial state is
particularly obvious. Defying this intuition, we show that quantum states can
be too entangled to be useful for the purpose of computation. We prove that
this phenomenon occurs for a dramatic majority of all states: the fraction of
useful n-qubit pure states is less than exp(-n^2). Computational universality
is hence a rare property in quantum states. This work highlights a new aspect
of the question concerning the role entanglement plays for quantum
computational speed-ups. The statements remain true if one allows for certain
forms of post-selection and also cover the notion of CQ-universality. We
identify scale-invariant states resulting from a MERA construction as likely
candidates for physically relevant states subject to this effect.
