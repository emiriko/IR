The familiar Fock space commonly used to describe the relativistic harmonic
oscillator, for example as part of string theory, is insufficient to describe
all the states of the relativistic oscillator. We find that there are three
different vacua leading to three disconnected Fock sectors, all constructed
with the same creation-annihilation operators. These have different spacetime
geometric properties as well as different algebraic symmetry properties or
different quantum numbers. Two of these Fock spaces include negative norm
ghosts (as in string theory) while the third one is completely free of ghosts.
We discuss a gauge symmetry in a worldline theory approach that supplies
appropriate constraints to remove all the ghosts from all Fock sectors of the
single oscillator. The resulting ghost free quantum spectrum in d+1 dimensions
is then classified in unitary representations of the Lorentz group SO(d,1).
Moreover all states of the single oscillator put together make up a single
infinite dimensional unitary representation of a hidden global symmetry
SU(d,1), whose Casimir eigenvalues are computed. Possible applications of these
new results in string theory and other areas of physics and mathematics are
briefly mentioned.
