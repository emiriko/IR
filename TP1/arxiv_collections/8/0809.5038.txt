Experimental tests of Bell's inequality based on two-photon interferometry
consider only those coincidence events in which both photons arrive at the
detectors at the same time. In a recent paper, Cabello et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett.
102, 040401 (2009)] proposed a local model that is consistent with some aspects
of these experiments. It is shown here that the model proposed by Cabello et
al. is local but not realistic, and the role of post-selection in experiments
of this kind is discussed.
