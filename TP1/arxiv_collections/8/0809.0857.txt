"I have dealt with many different transformations with various periods of
time, but the quickest that I have met was my own transformation in one moment
from a physicist to a chemist."
  Ernest Rutherford (Nobel Banquet, 1908)
  This article is about how Ernest Rutherford (1871-1937) got the 1908 Nobel
Prize in Chemistry and why he did not get a second Prize for his subsequent
outstanding discoveries in physics, specially the discovery of the atomic
nucleus and the proton. Who were those who nominated him and who did he
nominate for the Nobel Prizes.
  In order to put the Prize issue into its proper context, I will briefly
describe Rutherford's whereabouts.
  Rutherford, an exceptionally gifted scientist who revolutionized chemistry
and physics, was moulded in the finest classical tradition. What were his
opinions on some scientific issues such as Einstein's photon, uncertainty
relations and the future prospects for atomic energy? What would he have said
about the "Theory of Everything"?
