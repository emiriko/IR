Dirac's method for constraints is used for solving the problem of exclusion
of double occupancy for Correlated Electrons. The constraints are enforced by
the pair operator
$Q(\vec{x})=\psi_{\downarrow}(\vec{x})\psi_{\uparrow}(\vec{x})$ which
annihilates the ground state $|\Psi^0>$. Away from half fillings the operator
$Q(\vec{x})$ is replaced by a set of $first$ $class$ Non-Abelian constraints
$Q^{(-)}_{\alpha}(\vec{x})$ restricted to negative energies. The propagator for
a single hole away from half fillings is determined by modified measure which
is a function of the time duration of the hole propagator. As a result: a) The
imaginary part of the self energy - is linear in the frequency. At large hole
concentrations a Fermi Liquid self energy is obtained. b) For the
Superconducting state the constraints generate an asymmetric spectrum
excitations between electrons and holes giving rise to an asymmetry tunneling
density of states.
