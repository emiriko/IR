In a previous work, we have given an explicit method to obtain irreducible
characters of finite Lie algebras without referring to Weyl character formula.
Irreducible characters of $G_2$ Lie algebra has been given as an example. The
work is now extended to somewhat more complicated case of $F_4$ Lie algebra, in
the same manner.
