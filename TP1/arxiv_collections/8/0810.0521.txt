The density fluctuations that we observe in the universe today are thought to
originate from quantum fluctuations produced during a phase of the early
universe called inflation. By evolving a wavefunction describing two coupled
Fourier modes of a scalar field forward through an inflationary epoch, we
demonstrate that non-linear effects can result in a generation of entanglement
entropy between modes with different momenta in a scalar field during the
inflationary period when just one of the modes is observed. Through this
mechanism, the field would experience decoherence and appear more like a
classical distribution today; however the mechanism is not sufficiently
efficient to explain classicality. We find that the amount of entanglement
entropy generated scales roughly as a power law S \propto \lambda^{1.75}, where
\lambda is the coupling coefficient of the non-linear potential term. We also
investigate how the entanglement entropy scales with the duration of inflation
and compare various entanglement measures from the literature with the von
Neumann entropy. This demonstration explicitly follows particle creation and
interactions between modes; consequently, the mechanism contributing to the
generation of the von Neumann entropy can be easily seen.
