After the completion of data taking at HERA-2, a large data set is at hand to
study the photoproduction of charm and beauty quarks in ep collisions. New
measurements of charm production based on D^* meson tagging and beauty
production based on muon and electron reconstruction test perturbative QCD
calculations with improved accuracy. In general, QCD calculations at NLO
describe the data well. The scale uncertainties are, however, large and
dominate over the experimental uncertainties, calling for more precise
calculations.
