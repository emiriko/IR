We have used high-resolution Extended X-ray Absorption Fine-Structure and
diffraction techniques to measure the local structure of strained
La$_{0.5}$Sr$_{0.5}$CoO$_3$ films under compression and tension. The lattice
mismatch strain in these compounds affects both the bond lengths and the bond
angles, though the larger effect on the bandwidth is due to the bond length
changes. The popular double exchange model for ferromagnetism in these
compounds provides a correct qualitative description of the changes in Curie
temperature $T_C$, but quantitatively underestimates the changes. A microscopic
model for ferromagnetism that provides a much stronger dependence on the
structural distortions is needed.
