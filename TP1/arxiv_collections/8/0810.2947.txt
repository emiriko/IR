In this paper we analyze theoretically how the introduction of the third
component into the two-dimensional photonic crystal influences the photonic
band structure and the density-of-states of the system. We consider the
periodic array of cylindrical air rods in a dielectric, and the third medium is
introduced as a ring-shaped intermediate layer between the air pores and the
dielectric background. Using the plane wave method, we have obtained the band
structures for the 2D triangular lattice photonic crystals. The dependencies of
TE and TM band gaps' widths and gaps' edges position on the interlayer
dielectric constant and interlayer thickness were analyzed. In the framework of
this approach, we have estimated the influence of the surface oxide layer on
the band structure of macroporous silicon. We observed the shift of the gaps'
edges to the higher or lower frequencies, depending on the interlayer thickness
and dielectric constant. We have shown that the existence of a native oxide
surface layer should be taken into consideration to understand the optical
properties of 2D photonic crystals, particularly in macroporous silicon
structures.
