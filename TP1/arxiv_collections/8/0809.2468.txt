In a recent study, (Jain et al 2007 Phys. Rev. Lett. 99 190601), a symmetric
exclusion process with time-dependent hopping rates was introduced. Using
simulations and a perturbation theory, it was shown that if the hopping rates
at two neighboring sites of a closed ring vary periodically in time and have a
relative phase difference, there is a net DC current which decreases inversely
with the system size. In this work, we simplify and generalize our earlier
treatment. We study a model where hopping rates at all sites vary periodically
in time, and show that for certain choices of relative phases, a DC current of
order unity can be obtained. Our results are obtained using a perturbation
theory in the amplitude of the time-dependent part of the hopping rate. We also
present results obtained in a sudden approximation that assumes large
modulation frequency.
