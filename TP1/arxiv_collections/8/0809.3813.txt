A unitary design is a collection of unitary matrices that approximate the
entire unitary group, much like a spherical design approximates the entire unit
sphere. In this paper, we use irreducible representations of the unitary group
to find a general lower bound on the size of a unitary t-design in U(d), for
any d and t. We also introduce the notion of a unitary code - a subset of U(d)
in which the trace inner product of any pair of matrices is restricted to only
a small number of distinct values - and give an upper bound for the size of a
code of degree s in U(d) for any d and s. These bounds can be strengthened when
the particular inner product values that occur in the code or design are known.
Finally, we describe some constructions of designs: we give an upper bound on
the size of the smallest weighted unitary t-design in U(d), and we catalogue
some t-designs that arise from finite groups.
