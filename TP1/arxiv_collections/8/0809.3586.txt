This paper provides guidance to an analyst who wants to extract insight from
a spreadsheet model. It discusses the terminology of spreadsheet analytics, how
to prepare a spreadsheet model for analysis, and a hierarchy of analytical
techniques. These techniques include sensitivity analysis, tornado charts,and
backsolving (or goal-seeking). This paper presents native-Excel approaches for
automating these techniques, and discusses add-ins that are even more
efficient. Spreadsheet optimization and spreadsheet Monte Carlo simulation are
briefly discussed. The paper concludes by calling for empirical research, and
describing desired features spreadsheet sensitivity analysis and spreadsheet
optimization add-ins.
