By employing the Stueckelberg formalism, we argue that the theory of massive
spin-2 field coupled to electromagnetism in flat space must have an intrinsic,
model independent, finite UV cutoff. We show how the very existence of a cutoff
has connection to other pathologies of the system, such as superluminal
propagation. We comment on the generalization of the results to arbitrary spin,
and to gravitational interaction.
