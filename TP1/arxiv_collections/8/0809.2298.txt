In this paper, we formulate an N=2 supersymmetric extension of a
hydrodynamic-type system involving Riemann invariants. The supersymmetric
version is constructed by means of a superspace and superfield formalism, using
bosonic superfields, and consists of a system of partial differential equations
involving both bosonic and fermionic variables. We make use of
group-theoretical methods in order to analyze the extended model algebraically.
Specifically, we calculate a Lie superalgebra of symmetries of our
supersymmetric model and make use of a general classification method to
classify the one-dimensional subalgebras into conjugacy classes. As a result we
obtain a set of 401 one-dimensional nonequivalent subalgebras. For selected
subalgebras, we use the symmetry reduction method applied to Grassmann-valued
equations in order to determine analytic exact solutions of our supersymmetric
model. These solutions include travelling waves, bumps, kinks, double-periodic
solutions and solutions involving exponentials and radicals.
