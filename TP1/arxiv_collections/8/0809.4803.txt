To investigate the role of information flow in group formation, we introduce
a model of communication and social navigation. We let agents gather
information in an idealized network society, and demonstrate that heterogeneous
groups can evolve without presuming that individuals have different interests.
In our scenario, individuals' access to global information is constrained by
local communication with the nearest neighbors on a dynamic network. The result
is reinforced interests among like-minded agents in modular networks; the flow
of information works as a glue that keeps individuals together. The model
explains group formation in terms of limited information access and highlights
global broadcasting of information as a way to counterbalance this
fragmentation. To illustrate how the information constraints imposed by the
communication structure affects future development of real-world systems, we
extrapolate dynamics from the topology of four social networks.
