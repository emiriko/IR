The resonance energies of strange dibaryons are investigated with the use of
the \bar{K}NN-\pi Y N coupled-channels Faddeev equation. It is found that the
pole positions of the predicted three-body amplitudes are significantly
modified when the three-body coupled-channels dynamics is approximated, as is
done in the literature, by the effective two-body \bar{K}N interactions.
