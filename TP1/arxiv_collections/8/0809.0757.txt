The article presents a local search approach for the solution of timetabling
problems in general, with a particular implementation for competition track 3
of the International Timetabling Competition 2007 (ITC 2007). The heuristic
search procedure is based on Threshold Accepting to overcome local optima. A
stochastic neighborhood is proposed and implemented, randomly removing and
reassigning events from the current solution.
  The overall concept has been incrementally obtained from a series of
experiments, which we describe in each (sub)section of the paper. In result, we
successfully derived a potential candidate solution approach for the finals of
track 3 of the ITC 2007.
