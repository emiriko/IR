A system reservoir model, where the associated reservoir is modulated by an
external colored random force, is proposed to study the transport of an
overdamped Brownian particle in a periodic potential. We then derive the
analytical expression for the average velocity, mobility, and diffusion rate.
The bistable kinetics and escape rate from a metastable state in the overdamped
region are studied consequently. By numerical simulation we then demonstrate
that our analytical escape rate is in good agreement with that of numerical
result.
