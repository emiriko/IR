We study zero-temperature Glauber dynamics on \Z^d, which is a dynamic
version of the Ising model of ferromagnetism. Spins are initially chosen
according to a Bernoulli distribution with density p, and then the states are
continuously (and randomly) updated according to the majority rule. This
corresponds to the sudden quenching of a ferromagnetic system at high
temperature with an external field, to one at zero temperature with no external
field. Define p_c(\Z^d) to be the infimum over p such that the system fixates
at '+' with probability 1. It is a folklore conjecture that p_c(\Z^d) = 1/2 for
every 2 \le d \in \N. We prove that p_c(\Z^d) \to 1/2 as d \to \infty.
