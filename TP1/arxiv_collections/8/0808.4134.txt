We introduce a new notion of graph sparsificaiton based on spectral
similarity of graph Laplacians: spectral sparsification requires that the
Laplacian quadratic form of the sparsifier approximate that of the original.
This is equivalent to saying that the Laplacian of the sparsifier is a good
preconditioner for the Laplacian of the original. We prove that every graph has
a spectral sparsifier of nearly linear size. Moreover, we present an algorithm
that produces spectral sparsifiers in time $\softO{m}$, where $m$ is the number
of edges in the original graph. This construction is a key component of a
nearly-linear time algorithm for solving linear equations in
diagonally-dominant matrcies. Our sparsification algorithm makes use of a
nearly-linear time algorithm for graph partitioning that satisfies a strong
guarantee: if the partition it outputs is very unbalanced, then the larger part
is contained in a subgraph of high conductance.
