We present a molecular dynamics based method for computing accurately
short-range structural forces resulting from the overlap of spatially diffuse
solid-liquid interfaces at wetted grain boundaries close to the melting point.
The method is based on monitoring the fluctuations of the liquid layer width at
different temperatures to extract the excess interfacial free-energy as a
function of this width. The method is illustrated for a high energy Sigma 9
twist boundary in pure Ni. The short-range repulsion driving premelting is
found to be dominant in comparison to long-range dispersion and entropic forces
and consistent with previous experimental findings that nanometer-scale layer
widths may only be observed very close to the melting point.
