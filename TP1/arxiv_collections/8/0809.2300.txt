We show that Markov couplings can be used to improve the accuracy of Markov
chain Monte Carlo calculations in some situations where the steady-state
probability distribution is not explicitly known. The technique generalizes the
notion of control variates from classical Monte Carlo integration. We
illustrate it using two models of nonequilibrium transport.
