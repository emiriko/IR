This paper presents CRESM, a novel collision resolution method for decoding
collided packets in random-access wireless networks. In a collision,
overlapping signals from several sources are received simultaneously at a
receiver. CRESM exploits symbol misalignment among the overlapping signals to
recover the individual packets. CRESM can be adopted in 802.11 networks without
modification of the transmitter design; only a simple DSP technique is needed
at the receiver to decode the overlapping signals. Our simulations indicate
that CRESM has better BER performance than the simplistic Successive
Interference Cancellation (SIC) technique that treats interference as noise,
for almost all SNR regimes. The implication of CRESM for random-access
networking is significant: in general, using CRESM to resolve collisions of up
to n packets, network throughput can be boosted by more than n times if the
transmitters are allowed to transmit more aggressively in the MAC protocol.
