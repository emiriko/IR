We review the di-hadron correlation results from RHIC. A consistent physical
picture was constructed based on the correlation landscape in $p_T$,
$\Delta\phi$, $\Delta\eta$ and particle species. We show that the data are
consistent with competition between fragmentation of survived jets and response
of the medium to quenched jets. At intermediate $p_T$ where the medium response
are important, a large fraction of trigger hadrons do not come from jet
fragmentation. We argue that these hadrons can strongly influence the
interpretation of the low $p_T$ correlation data. We demonstrate this point
through a simple geometrical jet absorption model simulation. The model shows
that the correlation between medium response hadrons dominates the pair yield
and mimics the double hump structure of the away-side $\Delta\phi$ distribution
at low $p_T$. This correlation was also shown to lead to complications in
interpreting the results on reaction plane dependence and three particle
correlations. Finally, we briefly discuss several experimental issues which are
important for proper interpretations of the experimental data.
