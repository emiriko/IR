We propose a microscopic mechanism for the incommensurate phase in TiOX
compounds. The model includes the antiferromagnetic chains of Ti ions immersed
in the phonon bath of the bilayer structure. Making use of the Cross-Fisher
theory, we show that the geometrically frustrated character of the lattice is
responsible for the structural instability which leads the chains to an
incommensurate phase without an applied magnetic field. In the case of TiOCl,
we show that our model is consistent with the measured phonon frequencies at
$T=300K$ and the value of the incommensuration vector at the transition
temperature. Moreover, we find that the dynamical structure factor shows a
progressive softening of an incommensurate phonon near the zone boundary as the
temperature decreases. This softening is accompanied by a broadening of the
peak which gets asymmetrical as well when going towards the transition
temperature. These features are in agreement with the experimental inelastic
X-ray measurements.
