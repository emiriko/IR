We consider the instability of bilayer graphene with respect to a distorted
configuration in the same spirit as the model introduced by Su, Schrieffer and
Heeger. By computing the total energy of a distorted bilayer, we conclude that
the ground state of the system favors a finite distortion. We explore how the
equilibrium configuration changes with carrier density and an applied potential
difference between the two layers.
