This document describes the communication language used in one multiagent
system environment for ecological simulations, based on EcoDynamo simulator
application linked with several intelligent agents and visualisation
applications, and extends the initial definition of the language. The agents
actions and perceptions are translated into messages exchanged with the
simulator application and other agents. The concepts and definitions used
follow the BNF notation (Backus et al. 1960) and is inspired in the Coach
Unilang language (Reis and Lau 2002).
