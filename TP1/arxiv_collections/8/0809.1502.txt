Capillary forces have been measured by Atomic Force Microscopy in the
plate-sphere setup between gold, borosilicate glass, GeSbTe, titanium, and UV
irradiated amorphous titaniumdioxide surfaces. The force measurements were
performed as a function contact time and surface roughness in the range 0.2 -
15 nm rms, and relative humidity ranging between 2 and 40 %. It is found that
even for the lowest attainable relative humidity 2 % very large capillary
forces are still present. The latter suggests the persistence of a nanometers
thick adsorbed water layer that acts as a capillary bridge between contacting
surfaces. Moreover, we found a significantly different scaling behavior of the
force with rms roughness for materials with different hydrophilicity as
compared to gold-gold surfaces.
