In standard measure theory the measure on the base set Omega is normalised to
one, which encodes the statement that "Omega happens". Moreover, the rules
imply that the measure of any subset A of Omega is strictly positive if and
only if A cannot be covered by a collection of subsets of zero measure. In
quantum measure theory on the other hand, simple examples suffice to
demonstrate that this is no longer true. We propose an appropriate
generalisation of a cover to quantum measure theory, the {\sl quantum cover},
which in addition to being a cover of A, satisfies the property that if every
one of its elements has zero quantum measure, then so does A. We show that a
large class of inextendible antichains in the associated powerset lattice
provide quantum covers for Omega, for a quantum measure that derives from a
strongly positive decoherence functional. Quantum covers, moreover, give us a
new perspective on the Peres-Kochen-Specker theorem and its role in the
anhomomorphic logic approach to quantum interpretation.
