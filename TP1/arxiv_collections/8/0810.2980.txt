Using a vortex sheet method we prove global existence of a near circular
initial bubble in a Hele-Shaw cell with surface tension and generally finite
nonzero viscosity ratio between fluids inside and outside the bubble. The
circular shape is shown to be asymptotically stable for all sufficiently smooth
small perturbation. The initial condition in this case, while smooth, need not
be analytic.
