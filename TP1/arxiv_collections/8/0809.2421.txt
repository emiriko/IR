This project describes the electricity demand and energy consumption
management system and its application to Southern Peru smelter. It is composed
of an hourly demand-forecasting module and of a simulation component for a
plant electrical system. The first module was done using dynamic neural
networks with backpropagation training algorithm; it is used to predict the
electric power demanded every hour, with an error percentage below of 1%. This
information allows efficient management of energy peak demands before this
happen, distributing the raise of electric load to other hours or improving
those equipments that increase the demand. The simulation module is based in
advanced estimation techniques, such as: parametric estimation, neural network
modeling, statistic regression and previously developed models, which simulates
the electric behavior of the smelter plant. These modules facilitate
electricity demand and consumption proper planning, because they allow knowing
the behavior of the hourly demand and the consumption patterns of the plant,
including the bill components, but also energy deficiencies and opportunities
for improvement, based on analysis of information about equipments, processes
and production plans, as well as maintenance programs. Finally the results of
its application in Southern Peru smelter are presented.
