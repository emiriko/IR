In this paper, we consider a complex-valued d-dimensional fractional Brownian
motion defined on the closure of the complex upper half-plane, called analytic
fractional Brownian motion. This process has been introduced by the second
author of the article, and both its real and imaginary parts, restricted on the
real axis, are usual fractional Brownian motions. The current note is devoted
to prove that a rough path based on the analytic fBm can be constructed for any
value of the Hurst parameter in (0,1/2). This allows in particular to solve
differential equations driven by this process in a neighborhood of 0 of the
complex upper half-plane, thanks to a variant of the usual rough path theory
due to Gubinelli.
