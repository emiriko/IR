The ATLAS and CMS experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) will soon
search for physics phenomena that are not predicted by the Standard Model.
Technicolor, Compositeness and GUT-based models are rich in high-pt leptons and
could be studied in such final states. This contribution shows studies that
indicate that a 5sigma discovery of a 500 GeV leptoquark could occur with 100
pb^-1 of integrated luminosity, Technicolor predicted particles could be seen
with 4 fb^-1 of integrated luminosity and, excited electron could be detected
with 300 fb^-1 of integrated luminosity.
