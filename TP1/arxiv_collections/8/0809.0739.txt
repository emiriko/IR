We propose a mathematical framework for the study of a family of random
fields--called forward performances--which arise as numerical representation of
certain rational preference relations in mathematical finance. Their spatial
structure corresponds to that of utility functions, while the temporal one
reflects a Nisio-type semigroup property, referred to as self-generation. In
the setting of semimartingale financial markets, we provide a dual formulation
of self-generation in addition to the original one, and show equivalence
between the two, thus giving a dual characterization of forward performances.
Then we focus on random fields with an exponential structure and provide
necessary and sufficient conditions for self-generation in that case. Finally,
we illustrate our methods in financial markets driven by It\^o-processes, where
we obtain an explicit parametrization of all exponential forward performances.
