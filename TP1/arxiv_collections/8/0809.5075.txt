We study rack polynomials and the link invariants they define. We show that
constant action racks are classified by their generalized rack polynomials and
show that $ns^at^a$-quandles are not classified by their generalized quandle
polynomials. We use subrack polynomials to define enhanced rack counting
invariants, generalizing the quandle polynomial invariants.
