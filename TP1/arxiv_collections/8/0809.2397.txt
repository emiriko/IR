Finite Unified Theories (FUTs) are N=1 supersymmetric Grand Unified Theories
that can be made all-loop finite, leading to a severe reduction of the free
parameters. We review the investigation of FUTs based on SU(5) in the context
of low-energy phenomenology observables. Using the restrictions from the top
and bottom quark masses, it is possible to discriminate between different
models. Including further low-energy constraints such as B-physics observables,
the bound on the lightest Higgs boson mass and the cold dark matter density, we
derive the predictions for the supersymmetric particle spectrum and the
prospects for discoveries at the LHC.
