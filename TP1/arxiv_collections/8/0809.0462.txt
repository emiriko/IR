We present a study of single-diffractive $W$-boson production in $pp$
collisions at $\sqrt{s}=14$ TeV, $pp \to Xp$ with $X$ including a $W$ boson,
with the CMS detector. We discuss the feasibility of observing this process
with an integrated effective luminosity for single interactions of 100
pb$^{-1}$.
