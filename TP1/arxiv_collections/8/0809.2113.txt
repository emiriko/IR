We report on progress in ion placement into silicon devices with scanning
probe alignment. The device is imaged with a scanning force microscope (SFM)
and an aligned argon beam (20 keV, 36 keV) is scanned over the transistor
surface. Holes in the lever of the SFM tip collimate the argon beam to sizes of
1.6 um and 100 nm in diameter. Ion impacts upset the channel current due to
formation of positive charges in the oxide areas. The induced changes in the
source-drain current are recorded in dependence of the ion beam position in
respect to the FinFET. Maps of local areas responding to the ion beam are
obtained.
