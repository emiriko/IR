We numerically determine the time dependence of the scale factor from the
lattice QCD equation of state, which can be used to define a QCD driven
cosmology. We compare a lattice approach to QCD cosmology at late times with
other models of the low temperature equation of state including the hadronic
resonance gas model, Hagedorn model and AdS/CFT.
