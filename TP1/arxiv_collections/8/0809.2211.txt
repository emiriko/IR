An integral representation of solutions of the wave equation as a
superposition of other solutions of this equation is built. The solutions from
a wide class can be used as building blocks for the representation.
Considerations are based on mathematical techniques of continuous wavelet
analysis. The formulas obtained are justified from the point of view of
distribution theory. A comparison of the results with those by G. Kaiser is
carried out. Methods of obtaining physical wavelets are discussed.
