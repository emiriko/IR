The additivity principle allows to compute the current distribution in many
one-dimensional (1D) nonequilibrium systems. Using simulations, we confirm this
conjecture in the 1D Kipnis-Marchioro-Presutti model of heat conduction for a
wide current interval. The current distribution shows both Gaussian and
non-Gaussian regimes, and obeys the Gallavotti-Cohen fluctuation theorem. We
verify the existence of a well-defined temperature profile associated to a
given current fluctuation. This profile is independent of the sign of the
current, and this symmetry extends to higher-order profiles and spatial
correlations. We also show that finite-time joint fluctuations of the current
and the profile are described by the additivity functional. These results
suggest the additivity hypothesis as a general and powerful tool to compute
current distributions in many nonequilibrium systems.
