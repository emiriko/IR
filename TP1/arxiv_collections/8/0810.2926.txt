Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0, let $R$ be a
commutative $k$-algebra, and let $M$ be a torsion free $R$-module of rank one
with a connection $\nabla$. We consider the Lie-Rinehart cohomology with values
in $End_{R}(M)$ with its induced connection, and give an interpretation of this
cohomology in terms of the integrable connections on $M$. When $R$ is an
isolated singularity of dimension $d\geq2$, we relate the Lie-Rinehart
cohomology to the topological cohomology of the link of the singularity, and
when $R$ is a quasi-homogenous hypersurface of dimension two, we give a
complete computation of the cohomology.
