We report on hyperthermia measurements on a colloidal solution of 15 nm
monodisperse FeCo nanoparticles (NPs). Losses as a function of the magnetic
field display a sharp increase followed by a plateau, which is what is expected
for losses of ferromagnetic single-domain NPs. The frequency dependence of the
coercive field is deduced from hyperthermia measurement and is in quantitative
agreement with a simple model of non-interacting NPs. The measured losses (1.5
mJ/g) compare to the highest of the literature, though the saturation
magnetization of the NPs is well below the bulk one.
