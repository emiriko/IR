We report magnetostatic measurements for granulated films
(CoFeB)$_{x}$-(SiO$_{2}$)$_{1-x}$ with fabrication induced intraplanar
anisotropy. The measurements have been performed in the film plane in the wide
temperature interval 4.5$\div$300 K. They demonstrate that above films have
low-temperature anomaly below the percolation threshold for conductivity. The
essence of the above peculiarity is that below 100 K the temperature dependence
of coercive field for magnetization along easy direction deviates strongly from
Neel-Brown law. At temperature lowering, the sharp increase of coercivity is
observed, accompanied by the appearance of coercive field for magnetization
along hard direction in the film plane. We establish that observed effect is
related to the properties of individual ferromagnetic granules. The effect
weakens as granules merge into conglomerates at $x$ higher then percolation
threshold and disappears completely at $x>1$. We explain the above effect as a
consequence of the difference in thermal expansion coefficients of granule and
cover material. At temperature lowering this difference weakens the envelopment
of an individual granule by the cover matrix material, thus permitting to
realize the spontaneous magnetostriction of a granule. The latter induces an
additional anisotropy with new easy axis of a granule magnetization along the
external magnetic field direction. Our explanation is tested and corroborated
by the ferromagnetic resonance measurements in the films at $T$ = 300 K and $T$
= 77 K.
