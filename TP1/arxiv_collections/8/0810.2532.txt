Exact analytical results for the dynamics of two interacting qubits each of
which is embedded in its own spin star bath are presented. The time evolution
of the concurrence and the purity of the two-qubit system is investigated for
finite and infinite numbers of environmental spins. The effect of qubit-qubit
interactions on the steady state of the central system is investigated
