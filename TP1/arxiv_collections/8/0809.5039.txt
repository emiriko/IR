We give a simple multiround strategy that permits to beat the shot noise
limit when performing interferometric measurements even in the presence of
loss. In terms of the average photon number employed, our procedure can achieve
twice the sensitivity of conventional interferometric ones in the noiseless
case. In addition, it is more precise than the (recently proposed) optimal
two-mode strategy even in the presence of loss.
