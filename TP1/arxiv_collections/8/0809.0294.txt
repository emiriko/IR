We show that the threshold of complete synchronization in a lattice of
coupled non-smooth chaotic maps is determined by linear stability along the
directions transversal to the synchronization subspace. As a result, the
numerically determined synchronization threshold agree with the analytical
results previously obtained [C. Anteneodo et al., Phys. Rev. E 68, 045202(R)
(2003)] for this class of systems. We present both careful numerical
experiments and a rigorous mathematical explanation confirming this fact,
allowing for a generalization involving hyperbolic coupled map lattices.
