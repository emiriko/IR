Modeling an anisotropic spatially and temporarily dispersive
magnetodielectric medium by two independent collections of three dimensional
vector fields, we demonstrate a fully canonical quantization of electromagnetic
field in the presence of such a medium. Two tensor fields which couple the
electromagnetic field with the medium and have an important role in this
quantization method are introduced. The electric and magnetic polarization
fields of the medium naturally are concluded in terms of the coupling tensors
and the dynamical variables modeling the magnetodielectric medium. In
Heisenberg picture, the constitutive equations of the medium together with the
Maxwell laws are obtained as the equations of motion of the total system and
the susceptibility tensors of the medium are calculated in terms of the
coupling tensors. Following a perturbation method the Green function related to
the total system is found and the time dependence of electromagnetic field
operators is derived.
