This paper is the first of two papers constructing a calculus of
pseudodifferential operators suitable for doing analysis on Q-rank 1 locally
symmetric spaces and Riemannian manifolds generalizing these. This
generalization is the interior of a manifold with boundary, where the boundary
has the structure of a tower of fibre bundles. The class of operators we
consider on such a space includes those arising naturally from metrics which
degenerate to various orders at the boundary, in directions given by the tower
of fibrations. As well as Q-rank 1 locally symmetric spaces, examples include
Ricci-flat metrics on the complement of a divisor in a smooth variety
constructed by Tian and Yau. In this first part of the calculus construction,
parametrices are found for "fully elliptic differential \bfa-operators", which
are uniformly elliptic operators on these manifolds that satisfy an additional
invertibility condition at infinity. In the second part we will consider
operators that do not satisfy this condition.
