We study the dynamic properties of a model for wetting with two competing
adsorbates on a planar substrate. The two species of particles have identical
properties and repel each other. Starting with a flat interface one observes
the formation of homogeneous droplets of the respective type separated by
nonwet regions where the interface remains pinned. The wet phase is
characterized by slow coarsening of competing droplets. Moreover, in 2+1
dimensions an additional line of continuous phase transition emerges in the
bound phase, which separates an unordered phase from an ordered one. The
symmetry under interchange of the particle types is spontaneously broken in
this region and finite systems exhibit two metastable states, each dominated by
one of the species. The critical properties of this transition are analyzed by
numeric simulations.
