The sensitivity of LeHC to different models of "new physics" has been
studied, both for the resonance production and in the contact interaction
approximation. Expected limits are compared for different running scenarios.
Direct leptoquark production can be studied for masses up to about 2 TeV. For
contact interaction models scales up to about 70 TeV can be explored.
Significant improvement of existing limits is also expected for models with
large extra dimensions. Effective Plank mass scales up to about 5.4 TeV can be
probed. LeHC will be sensitive to the quark substructure of the order of 1E-19
m.
