We investigated the series of temperature and field-driven transitions in
LuFe$_2$O$_4$ by optical and M\"{o}ssbauer spectroscopies, magnetization, and
x-ray scattering in order to understand the interplay between charge,
structure, and magnetism in this multiferroic material. We demonstrate that
charge fluctuation has an onset well below the charge ordering transition,
supporting the "order by fluctuation" mechanism for the development of charge
order superstructure. Bragg splitting and large magneto optical contrast
suggest a low temperature monoclinic distortion that can be driven by both
temperature and magnetic field.
