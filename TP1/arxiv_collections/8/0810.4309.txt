In this paper we propose an ansatz that applies to the slepton mass matrices.
In our approach these matrices contain a dominant sector that can be
diagonalized exactly. We study the numerical results for the slepton mass
eigenstates, looking for deviations from universality, which is usually assumed
when one evaluates the production of sleptons at future colliders.
