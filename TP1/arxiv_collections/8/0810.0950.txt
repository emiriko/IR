We study the average separation between an elastic solid and a hard solid
with a nominal flat but randomly rough surface, as a function of the squeezing
pressure. We present experimental results for a silicon rubber (PDMS) block
with a flat surface squeezed against an asphalt road surface. The theory shows
that an effective repulse pressure act between the surfaces of the form p
proportional to exp(-u/u0), where u is the average separation between the
surfaces and u0 a constant of order the root-mean-square roughness, in good
agreement with the experimental results.
