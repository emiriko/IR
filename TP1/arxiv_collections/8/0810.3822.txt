External injection of electron bunches longer than the plasma wavelength in a
laser wakefield accelerator can lead to the generation of femtosecond
ultrarelativistic bunches with a couple of percent energy spread. Extensive
study has been done on external electron bunch (e.g. one generated by a
photo-cathode rf linac) injection in a laser wakefield for different
configurations. In this paper we investigate a new way of external injection
where the electron bunch is injected at a small angle into the wakefield. This
way one can avoid the ponderomotive scattering as well as the vacuum-plasma
transition region, which tend to destroy the injected bunch. In our
simulations, the effect of the laser pulse dynamics is also taken into account.
It is shown that injection at an angle can provide compressed and accelerated
electron bunches with less than 2% energy spread. Another advantage of this
scheme is that it has less stringent requirements in terms of the size of the
injected bunch and there is the potential to trap more charge.
