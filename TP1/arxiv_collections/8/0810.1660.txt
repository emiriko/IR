It is shown how to introduce a geometric description of the algebraic
approach to the non-relativistic quantum mechanics. It turns out that the GNS
representation provides not only symplectic but also Hermitian realization of a
`quantum Poisson algebra'. We discuss alternative Hamiltonian structures
emerging out of different GNS representations which provide a natural setting
for quantum bi-Hamiltonian systems.
