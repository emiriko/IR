Vortex trapping is investigated in thin-film strips of superconducting
material. We present a model for the critical field above which vortex trapping
occurs in these strips. This model includes the pairing energy of
vortex-antivortex pairs in addition to the energy of single vortices.
Experimental verification of the model with a scanning SQUID microscope shows
very good agreement between the model and experiments on YBa2Cu3O7-delta and Nb
strips. Statistical analysis of the vortex distribution in the strips above the
critical field has been performed and a comparison has been made between Nb and
YBa2Cu3O7-delta for the distributions in the lateral and longitudinal
directions.
