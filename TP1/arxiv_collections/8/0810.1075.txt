We show that baryon-like operators exist in the N=6 superconformal
Chern-Simons-matter theory constructed by Aharony, Bergman, Jafferis and
Maldacena (ABJM). This involves the introduction of Wilson(or 't Hooft) lines
ending on baryon-like operators and we show that the presence of such lines
cannot be detected by the fields in the theory. The same construction can be
used to make magnetic monopoles charged under the diagonal U(1) gauge group
with arbitrary non-integral charge. If we do not include such monopole
configurations in the path integral, the moduli space is known to be given by
the symmetric N copies of C^4/Z_k. However, if we allow for such monopole
configurations, the flux quantization conditions change so that we do not have
a discrete gauge symmetry and effectively the (SU(N)xSU(N))/Z_N gauge theory
remains. We discuss the possibility of the level-rank duality of the theory.
