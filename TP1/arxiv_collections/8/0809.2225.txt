Evidence of spin precession and dephasing ("Hanle effect") induced by an
external magnetic field is the only unequivocal proof of spin-polarized
conduction electron transport in semiconductor devices. However, when spin
dephasing is very strong, Hanle effect in a uniaxial magnetic field can be
impossible to measure. Using a Silicon device with lateral injector-detector
separation over 2 millimeters, and geometrically-induced dephasing making spin
transport completely incoherent, we show experimentally and theoretically that
Hanle effect can still be measured using a two-axis magnetic field.
