A level-set method is developed for numerically capturing the equilibrium
solute-solvent interface that is defined by the recently proposed variational
implicit solvent model (Dzubiella, Swanson, and McCammon, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf
104}, 527 (2006) and J. Chem.\Phys. {\bf 124}, 084905 (2006)). In the level-set
method, a possible solute-solvent interface is represented by the zero
level-set (i.e., the zero level surface) of a level-set function and is
eventually evolved into the equilibrium solute-solvent interface. The evolution
law is determined by minimization of a solvation free energy {\it functional}
that couples both the interfacial energy and the van der Waals type
solute-solvent interaction energy. The surface evolution is thus an energy
minimizing process, and the equilibrium solute-solvent interface is an output
of this process. The method is implemented and applied to the solvation of
nonpolar molecules such as two xenon atoms, two parallel paraffin plates,
helical alkane chains, and a single fullerene $C_{60}$. The level-set solutions
show good agreement for the solvation energies when compared to available
molecular dynamics simulations. In particular, the method captures solvent
dewetting (nanobubble formation) and quantitatively describes the interaction
in the strongly hydrophobic plate system.
