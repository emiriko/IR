The design of error-correcting codes used in modern communications relies on
information theory to quantify the capacity of a noisy channel to send
information [1]. This capacity can be expressed using the mutual information
between input and output for a single use of the channel: although correlations
between subsequent input bits are used to correct errors, they cannot increase
the capacity. For quantum channels, it has been an open question whether
entangled input states can increase the capacity to send classical information
[2]. The additivity conjecture [3,4] states that entanglement does not help,
making practical computations of the capacity possible. While additivity is
widely believed to be true, there is no proof. Here we show that additivity is
false, by constructing a random counter-example. Our results show that the most
basic question of classical capacity of a quantum channel remains open, with
further work needed to determine in which other situations entanglement can
boost capacity.
