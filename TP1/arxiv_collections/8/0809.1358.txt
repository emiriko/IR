Detailed analysis of transport, magnetism and x-ray absorption spectroscopy
measurements on ultrathin La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 films with thicknesses from 3 to 70
unit cells resulted in the identification of a lower critical thickness for a
non-metallic, non-ferromagnetic layer at the interface with the SrTiO3 (001)
substrate of only 3 unit cells (~12 Angstrom). Furthermore, linear dichroism
measurements demonstrate the presence of a preferred (x2-y2) in-plane orbital
ordering for all layer thicknesses without any orbital reconstruction at the
interface. A crucial requirement for the accurate study of these ultrathin
films is a controlled growth process, offering the coexistence of
layer-by-layer growth and bulk-like magnetic/transport properties.
