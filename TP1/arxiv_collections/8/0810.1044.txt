We calculated the electroweak contributions to the hadronic production of a
squark in association with a gluino within the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard
Model (MSSM). Presented are complete next-to-leading order electroweak (NLO EW)
corrections at O(alpha_s^2 alpha), which include real photon and real quark
radiation processes. Also considered are photon induced tree level O(alpha_s
alpha) contributions.
