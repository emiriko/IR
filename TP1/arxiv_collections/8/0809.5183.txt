The CRESST (Cryogenic Rare Event Search with Superconducting Thermometers)
and the EURECA (European Underground Rare Event Calorimeter Array) experiments
are direct dark matter search experiments where cryogenic detectors are used to
detect spin-independent, coherent WIMP (Weakly Interacting Massive
Particle)-nucleon scattering events by means of the recoil energy. The
cryogenic detectors use a massive single crystal as absorber which is equipped
with a TES (transition edge sensor) for signal read-out. They are operated at
mK-temperatures. In order to enable a mass production of these detectors, as
needed for the EURECA experiment, a so-called composite detector design (CDD)
that allows decoupling of the TES fabrication from the optimization procedure
of the absorber single-crystal was developed and studied. To further
investigate, understand and optimize the performance of composite detectors a
detailed thermal detector model which takes into account the CDD has been
developed.
