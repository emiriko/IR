We investigate a Quantum Dot (QD) in a Carbon Nanotube (CNT) in the regime
where the QD is nearly isolated from the leads. An aluminum single electron
transistor (SET) serves as a charge detector for the QD. We precisely measure
and tune the tunnel rates into the QD in the range between 1 kHz and 1 Hz,
using both pulse spectroscopy and real - time charge detection and measure the
excitation spectrum of the isolated QD.
