We report high-sensitivity microwave measurements of the in-plane penetration
depth $\lambda_{ab}$ and quasiparticle scattering rate $1/\tau$ in several
single crystals of hole-doped Fe-based superconductor
Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$ ($x\approx 0.55$). While power-law temperature
dependence of $\lambda_{ab}$ with the power $\sim 2$ is found in crystals with
large $1/\tau$, we observe exponential temperature dependence of superfluid
density consistent with the existence of fully opened two gaps in the cleanest
crystal we studied. The difference may be a consequence of different level of
disorder inherent in the crystals. We also find a linear relation between the
low-temperature scattering rate and the density of quasiparticles, which shows
a clear contrast to the case of d-wave cuprate superconductors with nodes in
the gap. These results demonstrate intrinsically nodeless order parameters in
the Fe-arsenides.
