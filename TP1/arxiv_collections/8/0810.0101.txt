In this contribution it is shown how closed formulas for anomalous dimensions
of two classes of operators in N=4 SYM can be derived, either by investigating
the numerics or on the basis of QCD-inspired assumptions. We discuss the case
of twist three "gauge" operators in which a complete proof of reciprocity can
be carried out.
