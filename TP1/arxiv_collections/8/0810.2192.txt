I review the formalism for gauge-field perturbation theory in noncovariant
gauges, particularly the temporal axial gauge. I show that, even at zero
temperature, there are complications and it is not known whether a formalism
exists for handling these that is correct for all calculations. For thermal
field theory in the imaginary time formalism, there are different difficulties,
whose solution so far is known only up to lowest order in the coupling $g$.
