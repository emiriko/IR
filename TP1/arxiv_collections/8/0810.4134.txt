We present the best constant and the existence of extremal functions for an
Improved Hardy-Sobolev inequality. We prove that, under a proper
transformation, this inequality is equivalent to the Sobolev inequality in
$\mathbb{R}^N$. We also discuss the connection of the related functional spaces
and as a result we obtain some Caffarelli - Kohn - Nirenberg inequalities. Our
starting point is the existence of a minimizer for the Bliss' inequality and
the indirect dependence of the Hardy inequality at the origin.
