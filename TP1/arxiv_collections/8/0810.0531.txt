In this contribution, we calculate the spin-dependent ballistic and coherent
transport through epitaxial Fe/ZnSe (001) simple and double magnetic tunnel
junctions with two different interface terminations: Zn-terminated and
Se-terminated. The electronic structure of the junctions is modeled by a
second-nearest neighbors {\it spd} tight-binding Hamiltonian parametrized to
{\it ab initio} calculated band structures, while the conductances and the
tunneling magnetoresistance are calculated within Landauer's formalism. The
calculations are done at zero bias voltage and as a function of energy. We show
and discuss the influence of the interface structure on the spin-dependent
transport through simple and double tunnel junctions.
