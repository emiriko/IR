We present time-resolved charge sensing measurements on a GaAs double quantum
dot with two proximal quantum point contact (QPC) detectors. The QPC currents
are analyzed with cross-correlation techniques, which enables us to measure dot
charging and discharging rates for significantly smaller signal-to-noise ratios
than required for charge detection with a single QPC. This allows to reduce the
current level in the detector and therefore the invasiveness of the detection
process and may help to increase the available measurement bandwidth in
noise-limited setups.
