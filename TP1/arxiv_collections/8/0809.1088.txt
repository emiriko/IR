We generalize the Manolescu-Owens smooth concordance invariant delta(K) of
knots K in the 3-sphere to invariants delta_{p^n}(K) obtained by considering
covers of order p^n, with p prime. Our main result shows that for any odd prime
p, the direct sum of delta_{p^n} as n ranges through the natural numbers,
yields a homomorphism of infinite rank from the smooth concordance group to
Z^\infty. We also show that unlike delta, these new invariants typically are
not multiples of the knot signature, even for alternating knots. A significant
portion of the article is devoted to exploring examples.
