We establish a connection between the quark model and the 1/N_c expansion
mass formulas used in the description of baryon resonances. We show that a
remarkable compatibility exists between the two methods in the light and heavy
baryon sectors. In particular, the band number used to classify baryons in the
1/N_c expansion is explained by the quark model and the mass formulas for both
approaches are consistent.
