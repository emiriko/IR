We review the asymptotic safety scenario for quantum gravity and the role and
implications of an underlying ultraviolet fixed point. We discuss
renormalisation group techniques employed in the fixed point search, analyse
the main picture at the example of the Einstein-Hilbert theory, and provide an
overview of the key results in four and higher dimensions. We also compare
findings with recent lattice simulations and evaluate phenomenological
implications for collider experiments.
