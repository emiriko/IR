We study experimentally and theoretically the probability density functions
of the injected and dissipated energy in a system of a colloidal particle
trapped in a double well potential periodically modulated by an external
perturbation. The work done by the external force and the dissipated energy are
measured close to the stochastic resonance where the injected power is maximum.
We show a good agreement between the probability density functions exactly
computed from a Langevin dynamics and the measured ones. The probability
density function of the work done on the particle satisfies the fluctuation
theorem.
