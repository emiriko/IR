Work by the Zurich school of causal (Epstein-Glaser) renormalization has
shown that renormalizability in the presence of massless or massive gauge
fields (as primary entities) explains gauge invariance and, in some instances,
the presence of a Higgs-like particle, without the Brout-Englert-Higgs-Kibble
(BEHK) mechanism. We review that work, in a pedagogical vein, with a pointer to
go beyond.
