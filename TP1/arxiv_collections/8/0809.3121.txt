In recent years the theory of border collision bifurcations has been
developed for piecewise smooth maps that are continuous across the border, and
has been successfully applied to explain nonsmooth bifurcation phenomena in
physical systems. However, many switching dynamical systems have been found to
yield two-dimensional piecewise smooth maps that are discontinuous across the
border. The theory for understanding the bifurcation phenomena in such systems
is not available yet. In this paper we present the first approach to the
problem of analysing and classifying the bifurcation phenomena in
two-dimensional discontinuous maps, based on a piecewise linear approximation
in the neighborhood of the border. We explain the bifurcations occurring in the
static VAR compensator used in electrical power systems, using the theory
developed in this paper. This theory may be applied similarly to other systems
that yield two-dimensional discontinuous maps.
