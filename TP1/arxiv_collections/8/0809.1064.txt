The state of a microscopic system encodes its complete quantum description,
from which the probabilities of all measurement outcomes are inferred. Being a
statistical concept, the state cannot be obtained from a single system
realization. It can be reconstructed from an ensemble of copies, by performing
measurements on different realizations. Reconstructing the state of a set of
trapped particles shielded from their environment is an important step for the
investigation of the quantum to classical boundary. While trapped atom state
reconstructions have been achieved, it is challenging to perform similar
experiments with trapped photons which require cavities storing light for very
long times. Here, we report the complete reconstruction and pictorial
representation of a variety of radiation states trapped in a cavity in which
several photons survive long enough to be repeatedly measured. Information is
extracted from the field by atoms crossing the cavity one by one. We exhibit a
gallery of pictures featuring coherent states, Fock states with a definite
photon number and Schrodinger cat states which are superpositions of coherent
states with different phases. These states are equivalently represented by
their density matrices in the photon-number basis or by their Wigner functions,
which are distributions of the field complex amplitude. Quasi-classical
coherent states have a Gaussian-shaped Wigner function while Fock and
Schrodinger cat Wigner functions show oscillations and negativities revealing
quantum interferences. Cavity damping induces decoherence which quickly washes
out the Wigner functions oscillations. We observe this process and realize
movies of decoherence by reconstructing snapshots of Schrodinger cat states at
successive times.
