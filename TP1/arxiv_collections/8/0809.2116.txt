We study basins of attraction of automorphisms of $\CC^2$ tangent to the
identity that fix both axes. Our main result is that, if a well known
conjecture about automorphisms of $\CC^*\times\CC^*$ holds, then there are no
basins of attraction associated to the non-degenerate characteristic directions
(in the sense of Hakim), and therefore we cannot find a Fatou-Bieberbach domain
that does not intersect both axis with this method.
