In this work we study the Dirac quasinormal modes of higher dimensional
charged black holes. Higher dimensional Reissner-N\"{o}rdstrom type black holes
as well as charged black holes in Einstein Gauss-Bonnet theories are studied
for Fermionic perturbations using WKB method. A comparative study of the
quasinormal modes in the two different theories of gravity has been performed.
The beahviour of the frequencies with the variation of black hole parameters as
well as with the variation of spacetime dimensions are done. We also study the
large multipole number limit of the black hole potential in order to look for
an analytic expression for the frequencies.
