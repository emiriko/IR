We construct all solvable Lie algebras with a specific n-dimensional
nilradical n_(n,2) (of degree of nilpotency (n-1) and with an (n-2)-dimensional
maximal Abelian ideal). We find that for given n such a solvable algebra is
unique up to isomorphisms. Using the method of moving frames we construct a
basis for the Casimir invariants of the nilradical n_(n,2). We also construct a
basis for the generalized Casimir invariants of its solvable extension s_(n+1)
consisting entirely of rational functions of the chosen invariants of the
nilradical.
