This thesis poses a selection of recent research of the author in a common
context. It starts with a selected review on research concerning the role
entanglement might play at quantum phase transitions and introduces measures
for entanglement used for this analysis. A selection of results from this
research is given and proposed as evidence for the relevance of multipartite
entanglement in this context. A constructive method for an SLOCC classification
and quantification of multipartite qubit entanglement is outlined and results
for convex roof extensions of the resulting measures are briefly discussed on a
specific example. At the end, a transformation of antilinear expectation values
into linear expectation values is presented which admits an expression of the
aforementioned measures of genuine multipartite entanglement in terms of spin
correlation function, hence making them experimentally accessible.
