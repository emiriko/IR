The animation of network visualizations poses technical and theoretical
challenges. Rather stable patterns are required before the mental map enables a
user to make inferences over time. In order to enhance stability, we developed
an extension of stress-minimization with developments over time. This dynamic
layouter is no longer based on linear interpolation between independent static
visualizations, but change over time is used as a parameter in the
optimization. Because of our focus on structural change versus stability the
attention is shifted from the relational graph to the latent eigenvectors of
matrices. The approach is illustrated with animations for the journal citation
environments of Social Networks, the (co-)author networks in the carrying
community of this journal, and the topical development using relations among
its title words. Our results are also compared with animations based on
PajekToSVGAnim and SoNIA.
