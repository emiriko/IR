We study the Cox realization of an affine variety, i.e., a canonical
representation of a normal affine variety with finitely generated divisor class
group as a quotient of a factorially graded affine variety by an action of the
Neron-Severi quasitorus. The realization is described explicitly for the
quotient space of a linear action of a finite group. A universal property of
this realization is proved, and some results on the divisor theory of an
abstract semigroup emerging in this context are given. We show that each
automorphism of an affine variety can be lifted to an automorphism of the Cox
ring normalizing the grading. It follows that the automorphism group of a
non-degenerate affine toric variety of dimension $\geq 2$ has infinite
dimension. We obtain a wild automorphism of the three-dimensional quadratic
cone that rises to Anick's automorphism of the polynomial algebra in four
variables.
