We study the three point genus zero Gromov-Witten invariants on the
Grassmannians which parametrize non-maximal isotropic subspaces in a vector
space equipped with a nondegenerate symmetric or skew-symmetric form. We
establish Pieri rules for the classical cohomology and the small quantum
cohomology ring of these varieties, which give a combinatorial formula for the
product of any Schubert class with certain special Schubert classes. We also
give presentations of these rings, with integer coefficients, in terms of
special Schubert class generators and relations.
