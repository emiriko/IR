Climate exhibits a vast range of dissipative structures. Some have
characteristic times of a few days; others evolve on thousands of years. All
these structures are interdependent; in other words, they communicate. It is
often considered that the only way to cope with climate complexity is to
integrate the equations of atmospheric and oceanic motion with the finer
possible mesh. Is this the sole strategy? Aren't we missing another
characteristic of the climate system: its ability to destroy and generate
information at the macroscopic scale? Paleoclimatologists consider that much of
this information is present in palaeoclimate archives. It is therefore natural
to build climate models such as to get the most of these archives. The strategy
proposed here is based on Bayesian statistics and low-order non-linear
dynamical systems, in a modelling approach that explicitly includes the effects
of uncertainties. Its practical interest is illustrated through the problem of
the timing of the next great glaciation. Is glacial inception overdue, or do we
need to wait for another 50,000 years before ice caps grow again? Our results
indicate a glaciation inception in 50,000 years.
