Following the observation of an anomalous Nernst signal in cuprates, the
Nernst effect was explored in a variety of metals and superconductors during
the past few years. This paper reviews the results obtained during this
exploration, focusing on the Nernst response of normal quasi-particles as
opposed to the one generated by superconducting vortices or by short-lived
Cooper pairs. Contrary to what has been often assumed, the so-called Sondheimer
cancelation does not imply a negligible Nernst response in a Fermi liquid. In
fact, the amplitude of the Nernst response measured in various metals in the
low-temperature limit is scattered over six orders of magnitude. According to
the data, this amplitude is roughly set by the ratio of electron mobility to
Fermi energy in agreement with the implications of the semi-classical transport
theory.
