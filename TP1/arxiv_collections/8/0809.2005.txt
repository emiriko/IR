The state of art in the theoretical and experimental studies of transition
metal doped oxides (dilute magnetic dielectrics) is reviewed. The available
data show that the generic non-equilibrium state of oxide films doped with
magnetic impurities may either favor ferromagnetism with high Curie temperature
or result in highly inhomogeneous state without long-range magnetic order. In
both case concomitant defects (vacancies, interstitial ions play crucial part.
