In a series of papers, cited in the main body of the paper below, detailed
calculations have been presented which show that electromagnetic and weak
interactions can induce low energy nuclear reactions to occur with observable
rates for a variety of processes. A common element in all these applications is
that the electromagnetic energy stored in many relatively slow moving electrons
can -under appropriate circumstances- be collectively transferred into fewer,
much faster electrons with energies sufficient for the latter to combine with
protons (or deuterons, if present) to produce neutrons via weak interactions.
The produced neutrons can then initiate low energy nuclear reactions through
further nuclear transmutations. The aim of this paper is to extend and enlarge
upon various examples analyzed previously, present simplified order of
magnitude estimates for each and to illuminate a common unifying theme amongst
all of them.
