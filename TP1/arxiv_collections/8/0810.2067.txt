This paper deals with products of moderate-size primes, familiarly known as
smooth numbers. Smooth numbers play a crucial role in information theory,
signal processing and cryptography.
  We present various properties of smooth numbers relating to their
enumeration, distribution and occurrence in various integer sequences. We then
turn our attention to cryptographic applications in which smooth numbers play a
pivotal role.
