We predict the branching ratios of the lepton flavor violating Higgs decays
H^0->e^{\pm} \mu^{\pm}, H^0-> e^{\pm} \tau^{\pm} and H^0->\mu^{\pm} \tau^{\pm}
in the case that the lepton flavor violation is carried by the scalar
unparticle mediation. We observe that their branching ratios are strongly
sensitive to the unparticle scaling dimension and they can reach to the values
of the order of $10^{-4}$, for the heavy lepton flavor case and for the small
values of the scaling dimension.
