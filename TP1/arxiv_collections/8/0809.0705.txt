We derive constraints on the mass insertion parameters from the recent
measurements of B_s - B_s bar mixing, and discuss their implications on SUSY
breaking mediation mechanisms and SUSY flavor models. Some SUSY flavor models
are already excluded or disfavored by B_s - B_s bar mixing. We also discuss how
to test the SM and SUSY models in the future experiments, by studying other CP
violating observables related to b -> s transition, such as the time-dependent
CP asymmetry in B -> phi K_S and the direct CP asymmetry in B -> X_s gamma.
