The principal aim of this Comment is to correct those entropic uncertainty
relations that are presented in a paper by Massar [arXiv:quant-ph/0703036v2
(current version)], concerning two approaches to a study of the noise produced
by POVM's. It is next emphasized that the first of the entropic bounds for POVM
obtained by the above author has been already presented in Ref. [8]. Some
exposition obscurity with equation (14) of the commented paper is elucidated.
Finally, some more specific remarks on the paper content are given.
