Schroedinger investigated entanglement in two-particle state vectors by
assuming measurement finding out if the nearby particle is in a given state
vector or not. Without interaction with the distant particle, just on account
of the entanglement, the distant particle is steered into a certain state
vector. In Schroedinger's finite-dimensional case thus any distant-particle
state vector can be reached. This theory was extended to infinite-dimensional
spaces by the author. The present article completes the extension by throwing
light on the fine structure of steering.
