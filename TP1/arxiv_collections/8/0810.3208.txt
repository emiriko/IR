In this note a study of hadronic event shapes in QCD events at the Large
Hadron Collider (LHC) is presented. Calorimetric jet momenta, determined by
various jet clustering algorithms, are used as input for calculating various
event-shape variables which probe the structure of the hadronic final state. It
is shown that the normalized event-shape distributions are robust under
variations of the jet energy scale and resolution effects, which makes them
particularly suitable for early data analysis and tuning of Monte Carlo models.
