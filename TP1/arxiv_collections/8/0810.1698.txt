The observation of the strong suppression of high pT hadrons in heavy ion
collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at BNL has motivated a
large experimental program using hard probes to characterize the deconfined
medium created. However what can be denoted as ``leading particle physics''
accessible at RHIC presents some limitations which motivate at higher energy
the study of much more penetrating objects: jets. The gain in center of mass
energy expected at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN will definitively
improve our understanding on how the energy is lost in the system opening a new
major window of study: the physics of jets on an event-by-event basis. We will
concentrate on the expected performance for jet reconstruction in ALICE using
the EMCal calorimeter.
