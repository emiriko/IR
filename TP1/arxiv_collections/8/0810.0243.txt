We consider static massive thin cylindrical shells (tubes) as the sources in
Einstein's equations. They correspond to $\dl$- and $\dl'$-function type
energy-momentum tensors. The corresponding metric components are found
explicitly. They are not continuous functions in general and lead to ambiguous
curvature tensor components. Nevertheless all ambiguous terms in Einstein's
equations safely cancel. The interplay between elasticity theory, geometric
theory of defects, and General Relativity is analyzed. The elasticity theory
provides a simple picture for defects creation and a new look on General
Relativity.
