The understanding of dynamics and functioning of biological membranes and in
particular of membrane embedded proteins is one of the most fundamental
problems and challenges in modern biology and biophysics. In particular the
impact of membrane composition and properties and of structure and dynamics of
the surrounding hydration water on protein function is an upcoming hot topic,
which can be addressed by modern experimental and computational techniques.
Correlated molecular motions might play a crucial role for the understanding
of, for instance, transport processes and elastic properties, and might be
relevant for protein function. Experimentally that involves determining
dispersion relations for the different molecular components, i.e., the length
scale dependent excitation frequencies and relaxation rates. Only very few
experimental techniques can access dynamical properties in biological materials
on the nanometer scale, and resolve dynamics of lipid molecules, hydration
water molecules and proteins and the interaction between them. In this context,
inelastic neutron scattering turned out to be a very powerful tool to study
dynamics and interactions in biomolecular materials up to relevant nanosecond
time scales and down to the nanometer length scale. We review and discuss
inelastic neutron scattering experiments to study membrane elasticity and
protein-protein interactions of membrane embedded proteins.
