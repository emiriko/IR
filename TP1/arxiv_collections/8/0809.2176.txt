We study lattice formulations of the two-dimensional N=2 Wess-Zumino model
with a cubic superpotential. Discretizations with and without lattice
supersymmetries are compared. We observe that the "Nicolai improvement"
introduces new problems to simulations of the supersymmetric model. With high
statistics we check the degeneracy of bosonic and fermionic masses on the
lattice. Perturbative mass corrections to one-loop order are compared with
continuum extrapolations of our lattice results in the weakly coupled regime.
For intermediate couplings first results of fermionic masses in the continuum
are presented where deviations from the perturbative result are observed.
