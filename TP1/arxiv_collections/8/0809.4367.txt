The main characters of this paper are the moduli spaces $TM_{g,n}$ of
rational tropical curves of genus $g$ with $n$ marked points, with $g\geq 2$.
We reduce the study of the homotopy type of these spaces to the analysis of
compact spaces $X_{g,n}$, which in turn possess natural representations as a
homotopy colimits of diagrams of topological spaces over combinatorially
defined generalized simplicial complexes $\Delta_g$, with the latter being
interesting on their own right.
  We use these homotopy colimit representations to describe a CW complex
decomposition for each $X_{g,n}$. Furthermore, we use these developments,
coupled with some standard tools for working with homotopy colimits, to perform
an in-depth analysis of special cases of genus 2 and 3, gaining a complete
understanding of the moduli spaces $X_{2,0}$, $X_{2,1}$, $X_{2,2}$, and
$X_{3,0}$, as well as a partial understanding of other cases, resulting in
several open questions and in further conjectures.
