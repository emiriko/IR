Using recent results obtained within the hidden gauge formalism for vector
mesons, in which the $f_0(1370)$ and $f_2(1270)$ resonances are dynamically
generated resonances from the $\rho \rho$ interaction, we evaluate the
radiative decay of these resonances into $\gamma \gamma$. We obtain results for
the width in good agreement with the experimental data for the $f_2(1270)$
state and a width about a factor five smaller for the $f_0(1370)$ resonance,
which would agree with preliminary results from the Belle collaboration,
hinting at an order of magnitude smaller width for this resonance than for the
$f_2(1270)$.
