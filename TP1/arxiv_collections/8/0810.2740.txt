The PANDA detector is under design to be installed at the HESR storage ring
for antiproton of the future FAIR facility in Darmstadt, Germany. Fundamental
questions of hadron and nuclear physics interactions of antiprotons with
nucleons and nuclei will be pursued using a multipurpose set-up which includes
innovative detectors. Here, the FAIR facility and the PANDA detector are
described.
