We analyze the role of Lorentz symmetry in the perturbative non-gravitational
anomalies for a single family of fermions. The theory is assumed to be
translational invariant, power-counting renormalizable and based on a local
action, but is allowed to have general Lorentz violating operators. We study
the conservation of global and gauge currents associate with general internal
symmetry groups and find, by using a perturbative approach, that Lorentz
symmetry does not participate in the clash of symmetries that leads to the
anomalies. We first analyze the triangle graphs and prove that there are
regulators for which the anomalous part of the Ward identities exactly
reproduces the Lorentz invariant case. Then we show, by means of a regulator
independent argument, that the anomaly cancellation conditions derived in
Lorentz invariant theories remain necessary ingredients for anomaly freedom.
