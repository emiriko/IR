Supersymmetric theories with bilinear R-parity violation can give rise to the
observed neutrino masses and mixings. One important feature of such models is
that the lightest supersymmetric particle might have a sufficiently large
lifetime to give rise to detached vertices. Working in the framework of
supergravity models we analyze the potential of the LHCb experiment to search
for supersymmetric models exhibiting bilinear R-parity violation. We show that
the LHCb experiment can probe a large fraction of the $m_0 \otimes m_{1/2}$
being able to explore gluino masses up to 1.3 TeV. The LHCb discover potential
for this kind of models is similar to the ATLAS and CMS ones in the low
luminosity phase of operation of the LHC.
