We report the realization of an active one-dimensional Fibonacci photonic
quasi-crystal via spin coating. Manipulation of the luminescence properties of
an organic dye embedded in the quasi-crystal is presented and compared to
theoretical simulations. The luminescence occurs via the pseudo-bandedge mode
and follows the dispersion properties of the Fibonacci crystal. Time resolved
luminescence measurement of the active structure shows faster spontaneous
emission rate, indicating the effect of the large photon densities available at
the bandedge due to the presence of critically localized states. The
experimental results are in excellent agreement with the theoretical
calculations.
