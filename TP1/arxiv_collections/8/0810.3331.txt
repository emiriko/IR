We determine the variance for the fluctuations of the arithmetic measures
obtained by collecting all closed geodesics on the modular surface with the
same discriminant and ordering them by the latter. This arithmetic variance
differs by subtle factors from the variance that one gets when considering
individual closed geodesics when ordered by their length. The arithmetic
variance is the same one that appears in the fluctuations of measures
associated with quantum states on the modular surface.
