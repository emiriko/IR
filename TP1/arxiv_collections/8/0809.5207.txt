GERDA, the GERmanium Detector Array experiment, is a new double beta-decay
experiment which is currently under construction in the INFN National Gran
Sasso Laboratory (LNGS), Italy. It is implementing a new shielding concept by
operating bare Ge diodes - enriched in Ge-76 - in high purity liquid argon
supplemented by a water shield. The aim of GERDA is to verify or refute the
recent claim of discovery, and, in a second phase, to achieve a two orders of
magnitude lower background index than recent experiments. The paper discusses
motivation, physics reach, design and status of construction of GERDA, and
presents some R&D results.
