$\hat q$ is the average squared transverse momentum transfer per unit length
to a high-energy particle traversing a QCD medium such as a quark-gluon plasma.
We find the (UV-regulated) value of $\hat q$ to leading order in the weak
coupling limit, $\alphas(T) \ll 1$. We then use this value to generalize
previous analytic results on the gluon bremsstrahlung and pair production rates
for massless high-energy particles in a weakly-coupled quark-gluon plasma, at
next-to-leading logarithmic order.
