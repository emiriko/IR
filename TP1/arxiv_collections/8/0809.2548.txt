A common situation in experimental physics is to have a signal which can not
be separated from a non-interfering background through the use of any cut. In
this paper, we describe a procedure for determining, on an event-by-event
basis, a quality factor ($Q$-factor) that a given event originated from the
signal distribution. This procedure generalizes the "side-band" subtraction
method to higher dimensions without requiring the data to be divided into bins.
The $Q$-factors can then be used as event weights in subsequent analysis
procedures, allowing one to more directly access the true spectrum of the
signal.
