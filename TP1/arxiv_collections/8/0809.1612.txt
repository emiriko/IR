Continuous time random walks impose a random waiting time before each
particle jump. Scaling limits of heavy tailed continuous time random walks are
governed by fractional evolution equations. Space-fractional derivatives
describe heavy tailed jumps, and the time-fractional version codes heavy tailed
waiting times. This paper develops scaling limits and governing equations in
the case of correlated jumps. For long-range dependent jumps, this leads to
fractional Brownian motion or linear fractional stable motion, with the time
parameter replaced by an inverse stable subordinator in the case of heavy
tailed waiting times. These scaling limits provide an interesting class of
non-Markovian, non-Gaussian self-similar processes.
