Gold-molecule-gold junctions can be formed by carefully breaking a gold wire
in a solution containing dithiolated molecules. Surprisingly, there is little
understanding on the mechanical details of the bridge formation process and
specifically on the role that the dithiol molecules play themselves. We propose
that alkanedithiol molecules have already formed bridges between the gold
electrodes before the atomic gold-gold junction is broken. This leads to
stabilization of the single atomic gold junction, as observed experimentally.
Our data can be understood within a simple spring model.
