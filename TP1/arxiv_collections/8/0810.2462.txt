Consider the general scalar balance law $\partial_t u + \Div f(t, x,u) =
F(t,x,u)$ in several space dimensions. The aim of this note is to estimate the
dependence of its solutions from the flow $f$ and from the source $F$. To this
aim, a bound on the total variation in the space variables of the solution is
obtained. This result is then applied to obtain well posedness and stability
estimates for a balance law with a non local source.
