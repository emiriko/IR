CERN LHC provides a good experimental platform to perturbatively probe the
fundamental gravity scale up to several TeV, with the precise value depending
on the number of extra dimensions. The leading experimental signal of graviton
at LHC is from the process $pp\to jet+{E\slash}_T$, where ${E\slash}_T$ stands
for the transverse missing energy. A detailed discussion on the hadronic
production of real graviton through hard subprocesses: $q\bar{q}\to G+g$,
$g+q\to G+q$ and $g+g\to G+g$ have been studied within the quantum gravity
theory with large extra dimensions. The main theoretical uncertainties together
with the dominant standard model background to these processes, e.g.
$q\bar{q}\to Z^0+g$ and $g+q\to Z^0+q$ with $Z^0$ further decaying into
neutrinos, have also been discussed. It is found that only in certain jet
energy region and with certain number of extra dimensions can the quantum
gravity signal be distinguished from the background, which inversely lead to
the effective scale $M_D$ to be probed up to $(8.8\pm 0.9)$ TeV for two extra
dimensions, and $(5.9\pm 0.5)$ TeV for four extra dimensions with sufficient
integrated luminosity, e.g. $100fb^{-1}$, at CERN LHC.
