We show that a Young's N slit interferometer can be used to factor the
integer N. The device could factor four- or five-digit numbers in a practical
fashion. This work shows how number theory may arise in physical problems, and
may provide some insight as to how quantum computers can carry out factoring
problems by interferometric means.
