We study the pure and random-bond versions of the square lattice
ferromagnetic Blume-Capel model, in both the first-order and second-order phase
transition regimes of the pure model. Phase transition temperatures, thermal
and magnetic critical exponents are determined for lattice sizes in the range
L=20-100 via a sophisticated two-stage numerical strategy of entropic sampling
in dominant energy subspaces, using mainly the Wang-Landau algorithm. The
second-order phase transition, emerging under random bonds from the
second-order regime of the pure model, has the same values of critical
exponents as the 2d Ising universality class, with the effect of the bond
disorder on the specific heat being well described by double-logarithmic
corrections, our findings thus supporting the marginal irrelevance of quenched
bond randomness. On the other hand, the second-order transition, emerging under
bond randomness from the first-order regime of the pure model, has a
distinctive universality class with \nu=1.30(6) and \beta/\nu=0.128(5). This
amounts to a strong violation of the universality principle of critical
phenomena, since these two second-order transitions, with different sets of
critical exponents, are between the same ferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases.
Furthermore, the latter of these two transitions supports an extensive but weak
universality, since it has the same magnetic critical exponent (but a different
thermal critical exponent) as a wide variety of two-dimensional systems. In the
conversion by bond randomness of the first-order transition of the pure system
to second order, we detect, by introducing and evaluating connectivity spin
densities, a microsegregation that also explains the increase we find in the
phase transition temperature under bond randomness.
