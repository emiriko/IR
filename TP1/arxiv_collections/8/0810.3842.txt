We discuss the renormalization of the $1^{--}$ vector meson propagator within
Resonance chiral theory at one loop. Using the particular form of the
interaction Lagrangian we show that additional poles of the renormalized
propagator corresponding to $1^{+-}$ degrees of freedom can be generated. We
give a concrete example of such an effect.
