Let $A$ be a noetherian ring, $\fa$ an ideal of $A$, and $M$ an $A$--module.
Some uniform theorems on the artinianness of certain local cohomology modules
are proven in a general situation. They generalize and imply previous results
about the artinianness of some special local cohomology modules in the graded
case.
