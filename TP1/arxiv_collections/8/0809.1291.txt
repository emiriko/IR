We investigate low-lying octupole response of neutron-rich Ni isotopes beyond
the N=50 shell closure using the Skyrme-Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov mean-fields and
the continuum quasi-particle random phase approximation. Performing detailed
numerical analyses employing the Skyrme parameter set SLy4 and a
density-dependent delta interaction of the mixed type, we show that a neutron
mode emerges above the neutron separation energy as a consequence of the weak
binding of neutrons and it exhibits strong influences of the di-neutron
correlation.
