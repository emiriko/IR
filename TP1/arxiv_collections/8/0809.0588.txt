Operation of the B-Factories (PEP-II and KEKB) has been very successful, both
having exceeded their design peak and integrated luminosity and provided a huge
amount of good data to the experiments. Proposal for upgrades, in order to
achieve about two order of magnitude larger luminosity, are in progress in
Japan, with Super-KEKB, and in Europe, with SuperB. Very high beam intensity,
very short bunch length and low Interaction Point beta-functions are the key
points of the Japanese design, very challenging for the hardware components
(RF, vacuum). On the other hand SuperB exploits a new collision scheme, namely
large Piwinski angle and "crab waist", which will allow to reach a luminosity
two order of magnitude larger without increasing beam currents and decreasing
bunch lengths. In this talk the present status of the two projects will be
reviewed.
