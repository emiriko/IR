We study the modification of the multiplicity distributions in MLLA due to
the presence of a QCD medium. The medium is introduced though a multiplicative
constant ($f_{med}$) in the soft infrared parts of the kernels of QCD evolution
equations. Using the asymptotic ansatz for quark and gluons mean multiplicities
$<n_G>=e^{\gamma y}$ and $<n_Q>=r^{-1}e^{\gamma y}$ respectively, we study two
cases: fixed $\gamma$ as previously considered in the literature, and fixed
$\alpha_s$. We find opposite behaviors of the dispersion of the multiplicity
distributions with increasing $f_{med}$ in both cases. For fixed $\gamma$ the
dispersion decreases, while for fixed $\alpha_s$ it increases.
