We present a star product between differential forms to second order in the
deformation parameter $\hbar$. The star product obtained is consistent with a
graded differential Poisson algebra structure on a symplectic manifold. The
form of the graded differential Poisson algebra requires the introduction of a
connection with torsion on the manifold, and places various constraints upon
it. The star product is given to second order in $\hbar^2$.
