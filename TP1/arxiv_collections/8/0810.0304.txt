Let $\V$ be a mixed characteristic complete discrete valuation ring with
perfect residue field $k$. We solve Berthelot's conjectures on the stability of
the holonomicity over smooth projective formal $\V$-schemes. Then we build a
category of complexes of arithmetic $\D$-modules over quasi-projective
$k$-varieties with bounded, $F$-holonomic cohomology. We get its stability
under Grothendieck's six operations.
