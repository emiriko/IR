Quantum entanglement reflects itself through non-local correlations among the
subsystems of a quantum system. This thesis focuses on constructing a complete
set of local invariants characterizing symmetric two qubit systems and
analyzing the pairwise entanglement properties like collective spin squeezing -
exhibited by multiqubits - in terms of two qubit entanglement invariants.
Further, the collective pairwise entanglement properties of symmetric
multiqubit states are shown to be captured entirely by the off diagonal block
of the covariance matrix.
