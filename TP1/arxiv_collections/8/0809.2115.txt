In the absence of nonlinearity all normal modes (NMs) of a chain with
disorder are spatially localized (Anderson localization). We study the action
of nonlinearity, whose strength is ramped linearly in time. It leads to a
spreading of a wavepacket due to interaction with and population of distant
NMs. Eventually the nonlinearity induced frequency shifts take over, and the
wavepacket becomes selftrapped. On finite chains a critical ramping speed is
obtained, which separates delocalized final states from localized ones. The
critical value depends on the strength of disorder and is largest when the
localization length matches the system size.
