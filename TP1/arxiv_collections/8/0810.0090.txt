We study the ferromagnetism of La0.67Ca0.33MnO3 in bulk polycrystalline,
nanocrystalline and amorphous phase. The structural change from crystalline
phase to amorphous phase exhibited a systematic decrease of TC(paramagnetic to
ferromagnetic transition temperature) and spontaneous magnetization (MS). The
experimental results suggested few more features, e.g., appearance of large
magnetic irreversibility in the temperature dependence of magnetization, lack
of magnetic saturation at high magnetic field, blocking of magnetization below
TB, and enhancement of coercivity. In addition, the magnetic phase transition
near to TC has changed from first order character in bulk sample to second
order character in nanocrystalline and amorphous samples. We understand the
observed magnetic features as the effects of decreasing particle size and
increasing magnetic (spin- lattice) disorder. We noted that magnetic dynamics
of amorphous samples is distinctly different from the nanocrystalline samples.
The ferromagnetism of amorphous samples are comparable with the properties of
reported amorphous ferromagnetic nanoparticles. We also demonstrate the effect
of disorder shell in controlling the dynamics of ferromagnetic cores.
