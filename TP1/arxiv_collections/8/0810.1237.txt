In this paper, we characterize the synchronization phenomenon of hyperchaotic
scalar non-linear delay dynamics in a fully-developed chaos regime. Our results
rely on the observation that, in that regime, the stationary statistical
properties of a class of hyperchaotic attractors can be reproduced with a
linear Langevin equation, defined by replacing the non-linear delay force by a
delta-correlated noise. Therefore, the synchronization phenomenon can be
analytically characterized by a set of coupled Langevin equations. We apply
this formalism to study anticipated synchronization dynamics subject to
external noise fluctuations as well as for characterizing the effects of
parameter mismatch in a hyperchaotic communication scheme. The same procedure
is applied to second order differential delay equations associated to
synchronization in electro-optical devices. In all cases, the departure with
respect to perfect synchronization is measured through a similarity function.
Numerical simulations in discrete maps associated to the hyperchaotic dynamics
support the formalism.
