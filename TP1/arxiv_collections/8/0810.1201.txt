In this paper we use abstract vector spaces and their duals without any
canonical basis. Some of our results can be extended to infinite dimensional
vector spaces too, but here we consider only finite dimensional spaces. We
focus on a general perturbation problem. Assume that $B:V\to V$ is a linear
operator, which is perturbated to $B'=B+Q$. We examine the question how the
determinant and the inverse change, because of this perturbation. In our
approach the operator $Q$ is given as a sum of dyadic products
$Q=\sum_{i=1}^{k}v_{i}\otimes p_{i}$, where $v_{i}\in V$ and $p_{i}\in V^{*}$.
In this paper we derive an $m$-th order ($m\in\mathbb{N}$) approximation
formula for $\det B'$ and $(B')^{-1}$, which gives the exact result if $m\geq
k$.
