We discuss the role of instantons in the spectroscopy of ordinary and exotic
hadrons as well as in high energy reactions. We argue that the instanton
induced flavor- and spin-dependent quark-quark and quark-gluon interactions can
explain many features of the hadron spectrum. The observed anomalous spin and
flavor effects in various reactions with hadrons can also be understood within
the instanton model for QCD vacuum.
