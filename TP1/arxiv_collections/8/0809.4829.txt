The aim of this talk is to review near and far future long baseline neutrino
experiments as superbeams, beta-Beams and neutrino factories, comparing their
sensitivities to the unknown parameters in the neutrino oscillation sector. We
focus on the extraction of the neutrino mass hierarchy, exploring alternatives
to the commonly used neutrino-antineutrino comparison. Special attention to a
new concept of neutrino factory design, the low energy neutrino factory, is
given.
