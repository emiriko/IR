We demonstrate that the RHIC data for hadron production in d-Au collisions
for all available rapidities are compatible with geometric scaling. In order to
establish the presence of scaling violations expected from small-x evolution a
much larger range in transverse momentum and rapidity needs to be probed. We
show that the fall-off of the transverse momentum distribution of produced
hadrons at LHC is a sensitive probe of small-x evolution.
