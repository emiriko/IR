The formation of the Kuroshio large meander in summer 2004 was investigated
by using the cruise data, Argo profiles data, and satellite remote sensing
data. We validated the point that cyclonic eddy contributes to the large
meander. Besides, the impacts of typhoons on Kuroshio meanders were studied.
  From 29 July to 4 August, the typhoons stirred the ocean and upwelled the
deep water, which enhanced the existed cyclonic eddy, and immediately made a
drastic meander of the Kuroshio. Moreover, the unexpected typhoons in June 2004
also contributed to the initial meander at Tokara Strait. The result suggests
an alternative meander mechanism of Kuroshio path via typhoon-eddy-Kuroshio
interactions. It is argued that typhoons accompanied with cyclonic eddies,
might play crucial roles in meanders of the Kuroshio. This will provide a more
comprehensive understanding of the dynamics of the west boundary flows like the
Kuroshio and the Gulf Stream, and will be useful in eddy-resolution models.
