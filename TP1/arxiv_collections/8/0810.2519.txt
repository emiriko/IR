We report new results from CDF on single-diffractive dijet and W/Z
production, and on exclusive dijet, diphoton, and dilepton production in
proton-antiproton collisions at sqrt{s}=1.96 TeV at the Fermilab Tevatron. The
measured exclusive dijet and diphoton cross sections provide a test of
theoretical predictions for exclusive Higgs production at the LHC.
