The electronic states of the Fe2As2 plane in iron-based superconductors are
investigated on the basis of the two-dimensional 16-band d-p model which
includes the Coulomb interaction on a Fe site: the intra- and inter-orbital
direct terms U and U', the Hund's coupling J and the pair-transfer J'. Using
the random phase approximation (RPA), we obtain the magnetic phase diagram
including the stripe and the incommensurate order on the U'-J plane. We also
solve the superconducting gap equation within the RPA and find that, for large
J, the most favorable pairing symmetry is extended s-wave whose order parameter
changes its sign between the hole pockets and the electron pockets, while it is
dxy-wave for small J.
