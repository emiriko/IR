A short overview of theoretical methods for B physics at hadron colliders is
presented. The main emphasis is on the theory of two-body hadronic B decays,
which provide a rich field of investigation in particular for the Tevatron and
the LHC. The subject holds both interesting theoretical challenges as well as
many opportunities for flavor studies and new physics tests. A brief review of
the current status and recent developments is given. A few additional topics in
B physics are also mentioned.
