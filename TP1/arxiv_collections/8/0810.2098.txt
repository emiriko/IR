We study chaotic regions in the phase space of classical non-Abelian gauge
theory, focusing particularly on those which determine the low-energy
interactions between BPS monopoles, and comment on the relevance of the
obtained results for long-standing speculations which relate classical
Yang-Mills chaos to the disordered quantum vacuum and quark confinement.
