Is it possible to increase Tc by constructing cuprate heterostructures, which
combine the high pairing energy of underdoped layers with the large carrier
density of proximate overdoped layers? We investigate this question within a
model bilayer system using an effective theory of the doped Mott insulator.
Interestingly, the question hinges on the fundamental nature of the
superconducting state in the underdoped regime. Within a plain slave boson mean
field theory, there is absolutely no enhancement of Tc. However, we do get a
substantial enhancement for moderate inter-layer tunneling when we use an
effective low energy theory of the bilayer in which the effective quasiparticle
charge in the underdoped regime is taken as an independent phenomenological
parameter. We study the Tc enhancement as a function of the doping level and
the inter-layer tunneling, and discuss possible connections to recent
experiments by Yuli et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 101, 057005 (2008)]. Finally, we
predict a unique paramagnetic reduction of the zero temperature phase stiffness
of coupled layers, which depends on the difference in the current carried by
quasiparticles on the two types of layers as (J1-J2)^2.
