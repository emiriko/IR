The measurements of the \Bs mixing parameter which describes the difference
in width (the inverse of the lifetime) between the \Bs heavy and light states
are described. These measurements include direct measurement of $\Delta
\Gamma_s$ and $\Gamma_s$ by resolving CP eigenstates by angular analysis and
measurements in which the proportion of CP even and odd is known.
