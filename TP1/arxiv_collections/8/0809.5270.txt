We explicitly construct a (unique) Spin(9)xSU(2) singlet state, phi,
involving only the fermionic degrees of freedom of the supersymmetric
matrix-model corresponding to reduced 10-dimensional super Yang-Mills theory,
resp. supermembranes in 11-dimensional Minkowski space. Any non-singular
wavefunction annihilated by the 16 supercharges of SU(2) matrix theory must, at
the origin (where it is assumed to be non-vanishing) reduce to phi.
