The response of ecosystems to perturbations is considered from a
thermodynamic perspective by acknowledging that, as for all macroscopic systems
and processes, the dynamics and stability of ecosystems is subject to definite
thermodynamic law. For open ecosystems, exchanging energy, work, and mass with
the environment, the thermodynamic criteria come from non-equilibrium or
irreversible thermodynamics. For ecosystems during periods in which the
boundary conditions may be considered as being constant, it is shown that
criteria from irreversible thermodynamic theory are sufficient to permit a
quantitative prediction of ecosystem response to perturbation. This framework
is shown to provide a new perspective on the population dynamics of real
ecosystems. The formalism is applied to the problem of the population
oscillations of the southern pine beetle.
