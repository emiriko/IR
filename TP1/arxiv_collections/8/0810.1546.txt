Most general renormalizable interaction in the system with a set of scalar
fields having identical quantum numbers generates naturally mixed kinetic terms
in the Lagrangian. Taking into account these terms leads to modification both
the renormalization group equations and the tree level analysis as compare with
many published results. We obtain conditions for non-appearance of such a
running mixing in some important cases.
