Multifractals are inhomogeneous measures (or functions) which are typically
described by a full spectrum of real dimensions, as opposed to a single real
dimension. Results from the study of fractal strings in the analysis of their
geometry, spectra and dynamics via certain zeta functions and their poles (the
complex dimensions) are used in this text as a springboard to define similar
tools fit for the study of multifractals such as the binomial measure. The goal
of this work is to shine light on new ideas and perspectives rather than to
summarize a coherent theory. Progress has been made which connects these new
perspectives to and expands upon classical results, leading to a healthy
variety of natural and interesting questions for further investigation and
elaboration.
