In this article we study the automorphism groups of binary cyclic codes. In
particular, we provide explicit constructions for codes whose automorphism
groups can be described as (a) direct products of two symmetric groups or (b)
iterated wreath products of several symmetric groups. Interestingly, some of
the codes we consider also arise in the context of regular lattice graphs and
permutation decoding.
