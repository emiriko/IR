Using the high energy color dipole formalism, we study the coherent and
incoherent nuclear DVCS process in the small-x regime. We consider simple
models for the elementary dipole-hadron scattering amplitude that captures main
features of the dependence on atomic number A, on energy and on momentum
transfer t. Using the obtained amplitudes we make predictions for the nuclear
DVCS cross section at photon level in the collider kinematics.
