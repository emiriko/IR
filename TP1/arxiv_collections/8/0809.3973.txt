We find a parametric solution of an arbitrary symmetric homogeneous
diophantine equation of 5th degree in 6 variables using two primitive
solutions. We then generalize this approach to symmetric forms of any odd
degree by proving the following results.
  (1) Every symmetric form of odd degree $n\ge 5$ in $6 \cdot 2^{n-5}$
variables has a rational parametric solution depending on $2n-8$ parameters.
(2) Let $F(x_1, ..., x_N)$ be a symmetric form of odd degree $n\ge 5$ in $N=6
\cdot 2^{n-4}$ variables, and let $q$ be any rational number. Then the equation
$F(x_i)=q$ has a rational parametric solution depending on $2n-6$ parameters.
  The latter result can be viewed as a solution of a problem of Waring type for
this class of forms.
