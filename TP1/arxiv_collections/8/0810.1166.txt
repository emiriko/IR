The Stochastic Vacuum Model for QCD, proposed by Dosch and Simonov, is fused
with a Worldline casting of the underlying theory, i.e. QCD. Important,
non-perturbative features of the model are studied. In particular,
contributions associated with the spin-field interaction are calculated and
both the validity of the loop equations and of the Bianchi identity are
explicitly demonstrated. As an application, a simulated meson-meson scattering
problem is studied in the Regge kinematical regime. The process is modeled in
terms of the "helicoidal" Wilson contour along the lines introduced by Janik
and Peschanski in a related study based on a AdS/CFT-type approach. Working
strictly in the framework of the Stochastic Vacuum Model and in a semiclassical
approximation scheme the Regge behavior for the Scattering amplitude is
demonstrated. Going beyond this approximation, the contribution resulting from
boundary fluctuation of the Wilson loop contour is also estimated.
