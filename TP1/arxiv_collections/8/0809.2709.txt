We study the phase diagram of the dilute two-component Fermi gas at zero
temperature as a function of the polarization and coupling strength. We map out
the detailed phase separations between superfluid and normal states near the
Feshbach resonance. We show that there are three different coexistence of
superfluid and normal phases corresponding to phase separated states between:
(I) the partially polarized superfluid and the fully polarized normal phases,
(II) the unpolarized superfluid and the fully polarized normal phases and (III)
the unpolarized superfluid and the partially polarized normal phases from
strong-coupling BEC side to weak-coupling BCS side. For pairing between two
species, we found this phase separation regime gets wider and moves toward the
BEC side for the majority species are heavier but shifts to BCS side and
becomes narrow if they are lighter.
