In this paper the lubrication-type dynamical model is developed of a molten,
pulsed laser-irradiated metallic film. The heat transfer problem that
incorporates the absorbed heat from a single beam or interfering beams is
solved analytically. Using this temperature field, we derive the 3D long-wave
evolution PDE for the film height. To get insights into dynamics of dewetting,
we study the 2D version of the evolution equation by means of a linear
stability analysis and by numerical simulations. The stabilizing and
destabilizing effects of various system parameters, such as the peak laser beam
intensity, the film optical thickness, the Biot and Marangoni numbers, etc. are
elucidated. It is observed that the film stability is promoted for such
parameters variations that increase the heat production in the film. In the
numerical simulations the impacts of different irradiation modes are
investigated. In particular, we obtain that in the interference heating mode
the spatially periodic irradiation results in a spatially periodic film rupture
with the same, or nearly equal period. The 2D model qualitatively reproduces
the results of the experimental observations of a film stability and spatial
ordering of a re-solidified nanostructures.
