We consider three examples of families of curves over a non-archimedean
valued field which admit a non-trivial group action. These equivariant
deformation spaces can be described by algebraic parameters (in the equation of
the curve), or by rigid-analytic parameters (in the Schottky group of the
curve). We study the relation between these parameters as rigid-analytic
self-maps of the disk.
