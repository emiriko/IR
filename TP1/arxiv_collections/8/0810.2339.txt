The Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect in a small array of antidots with large aspect
ratio is investigated in the quantum Hall regime. The evolution with
temperature of the AB oscillations in the magnetic field vs gate voltage (B-Vg)
plane reveals the temperature dependence of the screening. The
self-consistently screened potential of the compressible band surrounding an
antidot is observed to gain progressively steeper slope with increasing
temperature.
