We prove Strichartz estimates on general flat d-torus for arbitrary d. Using
these estimates, we prove local wellposedness for the cubic nonlinear
Schr\"odinger equations in appropriate Sobolev spaces. In dimensions 2 and 3,
we prove polynomial bounds on the possible growth of Sobolev norms of smooth
solutions.
