We develop a method of the ab-initio calculation for the core-level x-ray
photoemission spectroscopy (XPS). By calculating one-electron states in the
presence of core-hole potential, excited states are constructed by distributing
electrons on these one-electron states. The overlap integrals between the
excited states and the ground state are evaluated by using the wavefunctions
with and without the core-hole potential, and finally the XPS spectra are
obtained. Implementing the procedure, we obtain the spin-resolved 3s-core XPS
spectra in ferromagnetic iron without any adjustable parameters, in good
agreement with the experiment. The spectral shapes are quite different for
different spin channels. We explain the behavior in terms of the difference in
the one-electron states screening the core-hole potential.
