We present preliminary results of a study of Delta S = 2 matrix elements
originating from physics beyond the Standard Model. Using 2+1 flavour Domain
Wall Fermions we obtain the non-perturbative renormalisation (mixing) matrix in
the RI scheme. We also discuss plans for the chiral extrapolation of the
renormalised matrix elements in a partially quenched set-up.
