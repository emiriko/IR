Quantum Spin-Hall systems are topological insulators displaying
dissipationless spin currents flowing at the edges of the samples. In
contradistinction to the Quantum Hall systems where the charge conductance of
the edge modes is quantized, the spin conductance is not and it remained an
open problem to find the observable whose edge current is quantized. In this
paper, we define a particular observable and the edge current corresponding to
this observable. We show that this current is quantized and that the
quantization is given by the index of a certain Fredholm operator. This
provides a new topological invariant that is shown to take same values as the
Spin-Chern number previously introduced in the literature. The result gives an
effective tool for the investigation of the edge channels' structure in Quantum
Spin-Hall systems. Based on a reasonable assumption, we also show that the edge
conducting channels are not destroyed by a random edge.
