The spectrum of low-lying eigenvalues of overlap Dirac operator in quenched
SU(2) lattice gauge theory with tadpole-improved Symanzik action is studied at
finite temperatures in the vicinity of the confinement-deconfinement phase
transition defined by the expectation value of the Polyakov line. The value of
the chiral condensate obtained from the Banks-Casher relation is found to drop
down rapidly at T = Tc, though not going to zero. At Tc' = 1.5 Tc = 480 MeV the
chiral condensate decreases rapidly one again and becomes either very small or
zero. At T < Tc the distributions of small eigenvalues are universal and are
well described by chiral orthogonal ensemble of random matrices. In the
temperature range above Tc where both the chiral condensate and the expectation
value of the Polyakov line are nonzero the distributions of small eigenvalues
are not universal. Here the eigenvalue spectrum is better described by a
phenomenological model of dilute instanton - anti-instanton gas.
