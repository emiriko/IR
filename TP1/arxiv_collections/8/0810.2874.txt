We present a MSSM study of the b -> s gamma decay in a Minimal Flavor
Violating (MFV) framework, where the form of the soft SUSY breaking terms is
determined by the Standard Model Yukawa couplings. In particular, we address
the role of gluino contributions, which are set to zero in most studies of the
MFV MSSM.
  Gluino contributions can play an important role in the MFV MSSM whenever mu *
tan(beta) is large. In fact, similarly to chargino contributions, gluino
contributions are tan(beta) enhanced and can easily dominate charged Higgs
contributions for large values of tan(beta). Even though each of the separate
contributions to b -> s gamma can be sizeable by itself, surprisingly no
absolute lower bound can be placed on any of the relevant SUSY masses, since
patterns of partial cancellations among the three competing contributions
(Higgs, chargino and gluino) can occur throughout the MSSM parameter space.
