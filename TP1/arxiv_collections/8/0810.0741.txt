Twisted rapid passage is a type of non-adiabatic rapid passage that gives
rise to controllable quantum interference effects that were first observed
experimentally in 2003. We show that twisted rapid passage sweeps can be used
to implement a universal set of quantum gates that operate with high-fidelity.
For each gate in the universal set, sweep parameter values are provided which
simulations indicate will yield a quantum gate with error probability P_{e} <
10**(-4). Note that all gates in this universal set are driven by a **single**
type of control field (twisted rapid passage), and the error probability for
each gate falls below the rough-and-ready estimate for the accuracy threshold
P_{a} ~ 10**(-4). The simulations suggest that the universal gate set produced
by twisted rapid passage shows promise for use in a fault-tolerant scheme for
quantum computing.
