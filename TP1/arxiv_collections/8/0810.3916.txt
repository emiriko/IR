We show that the requirement of gauge invariance is not enough to fix the
form of interactions between unparticles and gauge fields, thus revealing a
wide new class of gauged unparticle actions. Our approach also allows us to
construct operators which create gauge invariant coloured unparticles. We
discuss both their perturbative and non--perturbative properties.
