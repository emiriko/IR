The interaction of intense laser fields with silver and argon clusters is
investigated theoretically using a modified nanoplasma model. Single pulse and
double pulse excitations are considered. The influence of the dense cluster
environment on the inner ionization processes is studied including the lowering
of the ionization energies. There are considerable changes in the dynamics of
the laser-cluster interaction. Especially, for silver clusters, the lowering of
the ionization energies leads to increased yields of highly charged ions.
