A black hole and a black hyperboloid solutions in the space with the
Schroedinger isometries are presented and their thermodynamics is examined. The
on-shell action is obtained by the difference between the extremal and
non-extremal ones with the unusual matching of the boundary metrics. This
regularization method is first applied to the black brane solution in the space
of the Schroedinger symmetry and shown to correctly reproduce the known
thermodynamics. The actions of the black solutions all turn out to be the same
as the AdS counterparts. The phase diagram of the black hole system is obtained
in the parameter space of the temperature and chemical potential and the
diagram contains the Hawking-Page phase transition and instability lines.
