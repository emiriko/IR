Fluctuating local diamagnetic pairs of electrons, embedded in a Fermi sea,
are candidates for non-phonon-mediated superconductors without the stringent
conditions on Tc which arise in phonon-mediated BCS classical low-Tc
superconductors. The local accumulations of charge, from which such diamagnetic
fluctuations originate, are irrevocably coupled to local dynamical lattice
instabilities and form composite charge-lattice excitations of the system. For
a superconducting phase to be realized, such excitations must be itinerant
spatially phase-coherent modes. This can be achieved by resonant pair tunneling
in and out of polaronic cation-ligand sites. Materials in which
superconductivity driven by such local lattice instability can be expected,
have a Tc which is controlled by the phase stiffness rather than the amplitude
of the diamagnetic pair fluctuations. Above Tc, a pseudogap phase will be
maintained up to a T*, where this pairing amplitude disappears. We discuss the
characteristic local charge and lattice properties which characterize this
pseudogap phase and which form the prerequisites for establishing a
phase-coherent macroscopic superconducting state.
