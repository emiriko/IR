The Sudbury Neutrino Observatory has measured the $^8$B solar neutrino flux
using an array of 3He proportional counters. Results obtained using a
Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) parameter estimation, integrating over a
standard extended likelihood, yield effective neutrino fluxes of:
phi_nc=5.54+0.33-0.31(stat)+0.36-0.34(syst) x 10^6 /cm^2/s,
phi_cc=1.67+0.05-0.04(stat)+0.07-0.08(syst) x 10^6 /cm^2/s, and
phi_es=1.77+0.24-0.21(stat)+0.09-0.10(syst) x 10^6 /cm^2/s. These measurements
are in agreement with previous solar neutrino flux measurements, and with
neutrino oscillation model results. Including these flux measurements in a
global analysis of solar and reactor neutrino results yields an improved
precision on the solar neutrino mixing angle of theta=34.4+1.3-1.2 degrees, and
Delta m^2=7.59+0.19-0.21 eV^2.
