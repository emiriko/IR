We calculate the instantaneous proper radial acceleration of test particles
(as measured by a locally defined Lorentzian observer) in a Weyl spacetime,
close to the horizon. As expected from the Israel theorem, there appear some
bifurcations with respect to the spherically symmetric case (Schwarzschild),
which are explained in terms of the behaviour of the superenergy, bringing out
the physical relevance of this quantity in the study of general relativistic
systems.
