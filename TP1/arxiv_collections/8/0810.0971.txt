In this letter we consider the case of primary scalar unparticle
contributions to B(d,s) mixing. With particular emphasis on the impact of the
recent hint of new physics in the measurement of the B(s) mixing phase, phi(s),
we determine the allowed parameter space and impose bounds on the unparticle
couplings.
