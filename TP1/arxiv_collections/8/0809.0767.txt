We prove that for a polynomial $f\in k[x,y,z]$ equivalent are: (1)$f$ is a
$k[z]$-coordinate of $k[z][x,y]$, and (2) $k[x,y,z]/(f)\cong k^{[2]}$ and
$f(x,y,a)$ is a coordinate in $k[x,y]$ for some $a\in k$. This solves a special
case of the Abhyankar-Sathaye conjecture. As a consequence we see that a
coordinate $f\in k[x,y,z]$ which is also a $k(z)$-coordinate, is a
$k[z]$-coordinate. We discuss a method for constructing automorphisms of
$k[x,y,z]$, and observe that the Nagata automorphism occurs naturally as the
first non-trivial automorphism obtained by this method - essentially linking
Nagata with a non-tame $R$-automorphism of $R[x]$, where $R=k[z]/(z^2)$.
