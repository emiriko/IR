Paterson, Stinson and Wei \cite{PSW} introduced Combinatorial batch codes,
which are combinatorial description of Batch code. Batch codes were first
presented by Ishai, Kushilevita, Ostrovsky and Sahai \cite{IKOS} in STOC'04. In
this paper we answer some of the questions put forward by Paterson, Stinson and
Wei and give some results for the general case $t>1$ which were not studied by
the authors.
