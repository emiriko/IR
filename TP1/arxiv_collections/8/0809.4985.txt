This paper investigates the impact of carrier frequency offset (CFO) and
sampling frequency offset (SFO) on the performance of different MIMO-OFDM
schemes with high spectral efficiency for next generation of terrestrial
digital TV. We analyze particularly orthogonal Alamouti scheme, and
non-orthogonal (NO) schemes like VBLAST, linear dispersion (LD) code and Golden
code. This analysis gives a global view on the best suitable MIMO-OFDM scheme
with respect to CFO and SFO. We show that for high spectral efficiency,
Alamouti is more sensitive to CFO and SFO. Moreover, we show that all studied
MIMO-OFDM schemes are sensitive to CFO when it is greater than 1% of
inter-carrier spacing. Their sensitivity due to SFO is less than that due to
CFO.
