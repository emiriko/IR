Undeniably, the imminent activity of LHC and the quest for the nature of
physics beyond the standard model have raised renewed interest in the conformal
and quasi-conformal behaviour of gauge field theories with matter content.
Theoretically driven questions seem to now acquire a strong experimental appeal
and might guide us towards a more realistic string theory to field theory
connection, originally inspired by the AdS/CFT conjecture. In this brief
report, we discuss the state of the art of our search for the conformal window
in the SU(3) colour-gauge theory with fermions in the fundamental
representation.
