This paper presents the architecture and characteristics of a memory database
intended to be used as a cache engine for web applications. Primary goals of
this database are speed and efficiency while running on SMP systems with
several CPU cores (four and more). A secondary goal is the support for simple
metadata structures associated with cached data that can aid in efficient use
of the cache. Due to these goals, some data structures and algorithms normally
associated with this field of computing needed to be adapted to the new
environment.
