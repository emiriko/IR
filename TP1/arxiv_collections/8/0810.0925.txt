We study the consistency of the description of charge distributions and radii
of nuclear clusters obtained with semiclassical nuclear pasta models. These
nuclei are expected to exist in the low density outer crust of neutron stars.
Properties of the arising clusterized nucleon matter can be compared to
realistic nuclear properties as experimentally extracted on earth. We focus on
non iso-symmetric light clusters with nucleon number $8 \le A \le 30$ and use
Monte Carlo many-body techniques. We simulate isotopic chains for a set of
selected nuclei using a model Hamiltonian consisting of the usual kinetic term,
hadronic nucleon nucleon (NN), Coulomb and an effective density dependent Pauli
potential. It is shown that for neutron rich (deficient) clusters neutron
(proton) skins develop. Different (matter, neutron, proton, electric charge)
radii are computed for this set of non iso-symmetric nuclei. Nuclear binding
energies are also analyzed in the isotopic chains.
