The evolution of the magnetization in (Cd,Mn)Te quantum wells after a short
pulse of magnetic field was determined from the giant Zeeman shift of
spectroscopic lines. The dynamics in absence of magnetic field was found to be
up to three orders of magnitude faster than that at 1 T. Hyperfine interaction
and strain are mainly responsible for the fast decay. The influence of a hole
gas is clearly visible: at zero field anisotropic holes stabilize the system of
Mn ions, while in a magnetic field of 1 T they are known to speed up the decay
by opening an additional relaxation channel.
