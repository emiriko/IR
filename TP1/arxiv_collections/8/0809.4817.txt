Using a conformal version of the Bianchi I metric and a perfect fluid
energy-momentum tensor, we show that the resulting Einstein field equations are
equivalent to a generalized Ermakov-Milne-Pinney equation. Using a
transformation analogous to the known correspondence between the classical EMP
and a linear Schr\"odinger equation, we then construct the linear Schr\"odinger
formulation for this cosmological model. Also, a note is included to show the
extra term that arises when the energy-momentum tensor is taken to include a
second term in addition to the scalar field.
