Scattered over the past few years have been several occurrences of simplicial
complexes whose topological behavior characterize the Cohen-Macaulay property
for quotients of polynomial rings by arbitrary (not necessarily squarefree)
monomial ideals. The purpose of this survey is to gather the developments into
one location, with self-contained proofs, including direct combinatorial
topological connections between them.
