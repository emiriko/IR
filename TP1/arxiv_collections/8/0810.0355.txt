A comparative study of the effect of a static homogeneous electric field on
the rovibrational spectra of several polar dimers in their
$\textrm{X}^1\Sigma^+$ electronic ground state is performed. Focusing upon the
rotational ground state within each vibrational band, results for energies and
various expectation values are presented. For moderate field strengths the
electric field-induced energy shifts, orientation, alignment, and angular
motion hybridization are analyzed up to high vibrational excitations close to
the dissociation threshold.
