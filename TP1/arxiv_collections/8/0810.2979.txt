This paper gives a new and short proof of existence and uniqueness of the
Polubarinova-Galin equation. The existence proof is an application of the main
theorem in Lin's paper. Furthermore, we can conclude that every strong solution
can be approximated by many strong polynomial solutions locally in time.
