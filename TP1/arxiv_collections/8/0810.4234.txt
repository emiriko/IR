A short review is presented of the spontaneous violation of chiral symmetry
in QCD vacuum. It is demonstrated, that this phenomenon is the origin of baryon
masses in QCD. The value of nucleon mass is calculated as well as the masses of
hyperons and some baryonic resonances and expressed mainly through the values
of quark condensates -- $<0\mid \bar{q} q \mid 0>, ~q=u,d,s$ -- the vacuum
expectation values (v.e.v.) of quark field. The concept of vacuum expectation
values induced by external fields is introduced. It is demonstrated that such
v.e.v. induced by static electromagnetic field results in quark condensate
magnetic susceptibility, which plays the main role in determination of baryon
magnetic moments. The magnetic moments of proton, neutron and hyperons are
calculated. The results of calculation of baryon octet $\beta$-decay constants
are also presented.
