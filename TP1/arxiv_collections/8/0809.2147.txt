A new form of multiuser diversity, named \emph{multiuser interference
diversity}, is investigated for opportunistic communications in cognitive radio
(CR) networks by exploiting the mutual interference between the CR and the
existing primary radio (PR) links. The multiuser diversity gain and ergodic
throughput are analyzed for different types of CR networks and compared against
those in the conventional networks without the PR link.
