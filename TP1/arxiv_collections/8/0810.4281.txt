We show that the quantum reflection coefficient of ultracold heavy atoms
scattering off a dielectric surface can be tuned in a wide range by suitable
choice of surface and environment temperatures. This effect results from a
temperature dependent long-range repulsive part of the van der
Waals-Casimir-Polder-Lifshitz atom-surface interaction potential.
