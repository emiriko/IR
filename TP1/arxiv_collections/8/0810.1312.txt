The sixth SuperB Workshop was convened in response to questions posed by the
INFN Review Committee, evaluating the SuperB project at the request of INFN.
The working groups addressed the capability of a high-luminosity flavor factory
that can gather a data sample of 50 to 75 /ab in five years to elucidate New
Physics phenomena unearthed at the LHC. This report summarizes the results of
the Workshop.
