Nufact08 is the tenth in a series of workshops started in 1999, whose main
goal is to understand options for future neutrino-oscillation experiments to
attack the problems of the neutrino mass hierarchy and CP violation in the
leptonic sector. I present a very brief review of what we know and what we
would like to know about neutrino mass, mixing, and flavor change. I consider
the interplay between neutrino physics and forthcoming information from the
Large Hadron Collider. I comment on a decade's progress and offer some context
for work that lies ahead.
