An analysis of a special class of type II string theory compactifications is
presented. We focus on recent work in one particular orientifold background of
intersecting brane models and the resulting four dimensional gauge group and
matter content. Special attention is paid to solutions that resemble the gauge
group of the MSSM. Statistical correlations between properties of the models
are analysed and compared to results on different backgrounds.
