We present a theory of linear optical constants based on a single-particle
density matrix and implemented in an extension of the real-space multiple
scattering code FEFF. This approach avoids the need to compute wave-functions
explicitly, and yields efficient calculations for frequencies ranging from the
IR to hard x-rays, and applicable to arbitrary aperiodic systems. Our approach
is illustrated with calculations of optical properties and applications for
several materials.
