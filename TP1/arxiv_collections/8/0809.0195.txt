The so-called light logics have been introduced as logical systems enjoying
quite remarkable normalization properties. Designing a type assignment system
for pure lambda calculus from these logics, however, is problematic. In this
paper we show that shifting from usual call-by-name to call-by-value lambda
calculus allows regaining strong connections with the underlying logic. This
will be done in the context of Elementary Affine Logic (EAL), designing a type
system in natural deduction style assigning EAL formulae to lambda terms.
