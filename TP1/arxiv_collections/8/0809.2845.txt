We examine in detail the theoretical underpinnings of previous successful
applications of local molecular field (LMF) theory to charged systems. LMF
theory generally accounts for the averaged effects of long-ranged components of
the intermolecular interactions by using an effective or restructured external
field. The derivation starts from the exact Yvon-Born-Green hierarchy and shows
that the approximation can be very accurate when the interactions averaged over
are slowly varying at characteristic nearest-neighbor distances. Application of
LMF theory to Coulomb interactions alone allows for great simplifications of
the governing equations. LMF theory then reduces to a single equation for a
restructured electrostatic potential that satisfies Poisson's equation defined
with a smoothed charge density. Because of this charge smoothing by a Gaussian
of width sigma, this equation may be solved more simply than the detailed
simulation geometry might suggest. Proper choice of the smoothing length sigma
plays a major role in ensuring the accuracy of this approximation. We examine
the results of a basic confinement of water between corrugated wall and justify
the simple LMF equation used in a previous publication. We further generalize
these results to confinements that include fixed charges in order to
demonstrate the broader impact of charge smoothing by sigma. The slowly-varying
part of the restructured electrostatic potential will be more symmetric than
the local details of confinements.
