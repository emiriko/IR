Electronic current in a nanometer-size rod is theoretically investigated by
an eigen-channel decomposition method in nonequilibrium Green's function
formalism. Physical properties, such as the local density of electrons and
local current, are decomposed into contributions of eigen-channels. We observe
that the evanescent modes and nonlinear conductance are enhanced in d-orbital
systems, and the structure of the transmission function, local current density,
and penetration depth are discussed. The two effects of the ill-contact at
electrodes in d-orbital systems, evanescent modes and the nonlinearity of
conductance, are regarded as originating in the peak structure of the
transmission function of eigen-channels in the energy region between chemical
potentials of left and right lead wires.
