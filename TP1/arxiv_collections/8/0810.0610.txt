The spin Hall effect is a phenomenon that an electric field induces a spin
Hall current. In this Letter, we examine the inverse effect that, in a
ferromagnetic conductor, a charge Hall current is induced by a spin motive
force, or a spin-dependent effective ` electric' field ${\bm E}_{\rm s}$,
arising from the time variation of magnetization texture. By considering
skew-scattering and side-jump processes due to spin-orbit interaction at
impurities, we obtain the Hall current density as $\sigma_{\rm SH} {\bm
n}\times{\bm E}_{\rm s}$, where ${\bm n}$ is the local spin direction and
$\sigma_{\rm SH}$ is the spin Hall conductivity. The Hall angle due to the spin
motive force is enhanced by a factor of $P^{2}$ compared to the conventional
anomalous Hall effect due to the ordinary electric field, where $P$ is the spin
polarization of the current. The Hall voltage is estimated for a field-driven
domain wall oscillation in a ferromagnetic nanowire.
