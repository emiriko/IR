In this lecture we discuss various aspects of QCD at nonzero chemical
potential, including its phase diagram and the Dirac spectrum, and summarize
what chiral random matrix theory has contributed to this subject. To illustrate
the importance of the phase of the fermion determinant, we particularly
highlight the differences between QCD and phase quenched QCD.
