The radiative decay of the axial-vector resonances into a pseudoscalar meson
and a photon is studied using the vector meson Lagrangian obtained from the
hidden gauge symmetry (HGS) formalism. The formalism is well suited to study
this problem since it deals with pseudoscalar and vector mesons in a unified
way, respecting chiral invariance. We show explicitly the gauge invariance of
the set of diagrams that appear in the approach and evaluate the radiative
decay width of the a1(1260) and b1(1235) axial vector meson resonances into pi
gamma. We also include the contribution of loops involving anomalous couplings
and compare the results to those obtained previously within another formalism.
