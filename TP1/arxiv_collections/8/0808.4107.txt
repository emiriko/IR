Several types of Wavefront Sensors (WFS) are nowadays available in the field
of Adaptive Optics (AO). Generally speaking, their basic principle consists in
measuring slopes or curvatures of Wavefront Errors (WFE) transmitted by a
telescope, subsequently reconstructing WFEs digitally. Such process, however,
does not seem to be well suited for evaluating co-phasing or piston errors of
future large segmented telescopes in quasi real-time. This communication
presents an original, recently proposed technique for direct WFE sensing. The
principle of the device, which is named "Telescope-Interferometer" (TI), is
based on the addition of a reference optical arm into the telescope pupil
plane. Then incident WFEs are deduced from Point Spread Function (PSF)
measurements at the telescope focal plane. Herein are described two different
types of TIs, and their performance are discussed in terms of intrinsic
measurement accuracy and spatial resolution. Various error sources are studied
by means of numerical simulations, among which photon noise sounds the most
critical. Those computations finally help to define the application range of
the TI method in an AO regime, including main and auxiliary telescope diameters
and magnitude of the guide star. Some practical examples of optical
configurations are also described and commented.
