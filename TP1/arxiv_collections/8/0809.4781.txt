In an incomplete market setting, we consider two financial agents, who wish
to price and trade a non-replicable contingent claim. Assuming that the agents
are utility maximizers, we propose a transaction price which is a result of the
minimization of a convex combination of their utility differences. We call this
price the risk sharing price, we prove its existence for a large family of
utility functions and we state some of its properties. As an example, we
analyze extensively the case where both agents report exponential utility.
