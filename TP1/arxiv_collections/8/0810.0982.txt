It is shown, that our contemporary knowledge of geometry is insufficient,
because we know only axiomatizable geometries. With such a knowledge of
geometry one cannot investigate properly physics of microcosm and structure of
elementary particles. One can obtain only a phenomenological systematics of
elementary particles, whose construction does not need a discrimination
mechanism. The discrimination mechanism, responsible for discrete
characteristics of elementary particles, can be created only on the basis of a
granular (discrete and continuous simultaneously) space-time geometry.
