The influence of the bremsstrahlung on the spin motion is expressed by the
equation which is the analogue and generalization of the
Bargmann-Michel-Telegdi equation. The new constant is involved in this
equation. This constant can be immediately determined by the experimental
measurement of the spin motion, or it follows from the classical limit of
quantum electrodynamics with radiative corrections.
