In this letter we discuss a method for generating synchrony-optimized
coupling architectures of Kuramoto oscillators with a heterogeneous
distribution of native frequencies. The method allows us to relate the
properties of the coupling network to its synchronizability. These relations
were previously only established from a linear stability analysis of the
identical oscillator case. We further demonstrate that the heterogeneity in the
oscillator population produces heterogeneity in the optimal coupling network as
well. Two rules for enhancing the synchronizability of a given network by a
suitable placement of oscillators are given: (i) native frequencies of adjacent
oscillators must be anti-correlated and (ii) frequency magnitudes should
positively correlate with the degree of the node they are placed at.
