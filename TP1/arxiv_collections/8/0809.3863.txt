We study analytically the optical properties of a simple model for an
electron-hole pair on a ring subjected to perpendicular magnetic flux and
in-plane electric field. We show how to tune this excitonic system from
optically active to optically dark as a function of these external fields. Our
results offer a simple mechanism for exciton storage and read-out.
