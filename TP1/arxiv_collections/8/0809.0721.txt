The response of hadrons to electromagnetic probes is highly constrained by
chiral dynamics; but, in some cases, predictions have not compared well with
experimental data. The lattice can be used to test the chiral electromagnetism
of hadrons and ultimately confront experiment. We use background field
techniques to study the electromagnetic polarizabilities of hadrons. Focusing
on simulations in background electric fields, we present preliminary results
for both charged and neutral particle polarizabilities. The former are
extracted using a novel method.
