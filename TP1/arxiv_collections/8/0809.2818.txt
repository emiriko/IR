Social Communities in bibliographic databases exist since many years,
researchers share common research interests, and work and publish together. A
social community may vary in type and size, being fully connected between
participating members or even more expressed by a consortium of small and
individual members who play individual roles in it. In this work, we focus on
social communities inside the bibliographic database DBLP and characterize
communities through a simple typifying description model. Generally, we
understand a publication as a transaction between the associated authors. The
idea therefore is to concern with directed associative relationships among
them, to decompose each pattern to its fundamental structure, and to describe
the communities by expressive attributes. Finally, we argue that the
decomposition supports the management of discovered structures towards the use
of adaptive-incremental mind-maps.
