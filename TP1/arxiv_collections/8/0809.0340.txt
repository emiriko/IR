We present a detailed analysis of the production efficiency of weakly bound
heteronuclear KRb-Feshbach molecules using radio frequency association in a
harmonic trap. The efficiency was measured in a wide range of temperatures,
binding energies and radio frequencies. A comprehensive analytical model is
presented, explaining the observed asymmetric spectra and achieving good
quantitative agreement with the measured production rates. This model provides
a deep understanding of the molecule association process and paves the way for
future experiments which rely on Feshbach molecules e.g. for the production of
deeply bound molecules.
