We consider the DBI action for the D-branes with the dynamic embeddings in
the background produced by p-branes. For the D-brane with the special topology
we obtain two Hublle parameters on this brane. The condition for the equality
of these parameters is analyzed. In the special case a mass and a charge of the
background p-branes are derived from this condition.
