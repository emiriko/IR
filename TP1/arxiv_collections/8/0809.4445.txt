A given dynamics for a composite quantum system can exhibit several distinct
properties for the asymptotic entanglement behavior, like entanglement sudden
death, asymptotic death of entanglement, sudden birth of entanglement, etc. A
classification of the possible situations was given in [M. O. Terra Cunha,
{\emph{New J. Phys}} {\bf{9}}, 237 (2007)] but for some classes there were no
known examples. In this work we give a better classification for the possibile
relaxing dynamics at the light of the geometry of their set of asymptotic
states and give explicit examples for all the classes. Although the
classification is completely general, in the search of examples it is
sufficient to use two qubits with dynamics given by differential equations in
Lindblad form (some of them non-autonomous). We also investigate, in each case,
the probabilities to find each possible behavior for random initial states.
