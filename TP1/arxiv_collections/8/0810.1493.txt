Studies are cited indicating that gravitino production acts as a natural
upper bound to Li6 and Li7 levels, based on what happens after hadronic decay
of relic 1 TeV into 100 GeV gravitinos at 1000 s. after the Big Bang. The
produced gravitinos contribute a large fraction of required dark matter
density. Whether or not gravitinos can be linked to neutrino production depends
on which model of dark matter (DM) is assumed or used. A model presented by the
author in 2008 links DM of about 100 GeV -- based on a phenomenological
Lagrangian creating different Neutrino masses without SUSY -- with a dark
matter candidate of about 100 GeV. This may tie in 100 GeV gravitinos with
neutrino physics.
