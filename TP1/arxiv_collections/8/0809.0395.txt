The phenomenon of storage and parametrically-stimulated recovery of a
microwave signal in a ferrite film has been studied both experimentally and
theoretically. The microwave signal is stored in the form of standing spin-wave
modes existing in the film due to its finite thickness. Signal recovery is
performed by means of frequency-selective amplification of one of these
standing modes by double- requency parametric pumping process. The time of
recovery, as well as the duration and magnitude of the recovered signal, depend
on the timing and amplitudes of both the input and pumping pulses. A mean-field
theory of the recovery process based on the competitive interaction of the
signal-induced standing spin-wave mode and thermal magnons with the parametric
pumping field is developed and compared to the experimental data.
