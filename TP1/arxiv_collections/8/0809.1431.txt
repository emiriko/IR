Multivariate versions of classical orthogonal polynomials such as Jacobi,
Hahn, Laguerre and Meixner are reviewed and their connection explored by
adopting a probabilistic approach. Hahn and Meixner polynomials are interpreted
as posterior mixtures of Jacobi and Laguerre polynomials, respectively. By
using known properties of gamma point processes and related transformations, a
new infinite-dimensional version of Jacobi polynomials is constructed with
respect to the size-biased version of the Poisson--Dirichlet weight measure and
to the law of the gamma point process from which it is derived.
