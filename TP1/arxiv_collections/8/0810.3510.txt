Some of the non-relativistic QQ/bar interaction potentials and its
isospectral partner-potentials have been employed to evaluate the masses and
leptonic decay widths of Charmonium and Upsilon states. An attempt has been
made to develop a prescription to provide a simultaneous fit to Masses and
leptonic decay widths of Quarkonia. Preliminary calculation shows that the
class of isospectral-potentials corresponding to: V(r)= -(alphas/r)+ar^n
appears to yield the desired results. The various associated theoretical and
phenomenological issues are discussed in light of recent data. The possible
relation with the 'Wrinkled potentials' is also discussed.
