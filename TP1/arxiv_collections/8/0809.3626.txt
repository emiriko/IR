For every $\alpha<\omega_1$ we establish the existence of a separable Banach
space whose Szlenk index is $\omega^{\alpha\omega+1}$ and which is universal
for all separable Banach spaces whose Szlenk-index does not exceed
$\omega^{\alpha\omega}$. In order to prove that result we provide an intrinsic
characterization of which Banach spaces embed into a space admitting an FDD
with upper estimates.
