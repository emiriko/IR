As a subproduct of the Schoof-Elkies-Atkin algorithm to count points on
elliptic curves defined over finite fields of characteristic p, there exists an
algorithm that computes, for l an Elkies prime, l-torsion points in an
extension of degree l-1 at cost O(l max(l, \log q)^2) bit operations in the
favorable case where l < p/2.
  We combine in this work a fast algorithm for computing isogenies due to
Bostan, Morain, Salvy and Schost with the p-adic approach followed by Joux and
Lercier to get for the first time an algorithm valid without any limitation on
l and p but of similar complexity.
