We review a performance of Fock space methods in calculating spectra of a
range of supersymmetric models with gauge symmetry. Examples include: a) SU(2)
Supersymmetric Yang Mills Quantum Mechanics in four euclidean dimensions, b)
Quantum Mechanics of one fermion and one boson with infinite number of colours,
and c) planar 1+1 dimensional Yang Mills theories with adjoint matter. Infrared
divergencies of the latter theories with scalars are briefly discussed and a
possible dynamical solution of the problem is suggested.
