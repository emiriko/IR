In this paper we prove a viability result for multidimensional, time
dependent, stochastic differential equations driven by fractional Brownian
motion with Hurst parameter1/2 < H < 1, using pathwise approach. The sufficient
condition is also an alternative global existence result for the fractional
differential equations with restrictions on the state.
