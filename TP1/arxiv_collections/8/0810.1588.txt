Upon passing an a.c. electrical current along magnetic micro- or nanostrips,
the measurement of a d.c. voltage that depends sensitively on current frequency
and applied field has been recently reported by A. Yamaguchi and coworkers. It
was attributed to the excitation of spin waves by the spin transfer torque,
leading to a time-varying anisotropic magnetoresistance and, by mixing of a.c.
current and resistance, to a d.c. voltage. We have performed a quantitative
analysis by micromagnetics, including the spin transfer torque terms considered
usually, of this situation. The signals found from the spin transfer torque
effect are several orders of magnitude below the experimental values, even if a
static inhomogeneity of magnetization (the so-called ripple) is taken into
account. On the other hand, the presence of a small non-zero average Oersted
field is shown to be consistent with the full set of experimental results, both
qualitatively and quantitatively. We examine, quantitatively, several sources
for this average field and point to the contacts to the sample as a likely
origin.
