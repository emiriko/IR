AMS-02 is a space-borne magnetic spectrometer designed to measure with very
high accuracy the composition of Cosmic Rays near Earth. With a large
acceptance of 5000 squared centimeters, an intense magnetic field from a
superconducting magnet (0.7 T) and a very efficient particle identification,
AMS-02 will provide the highest precision in Cosmic Rays measurements up to the
TeV region. During a three-years mission on board of the International Space
Station, AMS-02 will achieve a sensitivity to the existence of anti-Helium
nuclei in the Cosmic Rays of one part in a billion, as well as provide
important information on the origin and nature of the Dark Matter.
