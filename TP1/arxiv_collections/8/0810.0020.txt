We investigate the possible measurement of parity-violating spin asymmetries
in jet pair production in proton-proton collisions at the Brookhaven
Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), with the goal to constrain
longitudinally polarized quark and antiquark distribution functions. A
measurable asymmetry could be observed in the vicinity of the massive weak W
boson resonance, where the parity-violating signal appears above the
parity-conserving background and is enhanced by interference of the strong and
electroweak production amplitudes. We discuss the potential for such
measurements, perhaps the first opportunity to measure a parity-violating
asymmetry in proton-proton collisions at RHIC. Sensitivity of this measurement
to the polarization of down-type antiquarks is demonstrated.
