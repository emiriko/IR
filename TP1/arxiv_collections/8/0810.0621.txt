A simple kinematic model based on superposition of p+p collisions,
relativistic geometry and final-state hadronic rescattering is used to
calculate various hadronic observables in s(NN)**(1/2) = 200 GeV Au+Au
collisions and s(NN)**(1/2) = 5.5 TeV Pb+Pb collisions. The model calculations
are compared with experimental results from several s(NN)**(1/2) = 200 GeV
Au+Au collision studies. If a short hadronization time is assumed in the model,
it is found that this model describes the trends of the observables from these
experiments surprisingly well considering the model's simplicity. This also
gives more credibility to the model predictions presented for s(NN)**(1/2) =
5.5 TeV Pb+Pb collisions.
