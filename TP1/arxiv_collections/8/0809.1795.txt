Two photon decays of scalar mesons f_0(980), a_0(980), \sigma(600) in the
quark Nambu - Jona - Lasinio (NJL) model are calculated. The contributions of
the meson loops are taken into account along with the quark loops (Hartree -
Fock approximation). This corresponds to the next order of the 1/N_c expansion,
where
  N_c=3 is the number of quark colors. It is shown that the meson and quark
loops give comparable contributions to the amplitude. Moreover, in the process
f_0(980)-> \gamma \gamma the kaon loop plays the dominant role. A similar
situation takes place in the decay
  \phi -> f_0(980) \gamma \cite{physrev}.
  Our results are in satisfactory agreement with the recent experimental data.
