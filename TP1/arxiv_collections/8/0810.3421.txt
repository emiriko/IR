We show that the absence of pre-switching oscillations ("incubation delay")
in magnetic tunnel junctions can be explained within the macrospin model by a
sizable field-like component of the spin-transfer torque. It is further
suggested that measurements of the voltage dependence of tunnel junction
switching time in the presence of external easy axis magnetic fields can be
used to determine the magnitude and voltage dependence of the field-like
torque.
