In general, a nilpotent orbit closure in a complex simple Lie algebra \g,
does not have a crepant resolution. But, it always has a Q-factorial
terminalization by the minimal model program. According to B. Fu, a nilpotent
orbit closure has a crepant resolution only when it is a Richardson orbit, and
the resolution is obtained as a Springer map for it.
  In this paper, we shall generalize this result to Q-factorial
terminalizations when \g$ is classical. Here, the induced orbits play an
important role instead of Richardson orbits.
