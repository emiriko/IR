We demonstrate the use of Langevin spin dynamics for studying dynamical
properties of an archetypical spin glass system. Simulations are performed on
CuMn (20% Mn) where we study the relaxation that follows a sudden quench of the
system to the low temperature phase. The system is modeled by a Heisenberg
Hamiltonian where the Heisenberg interaction parameters are calculated by means
of first-principles density functional theory. Simulations are performed by
numerically solving the Langevin equations of motion for the atomic spins. It
is shown that dynamics is governed, to a large degree, by the damping parameter
in the equations of motion and the system size. For large damping and large
system sizes we observe the typical aging regime.
