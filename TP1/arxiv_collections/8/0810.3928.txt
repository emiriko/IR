We present the first experimental study that maps the transformation of
nuclear quadrupole resonances from the pure nuclear quadrupole regime to the
quadrupole-perturbed Zeeman regime. The transformation presents an interesting
quantum-mechanical problem, since the quantization axis changes from being
aligned along the axis of the electric-field gradient tensor to being aligned
along the magnetic field. We achieve large nuclear quadrupole shifts for I =
3/2 131-Xe by using a 1 mm^3 cubic cell with walls of different materials. When
the magnetic and quadrupolar interactions are of comparable size, perturbation
theory is not suitable for calculating the transition energies. Rather than use
perturbation theory, we compare our data to theoretical calculations using a
Liouvillian approach and find excellent agreement.
