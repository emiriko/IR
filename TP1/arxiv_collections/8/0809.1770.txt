In this presentation, we briefly review recent investigations on pion and
kaon structures from the instanton vacuum. Starting from the low-energy QCD
partition function, we have computed the Gasser-Leutwyler low-energy constants,
electromagnetic form factors of the pion and kaon, semileptonic decay form
factors of the kaon, and light-cone distribution amplitues of the pion and
kaon. The results are in good agreement with the experimental and empirical
data.
