The objective of this paper is to share our enthusiasm for optical pumping
experiments and to encourage their use in researches on practical physics. The
experimental technique has been well developed and the apparatus sophisticated,
but, by paying attention to a few details, reliable operation can be repeated.
Some theoretical principles for optical pumping are also introduced and they
can be demonstrated experimentally.
