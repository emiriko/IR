We study the scattering process of photons confined in a one dimensional
optical waveguide by a laser controlled atomic ensemble. The investigation
leads to an alternative setup of quantum node controlling the coherent transfer
of single photon in such one dimensional continuum. To exactly solve the
effective scattering equations by using the discrete coordinate approach, we
simulate the linear waveguide as a coupled resonator array at the high energy
limit. We generally calculate the transmission coefficients and its vanishing
at resonace reflects the good controllability of our scheme. We also show that
there exist two bound states to describe the localize photons around the
cavity.
