We develop an incremental-tableau-based decision procedure for the
multi-agent epistemic logic MAEL(CD) (aka S5_n (CD)), whose language contains
operators of individual knowledge for a finite set Ag of agents, as well as
operators of distributed and common knowledge among all agents in Ag. Our
tableau procedure works in (deterministic) exponential time, thus establishing
an upper bound for MAEL(CD)-satisfiability that matches the (implicit)
lower-bound known from earlier results, which implies ExpTime-completeness of
MAEL(CD)-satisfiability. Therefore, our procedure provides a complexity-optimal
algorithm for checking MAEL(CD)-satisfiability, which, however, in most cases
is much more efficient. We prove soundness and completeness of the procedure,
and illustrate it with an example.
