Hybrid magnetometers based on a normal conducting sensor and a
superconducting flux concentrator have been investigated. When this sensor is
operated in an unshielded environment flux vortices can be trapped in the
superconducting body when the sensor is cooled. Thermal hopping of the trapped
vortices gives rise to 1/f noise. The mechanism for vortex trapping has been
investigated. A new model for the critical field for vortex trapping and vortex
densities has been derived. Experimental verification on YBa2Cu3O7-delta (YBCO)
strips with a Scanning SQUID Microscope shows very good agreement between
measurements and the new theory. The results have been applied in a hybrid
magnetometer design based on a bismuth Hall sensor and an YBCO flux
concentrator. Measurements show a field gain up to G=7 with a large effective
range of 175uT.
