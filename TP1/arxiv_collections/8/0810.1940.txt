In this paper we present an overview of radio frequency (RF) spectroscopy in
the atomic Fermi superfluids. An ultimate goal is to suggest new directions in
the cold gas research agenda from the condensed matter perspective.Our focus is
on the experimental and theoretical literature of cold gases and photoemission
spectroscopy of the cuprates particularly as it pertains to areas of overlap.
This paper contains a systematic overview of the theory of RF spectroscopy,
both momentum integrated and momentum resolved. We discuss the effects of
traps, population imbalance, final state interactions over the entire range of
temperatures and compare theory and experiment. We show that this broad range
of phenomena can be accomodated within the BCS-Leggett description of BCS-BEC
crossover and that this scheme also captures some of the central observations
in photoemission experiments in the cuprates. In this last context, we note
that the key themes which have emerged in cuprate photoemission studies involve
characterization of the fermionic self energy, of the pseudogap and of the
effects of superconducting coherence (in passing from above to below the
superfluid transition temperature, $T_c$).These issues have a counterpart in
the cold Fermi gases and it would be most useful in future to use these atomic
systems to address these and the more sweeping question of how to describe that
anomalous superfluid phase which forms in the presence of a normal state
excitation gap.
