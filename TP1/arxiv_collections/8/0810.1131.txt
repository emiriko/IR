In this preliminary work, I provide the outline of an argument (leaving the
full proof to a future publication) that there exists a valid renormalization
group blocking transformation which converts the continuum fermion action into
a Ginsparg-Wilson lattice action. I construct the blocking for the massless
overlap operator as a specific example, indicating how other Ginsparg-Wilson
lattice Dirac operators can be derived in a similar fashion. This
renormalization group transformation modifies the gauge action and adds a
number of irrelevant terms to the lattice action. The procedure is not valid
for lattice Dirac operators which do not exactly satisfy the Ginsparg-Wilson
relation, for example the Wilson operator.
