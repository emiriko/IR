Considering the Casimir effect due to phononic excitations of a weakly
interacting dilute {BEC}, we derive a re-normalized expression for the zero
temperature Casimir energy $\mathcal{E}_c$ of a {BEC} confined to a parallel
plate geometry with periodic boundary conditions. Our expression is formally
equivalent to the free energy of a bosonic field at finite temperature, with a
nontrivial density of modes that we compute analytically. As a function of the
interaction strength, $\mathcal{E}_c$ smoothly describes the transition from
the weakly interacting Bogoliubov regime to the non-interacting ideal {BEC}.
For the weakly interacting case, $\mathcal{E}_c$ reduces to leading order to
the Casimir energy due to zero-point fluctuations of massless phonon modes. In
the limit of an ideal Bose gas, our result correctly describes the Casimir
energy going to zero.
