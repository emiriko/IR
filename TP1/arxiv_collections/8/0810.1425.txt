In this paper we consider moduli spaces of coherent systems on an elliptic
curve. We compute their Hodge polynomials and determine their birational types
in some cases. Moreover we prove that certain moduli spaces of coherent systems
are isomorphic. This last result uses the Fourier-Mukai transform of coherent
systems introduced by Hern\'andez Ruiperez and Tejero Prieto.
