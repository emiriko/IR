We report dynamic control of magnetization precession by light alone. A
ferromagnetic (Ga,Mn)As epilayer was used for experiments. Amplitude of
precession was modulated to a large extent by tuning the time interval between
two successive optical pump pulses which induced torques on magnetization
through a non-thermal process. Nonlinear effect in precession motion was also
discussed.
