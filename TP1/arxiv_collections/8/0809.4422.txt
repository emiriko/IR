The Born Interpretation of the wave function gives only the relative
frequencies as the number of observations approaches infinity. Using the
Many-Worlds Interpretation of quantum mechanics, specifically the fact that
there must exist other versions of ourselves in the multiverse, I show that the
observed frequencies should approach the Born frequencies as 1/N, where N is
the number of observations. In the body of the paper I state this convergence
rate precisely as AN EASILY TESTABLE FORMULA. We can therefore test the central
claim of the MWI by measuring the convergence rate to the final Born frequency.
Conversely, the MWI allows us to calculate this convergence rate.
