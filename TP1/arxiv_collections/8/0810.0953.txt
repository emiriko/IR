Partial decay widths and branching fractions are calculated for the exclusive
decays of the Standard Model Higgs boson into a pair of vector quarkonium
states, $ H\to J/\psi J/\psi, H\to \Upsilon \Upsilon, H\to J/\psi \phi, H\to
J/\psi \Upsilon$, with relativistic corrections due to quark motion in mesons
taken into account.
