Spin evolution of a mixture of two species of spin-1 Bose-Einstein
condensates (Rb and Na) has been investigated beyond the mean field theory.
Both analytical expression and numerical results on the populations of
spin-components are obtained. The interference is found to depend on the
initial states and the inter-species interaction sensitively. A number of
phenomena arising from the interference have been predicted. In particular,
periodic behavior and the alternate appearances of a zone of oscillation and a
long quiet zone are found.
