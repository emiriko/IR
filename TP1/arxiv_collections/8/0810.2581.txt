We construct special solutions to the rational quantum Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov
equation associated with the Lie algebra $gl_N$. The main ingredient is a
special class of the shifted non-symmetric Jack polynomials. It may be regarded
as a shifted version of the singular polynomials studied by Dunkl. We prove
that our solutions contain those obtained as a scaling limit of matrix elements
of the vertex operators of level one.
