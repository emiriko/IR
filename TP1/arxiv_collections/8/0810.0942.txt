To date, most efforts to demonstrate quantum nonlocality have concentrated on
systems of two (or very few) particles. It is however difficult in many
experiments to address individual particles, making it hard to highlight the
presence of nonlocality. We show how a natural setup with no access to
individual particles allows one to violate the CHSH inequality with many pairs,
including in our analysis effects of noise and losses. We discuss the case of
distinguishable and indistinguishable particles. Finally, a comparison of these
two situations provides new insight into the complex relation between
entanglement and nonlocality.
