Lattice QCD is used to calculate the potential between a static quark and
anti-quark in the presence of a finite density of pi^+'s. Correlation functions
of multiple pi^+'s are used in conjunction with Wilson-loop correlators to
determine the difference between the Q\overline{Q}-potential in free-space and
in the presence of a pion condensate. The modifications to the potential are
found to have significant dependence on the Q\overline{Q} separation over the
range r < 1 fm explored in this work. Our results are consistent with the
pion-condensate behaving as a (nonlinear) chromo-dielectric.
