The global first passage time density of a network is the probability that a
random walker released at a random site arrives at an absorbing trap at time T.
We find simple expressions for the mean global first passage time <T> for five
fractals. We also find an exact expression for the second moment <T^2> and show
that the variance of the first passage time, Var(T), scales with the number of
nodes within the fractal N such that Var(T) ~ N^(4/\bar{d}), where \bar{d} is
the spectral dimension.
