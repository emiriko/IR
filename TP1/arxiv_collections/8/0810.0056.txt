The discoveries of superconductivity in heavily boron-doped diamond (C:B) in
2004 and silicon (Si:B) in 2006 renew the interest in the superconducting state
of semiconductors. Charge-carrier doping of wide-gap semiconductors leads to a
metallic phase from which upon further doping superconductivity can emerge.
Recently, we discovered superconductivity in a closely related system:
heavily-boron doped silicon carbide (SiC:B). The sample used for that study
consists of cubic and hexagonal SiC phase fractions and hence this lead to the
question which of them participates in the superconductivity. Here we focus on
a sample which mainly consists of hexagonal SiC without any indication for the
cubic modification by means of x-ray diffraction, resistivity, and ac
susceptibility.
