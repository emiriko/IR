The mixed spin-1/2 and spin-1 Ising model on the Bethe lattice with both
uniaxial as well as biaxial single-ion anisotropy terms is exactly solved by
combining star-triangle and triangle-star mapping transformations with exact
recursion relations. Magnetic properties (magnetization, phase diagrams and
compensation phenomenon) are investigated in detail. The particular attention
is focused on the effect of uniaxial and biaxial single-ion anisotropies that
basically influence the magnetic behavior of the spin-1 atoms.
