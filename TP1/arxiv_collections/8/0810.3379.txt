We propose to the create vortices in spin-1 condensates via magnetic
dipole-dipole interaction. Starting with a polarized condensate prepared under
large axial magnetic field, we show that by gradually inverting the field,
population transfer among different spin states can be realized in a controlled
manner. Under optimal condition, we generate a doubly quantized vortex state
containing nearly all atoms in the condensate. The resulting vortex state is a
direct manifestation of the dipole-dipole interaction and spin textures in
spinor condensates. We also point out that the whole process can be
qualitatively described by a simple rapid adiabatic passage model.
