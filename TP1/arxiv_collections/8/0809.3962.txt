We describe the definition and the role background independence and the
closely related notion of diffeomorphism invariance play in modern string
theory. These important concepts are transformed by a new understanding of
gauge redundancies and their implementation in non-perturbative quantum field
theory and quantum gravity. This new understanding also suggests a new role for
the so-called background-independent approaches to directly quantize the
gravitational field. This article is intended for a general audience, and is
based on a plenary talk given in the Loops 2007 conference in Morelia, Mexico.
