We discuss the properties of complex manifolds having rational homology of
$S^1 \times S^{2n-1}$ including those constructed by Hopf, Kodaira and
Brieskorn-van de Ven. We extend certain previously known vanishing properties
of cohomology of bundles on such manifolds.As an application we consider
degeneration of Hodge-deRham spectral sequence in this non Kahler setting.
