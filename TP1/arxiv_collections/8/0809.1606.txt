Jet quenching measurements using leading particles and their correlations
suffer from known biases, which can be removed via direct reconstruction of
jets in central heavy ion collisions. In this talk, we discuss several modern
jet reconstruction algorithms and background subtraction techniques that are
appropriate to heavy ion collisions.
