We study a quantum dot Josephson junction inside an Aharonov-Bohm
environment. The geometry is modeled by an Anderson impurity coupled to two
directly-linked BCS leads. We illustrate that the well-established picture of
the low-energy physics being governed by an interplay of two distinct (singlet
and doublet) phases is still valid for this interferometric setup. The phase
boundary depends, however, non-monotonically on the coupling strength between
the superconductors, causing the system to exhibit re-entrance behavior and
multiple phase transitions. We compute the zero-temperature Josephson current
and demonstrate that it can become negative in the singlet phase by virtue of
the Coulomb interaction U. As a starting point, the limit of large
superconducting energy gaps \Delta=\infty is solved analytically. In order to
tackle arbitrary \Delta<\infty and U>0, we employ a truncated functional
renormalization group scheme which was previously demonstrated to give
quantitatively reliable results for the quantum dot Josephson problem.
