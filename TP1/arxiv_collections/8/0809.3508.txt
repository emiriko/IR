Heavy-ion collisions will enter a new era with the start of the CERN Large
Hadron Collider (LHC). A first short run with proton-proton collisions at the
injection energy of 0.9 TeV will be followed by a longer one with $pp$
collisions at 10 TeV. First Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=5.5 TeV will
take place in 2009. Three experiments (ALICE, ATLAS, and CMS) will study both
$pp$ and Pb-Pb collisions. A selection of results showing the capabilities of
the three experiments for the study of the LHC medium with electromagnetic
probes is presented.
