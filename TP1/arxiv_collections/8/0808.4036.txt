We study the phase behaviour of a fluid composed of particles which interact
via a pair potential that is repulsive for large inter-particle distances, is
attractive at intermediate distances and is strongly repulsive at short
distances (the particles have a hard core). As well as exhibiting gas-liquid
phase separation, this system also exhibits phase transitions from the uniform
fluid phases to modulated inhomogeneous fluid phases. Starting from a
microscopic density functional theory, we develop an order parameter theory for
the phase transition in order to examine in detail the phase behaviour. The
amplitude of the density modulations is the order parameter in our theory. The
theory predicts that the phase transition from the uniform to the modulated
fluid phase can be either first order or second order (continuous). The phase
diagram exhibits two tricritical points, joined to one another by the line of
second order transitions.
