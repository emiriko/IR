We discuss some of the drawbacks of using event horizons to define black
holes and suggest ways in which black holes can be described without event
horizons, using trapping horizons. We show that these trapping horizons give
rise to thermodynamic behavior and possibly Hawking radiation too. This raises
the issue of whether the event horizon or the trapping horizon should be seen
as the true boundary of a black hole. This difference is important if we
believe that quantum gravity will resolve the central singularity of the black
hole and clarifies several of the issues associated with black hole
thermodynamics and information loss.
