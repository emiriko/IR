In quantum mechanics some properties are maximally incompatible, such as the
position and momentum of a particle or the vertical and horizontal projections
of a 2-level spin. Given any definite state of one property the other property
is completely random, or unbiased. For N-level systems, the 6-level ones are
the smallest for which a tomographically efficient set of N+1 mutually unbiased
bases (MUBs) has not been found. To facilitate the search, we numerically
extend the classification of unbiased bases, or Hadamards, by incrementally
adjusting relative phases in a standard basis. We consider the non-unitarity
caused by small adjustments with a second order Taylor expansion, and choose
incremental steps within the 4-dimensional nullspace of the curvature. In this
way we prescribe a numerical integration of a 4-parameter set of Hadamards of
order 6.
