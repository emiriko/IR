Borexino is a massive, calorimetric, liquid scintillator detector aimed at
the detection of low energy sub-MeV solar neutrinos, installed at the Gran
Sasso Laboratory. After several years of construction, data taking started in
May 2007, providing immediately incontrovertible evidence of the unprecedented
radiopurity of the target mass, at the level required to ensure the successful
detection of 7Be solar neutrinos, which was then announced in the 2007 summer.
In this talk first the main technical characteristics of the detector will be
highlighted, with special emphasis on the exceptional purity challenges
successfully faced by the Collaboration, and afterwards the physics outputs
reached so far will be carefully reported and illustrated, together with the
perspectives for the future measurements that will complete the broad program
of the experiment.
