Several decades ago, John McKay suggested a correspondence between nodes of
the affine E8 Dynkin diagram and certain conjugacy classes in the Monster
group. Thanks to Monstrous Moonshine, this correspondence can be recast as an
assignment of discrete subgroups of PSL2 to nodes of the affine E8 Dynkin
diagram. The purpose of this article is to give an explanation for this latter
correspondence using elementary properties of the group PSL2. We also obtain a
super analogue of McKay's observation, in which conjugacy classes of the
Monster are replaced by conjugacy classes of Conway's group -- the automorphism
group of the Leech lattice.
