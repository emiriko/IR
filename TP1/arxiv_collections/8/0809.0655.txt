We report our numerical simulation of two-dimensional N=(2,2) super
Yang-Mills. The lattice model we use is one proposed by F.Sugino which keeps
one exact supersymmetry at finite lattice spacing. We use Rational Hybrid Monte
Carlo (RHMC) method to implement the dynamical fermion. We apply the simulation
to measure the ground state energy which is useful to observe dynamical SUSY
breaking.
