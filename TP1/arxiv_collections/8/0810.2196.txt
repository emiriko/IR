Transport properties of high quality Nb/semiconductor/Nb long Josephson
junctions based on metamorphic In_0.75Ga_0.25As epitaxial layers are reported.
Different junction geometries and fabrication procedures are presented that
allow a systematic comparison with quasiclassical theory predictions. The
impact of junction transparency is highlighted and a procedure capable of
yielding a high junction quality factor is identified.
