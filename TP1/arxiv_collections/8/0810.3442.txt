We examine a naming game with two agents trying to establish a common
vocabulary for n objects. Such efforts lead to the emergence of language that
allows for an efficient communication and exhibits some degree of homonymy and
synonymy. Although homonymy reduces the communication efficiency, it seems to
be a dynamical trap that persists for a long, and perhaps indefinite, time. On
the other hand, synonymy does not reduce the efficiency of communication, but
appears to be only a transient feature of the language. Thus, in our model the
role of synonymy decreases and in the long-time limit it becomes negligible. A
similar rareness of synonymy is observed in present natural languages. The role
of noise, that distorts the communicated words, is also examined. Although, in
general, the noise reduces the communication efficiency, it also regroups the
words so that they are more evenly distributed within the available "verbal"
space.
