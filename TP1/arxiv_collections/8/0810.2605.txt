Measurements of the polar Kerr effect using a zero-area-loop Sagnac
magnetometer on Pb/Ni and Al/(Co-Pd) proximity-effect bilayers show unambiguous
evidence for the "inverse proximity effect," in which the ferromagnet (F)
induces a finite magnetization in the superconducting (S) layer. To avoid
probing the magnetic effects in the ferromagnet, the superconducting layer was
prepared much thicker than the light's optical penetration depth. The sign and
size of the effect, as well as its temperature dependence agree with recent
predictions by Bergeret et al..
