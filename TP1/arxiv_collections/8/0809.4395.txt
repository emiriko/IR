The miniaturisation of computing devices has seen computing devices become
increasingly pervasive in society. With this increased pervasiveness, the
technologies of small computing devices have also improved. Mobile devices are
now capable of capturing various forms of multimedia and able to communicate
wirelessly using increasing numbers of communication techniques. The owners and
creators of local content are motivated to share this content in ever
increasing volume; the conclusion has been that social networks sites are
seeing a revolution in the sharing of information between communities of
people. As load on centralised systems increases, we present a novel
decentralised peer-to-peer approach dubbed the Market Contact Protocol (MCP) to
achieve cost effective, scalable and efficient content sharing using
opportunistic networking (pocket switched networking), incentive,
context-awareness, social contact and mobile devices. Within the report we
describe how the MCP is simulated with a superimposed geographic framework on
top of the JiST (Java in Simulation Time) framework to evaluate and measure its
capability to share content between massively mobile peers. The MCP is shown in
conclusion to be a powerful means by which to share content in a massively
mobile ad-hoc environment.
