The half-life for double beta decay of 150-Nd has been measured by the NEMO-3
experiment at the Modane Underground Laboratory. Using 924.7 days of data
recorded with 36.55 g of 150-Nd the half-life for 2nubb decay is measured to be
T_1/2^2nu = (9.11+0.25_-0.22}(stat.) +- 0.63 (syst.)) x 10^18 years. The
observed limit on the half-life for neutrinoless double beta decay is found to
be T_1/2^{0nu} > 1.8 x 10^22 years at 90 % Confidence Level. This translates
into a limit on the effective Majorana neutrino mass of <m_{neutrino}><4.0-6.3
eV if the nuclear deformation is taken into account. We also set limits on
models involving Majoron emission, right-handed currents and transitions to
excited states.
