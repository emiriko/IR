In this document we present several recent (July 2008) results from studies
of the top quark properties at the CDF and D0 experiments at the Tevatron.
Measurements of several top quark properties, as well as tests of new physics
in the top quark production and decay sectors are presented. In the latter
case, no significant evidence for physics beyond the Standard Model is
uncovered, and the tightest constraints to date are placed on most of the new
physics scenarios investigated.
