We calculate the spectral density of the phi meson in a hot bath of nucleons
and pions using a general formalism relating self-energy to the forward
scattering amplitude (FSA). In order to describe the low energy FSA, we use
experimental data along with a background term. For the high energy FSA, a
Regge parameterization is employed. We verify the resulting FSA using
dispersion techniques. We find that the position of the peak of the spectral
density is slightly shifted from its vacuum position and that its width is
considerably increased. The width of the spectral density at a temperature of
150 MeV and at normal nuclear density is more than 90 MeV.
