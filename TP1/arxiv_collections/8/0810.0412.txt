A semiconductor-based terahertz-detector strategy, exploiting a
bound-to-bound-to-continuum architecture, is presented and investigated. In
particular, a ladder of equidistant energy levels is employed, whose step is
tuned to the desired detection frequency and allows for sequential multi-photon
absorption. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that the proposed
multi-subband scheme could represent a promising alternative to conventional
quantum-well infrared photodetectors in the terahertz spectral region.
