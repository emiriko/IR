A recent paper [V. L. Campo et. al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 240403 (2007) has
proposed a two-parameter scaling method to determine the phase diagram of the
fermionic Hubbard model from optical lattice experiments. Motivated by this
proposal, we investigate in more detail, the behavior of the ground-state
energy per site as a function of trap size(L) and confining potential (V(x) =
t(x/L)^alpha) in the one-dimensional case. Using the BALDA-DFT method, we find
signatures of critical behavior as alpha goes to infinity.
