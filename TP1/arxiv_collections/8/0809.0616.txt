We present a computer simulation model that reproduces, event-by-event, the
wave mechanical results of double-slit and two-beam interference experiments.
The same model also simulates a one-to-one copy of a single-photon interference
experiment with a Fresnel biprism (Jacques V. et al., Eur. Phys. J. D, 35
(2005) 561). The model satisfies Einstein's criterion of local causality and is
solely based on experimental facts, comprising the apparatuses used in the
experiment and the observation of individual detector clicks. Our results prove
that it is possible to give a particle-only description of single-photon
double-slit experiments.
