In this article there are two main results. The first result gives a formula,
in terms of a log resolution, for the graded pieces of the Hodge filtration on
the cohomology of a unitary local system of rank one on the complement of an
arbitrary divisor in a smooth projective complex variety. The second result is
an application of the first. We give a combinatorial formula for the spectrum
of a hyperplane arrangement. M. Saito recently proved that the spectrum of a
hyperplane arrangement depends only on combinatorics. However, a combinatorial
formula was missing. The formula is achieved by a different method.
