A model of sequential resonant tunneling transport between two-dimensional
subbands that takes into account explicitly elastic scattering is investigated.
It is compared to transport measurements performed on quantum cascade lasers
where resonant tunneling processes are known to be dominating. Excellent
agreement is found between experiment and theory over a large range of current,
temperature and device structures.
