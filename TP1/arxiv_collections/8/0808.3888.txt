Unique electronic properties of self-organized Au atom chains on Ge(001) in
novel c(8x2) long-range order are revealed by scanning tunneling microscopy.
Along the nanowires an exceptionally narrow conduction path exists which is
virtually decoupled from the substrate. It is laterally confined to the
ultimate limit of single atom dimension, and is strictly separated from its
neighbors, as not previously reported. The resulting tunneling conductivity
shows a dramatic inhomogeneity of two orders of magnitude. The atom chains thus
represent an outstandingly close approach to a one-dimensional electron liquid.
