We review and discuss the role of diffeomorphism symmetry in quantum gravity
models. Such models often involve a discretization of the space-time manifold
as a regularization method. Generically this leads to a breaking of the
symmetries to approximate ones, however there are incidences in which the
symmetries are exactly preserved. Both kind of symmetries have to be taken into
account in covariant and canonical theories in order to ensure the correct
continuum limit. We will sketch how to identify exact and approximate
symmetries in the action and how to define a corresponding canonical theory in
which such symmetries are reflected as exact and approximate constraints.
