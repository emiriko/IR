This paper provides applications of patching to quadratic forms and central
simple algebras over function fields of curves over henselian valued fields. In
particular, we use a patching approach to reprove and generalize a recent
result of Parimala and Suresh on the u-invariant of p-adic function fields, for
p odd. The strategy relies on a local-global principle for homogeneous spaces
for rational algebraic groups, combined with local computations.
