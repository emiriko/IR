I argue that conventional estimates of the criterion for classical behavior
of a macroscopic body are incorrect, because they do not take into account the
locality of interactions, which characterizes the behavior of all systems
described approximately by local quantum field theory. Black holes are the only
localized objects which do not have such a description. The deviations from
classical behavior of a macroscopic body, except for those which can be
described as classical uncertainties in the initial values of macroscopic
variables,are {\it exponentially} small as a function of the volume of the
macro-system in microscopic units.
