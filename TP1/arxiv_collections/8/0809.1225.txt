We work on the uniqueness, gr-qc/0504147, of representations of the
holonomy-flux algebra in loop quantum gravity. We argue that for analytic
diffeomorphisms, the flux operators can be only constants as functions on the
configuration space in representations with no anomaly, which are zero in the
standard representation.
