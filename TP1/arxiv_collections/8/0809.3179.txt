This paper deals with the kinematic and dynamic analyses of the Orthoglide
5-axis, a five-degree-of-freedom manipulator. It is derived from two
manipulators: i) the Orthoglide 3-axis; a three dof translational manipulator
and ii) the Agile eye; a parallel spherical wrist. First, the kinematic and
dynamic models of the Orthoglide 5-axis are developed. The geometric and
inertial parameters of the manipulator are determined by means of a CAD
software. Then, the required motors performances are evaluated for some test
trajectories. Finally, the motors are selected in the catalogue from the
previous results.
