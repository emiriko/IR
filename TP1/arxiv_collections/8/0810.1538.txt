In a thin magnetic nanostripe, an anti-vortex nucleates inside a moving
domain wall when driven by an in-plane magnetic field greater than the
so-called Walker field. The nucleated anti-vortex must cross the width of the
nanostripe before the domain wall can propagate again, leading to low average
domain wall speeds. A large out-of-plane magnetic field, applied
perpendicularly to the plane of the nanostripe, inhibits the nucleation of the
anti-vortex leading to fast domain wall speeds for all in-plane driving fields.
We present micromagnetic simulation results relating the anti-vortex dynamics
to the strength of the out-of-plane field. An asymmetry in the motion is
observed which depends on the alignment of the anti-vortex core magnetic
moments to the direction of the out-of-plane field. The size of the core is
directly related to its crossing speed, both depending on the strength of the
perpendicular field and the alignment of the core moments and direction of the
out-of-plane field.
