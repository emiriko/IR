The reconstruction of an Ag monolayer on Ag/Pt(111) is analyzed
theoretically, employing a vertically extended Frenkel-Kontorova model whose
parameters are derived from density functional theory. Energy minimization is
carried out using simulated quantum annealing techniques. Our results are
compatible with the STM experiments, where a striped pattern is initially found
which transforms into a triangular reconstruction upon annealing. In our model
we recognize the first structure as a metastable state, while the second one is
the true energy minimum.
