Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) is the most popular
transmission technology in digital terrestrial broadcasting (DTTB), adopted by
many DTTB standards. In this paper, the bit error rate (BER) performance of two
DTTB systems, namely cyclic prefix OFDM (CP-OFDM) based DVB-T and time domain
synchronous OFDM (TDS-OFDM) based DTMB, is evaluated in different channel
conditions. Spectrum utilization and power efficiency are also discussed to
demonstrate the transmission overhead of both systems. Simulation results show
that the performances of the two systems are much close. Given the same ratio
of guard interval (GI), the DVB-T outperforms DTMB in terms of signal to noise
ratio (SNR) in Gaussian and Ricean channels, while DTMB behaves better
performance in Rayleigh channel in higher code rates and higher orders of
constellation thanks to its efficient channel coding and interleaving scheme.
