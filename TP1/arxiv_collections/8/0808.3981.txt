The deformation kinetics for glassy polymers confined in microscopic domain
at very low temperature regime was investigated using a transition-rate-state
dependent model considering the shear thinning behavior which means, once
material being subjected to high shear rates, the viscosity diminishes with
increasing shear rate. The preliminary results show that there might be nearly
frictionless fields for rate of deformation due to the almost vanishing shear
stress in micropores at very low temperature regime subjected to some surface
conditions : The relatively larger roughness (compared to the macroscopic
domain) inside micropores and the slip. As the pore size decreases, the
surface-to-volume ratio increases and therefore, surface roughness will greatly
affect the deformation kinetics in micropores.
  By using the boundary perturbation method, we obtained a class of temperature
and activation energy dependent fields for the deformation kinetics at low
temperature regime with the presumed small wavy roughness distributed along the
walls of an cylindrical micropore. The critical deformation kinetics of the
glassy matter is dependent upon the temperature, activation energy, activation
volume, orientation dependent and is proportional to the (referenced) shear
rate, the slip length, the amplitude and the orientation of the wavy-roughness.
