We analyze the motion of a pressure control system described by a
differential equation with nonlocal dissipative force. This system is composed
by an oscillator, a membrane and a constant force. We consider the dissipative
memory kernel consisting of two terms. One of them is described by the Dirac
delta function which represents a local friction, whereas for the second one we
consider two types: the exponential and power-law functions which represent
nonlocal dissipative forces. For these cases, one can obtain exact solutions
for the displacement and velocity. The long-time behaviors of these quantities
are also investigated.
