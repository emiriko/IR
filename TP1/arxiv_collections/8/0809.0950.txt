We study evolution of metals from Mott insulators in the carrier-doped 2D
Hubbard model using a cluster extension of the dynamical mean-field theory.
While the conventional metal is simply characterized by the Fermi surface (pole
of the Green function G), interference of the zero surfaces of G with the pole
surfaces becomes crucial in the doped Mott insulators. Mutually interfering
pole and zero surfaces are dramatically transferred over the Mott gap, when
lightly doped holes synergetically loosen the doublon-holon binding. The heart
of the Mott physics such as the pseudogap, hole pockets, Fermi arcs, in-gap
states, and Lifshitz transitions appears as natural consequences of this global
interference in the frequency space.
