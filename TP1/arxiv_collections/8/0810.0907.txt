This letter presents results on the precision measurement of the top quark
mass and a combination of the best CDF top mass measurements. A combination by
the TevEWWG (Tevatron electroweak working group) of the best top mass results
from CDF and D0 in Run 1 and Run 2 of the Tevatron is also presented. This
result is the current world average, and offers an uncertainty less than 1%.
The new mass value has been included in traditional LEP EWWG fits to precision
electroweak data, and implications for the Standard Model Higgs have been
derived.
