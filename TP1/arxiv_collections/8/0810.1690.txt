We investigate the dynamics of a 10 fs light pulse propagating in a random
medium by the direct solution of the 3D Maxwell equations. Our approach employs
molecular dynamics to generate a distribution of spherical scatterers and a
parallel finite-difference time-domain code for the vectorial wave propagation.
We calculate the disorder-averaged energy velocity and the decay time of the
transmitted pulse Versus the localization length for an increasing refractive
index.
