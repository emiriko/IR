We investigate the connection between the transport properties and the
thermodynamics of electronic systems with a tendency to form broken-symmetry
mesophases evocative of the physics of liquid crystals. Through a hydrodynamic
approach to the electronic transport in inhomogeneous systems, we develop a
perturbative expansion for the macroscopic conductivity to study the transport
of two-dimensional smectic and nematic phases. At the fluctuation induced first
order phase transition expected for the smectic to isotropic transition, a jump
in the macroscopic conductivity is predicted, with a directional dependence
that reflects the fluctuation spectrum of the order parameter. When elastic
fluctuation modes melt the smectic phase into a nematic phase, the resultant
nematic order parameter is shown to be linearly proportional to the
conductivity anisotropy. We also outline qualitative comparisons with recent
experimental works on strongly correlated materials that show evidences of
electronic liquid-crystalline mesophases.
