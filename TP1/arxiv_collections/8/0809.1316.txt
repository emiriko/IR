A thorough critical analysis of the theoretical relationships between the
bond-angle dispersion in a-Si and the width of the transverse optical (TO)
Raman peak is presented. It is shown that the discrepancies between them are
drastically reduced when unified definitions for these magnitudes are used.
This reduced dispersion in the predicted values of the bond-angle dispersion
together with the broad agreement with its scarce direct determinations is then
used to analyze the strain energy in partially relaxed pure a-Si. It is
concluded that defect annihilation does not contribute appreciably to reducing
the a-Si energy during structural relaxation. In contrast, it can account for
half of the crystallization energy, which can be as low as 7 kJ/mol in
defect-free a-Si.
