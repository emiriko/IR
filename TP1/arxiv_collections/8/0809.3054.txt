We study the Yukawa corrections to the gamma gamma --> b\bar{b} corss section
in the topcolor assisted technicolor models at the photon-photon colliders. We
find that, for the favorable parameters, the relative corrections from pseudo
Goldstone bosons give out a 3.2%--5.9% decrement of the cross section from the
tree level when \sqrt{s}=500 GeV, the contributions from new extended
technicolor gauge bosons Z* and colored gauge bosons B are negligibly small,
and the relative correction arising from new color-singlet heavy gauge boson Z'
is less than -3.2%. Therefore, the total relative corrections are significantly
larger than the corresponding corrections in the standard model, the general
two Higgs doublet model and the minimal supersymmetric standard model. Since
these corrections are obvious for the International Linear Colliders, the
process gamma gamma --> b\bar{b} is really interesting in testing the standard
model and searching for the signs of technicolor.
