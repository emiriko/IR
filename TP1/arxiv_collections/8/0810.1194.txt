The photoproduction of K+ mesons is an important challenge to recent QCD
based chiral perturbation theories in the strange quark sector and is an
important constraint on the nucleon excitation spectrum. We present preliminary
data from a new high precision measurement using the Crystal Ball detector. The
measurement pioneers a new technique for tagging strangeness using detailed
cluster analysis in segmented calorimeters which has potential wider
application at present and future hadron physics facilities.
