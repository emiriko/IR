In some fields such as Mathematics Mechanization, automated reasoning and
Trustworthy Computing etc., exact results are needed. Symbolic computations are
used to obtain the exact results. Symbolic computations are of high complexity.
In order to improve the situation, exactly interpolating methods are often
proposed for the exact results and approximate interpolating methods for the
approximate ones. In this paper, we study how to obtain exact interpolation
polynomial with rational coefficients by approximate interpolating methods.
