For a relativistic charged particle moving in a constant electromagnetic
field, its velocity 4-vector has been well studied. However, despite the fact
that both the electromagnetic field and the equations of motion are purely
real, the resulting 4-velocity is seemingly due to a complex electromagnetic
field. This work shows that this is not due to some complex formalism used
(such as Clifford algebra) but is intrinsically due to the fact that the
$o(3,1)$ Lie algebra of the Lorentz group is equivalent to two commuting
complex $su(2)$ algebras. Expressing the complex $su(2)$ generators in terms of
the boost and rotation operators then naturally introduces a complex
electromagnetic field. This work solves the equation of motion not as a matrix
equation, but as an operator evolution equation in terms of the generators of
the Lorentz group. The factorization of the real evolution operator into two
commuting complex evolution operators then directly gives the time evolution of
the velocity 4-vector without any reference to an intermediate field.
