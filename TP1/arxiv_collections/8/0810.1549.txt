We study the instabilities occurring during the burst of an air balloon in a
liquid. These instabilities are typical for the deformation of an interface
between two fluids of different densities, similar to fingering in
Rayleigh-Taylor instability (see e.g. Sharp, 1984). In the Video a series of
bursts are shown for air balloons in different liquids. When the balloon tears
it tracks the surface, generating wrinkles and releasing the pressure inside.
Apparently, the texture of the surface during the burst becomes smoother as the
viscosity increases. During the burst the surface breaks and generates several
small bubbles. Furthermore, the pressure inside the balloon is higher than the
external pressure before the burst; once the balloon tears the pressure is
released and the generated bubbles pulsate several times (see e.g. Brennen,
1995). Such oscillations are more evident for higher internal pressures.
