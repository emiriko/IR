We examine the effects of magnetic moments of right-handed neutrinos, whose
masses are set at around TeV scale, then it is plausible to have a large
enhancement for the production cross section of TeV scale right-handed
neutrinos though the Drell-Yan process, e^+ e^- to gamma, Z* to N_i N_j, which
is within the reach of the future linear collider (ILC).
