We calculate the predictions for lepton flavour violating (LFV) tau and muon
decays, $l_j \to l_i \gamma$, $l_j \to 3 l_i$, $\mu-e$ conversion in nuclei and
LFV semileptonic tau decays $\tau \to \mu PP$ with $PP= \pi^+\pi^-, \pi^0\pi^0,
K^+K^-, K^0 {\bar K}^0$ $\tau \to \mu P$ with $P=\pi^0, \eta, \eta'$ and $\tau
\to \mu V$ with $V = \rho^0, \phi$, performing the hadronisation of quark
bilinears within the chiral framework. We work within a SUSY-seesaw context
where the particle content of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model is
extended by three right-handed neutrinos plus their corresponding SUSY
partners, and where a seesaw mechanism for neutrino mass generation is
implemented. Two different scenarios with either universal or non-universal
soft supersymmetry breaking Higgs masses at the gauge coupling unification
scale are considered. After comparing the predictions with present experimental
bounds and future sensitivities, the most promising processes are particularly
emphasised.
