In the previous paper (Li, X. Z., Xi, P., Zhai, X. H.: Phys. Lett. B{\bf666},
125-130 (2008)), we show the solutions of Einstein equations with static
spherically-symmetric quintessence-like matter surrounding a global monopole.
Furthermore, this monopole become a black hole with quintessence-like matter
and a deficit solid angle when it is swallowed by an ordinary black hole. We
study its quasinormal modes by WKB method in this paper. The numerical results
show that both the real part of the quasinormal frequencies and the imaginary
part decrease as the state parameter $w$, for scalar and gravitational
perturbations. And we also show variations of quasinormal frequencies of scalar
and gravitational fields via different $\epsilon$ (deficit solid angel
parameter) and different $\rho_0$ (density of static spherically-symmetric
quintessence-like matter at $r=1$), respectively.
