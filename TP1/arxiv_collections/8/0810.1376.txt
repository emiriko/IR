We study the influence that population density and the road network have on
each others' growth and evolution. We use a simple model of formation and
evolution of city roads which reproduces the most important empirical features
of street networks in cities. Within this framework, we explicitely introduce
the topology of the road network and analyze how it evolves and interact with
the evolution of population density. We show that accessibility issues -pushing
individuals to get closer to high centrality nodes- lead to high density
regions and the appearance of densely populated centers. In particular, this
model reproduces the empirical fact that the density profile decreases
exponentially from a core district. In this simplified model, the size of the
core district depends on the relative importance of transportation and rent
costs.
