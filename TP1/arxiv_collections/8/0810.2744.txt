In this work we compute the Chen--Ruan cohomology and the stringy Chow ring
of the moduli spaces of smooth and stable $n$-pointed curves of genus 1. We
suggest a definition for an Orbifold Tautological Ring in genus 1, which is
both a subring of the Chen--Ruan cohomology and of the stringy Chow ring.
