We propose a new cosmological paradigm in which our observed expanding phase
is originated from an initially large contracting Universe that subsequently
experienced a bounce. This category of models, being geodesically complete, is
non-singular and horizon-free, and can be made to prevent any relevant scale to
ever have been smaller than the Planck length. In this scenario, one can find
new ways to solve the standard cosmological puzzles. One can also obtain scale
invariant spectra for both scalar and tensor perturbations: this will be the
case, for instance, if the contracting Universe is dust-dominated at the time
at which large wavelength perturbations get larger than the curvature scale. We
present a particular example based on a dust fluid classically contracting
model, where a bounce occurs due to quantum effects, in which these features
are explicit.
