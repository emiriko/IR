This paper concerns arithmetic families of $\varphi$-modules over reduced
affinoid spaces. For such a family, we first prove that the slope polygons is
lower semicontinuous around any rigid point. If the slope polygons are locally
constant around a rigid point, we further prove that around this point, the
family has a global slope filtration after base change to some extended Robba
ring.
