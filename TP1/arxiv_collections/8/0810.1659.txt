A scheme which allows to compute the dynamics of strongly correlated
classical ions embedded into a partiallzy ionized quantum plasma by first
principles molecular dynamics is presented. The dynamically screened dust
approach of Joyce and Lampe [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 88}, 095006 (2002] ist
generalized to quantum systems. The electrons are treated fully
quantum-mechanically taking into account their dynamical screening of the
ion-ion interaction in linear response on the basis of an extended Mermin
formula. The scheme allows to include the effect of the electron dynamics,
electron streaming, wake effects and electron magnetization.
