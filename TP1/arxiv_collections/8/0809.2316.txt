The correlation between the nuclear stopping and the scale invariant nucleon
sideward flow at energies ranging from those available at the GSI heavy ion
synchrotron (SIS) to those at the CERN Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) is
studied within ultrarelativistic quantum molecular dynamics (UrQMD). The
universal behavior of the two experimental observables for various colliding
systems and scale impact parameters are found to be highly correlated with each
other. As there is no phase transition mechanism involved in the UrQMD, the
correlation may be broken down by the sudden change of the bulk properties of
the nuclear matter, such as the formation of quark-gluon plasma (QGP), which
can be employed as a QGP phase transition signal in high-energy heavy ion
collisions. Furthermore, we also point out that the appearance of a breakdown
of the correlation may be a powerful tool for searching for the critical point
on the QCD phase diagram.
