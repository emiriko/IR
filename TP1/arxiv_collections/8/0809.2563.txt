J. Nash proved that the geometry of any Riemannian manifold M imposes no
restrictions to be embedded isometrically into a (fixed) ball
B_{\mathbb{R}^{N}}(1) of the Euclidean space R^N. However, the geometry of M
appears, to some extent, imposing restrictions on the mean curvature vector of
the embedding.
