In this paper we derive an updating scheme for calculating some important
network statistics such as degree, clustering coefficient, etc., aiming at
reduce the amount of computation needed to track the evolving behavior of large
networks; and more importantly, to provide efficient methods for potential use
of modeling the evolution of networks. Using the updating scheme, the network
statistics can be computed and updated easily and much faster than
re-calculating each time for large evolving networks. The update formula can
also be used to determine which edge/node will lead to the extremal change of
network statistics, providing a way of predicting or designing evolution rule
of networks.
