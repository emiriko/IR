We explore the effects of the anomalous $tbW$ couplings on the $\bd$ mixing
and recently measured $\bs$ mixing. The combined analysis of mixings via box
diagrams with penguin decays provides strong constraints on the anomalous top
quark couplings. We find the bound from the $\bd$ mixing data is stronger than
that from the $\bs$ mixing.
