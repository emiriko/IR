In this article we present a study of the electrical resistivity of
Yb(Rh-xIrx)2Si2, x=0.06, under high pressure and in magnetic field. Ir
substitution is expanding the unit cell and leads to a suppression of the
antiferromagnetic transition temperature to zero, where eventually a quantum
critical point (QCP) exists. We applied hydrostatic pressure to reverse the
effect of substitution. Our results indicate that Yb(Rh0.94Ir0.06)2Si2 is
situated in the immediate proximity to a volume controlled QCP, but still on
the magnetically ordered side of the phase diagram. The temperature - pressure
phase diagram of Yb(Rh0.94Ir0.06)2Si2 resembles that of the pure compound.
Substitution acts mainly as chemical pressure. Disorder introduced by
substitution has only minor effects.
