We show that the global balance of information dynamics for general quantum
measurements given in [F. Buscemi, M. Hayashi, and M. Horodecki, Phys.Rev.Lett.
100, 210504 (2008)] makes it possible to unify various and generally
inequivalent approaches adopted in order to derive information-disturbance
tradeoffs in quantum theory. We focus in particular on those tradeoffs,
constituting the vast majority of the literature on the subject, where
disturbance is defined either in terms of average output fidelity or of
entanglement fidelity.
