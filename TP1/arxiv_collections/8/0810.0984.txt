Let $\Sigma_{g,p}$ be a closed oriented surface of genus $g\geq 1$ with $p$
punctures. Let $\rm Mod(\Sigma_{\textit{g,p}})$ be the mapping class group of
$\Sigma_{g,p}$. Wajnryb proved in [Wa] that for $p=0, 1$ $\rm
Mod({\Sigma_{\textit{g,p}}})$ is generated by two elements. Korkmaz proved in
[Ko] that one of these generators can be taken as a Dehn twist. For $p\geq 2$,
We proved that $\rm Mod(\Sigma_{\textit{g,p}})$ is generated by three elements.
