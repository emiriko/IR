Possible existence of black holes remnants provides a suitable candidates for
dark matter. In this paper we study the possibility of existence for such
remnants. We consider quantum gravitational induced corrections of black hole's
entropy and temperature to investigate the possibility of such relics.
Observational scheme for detection of these remnants and their cosmological
constraints are discussed.
