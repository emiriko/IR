In many physical, statistical, biological and other investigations it is
desirable to approximate a system of points by objects of lower dimension
and/or complexity. For this purpose, Karl Pearson invented principal component
analysis in 1901 and found 'lines and planes of closest fit to system of
points'. The famous k-means algorithm solves the approximation problem too, but
by finite sets instead of lines and planes. This chapter gives a brief
practical introduction into the methods of construction of general principal
objects, i.e. objects embedded in the 'middle' of the multidimensional data
set. As a basis, the unifying framework of mean squared distance approximation
of finite datasets is selected. Principal graphs and manifolds are constructed
as generalisations of principal components and k-means principal points. For
this purpose, the family of expectation/maximisation algorithms with nearest
generalisations is presented. Construction of principal graphs with controlled
complexity is based on the graph grammar approach.
