We show that phase space bounds on the eigenvalues of Schr\"{o}dinger
operators can be derived from universal bounds recently obtained by E. M.
Harrell and the author via a monotonicity property with respect to coupling
constants. In particular, we provide a new proof of sharp Lieb-Thirring
inequalities.
