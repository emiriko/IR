We present a first-principles study of multiferroic BiFeO3 at high pressures.
Our work reveals the main structural (change in Bi's coordination and loss of
ferroelectricity), electronic (spin crossover and metallization), and magnetic
(loss of order) effects favored by compression and how they are connected. Our
results are consistent with the striking manifold transition observed
experimentally by Gavriliuk et al. [Phys. Rev. B 77, 155112 (2008)] and provide
an explanation for it.
