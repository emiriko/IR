A stripline-type near-field microwave probe is microfabricated for microwave
impedance microscopy. Unlike the poorly shielded coplanar probe that senses the
sample tens of microns away, the stripline structure removes the stray fields
from the cantilever body and localizes the interaction only around the
focused-ion beam deposited Pt tip. The approaching curve of an oscillating tip
toward bulk dielectrics can be quantitatively simulated and fitted to the
finite-element analysis result. The peak signal of the approaching curve is a
measure of the sample dielectric constant and can be used to study unknown bulk
materials.
