Let $\bm{i}=1+q+...+q^{i-1}$. For certain sequences $(r_1,...,r_l)$ of
positive integers, we show that in the Hecke algebra $\mathscr{H}_n(q)$ of the
symmetric group $\mathfrak{S}_n$, the product $(1+\bm{r_1}T_{r_1})...
(1+\bm{r_l}T_{r_l})$ has a simple explicit expansion in terms of the standard
basis $\{T_w\}$. An interpretation is given in terms of random walks on
$\mathfrak{S}_n$.
