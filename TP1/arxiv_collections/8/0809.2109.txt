Tunnel junction between two superconductors is considered in the vicinity of
the critical temperature. Superconductive fluctuations above Tc give rise to
the noise of the ac Josephson current although the current itself is zero in
average. As a result of fluctuations, current noise spectrum is peaked at the
Josephson frequency, which may be considered as precursor of superconductivity
in the normal state. Temperature dependence and shape of the Josephson current
noise resonance line is calculated for various junction configurations.
