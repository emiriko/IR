Acyclic preferences recently appeared as an elegant way to model many
distributed systems. An acyclic instance admits a unique stable configuration,
which can reveal the performance of the system. In this paper, we give the
statistical properties of the stable configuration for three classes of acyclic
preferences: node-based preferences, distance-based preferences, and random
acyclic systems. Using random overlay graphs, we prove using mean-field and
fluid-limit techniques that these systems have an asymptotically continuous
independent rank distribution for a proper scaling, and the analytical solution
is compared to simulations. These results provide a theoretical ground for
validating the performance of bandwidth-based or proximity-based unstructured
systems.
