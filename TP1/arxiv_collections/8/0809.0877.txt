We propose a theoretical description of possible orientational glass
transition in solid molecular para-hydrogen and ortho-deuterium under pressure
supposing that they are mixtures of J=0 and J=2 states of molecules. The theory
uses the basic concepts and methods of standard spin-glass theory. We expect
our orientational glass to correspond the II' phase of the high pressure
hydrogen phase diagram.
