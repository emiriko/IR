In string theory, black-hole backgrounds are far from unique and there are
large families of completely smooth, horizonless geometries with the same
structure as a black hole from infinity down to the neighborhood of the
black-hole horizon. These microstate geometries cap off in foam of topological
bubbles. I review some of the recent progress in constructing these smooth
horizonless geometries and discuss some of the physical implications.
