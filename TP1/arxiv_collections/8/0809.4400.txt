We study the decay of vortices in Bose-Einstein condensates at finite
temperatures by means of the Zaremba Nikuni Griffin formalism, in which the
condensate is modelled by a Gross Pitaevskiiequation, which is coupled to a
Boltzmann kinetic equation for the thermal cloud. At finite temperature, an
off-centred vortex in a harmonically trapped pancake shaped condensate decays
by spiralling out towards the edge of the condensate. This decay, which depends
heavily on temperature and atomic collisions, agrees with that predicted by the
Hall Vinen phenomenological model of friction force, which is used to describe
quantised vorticity in superfluid systems. Our result thus clarifies the
microscopic origin of the friction and provides an ab initio determination of
its value.
