This contribution adds to the points on the <indeterminacy of special
relativity> made by De Abreu and Guerra. We show that the Lorentz
Transformation can be composed by the physical observations made in a frame K
of events in a frame K-prime viz i) objects in K-prime are moving at a speed v
relative to K, ii) distances and time intervals measured by K-prime are at
variance with those measured by K and iii) the concept of simultaneity is
different in K-prime compared to K. The order in which the composition is
executed determines the nature of the middle aspect (ii). This essential
uncertainty of the theory can be resolved only by a universal synchronicity as
discussed in [1] based on the unique frame in which the one way speed of light
is constant in all directions.
