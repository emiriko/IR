We present a measure of local information transfer, derived from an existing
averaged information-theoretical measure, namely transfer entropy. Local
transfer entropy is used to produce profiles of the information transfer into
each spatiotemporal point in a complex system. These spatiotemporal profiles
are useful not only as an analytical tool, but also allow explicit
investigation of different parameter settings and forms of the transfer entropy
metric itself. As an example, local transfer entropy is applied to cellular
automata, where it is demonstrated to be a novel method of filtering for
coherent structure. More importantly, local transfer entropy provides the first
quantitative evidence for the long-held conjecture that the emergent traveling
coherent structures known as particles (both gliders and domain walls, which
have analogues in many physical processes) are the dominant information
transfer agents in cellular automata.
