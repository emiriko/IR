We investigate the quark mass dependence of meson and baryon masses obtained
from 2+1 flavor dynamical quark simulations performed by the PACS-CS
Collaboration. With the use of SU(2) and SU(3) chiral perturbation theories up
to NLO, we examine the chiral behavior of the pseudoscalar meson masses and the
decay constants in terms of the degenerate up-down quark mass ranging form 3
MeV to 24 MeV and two choices of the strange quark mass around the physical
value. We discuss the convergence of the SU(2) and SU(3) chiral expansions and
present the results for the low energy constants. We find that the SU(3)
expansion is not convergent at NLO for the physical strange quark mass. The
chiral behavior of the nucleon mass is also discussed based on the SU(2) heavy
baryon chiral perturbation theory up to NNLO. Our results show that the
expansion is well behaved only up to m_pi^2 ~ 0.2 GeV^2.
