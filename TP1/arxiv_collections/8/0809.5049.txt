Eigenvalues of a Wilson loop operator are gauge invariant and their
distribution undergoes a transition at infinite N as the size of the loop is
changed. We study this transition using the average characteristic polynomial
associated with the Wilson loop operator. We derive the scaling function in a
certain double scaling limit for two dimensional QCD and hypothesize that the
transition in three and four dimensional QCD are in the same universality
class. Numerical evidence for this hypothesisis provided in three dimensions
