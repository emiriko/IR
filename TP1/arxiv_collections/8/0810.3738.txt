As the Tevatron luminosity increases sophisticated selections are required to
be efficient in selecting rare events among a very huge background. To cope
with this problem, CDF has pushed the offline calorimeter algorithm
reconstruction resolution up to Level 2 and, when possible, even up to Level 1,
increasing efficiency and, at the same time, keeping under control the rates.
  The CDF Run II Level 2 calorimeter trigger is implemented in hardware and is
based on a simple algorithm that was used in Run I. This system has worked well
for Run II at low luminosity. As the Tevatron instantaneous luminosity
increases, the limitation due to this simple algorithm starts to become clear:
some of the most important jet and MET (Missing ET) related triggers have large
growth terms in cross section at higher luminosity. In this paper, we present
an upgrade of the Level 2 Calorimeter system which makes the calorimeter
trigger tower information available directly to a CPU allowing more
sophisticated algorithms to be implemented in software. Both Level 2 jets and
MET can be made nearly equivalent to offline quality, thus significantly
improving the performance and flexibility of the jet and MET related triggers.
However in order to fully take advantage of the new L2 triggering capabilities
having at Level 1 the same L2 MET resolution is necessary. The new Level-1 MET
resolution is calculated by dedicated hardware. This paper describes the
design, the hardware and software implementation and the performance of the
upgraded calorimeter trigger system both at Level 2 and Level 1.
