We present a Monte Carlo implementation of medium-induced gluon radiation in
the final-state branching process. Medium effects are introduced through an
additive term in the splitting functions. We have implemented such modification
within PYTHIA. We show the medium effects on the hump-backed plateau, and the
transverse momentum and angular distributions with respect to the parent
parton. As expected, with increasing medium densities there is an increase
(decrease) of partons with small (large) momentum fraction, and angular
broadening is observed. The effects on the transverse-momentum distributions
are more involved, with an enhancement of low- and intermediate-$p_T$ partons
and a decrease at large $p_T$, which is related to energy conservation, and to
the lack of momentum exchange with the medium in our approach.
