In this paper we show that states, transitions and behavior of concurrent
systems can often be modeled as sheaves over a suitable topological space. In
this context, geometric logic can be used to describe which local properties
(i.e. properties of individual systems) are preserved, at a global level, when
interconnecting the systems. The main area of application is to modular
verification of complex systems. We illustrate the ideas by means of an example
involving a family of interacting controllers for trains on a rail track.
