The objective of this article is to complete preliminary results concerning
the time-minimal control of dissipative two-level quantum systems whose
dynamics is governed by Lindblad equations. The extremal system is described by
a 3D-Hamiltonian depending upon three parameters. We combine geometric
techniques with numerical simulations to deduce the optimal solutions.
