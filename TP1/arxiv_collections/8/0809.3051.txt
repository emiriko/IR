These lecture notes aim to provide a self-contained, pedagogical introduction
to the physics of local constraints, fractionalisation and topological liquids
organised around the Rokhsar-Kivelson quantum dimer model. Topics and phenomena
covered include emergent photons, SU(2) invariant spin liquids, valence-bond
solids and Cantor deconfinement, along with an elementary introduction to the
underlying theoretical models and methods.
