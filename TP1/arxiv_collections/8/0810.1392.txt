The orientation fluctuations of the director of a liquid crystal(LC) are
measured after a quench near the Fr\'eedericksz transition, which is a second
order transition driven by an electric field. We report experimental evidence
that, because of the critical slowing down, the LC presents, after the quench,
several properties of an aging system, such as power law scaling versus time of
correlation and response functions. During this slow relaxation, a well defined
effective temperature, much larger than the heat bath temperature, can be
measured using the fluctuation dissipation relation.
