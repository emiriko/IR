The overlapping stage of heavy-ion reactions can be simulated by dynamical
microscopical models, such as those built on the basis of the Molecular
Dynamics (MD) approaches, allowing to study the fragment formation process. The
present performances of the Quantum MD (QMD) code developed at the University
of Milano are discussed, showing results concerning fragment and particle
production at bombarding energies up to $\lsim$ 700 MeV/A, as well as a
preliminary analysis on the isoscaling behaviour of isotopic yield ratios for
reactions with isospin composition N/Z in the (1 - 1.2) range, at a 45 MeV/A
bombarding energy.
