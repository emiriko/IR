We present the results of a search for a new heavy top-like quark, tprime,
decaying to a W boson and another quark using the CDF II Detector in Run II of
the Tevatron ppbar collider. New top-like quarks are predicted in a number of
models of new physics. Using a data sample corresponding to 2.8 fb-1 of
integrated luminosity we fit the observed spectrum of total transverse energy
and reconstructed quark mass to a combination of background plus signal. We see
no evidence for tprime production, so use this result to set limits on the
tprime tprimebar production cross section times the branching ratio of tprime
to Wq and infer a lower limit of 311 GeV/c2 on the mass of the tprime at 95%
CL.
