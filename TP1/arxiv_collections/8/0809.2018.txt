We prove a duality principle for a special class of submanifolds in
pseudo-Euclidean spaces. This class of submanifolds with potential of normals
is introduced in this paper. We prove also, for example, that an arbitrary
Frobenius manifold can be realized as a certain flat submanifold of this very
natural class.
