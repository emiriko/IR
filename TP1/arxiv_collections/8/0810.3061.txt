Kinetics of phase separation transition in boson-fermion cold atom mixtures
is investigated. We identify the parameters at which the transition is governed
by quantum nucleation mechanism, responsible for the formation of critical
nuclei of a stable phase. We demonstrate that for low fermion-boson mass ratio
the density dependence of quantum nucleation transition rate is experimentally
observable. The crossover to macroscopic quantum tunneling regime is analyzed.
Based on a microscopic description of interacting cold atom boson-fermion
mixtures we derive an effective action for the critical droplet and obtain an
asymptotic expression for the nucleation rate in the vicinity of the phase
transition and near the spinodal instability of the mixed phase. We show that
dissipation due to excitations in fermion subsystem play a dominant role close
to the transition point.
