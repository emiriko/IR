A dyadic shell model for the Navier-Stokes equations is studied in the
context of turbulence. The model is an infinite nonlinearly coupled system of
ODEs. It is proved that the unique fixed point is a global attractor, which
converges to the global attractor of the inviscid system as viscosity goes to
zero. This implies that the average dissipation rate for the viscous system
converges to the anomalous dissipation rate for the inviscid system (which is
positive) as viscosity goes to zero. This phenomenon is called the dissipation
anomaly predicted by Kolmogorov's theory for the actual Navier-Stokes
equations.
