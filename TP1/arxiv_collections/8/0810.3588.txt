We present the first light-hadron spectroscopy on a set of $N_f=2+1$
dynamical, anisotropic lattices. A convenient set of coordinates that
parameterize the two-dimensional plane of light and strange-quark masses is
introduced. These coordinates are used to extrapolate data obtained at the
simulated values of the quark masses to the physical light and strange-quark
point. A measurement of the Sommer scale on these ensembles is made, and the
performance of the hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm used for generating the
ensembles is estimated.
