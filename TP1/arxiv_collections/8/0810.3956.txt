We consider billiards in a (1/2)-by-1 rectangle with a barrier midway along a
vertical side. Let NE be the set of directions theta such that the flow in
direction theta is not ergodic. We show that the Hausdorff dimension of the set
NE is either 0 or 1/2, with the latter occurring if and only if the length of
the barrier satisfies the condition of P'erez Marco, i.e. the sum of (loglog
q_{k+1})/q_k is finite, where q_k is the the denominator of the kth convergent
of the length of the barrier.
