Model waveforms are used in gravitational wave data analysis to detect and
then to measure the properties of a source by matching the model waveforms to
the signal from a detector. This paper derives accuracy standards for model
waveforms which are sufficient to ensure that these data analysis applications
are capable of extracting the full scientific content of the data, but without
demanding excessive accuracy that would place undue burdens on the model
waveform simulation community. These accuracy standards are intended primarily
for broad-band model waveforms produced by numerical simulations, but the
standards are quite general and apply equally to such waveforms produced by
analytical or hybrid analytical-numerical methods.
