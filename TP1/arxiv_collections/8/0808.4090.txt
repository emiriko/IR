We present a theory for two-particle entanglement production and detection in
mesoscopic conductors at finite temperature. In contrast to the zero
temperature limit, the entanglement of the density matrix projected out of the
emitted many-body state is different from the entanglement of the reduced
density matrix, detectable by current correlation measurements. We show that
under very general conditions the reduced entanglement constitutes a lower
bound for the projected entanglement. Applying the theory to the recent
experiment [Neder et al, Nature 448 333 (2007)] on a fermionic Hanbury Brown
Twiss two-particle interferometer we find that despite an appreciable
entanglement production in the experiment, the detectable entanglement is close
to zero.
