We propose and investigate a fibre-based quantum key distribution system,
which employs polarization qubits encoded into faint laser pulses. As a novel
feature, it allows sending of classical framing information via sequences of
strong laser pulses that precede the quantum data. This allows synchronization,
sender and receiver identification, and compensation of time-varying
birefringence in the communication channel. Furthermore, this method also
provides a platform to communicate implementation specific information such as
encoding and protocol in view of future optical quantum networks. All optical
components can be operated at Gbps rates, which is a first requirement for Mbps
secret key rates.
