Studies of the phase diagram of the coupled sine circle map lattice have
identified the presence of two distinct universality classes of spatiotemporal
intermittency viz. spatiotemporal intermittency of the directed percolation
class with a complete set of directed percolation exponents, and spatial
intermittency which does not belong to this class. We show that these two types
of behavior are special cases of a spreading regime where each site can infect
its neighbors permitting an initial disturbance to spread, and a non-spreading
regime where no infection is possible, with the two regimes being separated by
a line, the infection line. The coupled map lattice can be mapped on to an
equivalent cellular automaton which shows a transition from a probabilistic
cellular automaton to a deterministic cellular automaton at the infection line.
The origins of the spreading-non-spreading transition in the coupled map
lattice, as well as the probabilistic to deterministic transition in the
cellular automaton lie in a dynamical phenomenon, an attractor-widening crisis
at the infection line. Indications of unstable dimension variability are seen
in the neighborhood of the infection line. This may provide useful pointers to
the spreading behavior seen in other extended systems.
