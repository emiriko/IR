Damping in 2D and 3D dilute gases is investigated using both the
hydrodynamical approach and the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) approximation .
We found that the both methods are good for the Beliaev damping at zero
temperature and Landau damping at very low temperature, however, at high
temperature, the hydrodynamical approach overestimates the Landau damping and
the HFB gives a better approximation. This result shows that the comparison of
the theoretical calculation using the hydrodynamical approach and the
experimental data for high temperature done by Vincent Liu (PRL {\bf21} 4056
(1997)) is not proper. For two-dimensional systems, we show that the Beliaev
damping rate is proportional to $k^3$ and the Landau damping rate is
proportional to $ T^2$ for low temperature and to $T$ for high temperature. We
also show that in two dimensions the hydrodynamical approach gives the same
result for zero temperature and for low temperature as HFB, but overestimates
the Landau damping for high temperature.
