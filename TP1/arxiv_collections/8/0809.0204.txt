In this paper the dynamics of the interaction of attosecond laser pulses with
matter is investigated. It will be shown that the master equation: modified
Klein-Gordon equation describes the propagation of the heatons. Heatons are the
thermal wave packets. When the duration of the laser pulses is of the order of
attosecond the heaton thermal wave packets are nondispersive objects. For
infinite time the heatons are damped with damping factor of the order of
relaxation time for thermal processes.
