We present the first evidence of WW+WZ production with lepton+jets final
states at a hadron collider. The data correspond to 1.07 inverse femtobarns of
integrated luminosity collected with the D0 detector at the Fermilab Tevatron
Collider in proton-antiproton collisions at sqrt(s)=1.96 TeV. The observed
cross section for WW+WZ production is 20.2 +/- 4.5 pb, consistent with the SM
prediction of 16.1 +/- 0.9 pb. The probability for background fluctuations to
produce an excess equal to or larger than that observed is estimated to be
5.4e-6, corresponding to a significance of 4.4 standard deviations.
