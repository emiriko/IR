The simplicity of single-molecule junctions based on direct bonding of a
small molecule between two metallic electrodes make them an ideal system for
the study of fundamental questions related to molecular electronics. Here we
study the conductance properties of six different molecules suspended between
Pt electrodes. All the molecular junctions show a typical conductance of about
1G0 which is ascribed to the dominant role of the Pt contacts. However, despite
the metallic-like conductivity, the individual molecular signature is
well-expressed by the effect of molecular vibrations in the inelastic
contribution to the conductance.
