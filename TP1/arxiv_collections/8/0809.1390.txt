We continue our previous study on what are the allowed forms of quark mass
matrices in the Randall-Sundrum (RS) framework that can reproduce the
experimentally observed quark mass spectrum and the CKM mixing pattern. We
study the constraints the $\Delta F = 2$ processes in the neutral meson sector
placed on the admissible forms found there, and we found only the asymmetrical
type of quark mass matrices arising from anarchical Yukawa structures stay
viable at the few TeV scale reachable at the LHC. We study also the decay of
the first Kaluza-Klein (KK) excitation of the gluon. We give the decay
branching ratios into quark pairs, and we point out that measurements of the
decay width and just one of the quark spins in the dominant $\bar{t}t$ decays
can be used to extract the effective coupling of the first KK gluon to top
quarks for both chiralities. This provides further probe to the flavour
structure of the RS framework.
