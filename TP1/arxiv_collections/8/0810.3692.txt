In this note we present the results of several searches for physics beyond
the standard model. All final states use 2 inverse fb\of data produced at
Tevatron in p-pbar collisions at 1.96 TeV and collected by the CDF Run II
detector. None of the analysis is heavily optimized for any specific model. All
signatures contain missing transverse energy in the final state and all, except
for one, have at least one photon in the final state. Unfortunately, no
interesting excesses of events over the SM prediction are observed in any final
states, except may be for the last one.
