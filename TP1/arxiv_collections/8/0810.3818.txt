The human society today is far from perfection and conflicts between groups
of humans are frequent events. One example for such conflicts are armed
intergroup conflicts. The collective behavior of the large number of
cooperating participants in these conflicts allows us to describe the conflict
on the basis of models containing only few variables. In this paper we discuss
several cases of conflicts without use of weapons of non-conventional kind. In
the ancient times the Chinese writer Sun Tsu mentioned that the war is an art.
We can confirm that the conflict is an art but with much mathematics at the
background.
