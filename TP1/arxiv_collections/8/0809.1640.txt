We approach the holomorphic analogue to the Quantum Unique Ergodicity
conjecture through an application of the Large Sieve. We deal with shifted
convolution sums as in ([Ho], arXiv:0809.1669), with various simplifications in
our analysis due to the knowledge of the Ramanujan-Petersson conjecture in this
holomorphic case.
