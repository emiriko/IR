We present an exact Quantum Monte Carlo study of the effect of unequal masses
on pair formation in Fermionic systems with population imbalance loaded into
optical lattices. We have considered three forms of the attractive interaction
and find in all cases that the system is unstable and collapses as the mass
difference increases and that the ground state becomes an inhomogeneous
collapsed state. We also address the question of canonical vs grand canonical
ensemble and its role, if any, in stabilizing certain phases.
