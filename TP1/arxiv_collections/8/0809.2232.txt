In a recent paper we have suggested that the finite temperature density
matrix can be computed efficiently by a combination of polynomial expansion and
iterative inversion techniques. We present here significant improvements over
this scheme. The original complex-valued formalism is turned into a purely real
one. In addition, we use Chebyshev polynomials expansion and fast summation
techniques. This drastically reduces the scaling of the algorithm with the
width of the Hamiltonian spectrum, which is now of the order of the cubic root
of such parameter. This makes our method very competitive for applications to
ab-initio simulations, when high energy resolution is required.
