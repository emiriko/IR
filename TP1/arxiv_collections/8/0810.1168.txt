Molecular motors convert chemical energy into mechanical work while operating
in an environment dominated by Brownian motion. The aim of this paper is to
explore the flow of energy between the molecular motors and its surroundings,
in particular, its efficiency. Based on the Fokker-Planck equation with either
$N$ or infinite chemical states, we find that the energy efficiency of the
molecular motors, whether the Stokes efficiency or the usual thermodynamic
efficiency, is strictly bounded by 1, because of the dissipation of the energy
in both the overdamped surroundings and in the process of the chemical
reaction.
