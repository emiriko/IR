The capabilities of the CMS experiment to study properties of hot and dense
QCD-matter created in heavy ion collisions at the CERN Large Hadron Collider
with the perturbative processes (so-called "hard probes") are presented.
Detailed studies from complete simulations of the CMS detectors in Pb+Pb
collisions at $\sqrt{s}=5.5$ TeV per nucleon pair are presented in view of two
hard probes: quarkonium and $\gamma$-jet production.
