In this note, we point out that infinite-volume Gibbs measures of spin glass
models on the hypercube can be identified as random probability measures on the
unit ball of a Hilbert space. This simple observation follows from a result of
Dovbysh and Sudakov on weakly exchangeable random matrices. Limiting Gibbs
measures can then be studied as single well-defined objects. This approach
naturally extends the space of Random Overlap Structures as defined by
Aizenman, Sims and Starr. We discuss the Ruelle Probability Cascades and the
stochastic stability within this framework. As an application, we use an idea
of Parisi and Talagrand to prove that if a sequence of finite-volume Gibbs
measures satisfies the Ghirlanda-Guerra identities, then the infinite-volume
measure must be singular as a measure on a Hilbert space.
