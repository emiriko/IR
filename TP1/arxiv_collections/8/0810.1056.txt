Functional methods are used to study magnetoimpurity states of electrons in
nanostructures. The Keldysh formalism is applied to these states. The theory is
illustrated using a quantum wire sample with impurity atoms capable of
localizing electrons in a magnetic field. The characteristics of
magnetoimpurity states of electrons in the wire are calculated using the model
of a Gaussian separable potential.
