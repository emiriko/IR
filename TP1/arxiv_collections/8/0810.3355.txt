For distinct complex numbers $z_1,...,z_{2N}$, we give a polynomial
$P(y_1,...,y_{2N})$ in the variables $y_1,...,y_{2N}$, which is homogeneous of
degree $N$, linear with respect to each variable, $sl_2$-invariant with respect
to a natural $sl_2$-action, and is of order $N-1$ at
$(y_1,...,y_{2N})=(z_1,...,z_{2N})$.
  We give also a Selberg integral type formula for the associated
one-dimensional space of conformal blocks.
