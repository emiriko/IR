Towards the investigation of the full dynamics in higher-dimensional and/or
stringy gravitational model, we present the basic equations of the
Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity theory. We show $(N+1)$-dimensional version of
the ADM decomposition including Gauss-Bonnet terms, which shall be the standard
approach to treat the space-time as a Cauchy problem. Due to the quasi-linear
property of the Gauss-Bonnet gravity, we find that the evolution equations can
be in a treatable form in numerics. We also show the conformally-transformed
constraint equations for constructing an initial data. We discuss how the
constraints can be simplified by tuning the powers of conformal factors. Our
equations can be used both for timelike and spacelike foliations.
