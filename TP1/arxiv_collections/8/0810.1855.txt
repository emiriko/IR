It is well-known that the Artin-Mazur dynamical zeta function of a hyperbolic
or quasi-hyperbolic toral automorphism is a rational function, which can be
calculated in terms of the eigenvalues of the corresponding integer matrix. We
give an elementary proof of this fact that extends to the case of general toral
endomorphisms without change. The result is a closed formula that can be
calculated by integer arithmetic only. We also address the functional equation
and the relation between the Artin-Mazur and Lefschetz zeta functions.
