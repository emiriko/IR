We demonstrate that the topological Helly theorem and the algebraic
Auslander-Buchsbaum may be viewed as different versions of the same phenomenon.
Using this correspondence we show how the colorful Helly theorem of I.Barany
and its generalizations by G.Kalai and R.Meshulam translates to the algebraic
side. Our main results are algebraic generalizations of these translations,
which in particular gives a syzygetic version of Hellys theorem.
