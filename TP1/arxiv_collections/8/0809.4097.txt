We report measurements of quasiparticle relaxation dynamics in the
high-temperature superconductor (Ba,K)Fe$_{2}$As$_{2}$ in optimally doped,
underdoped and undoped regimes. In the underdoped sample, spin-density wave
(SDW) order forms at $\sim$85 K, followed by superconductivity at $\sim$ 28 K.
We find the emergence of a normal-state order that suppresses SDW at a
temperature $T^{\ast} \sim$ 60 K and argue that this normal-state order is a
precursor to superconductivity.
