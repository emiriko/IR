CoFe/FeMn, FeMn/CoFe bilayers and CoFe/FeMn/CoFe trilayers were grown in
magnetic field and at room temperature. The exchange bias field $H_{eb}$
depends strongly on the order of depositions and is much higher at CoFe/FeMn
than at FeMn/CoFe interfaces. By combining the two bilayer structures into
symmetric CoFe/FeMn($t_\mathrm{FeMn}$)/CoFe trilayers, $H_{eb}^t$ and
$H_{eb}^b$ of the top and bottom CoFe layers, respectively, are both enhanced.
Reducing $t_\mathrm{FeMn}$ of the trilayers also results in enhancements of
both $H_{eb}^b$ and $H_{eb}^t$. These results evidence the propagation of
exchange bias between the two CoFe/FeMn and FeMn/CoFe interfaces mediated by
the FeMn antiferromagnetic order.
