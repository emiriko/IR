We report on two optical realizations of the $1 \to 2$ asymmetric
phase-covariant cloning machines for polarization states of single photons. The
experimental setups combine two-photon interference and tunable polarization
filtering that enables us to control the asymmetry of the cloners. The first
scheme involves a special unbalanced bulk beam splitter exhibiting different
splitting ratios for vertical and horizontal polarizations, respectively. The
second implemented scheme consists of a balanced fiber coupler where photon
bunching occurs, followed by a free-space part with polarization filters. With
this later approach we were able to demonstrate very high cloning fidelities
which are above the universal cloning limit.
