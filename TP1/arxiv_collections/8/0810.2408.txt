We define a new scaling limit of matrix models which can be related to the
method of causal dynamical triangulations (CDT) used when investigating
two-dimensional quantum gravity. Surprisingly, the new scaling limit of the
matrix models is also a matrix model, thus explaining why the recently
developed CDT continuum string field theory (arXiv:0802.0719) has a
matrix-model representation (arXiv:0804.0252).
