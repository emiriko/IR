In the current paper, we present an optimization system solving multi
objective production scheduling problems (MOOPPS). The identification of Pareto
optimal alternatives or at least a close approximation of them is possible by a
set of implemented metaheuristics. Necessary control parameters can easily be
adjusted by the decision maker as the whole software is fully menu driven. This
allows the comparison of different metaheuristic algorithms for the considered
problem instances. Results are visualized by a graphical user interface showing
the distribution of solutions in outcome space as well as their corresponding
Gantt chart representation.
  The identification of a most preferred solution from the set of efficient
solutions is supported by a module based on the aspiration interactive method
(AIM). The decision maker successively defines aspiration levels until a single
solution is chosen.
  After successfully competing in the finals in Ronneby, Sweden, the MOOPPS
software has been awarded the European Academic Software Award 2002
