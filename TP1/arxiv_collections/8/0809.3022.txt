Geons, small topological structures that exhibit particle properties such as
charge and angular momentum without the presence of matter sources, have been
extensively discussed in 3+1-dimensional general relativity. Given the recent
renewal of interest in 2+1 gravity, it is natural to ask whether or not the
notion of geons extends to three dimensions. We prove here that, in contrast to
the 3+1-dimensional case, there are no 2+1-dimensional asymptotically flat
solutions of the vacuum Einstein or Einstein-Maxwell equations containing
geons. In contrast, 2+1-dimensional asymptotically anti-de Sitter spacetimes
can indeed contain geons; however, the geons are always hidden behind a single
black hole horizon. We also prove sufficient conditions for the non-existence
of 2+1-dimensional asymptotically flat geon-containing solutions.
