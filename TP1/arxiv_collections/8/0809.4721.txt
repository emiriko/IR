Quantum optical coherence tomography (QOCT) makes use of an entangled-photon
light source to carry out dispersion-immune axial optical sectioning. We
present the first experimental QOCT images of a biological sample: an
onion-skin tissue coated with gold nanoparticles. 3D images are presented in
the form of 2D sections of different orientations.
