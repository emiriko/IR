Using an exact diagonalization technique on small clusters, we study spin and
density excitations of the triangular-lattice $t$-$J$ model with multiple-spin
exchange interactions, whereby we consider anomalous properties observed in the
doped Mott region of the two-dimensional liquid $^3$He adsorbed on a graphite
surface. We find that the double-peak structure consistent with experiment
appears in the calculated temperature dependence of the specific heat; the
low-temperature sharp peak comes from the spin excitations reflecting the
frustrated nature of the spin degrees of freedom and high-temperature broad
peak comes from the density excitations extending over the entire band width.
The clear separation in their energy scales is evident in the calculated spin
and density excitation spectra. The calculated single-particle excitation
spectra suggest the presence of fermionic quasiparticles dressed by the spin
excitations, with an enhanced effective mass consistent with experiment.
