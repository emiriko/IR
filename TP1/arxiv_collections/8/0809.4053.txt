We obtain the best approximation in $L^1(\R)$, by entire functions of
exponential type, for a class of even functions that includes
$e^{-\lambda|x|}$, where $\lambda >0$, $\log |x|$ and $|x|^{\alpha}$, where $-1
< \alpha < 1$. We also give periodic versions of these results where the
approximating functions are trigonometric polynomials of bounded degree.
