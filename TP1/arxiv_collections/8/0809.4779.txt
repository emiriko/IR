The role of disorder on wave propagation through the universe is studied.
Assuming space fluctuations of the order of the Planck length and the size of
the universe as the corresponding localization length for the background
radiation, we obtain the exponent (close to unity) in the power law
relationship between these quantities. This suggests that the role of Anderson
localization is not negligible at cosmological scales.
