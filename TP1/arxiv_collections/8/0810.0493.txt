Recently, a new mechanism leading to purely quantum directed transport in the
asymmetric multibaker map has been presented. Here, we show a comprehensive
characterization of the finite asymptotic current behavior with respect to the
$h$ value, the shape of the initial conditions, and the features of the
spectrum. We have considered different degrees of asymmetry in these studies
and we have also analyzed the classical and quantum phase space distributions
for short times in order to understand the mechanisms behind the generation of
the directed current.
