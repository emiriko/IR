We discuss a new simple field theory approach of Coulomb systems. Using a
description in terms of fields, we introduce in a new way the statistical
degrees of freedom in relation with the quantum mechanics. We show on a series
of examples that these fundamental entropic effects can help account for
physical phenomena in relation with Coulomb systems whether symmetric or also
asymmetric in valence. On the overall, this gives a new understanding of these
systems.
