We construct an accurate approximation to the exact NNLO cross section for
Higgs production in gluon-gluon fusion by matching the dominant finite top mass
corrections recently computed by us to the known result in the infinite mass
limit. The ensuing corrections to the partonic cross section are very large
when the center of mass energy of the partonic collision is much larger than
the Higgs mass, but lead to a moderate correction at the percent level to the
total Higgs production cross section at the LHC. Our computation thus reduces
the uncertainty related to these corrections at the LHC from the percent to the
per mille level.
