Let U(g,e) be the finite W-algebra associated with a nilpotent element e in a
simple Lie algebra g and assume that e is induced from a nilpotent element e_0
in a Levi subalgebra l of g. We show that if the finite W-algebra U(l,e_0) has
a 1-dimensional representation, then so does U(g,e). For g classical (and in
may other cases), we compute the Krull dimension of the largest commutative
quotient of U(g,e). Some applications to representation theory of modular
counterparts of g are given.
