An important problem in applied science is the continuous nonlinear filtering
problem, i.e., the estimation of a Langevin state that is observed indirectly.
In this paper, it is shown that Euclidean quantum mechanics is closely related
to the continuous nonlinear filtering problem. The key is the configuration
space Feynman path integral representation of the fundamental solution of a
Fokker-Planck type of equation termed the Yau Equation of continuous-continuous
filtering. A corollary is the equivalence between nonlinear filtering problem
and a time-varying Schr\"odinger equation.
