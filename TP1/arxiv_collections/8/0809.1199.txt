Three-photon annihilation of the electron-positron pairs (= $(e^{-},
e^{+})-$pairs) is considered in the electron rest frame. The energy of the
incident positron can be arbitrary. The analytical expression for the
cross-section of three-photon annihilation of the $(e^{-},e^{+})-$pair has been
derived and investigated.
