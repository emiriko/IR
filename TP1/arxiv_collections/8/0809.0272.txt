Magnetic monopoles have attracted the attention of physicists since the
founding of the electromagnetic theory. Their search has been a constant
endeavor which was intensified when Dirac established the relation between the
existence of monopoles and charge quantization. However, these searches have
been unsuccessful. We have recently proposed that monopolium, a
monopole-antimonopole bound state, so strongly bound that it has a relatively
small mass, could be easier to find and become an indirect but clear signature
for the existence of magnetic monopoles. In here we extend our previous
analysis for its production to two photon fusion at LHC energies.
