The amplitudes for the pion-nucleon charge exchange reaction of the
Karlsruhe-Helsinki and the George-Washington-University partial wave analyses
are compared with those of a Regge-cut model with the aim to explore the
possibility to provide high energy constraints for theoretical baryon resonance
analyses in the energy region above 2 GeV.
