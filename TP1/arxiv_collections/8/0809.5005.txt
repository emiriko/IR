In this paper we present a new algorithm for a layout optimization problem:
this concerns the placement of weighted polygons inside a circular container,
the two objectives being to minimize imbalance of mass and to minimize the
radius of the container. This problem carries real practical significance in
industrial applications (such as the design of satellites), as well as being of
significant theoretical interest. Previous work has dealt with circular or
rectangular objects, but here we deal with the more realistic case where
objects may be represented as polygons and the polygons are allowed to rotate.
We present a solution based on simulated annealing and first test it on
instances with known optima. Our results show that the algorithm obtains
container radii that are close to optimal. We also compare our method with
existing algorithms for the (special) rectangular case. Experimental results
show that our approach out-performs these methods in terms of solution quality.
