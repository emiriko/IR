In this work, we study the Benjamin-Bona-Mahony like equations with a fully
nonlinear dispersive term by means of the factorization technique. In this way
we find the travelling wave solutions of this equation in terms of the
Weierstrass function and its degenerated trigonometric and hyperbolic forms.
Then, we obtain the pattern of periodic, solitary, compacton and kink-like
solutions. We give also the Lagrangian and the Hamiltonian, which are linked to
the factorization, for the nonlinear second order ordinary differential
equations associated to the travelling wave equations.
