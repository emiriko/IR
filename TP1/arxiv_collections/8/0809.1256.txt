This letter reports on the magnetic properties of Ti1-xCoxO2 anatase phase
nanopowders with different Co contents. It is shown that oxygen vacancies play
a fundamental role in promoting the long-range ferromagnetic order in the
material studied, in addition to the transition-metal doping. Furthermore, the
results allow ruling out the premise of a strict connection between Co
clustering and the ferromagnetism observed in the Co:TiO2 anatase system.
