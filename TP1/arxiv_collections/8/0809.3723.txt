Epitaxially grown intermetallic RFe2 (R = Dy, Er, Y) thin films have been
studied by point contact Andreev reflection. Spin polarization values were
extracted by fitting normalized conductance curves for mechanical Nb/RFe2 point
contacts, using a modified Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk (BTK) model. Good agreement
is found between this model and the experimentally obtained data. Extracted
values of spin polarization, which are close to the spin polarization of Fe,
reveal no variation with the rare earth component for the measured
intermetallic compounds. This suggests that using this technique we probe the
Fe sub-lattice, and that this lattice drives spintronic effects in these
compounds.
