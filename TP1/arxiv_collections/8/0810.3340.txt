Since the quantum field theory treats a system of particles, there must be a
distribution which is associated with the system of particles. It means that a
meaningful quantity is adjoined in the system of particles. It seems that these
concepts, constraints and distribution are ignored in the conventional
approach. Further more, there are two versions of quantization relations, one
is prior to the field equation and the other is posterior to the field
equation. And it is very difficult to find the posterior one. If the posterior
one is found, of course, these two versions of quantization must be the same
one. Actually, it implies that there is recursive problem. In this paper, we
will discuss these serious problems.
