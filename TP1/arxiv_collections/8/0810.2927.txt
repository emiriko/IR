It is shown how to construct quantum random walks with particles in an
arbitrary faithful normal state. A convergence theorem is obtained for such
walks, which demonstrates a thermalisation effect: the limit cocycle obeys a
quantum stochastic differential equation without gauge terms. Examples are
presented which generalise that of Attal and Joye (2007, J. Funct. Anal. 247,
253-288).
