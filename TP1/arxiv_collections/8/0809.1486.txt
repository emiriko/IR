We determine the ground-state properties of a gas of interacting bosonic
atoms in a one-dimensional optical lattice. The system is modelled by the
Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian. We show how to apply the time-evolving block
decimation method to systems with periodic boundary conditions, and employ it
as a reference to find the ground state of the Bose-Hubbard model. Results are
compared with recently proposed approximate methods, such as
Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) theories generalised for strong interactions and
the variational Bijl-Dingle-Jastrow method. We find that all HFB methods do not
bring any improvement to the Bogoliubov theory and therefore provide correct
results only in the weakly-interacting limit, where the system is deeply in the
superfluid regime. On the other hand, the variational Bijl-Dingle-Jastrow
method is applicable for much stronger interactions, but is essentially limited
to the superfluid regime as it reproduces the superfluid-Mott insulator
transition only qualitatively.
