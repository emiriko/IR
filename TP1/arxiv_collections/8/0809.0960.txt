After many years searching for electroweak production of top quarks, the
Tevatron collider experiments have now moved from obtaining first evidence for
single top quark production to an impressive array of measurements that test
the standard model in several directions. This paper describes measurements of
the single top quark cross sections, limits set on the CKM matrix element
|Vtb|, searches for production of single top quarks produced via
flavor-changing neutral currents and from heavy W-prime and H+ boson
resonances, and studies of anomalous Wtb couplings. It concludes with
projections for future expected significance as the analyzed datasets grow.
