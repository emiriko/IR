Spin-entanglement of two electrons occupying two spatial regions -- domains
-- is expressed in a compact form in terms of spin-spin correlation functions.
The power of the formalism is demonstrated on several examples ranging from
generation of entanglement by scattering of two electrons to the entanglement
of a pair of qubits represented by a double quantum dot coupled to leads. In
the latter case the collapse of entanglement due to the Kondo effect is
analyzed.
