In this paper we present a short overview of atom interferometry based on
light pulses. We discuss different implementations and their applications for
high precision measurements. We will focus on the determination of the ratio
h/m of the Planck constant to an atomic mass. The measurement of this quantity
is performed by combining Bloch oscillations of atoms in a moving optical
lattice with a Ramsey-Bord\'e interferometer.
