Dc and ac transport properties as well as electric modulus spectra have been
investigated for the samples LaMn$_{1-x}$Fe$_{x}$O$_3$ with compositions 0
$\leq x \leq$ 1.0. The bulk dc resistivity shows a temperature variation
consistent with the variable range hopping mechanism at low temperature and
Arrhenius mechanism at high temperatures. The ac conductivity has been found to
follow a power law behavior at a limited temperature and frequency region where
Anderson-localization plays a significant role in the transport mechanism for
all the compositions. At low temperatures large dc resistivities and dielectric
relaxation behavior for all the compositions are consistent with the polaronic
nature of the charge carriers. Scaling of the modulus spectra shows that the
charge transport dynamics is independent of temperature for a particular
composition but depends strongly on different compositions possibly due to
different charge carrier concentrations and structural properties.
