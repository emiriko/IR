We investigate the electronic states of the CoO_2 plane in the layered cobalt
oxides Na_{0.5}CoO_{2} using the realistic 11 band d-p model on a
two-dimensional triangular lattice. Effects of the Coulomb interaction on a Co
site: the intra- and inter-orbital direct terms U and U', the exchange coupling
J and the pair-transfer J', are treated within the Hartree-Fock approximation.
It is found that the metallic antiferromagnetism takes place below T_{c1} and,
in addition, the orbital order accompanied by the small charge order takes
place below T_{c2} (< T_{c1}) where the system becomes insulator. The obtained
results are consistent with the successive phase transitions observed in
Na_{0.5}CoO_{2}.
