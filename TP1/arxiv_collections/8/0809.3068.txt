Let $X$ be a nonsingular projective surface over an algebraically closed
field with characteristic zero, and $H_-$ and $H_+$ ample line bundles on $X$
separated by only one wall of type $(c_1,c_2)$. Suppose the moduli scheme
$M(H_-)$ of rank-two $H_-$-stable sheaves with Chern classes $(c_1,c_2)$ is
non-singular. We shall construct a desingularization of $M(H_+)$ by using
$M(H_-)$. As an application, we consider whether singularities of $M(H_+)$ are
terminal or not when $X$ is ruled or elliptic.
