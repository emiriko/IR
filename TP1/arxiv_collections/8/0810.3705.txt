Searches for this Higgs boson are reaching an exciting time. This proceeding
reports the progress on Standard Model Higgs boson searches at the Tevatron and
the prospects for Higgs boson searches at the Large Hadron Collider. Also
reported are the results of non Standard Model searches and prospects at the
Tevatron, Large Hadron Collide and B factories. Included in this result are the
first limits on the mass of the Standard Model Higgs boson at high masses
beyond the kinematic reach of the Large Electron Positron collider.
