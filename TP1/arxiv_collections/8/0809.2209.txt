We analyze the prospect for observing the intermediate neutral Higgs ($h_2$)
boson in its decay to two lighter Higgs bosons ($h_1$) at the Tevatron in the
framework of the CP violating MSSM using the PYTHIA event generator. We
consider the lepton+ 4-jets+ $\met$ channel from $p \bar p \ra W h_2 \ra W h_1
h_1 \ra l \nu_l b \bar b b\bar b$, with two or three tagged $b$ jets. We found
that it is very hard to observe this signature in the LEP-allowed region of
parameter space, due to the small signal efficiency.
