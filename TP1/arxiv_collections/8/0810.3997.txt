Spin-dependent total pbar-d cross sections are considered using the optical
theorem. For this aim the full spin dependence of the forward pbar-d elastic
scattering amplitude is considered in a model independent way. The
single-scattering approximation is used to relate this amplitude to the
elementary amplitudes of pbar-p and pbar-n scattering and the deuteron form
factor. A formalism allowing to take into account Coulomb-nuclear interference
effects in polarized pbar-d cross sections is developed. Numerical calculations
for the polarized total pbar-d cross sections are performed at beam energies
20-300 MeV using the Nbar-N interaction models developed by the Julich group.
Double-scattering effects are estimated within the Glauber approach and found
to be in the order of 10-20%. Existing experimental data on differential pbar-d
cross sections are in good agreement with the performed Glauber calculations.
It is found that for the used Nbar-N models the total longitudinal and
transversal pbar-d cross sections are comparable in absolute value to those for
pbar-p scattering.
