For d=10 N=1 SUGRA coupled to d=10 N=1 SYM, anomaly cancellation places
severe constraints on the allowed gauge groups. Besides the ones known to
appear in string theory, only U(1)^496 and E_8 x U(1)^248 are allowed. There
are no known theories of quantum gravity that reduce in some limit to these two
last supergravity theories, and in this note I present some evidence that those
quantum theories might not exist. The first observation is that, upon
compactification, requring that the quantum theory possesses a moduli space
with finite volume typically implies the existence of singularities where the
4d gauge group is enhanced, but for these two theories that gauge enhancement
is problematic from the 10d point of view. I also point out that while these
four supergravity theories present repulson-type singularities, the known
mechanism that repairs those singularities for the first two - the non-Abelian
enhancon - is not available for the last two theories. In short, these two
supergravity theories might be too Abelian for their own good.
