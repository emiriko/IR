The temperature dependence of the non-ergodicity factor of vitreous GeO$_2$,
$f_{q}(T)$, as deduced from elastic and quasi-elastic neutron scattering
experiments, is analyzed. The data are collected in a wide range of
temperatures from the glassy phase, up to the glass transition temperature, and
well above into the undercooled liquid state. Notwithstanding the investigated
system is classified as prototype of strong glass, it is found that the
temperature- and the $q$-behavior of $f_{q}(T)$ follow some of the predictions
of Mode Coupling Theory. The experimental data support the hypothesis of the
existence of an ergodic to non-ergodic transition occurring also in network
forming glassy systems.
