We present an exposition on the geometrization of the electromagnetic force.
We show that, in noncommutative (NC) spacetime, there always exists a
coordinate transformation to locally eliminate the electromagnetic force, which
is precisely the Darboux theorem in symplectic geometry. As a consequence, the
electromagnetism can be realized as a geometrical property of spacetime like
gravity. We show that the geometrization of the electromagnetic force in NC
spacetime is the origin of gravity, dubbed as the emergent gravity. We discuss
how the emergent gravity reveals a novel, radically different picture about the
origin of spacetime. In particular, the emergent gravity naturally explains the
dynamical origin of flat spacetime, which is absent in Einstein gravity. This
spacetime picture turns out to be crucial for a tenable solution of the
cosmological constant problem.
