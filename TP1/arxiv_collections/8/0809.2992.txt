We introduce moduli spaces of stable perverse coherent systems on small
crepant resolutions of Calabi-Yau 3-folds and consider their Donaldson-Thomas
type counting invariants. The stability depends on the choice of a component (=
a chamber) in the complement of finitely many lines (= walls) in the plane. We
determine all walls and compute generating functions of invariants for all
choices of chambers when the Calabi-Yau is the resolved conifold. For suitable
choices of chambers, our invariants are specialized to Donaldson-Thomas,
Pandharipande-Thomas and Szendroi invariants.
