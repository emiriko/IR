We consider systems of weakly coupled Schr\"odinger equations with
nonconstant potentials and we investigate the existence of nontrivial
nonnegative solutions which concentrate around local minima of the potentials.
We obtain sufficient and necessary conditions for a sequence of least energy
solutions to concentrate.
