We consider an atomic Fermi gas confined in a uniform optical lattice
potential, where the atoms can pair into molecules via a magnetic field
controlled narrow Feshbach resonance. The phase diagram of the resulting
atom-molecule mixture in chemical and thermal equilibrium is determined
numerically in the absence of interactions under the constraint of particle
conservation. In the limiting cases of vanishing or large lattice depth we
derive simple analytical results for important thermodynamic quantities. One
such quantity is the dissociation energy, defined as the detuning of the
molecular energy spectrum with respect to the atomic one for which half of the
atoms have been converted into dimers. Importantly we find that the
dissociation energy has a non-monotonic dependence on lattice depth.
