We investigate the possibility of a strongly correlated Fractional Quantum
Hall (FQH) state in bulk three dimensional isotropic (not layered) materials.
We find that a FQH state can exist at low densities only if it is accompanied
by a staging transition in which the electrons re-organize themselves in
layers, perpendicular to the magnetic field, at distances of order the magnetic
length apart. The Hartree energy associated to the staging transition is
off-set by the correlation Fock energy of the 3D FQH state. We obtain the phase
diagram of bulk electrons in a magnetic field subject to Coulomb interactions
as a function of carrier density and lattice constant. At very low densities,
the 3D FQH state exhibits a transition to a 3D Wigner crystal state stabilized
by phonon correlations.
