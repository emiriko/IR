We consider two coupled phase oscillators in the presence of proportional
("common") and independent white noises. The global synchronization properties
of the system are analytically studied via the Fokker-Planck equation. When the
"effective coupling" is big compared to the common noises, the former favors
and the latter hinder synchronization. On the contrary, when the coupling is
small compared to the proportional noises, we find that the latter induce
synchronization, optimally when their intensities are big and in the n:m
synchronization ratio. Furthermore, in such case a small value of the coupling
is better for synchronization. Finally, we show that synchronization, which is
a global property, must not be studied via local stability such as with
Lyapunov exponents.
