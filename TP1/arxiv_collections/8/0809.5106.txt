In the string theory in AdS_4 \times CP^3 we construct the giant magnon and
spike solutions with two spins in two kinds of subspaces of R_t \times CP^3 and
derive the dispersion relations for them. For the single giant magnon solution
in one subspace we show that its dispersion relation is associated with that of
the big one-spin giant magnon solution in the RP^2 subspace. For the single
giant magnon solution in the other complementary subspace its dispersion
relation is similar to that of the one-spin giant magnon solution living in the
S^2 subspace but has one additional spin dependence.
