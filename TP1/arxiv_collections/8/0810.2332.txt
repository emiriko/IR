A recent experiment on the multiferroic BiMn$_2$O$_5$ compound under a strong
applied magnetic field revealed a rich phase diagram driven by the coupling of
magnetic and charge (dipolar) degrees of freedom. Based on the
exchange-striction mechanism, we propose here a theoretical model with the
intent to capture the interplay of the spin and dipolar moments in the presence
of a magnetic field in BiMn$_2$O$_5$. Experimentally observed behavior of the
dielectric constants, magnetic susceptibility, and the polarization is, for the
most part, reproduced by our model. The critical behavior observed near the
polarization reversal $(P=0)$ point in the phase diagram is interpreted as
arising from the proximity to the critical end point.
