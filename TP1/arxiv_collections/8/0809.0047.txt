We report the direct observation of the current-driven domain wall (DW)
motion by magnetic force microscopy in a structured Co/Ni wire with
perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. The wire has notches to define the DW
position. It is demonstrated that single current pulses can precisely control
the DW position from notch to notch with high DW velocity of 40 m/s.
