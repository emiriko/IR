Entanglement is central both to the foundations of quantum theory and, as a
novel resource, to quantum information science. The theory of entanglement
establishes basic laws, such as the non-increase of entanglement under local
operations, that govern its manipulation and aims to draw from them formal
analogies to the second law of thermodynamics. However, while in the second law
the entropy uniquely determines whether a state is adiabatically accessible
from another, the manipulation of entanglement under local operations exhibits
a fundamental irreversibility which prevents the existence of such an order.
  Here we show that a reversible theory of entanglement and a rigorous
relationship with thermodynamics may be established when one considers all
non-entangling transformations. The role of the entropy in the second law is
taken by the asymptotic relative entropy of entanglement in the basic law of
entanglement. We show the usefulness of this new approach to general resource
theories and to quantum information theory.
