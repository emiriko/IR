A model is presented which demonstrates that the attosecond pulse structure
of a High Harmonic Generation (HHG) seed may be retained through to saturation
in an FEL amplifier. At wavelengths of ~12nm a train of attosecond pulses of
widths ~300 attoseconds with peak powers in excess of 1 GW are predicted from
full 3D simulation. Methods for improving these results are discussed.
