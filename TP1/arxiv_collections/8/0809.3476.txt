We introduce a bijection between inequivalent minimal factorizations of the
n-cycle (1 2 ... n) into a product of smaller cycles of given length, on one
side, and trees of a certain structure on the other. We use this bijection to
count the factorizations with a given number of different commuting factors
that can appear in the first and in the last positions, a problem which has
found applications in physics. We also provide a necessary and sufficient
condition for a set of cycles to be arrangeable into a product evaluating to (1
2 ... n).
