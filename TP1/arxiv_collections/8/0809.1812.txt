This is an extended abstract presenting new results on the topological
complexity of omega-powers (which are included in a paper "Classical and
effective descriptive complexities of omega-powers" available from
arXiv:0708.4176) and reflecting also some open questions which were discussed
during the Dagstuhl seminar on "Topological and Game-Theoretic Aspects of
Infinite Computations" 29.06.08 - 04.07.08.
