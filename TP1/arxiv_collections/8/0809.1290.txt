We present a generalized Schmidt decomposition for a pure system with any
number of two-level subsystems. The basis is symmetric under the permutation of
the parties and is derived from the product state defining the injective tensor
norm of the state. The largest coefficient quantifies the quantum correlation
of the state. Other coefficients have a lot of information such as the
unentangled particles as well as the particles whose reduced states are
completely mixed. The decomposition clearly distinguishes the states entangled
in inequivalent ways and have an information on the applicability to the
teleportation and superdense coding when the given quantum state is used as a
quantum channel.
