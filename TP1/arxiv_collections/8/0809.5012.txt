By using a close similarity between multi-photon and tunneling population
transfer schemes, we propose robust adiabatic methods for the transport of
Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) in double- and triple-well traps. The
calculations within the mean-field approximation (Gross-Pitaevskii equation)
show that irreversible and complete transport takes place even in the presence
of the non-linear effects caused by interaction between BEC atoms. The transfer
is driven by adiabatic time-dependent monitoring the barriers and well depths.
The proposed methods are universal and can be applied to a variety of systems
and scenarios.
