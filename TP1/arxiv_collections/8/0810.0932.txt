We investigate how quantum coincidence interferometry is affected by a
controllable manipulation of transverse wave-vectors in type-II parametric down
conversion using adaptive optics techniques. In particular, we discuss the
possibility of spatial walk-off compensation in quantum interferometry and a
new effect of even-order spatial aberration cancellation.
