This paper is devoted to the study of the leading twist distribution
amplitudes of P-wave nonrelativistic mesons. It is shown that at the leading
order approximation in relative velocity of quark-antiquark pair inside the
mesons these distribution amplitudes can be expressed through one universal
function. As an example, the distribution amplitudes of the P-wave charmonia
mesons are considered. Within QCD sum rules the model for the universal
function of P-wave charmonia mesons is built. In addition, it is found the
relations between the moments of the universal function and the nonrelativistic
QCD matrix elements that control relativistic corrections to any amplitude
involving P-wave charmonia. Our calculation shows that characteristic size of
these corrections is of order of ~30 %.
