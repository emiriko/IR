We use neutron reflectometry to investigate the interlayer exchange coupling
between Ga$_{0.97}$Mn$_{0.03}$As ferromagnetic semiconductor layers separated
by non-magnetic Be-doped GaAs spacers. Polarized neutron reflectivity measured
below the Curie temperature of Ga$_{0.97}$Mn$_{0.03}$As reveals a
characteristic splitting at the wave vector corresponding to twice the
multilayer period, indicating that the coupling between the ferromagnetic
layers are antiferromagnetic (AFM). When the applied field is increased to
above the saturation field, this AFM coupling is suppressed. This behavior is
not observed when the spacers are undoped, suggesting that the observed AFM
coupling is mediated by charge carriers introduced via Be doping. The behavior
of magnetization of the multilayers measured by DC magnetometry is consistent
with the neutron reflectometry results.
