For each infinite series of the classical Lie groups of type B,C or D, we
introduce a family of polynomials parametrized by the elements of the
corresponding Weyl group of infinite rank. These polynomials represent the
Schubert classes in the equivariant cohomology of the appropriate flag variety.
They satisfy a stability property, and are a natural extension of the (single)
Schubert polynomials of Billey and Haiman, which represent non-equivariant
Schubert classes. They are also positive in a certain sense, and when indexed
by maximal Grassmannian elements, or by the longest element in a finite Weyl
group, these polynomials can be expressed in terms of the factorial analogues
of Schur's Q- or P-functions defined earlier by Ivanov.
