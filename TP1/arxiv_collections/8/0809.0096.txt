We systematically study Raman spectroscopy of cleaved Na$_x$CoO$_2$ single
crystals with 0.37 $\leq$ x $\leq$ 0.80. The Raman shift of A$_{1g}$ mode is
found to be linearly dependent on Na content, while the Raman shift of E$_{1g}$
mode has an abnormal shift to high frequency around x = 0.5. The abnormal shift
is ascribed to the occurrence of Na rearrangement in O1 structure. Temperature
dependent Raman spectrum for x = 0.56 sample shows that Na rearrangement
transition from O1 structure to H1 structure occurs around 240 K. Electronic
transport and susceptibility for the sample with $x=0.56$ show a response to
the Na rearrangement transition from O1 to H1 structure, and that different Na
ordering pattern causes distinct physical properties. These results give a
direct evidence to proved Na ordering effect on physical properties of Co-O
plane.
