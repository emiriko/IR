The sums k(E1)+k(M1) of radiative strength functions of dipole primary
gamma-transitions were approximated with high precision in the energy region of
$0.5 < E_1 < B_n-0.5$ MeV for nuclei: 40K, 60Co, 71,74Ge, 80Br, 114Cd, 118Sn,
124,125Te, 128I, 137,138,139Ba, 140La, 150Sm, 156,158Gd, 160Tb, 163,164,165Dy,
166Ho, 168Er, 170Tm, 174Yb, 176,177Lu, 181Hf, 182Ta, 183,184,185,187W,
188,190,191,193Os, 192Ir, 196Pt, 198Au, 200Hg by sum of two independent
functions. It has been shown that this parameter of gamma-decay are determined
by the structure of the decaying and excited levels, at least, up to the
neutron binding energy.
