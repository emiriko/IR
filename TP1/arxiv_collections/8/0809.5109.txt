In a recent preprint, Y. Namikawa proposed a conjecture on Q-factorial
terminalizations and their birational geometry of nilpotent orbits. He proved
his conjecture for classical simple Lie algebras. In this note, we prove his
conjecture for exceptional simple Lie algebras. For the birational geometry,
contrary to the classical case, two new types of Mukai flops appear.
