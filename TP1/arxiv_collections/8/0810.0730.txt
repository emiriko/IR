Hadron spectroscopy on dynamical configurations are faced with the
difficulties of dealing with the mixing of single particle states and
multi-hadron states (for large spatial volumes and light dynamical quarks
masses). It is conceivable that explicit multi-hadron interpolating operators
will be necessary for obtaining sufficiently good overlap onto multi-hadron
states in order to extract the low-lying excitation spectrum. We explore here
the feasibility of using four noise diluted all-to-all quark propagators in the
construction of explicit two-hadron operators on quenched, anisotropic
lattices. Our longer term goal is to use these operators on large anisotropic,
dynamical configurations for hadron spectroscopy.
