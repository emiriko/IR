In this paper we present a general tool to handle the presence of zero
dynamics which are asymptotically but not locally exponentially stable in
problems of robust nonlinear stabilization by output feedback. We show how it
is possible to design locally Lipschitz stabilizers under conditions which only
rely upon a partial detectability assumption on the controlled plant, by
obtaining a robust stabilizing paradigm which is not based on design of
observers and separation principles. The main design idea comes from recent
achievements in the field of output regulation and specifically in the design
of nonlinear internal models.
