We study, analytically and numerically, reflection and transmission of an
arbitrarily polarized vortex beam on an interface separating two dielectric
media and derive general expressions for linear and angular Goos-Hanchen and
Imbert-Fedorov shifts. We predict a novel vortex-induced Goos-Hanchen shift,
and also reveal direct connection between the spin-induced angular shifts and
the vortex-induced linear shifts.
