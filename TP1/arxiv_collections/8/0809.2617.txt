We propose an experiment to identify the potential existence of a spinon
Fermi surface by looking for oscillatory coupling between two ferromagnets via
a spin liquid spacer. Three candidate spin liquids are investigated, and it is
found that in all cases, long period oscillations should be present, the period
of which would identify the Fermi wavevector of the spinon surface.
