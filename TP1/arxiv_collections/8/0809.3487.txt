We consider ideals of polynomials vanishing on the W-orbits of the
intersections of mirrors of a finite reflection group W. We determine all such
ideals which are invariant under the action of the corresponding rational
Cherednik algebra hence form submodules in the polynomial module. We show that
a quantum integrable system can be defined for every such ideal for a real
reflection group W. This leads to known and new integrable systems of
Calogero-Moser type which we explicitly specify. In the case of classical
Coxeter groups we also obtain generalized Calogero-Moser systems with added
quadratic potential.
