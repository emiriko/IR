For a $n$-dimensional spin manifold $M$ with a fixed spin structure and a
spinor bundle $\Sigma M$, we prove an $\epsilon$-regularity theorem for weak
solutions to the nonlinear Dirac equation of cubic nonlinearity. This, in
particular, answers a regularity question raised by Chen-Jost-Wang when $n=2$.
