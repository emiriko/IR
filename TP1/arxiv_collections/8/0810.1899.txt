We demonstrate that abundant quantities of short-lived beta unstable ions can
be trapped in a novel transparent Paul trap and that their decay products can
directly be detected in coincidence. Low energy 6He+ (807 ms half-life) ions
were extracted from the SPIRAL source at GANIL, then decelerated, cooled and
bunched by means of the buffer gas cooling technique. More than 10^8 ions have
been stored over a measuring period of six days and about 10^5 decay
coincidences between the beta particles and the 6Li^{++} recoiling ions have
been recorded. The technique can be extended to other short-lived species,
opening new possibilities for trap assisted decay experiments.
