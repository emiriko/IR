Hard surfaces or magnetic surfaces can be used to propagate quasi-TEM modes
inside closed waveguides. The interesting feature of these modes is an almost
uniform field distribution inside the waveguide. But the mechanisms governing
how these surfaces act, how they can be characterized, and further how the
modes propagate are not detailed in the literature. In this paper, we try to
answer these questions. We give some basic rules that govern the propagation of
the quasi-TEM modes, and show that many of their characteristics (i.e. their
dispersion curves) can be deduced from the simple analysis of the reflection
properties of the involved surfaces.
