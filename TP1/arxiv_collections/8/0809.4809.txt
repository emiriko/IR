This paper describes the determination of the direct CP observables R_cp and
A_cp, related to the CKM angle gamma, using B- to D0 K- decays in 1.0 inverse
fb of data collected with the CDF II detector. This is the first measurement of
these CP observables made at a hadron collider in this decay mode. The results
presented are consistent with the measurements of these quantities made by the
Belle and BABAR collaborations.
