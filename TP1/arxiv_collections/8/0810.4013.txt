We report the new results of exchange bias effect in Nd_{1-x}Sr_{x}CoO_3 for
x = 0.20 and 0.40, where the exchange bias phenomenon is involved with the
ferrimagnetic (FI) state in a spontaneously phase separated system. The
zero-field cooled magnetization exhibits the FI (T_{FI}) and ferromagnetic
(T_C) transitions at ~ 23 and \sim 70 K, respectively for x = 0.20. The
negative horizontal and positive vertical shifts of the magnetic hysteresis
loops are observed when the system is cooled through T_{FI} in presence of a
positive static magnetic field. Training effect is observed for x = 0.20, which
could be interpreted by a spin configurational relaxation model. The
unidirectional shifts of the hysteresis loops as a function of temperature
exhibit the absence of exchange bias above T_{FI} for x = 0.20. The analysis of
the cooling field dependence of exchange bias field and magnetization indicates
that the ferromagnetic (FM) clusters consist of single magnetic domain with
average size around \sim 20 and ~ 40 \AA ~ for x = 0.20 and 0.40, respectively.
The sizes of the FM clusters are close to the percolation threshold for x =
0.20, which grow and coalesce to form the bigger size for x = 0.40 resulting in
a weak exchange bias effect.
