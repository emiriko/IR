We calculate the connected insertions of the nucleon three-point function to
study the first few moments of the unpolarized structure functions of the
nucleon. (The disconnected insertions are discussed elsewhere in these
proceedings). The calculation employs the CP-PACS/JLQCD 2+1 dynamical clover
fermions on a 16^3x32 lattice with lattice spacing a=0.1219 fm. The sequential
source technique, using non-zero and zero momentum point nucleon field as the
secondary source, is applied enabling a study of different currents at various
momentum transfer.
