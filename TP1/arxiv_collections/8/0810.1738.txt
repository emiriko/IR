The Anderson impurity model for Kondo problem is investigated for arbitrary
orbit-spin degeneracy $N$ of the magnetic impurity by the equation of motion
method (EOM). By employing a new decoupling scheme, a set self-consistent
equations for the one-particle Green function are derived and numerically
solved in the large-$N$ approximation. For the particle-hole symmetric Anderson
model with finite Coulomb interaction $U$, we show that the Kondo resonance at
the impurity site exists for all $N \geq 2$. The approach removes the pathology
in the standard EOM for N=2, and has the same level of applicability as
non-crossing approximation. For N=2, an exchange field splits the Kondo
resonance into only two peaks, consist with the result from more rigorous
numerical renormalization group (NRG) method. The temperature dependence of the
Kondo resonance peak is also discussed.
