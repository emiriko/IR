We propose a scheme for long-distance distribution of quantum entanglement in
which the entanglement between qubits at intermediate stations of the channel
is established by using bright light pulses in squeezed states coupled to the
qubits in cavities with a weak dispersive interaction. The fidelity of the
entanglement between qubits at the neighbor stations (10 km apart from each
other) obtained by postselection through the balanced homodyne detection of 7
dB squeezed pulses can reach F=0.99 without using entanglement purification, at
same time, the probability of successful generation of entanglement is 0.34.
