We discuss the thermoelectric (TE) transport in billiard systems of
interacting particles, coupled to stochastic particle reservoirs. Recently in
[1], analytical exact expressions for the TE transport of noninteracting gases
of polyatomic molecules were obtained, and a novel microscopic mechanism for
the increase of thermoelectric efficiency described. After briefly reviewing
the derivation of [1], in this paper we focus on the effects that the
particle-particle interaction has on the TE efficiency. We show that
interaction reduces the maximal thermodynamic efficiency. However, the
mechanism for the efficiency's increase towards its Carnot upper limit,
described in [1], remains unaffected.
