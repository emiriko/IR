In the paper, we analyze the distribution of complexities in the Vai script,
an indigenous syllabic writing system from Liberia. It is found that the
uniformity hypothesis for complexities fails for this script. The models using
Poisson distribution for the number of components and hyper-Poisson
distribution for connections provide good fits in the case of the Vai script.
