The interaction of optical beams in bi-dispersive nonlinear media with
self-focusing nonlinearity is numerically investigated. Under proper
conditions, the interaction of spatially separated beams can lead to the
creation of two prominent filaments along the other spatial or temporal
dimension and, thus to an effective beam exchange. This X-wave generation-based
effect could potentially be exploited in optical realizations of spatial or
spatio-temporal filtering.
