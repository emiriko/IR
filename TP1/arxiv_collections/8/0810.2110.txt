Ising interaction between qubits could produce distortion in entangled pairs
generated for engineering purposes (as in quantum computation) in presence of
parasite magnetic fields, destroying or altering the expected behavior of
process in which is projected to be used. Quantum control could be used to
correct that situation in several ways. Sometimes the user should be make some
measurement upon the system to decide which is the best control scheme; other
posibility is try to reconstruct the system using similar procedures without
perturbate it. In the complete pictures both schemes are present. We will work
first with pure systems studying advantages of different procedures. After, we
will extend these operations when time of distortion is uncertain, generating a
mixed state, which needs to be corrected by suposing the most probably time of
distortion.
