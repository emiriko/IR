Let $p \in (0, \infty)$ be a constant and let $\{\xi_n\} \subset L^p(\Omega,
{\mathcal F}, \P)$ be a sequence of random variables. For any integers $m, n
\ge 0$, denote $S_{m, n} = \sum_{k=m}^{m + n} \xi_k$. It is proved that, if
there exist a nondecreasing function $\varphi: \R_+\to \R_+$ (which satisfies a
mild regularity condition) and an appropriately chosen integer $a\ge 2$ such
that $$ \sum_{n=0}^\infty \sup_{k \ge 0} \E\bigg|\frac{S_{k, a^n}}
{\varphi(a^n)} \bigg|^p < \infty,$$ Then $$ \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{S_{0, n}}
{\varphi(n)} = 0\qquad \hbox{a.s.} $$ This extends Theorem 1 in Levental,
Chobanyan and Salehi \cite{chobanyan-l-s} and can be applied conveniently to a
wide class of self-similar processes with stationary increments including
stable processes.
