The thermal magnonic spectra of Co$_{2}$Cr$_{0.6}$Fe$_{0.4}$Al (CCFA) and
Co$_2$FeAl were investigated using Brillouin light scattering spectroscopy
(BLS). For CCFA, the exchange constant A (exchange stiffness D) is found to be
0.48 $\mu$erg/cm (203 meV A$^2$), while for Co$_2$FeAl the corresponding values
of 1.55 $\mu$erg/cm (370 meV A$^2$) were found. The observed asymmetry in the
BLS spectra between the Stokes and anti-Stokes frequencies was assigned to an
interplay between the asymmetrical profiles of hybridized Damon-Esbach and
perpendicular standing spin-wave modes, combined with the optical sensitivity
of the BLS signal to the upper side of the CCFA or Co$_2$FeAl film.
