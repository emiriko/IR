It is shown that the Lambda(c+)-Lambda(c-) signal recently reported by the
Belle Collaboration (ARXIV:0807.4458) contains clear signs of the psi(5S) and
the psi(4D) c-cbar vector states, and also some indication for the masses and
widths of the psi(6S) and psi(5D). Moreover, it is argued that the threshold
behaviour of the Lambda(c+)-antiLambda(c-) cross sections suggests the presence
of the hitherto undetected psi(3D) state not far below the
Lambda(c+)-Lambda(c-) threshold.
