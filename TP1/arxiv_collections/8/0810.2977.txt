In previous work on adsorbate-induced surface core level shifts (SCLSs), the
effects caused by O atom adsorption on Rh(111) and Ru(0001) were found to be
additive: the measured shifts for first layer Ru atoms depended linearly on the
number of directly coordinated O atoms. Density-functional theory calculations
quantitatively reproduced this effect, allowed separation of initial and final
state contributions, and provided an explanation in terms of a roughly constant
charge transfer per O atom. We have now conducted similar measurements and
calculations for three well-defined adsorbate and coadsorbate layers containing
O and H atoms: (1 x 1)-H, (2 x 2)-(O+H), and (2 x 2)-(O+3H) on Ru(0001). As H
is stabilized in fcc sites in the prior two structures and in hcp sites in the
latter, this enables us to not only study coverage and coadsorption effects on
the adsorbate-induced SCLSs, but also the sensitivity to similar adsorption
sites. Remarkably good agreement is obtained between experiment and
calculations for the energies and geometries of the layers, as well as for all
aspects of the SCLS values. The additivity of the next-neighbor
adsorbate-induced SCLSs is found to prevail even for the coadsorbate
structures. While this confirms the suggested use of SCLSs as fingerprints of
the adsorbate configuration, their sensitivity is further demonstrated by the
slightly different shifts unambiguously determined for H adsorption in either
fcc or hcp hollow sites.
