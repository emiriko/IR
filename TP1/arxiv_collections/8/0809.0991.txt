We discuss the nature of sequestering supersymmetry breaking sectors in a
certain class of moduli stabilization in supergravity/string models, where a
negative vacuum energy of the nonperturbative moduli potential is canceled by
dynamically generated F-terms. Two illustrating examples are shown to sketch
the issues around the supersymmetry breaking, flavors and sequestering within
such a framework.
