Cascading gravity is an explicit realization of the idea of degravitation,
where gravity behaves as a high-pass filter. This could explain why a large
cosmological constant does not backreact as much as anticipated from standard
General Relativity. The model relies on the presence of at least two infinite
extra dimensions while our world is confined on a four-dimensional brane.
Gravity is then four-dimensional at short distances and becomes weaker and
weaker at larger distances.
