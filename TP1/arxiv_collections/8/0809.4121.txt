Physical time intervals are attributes of single physical object whereas
physical space intervals are a relational attribute of two physical objects.
Some consequences of the breaking of the space-time exchange symmetry inherent
in the Lorentz transformation following from the above distinction are
investigated. In particular, it is shown that the relativity of simultaneity
and length contraction effects which naively follow from space-time symmetry of
the Lorentz transformation do not occur. Seven laws describing the relation
between observations of space intervals, time intervals and velocities in
different reference frames are given. Only two of these laws are respected by
conventional special relativity theory.
