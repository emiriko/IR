We consider a communication method, where the sender encodes n classical bits
into 1 qubit and sends it to the receiver who performs a certain measurement
depending on which of the initial bits must be recovered. This procedure is
called (n,1,p) quantum random access code (QRAC) where p > 1/2 is its success
probability. It is known that (2,1,0.85) and (3,1,0.79) QRACs (with no
classical counterparts) exist and that (4,1,p) QRAC with p > 1/2 is not
possible.
  We extend this model with shared randomness (SR) that is accessible to both
parties. Then (n,1,p) QRAC with SR and p > 1/2 exists for any n > 0. We give an
upper bound on its success probability (the known (2,1,0.85) and (3,1,0.79)
QRACs match this upper bound). We discuss some particular constructions for
several small values of n.
  We also study the classical counterpart of this model where n bits are
encoded into 1 bit instead of 1 qubit and SR is used. We give an optimal
construction for such codes and find their success probability exactly--it is
less than in the quantum case.
