The reflectivity of single-crystalline CoO has been studied by optical
spectroscopy for wave numbers ranging from 100 to 28,000\wn and for
temperatures 8 $< T <$ 325 K\@. A splitting of the cubic IR-active phonon mode
on passing the antiferromagnetic phase transition at $T_N$ = 289 K has been
observed. At low temperatures the splitting amounts to 15.0\wn. In addition, we
studied the splitting of the cubic crystal field ground state of the Co$^{2+}$
ions due to spin-orbit coupling, a tetragonal crystal field, and exchange
interaction. Below $T_N$, magnetic dipole transitions between the
exchange-split levels are identified and the energy-level scheme can be well
described with a spin-orbit coupling $\lambda = 151.1\wn$, an exchange constant
$J = 17.5\wn$, and a tetragonal crystal-field parameter $D = -47.8\wn$. Already
in the paramagnetic state electric quadrupole transitions between the
spin-orbit split level have been observed. At high frequencies, two electronic
levels of the crystal-field-split $d$-manifold were identified at 8,000 and
18,500\wn.
