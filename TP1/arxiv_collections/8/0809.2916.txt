It is shown that the Riemannian curvature of the 3-dimensional hypersurfaces
in space-time, described by the Wilson loop integral, can be represented by a
quaternion quantum operator induced by the SU(2) gauge potential, thus
providing a justification for quaternion quantum gravity at the Tev energy
scale.
