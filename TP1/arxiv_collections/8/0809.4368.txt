Quantum computers hold the promise to solve certain computational task much
more efficiently than classical computers. We review the recent experimental
advancements towards a quantum computer with trapped ions. In particular,
various implementations of qubits, quantum gates and some key experiments are
discussed. Furthermore, we review some implementations of quantum algorithms
such as a deterministic teleportation of quantum information and an error
correction scheme.
