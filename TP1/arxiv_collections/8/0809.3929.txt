Extending the work of Connolly and Rendleman (2008), we document the
dominance of Tiger Woods during the 1998-2001 PGA Tour seasons. We show that by
playing "average," Woods could have won some tournaments and placed no worse
than fourth in the tournaments in which he participated in year 2000, his best
on the PGA Tour. No other PGA Tour player in our sample could have come close
to such a feat. We also are able to quantify the intimidation factor associated
with playing with Woods. On average, players who were paired with Woods during
the 1998-2001 period scored 0.462 strokes per round worse than normal. Although
we find that Woods' presence in a tournament may have had a small, but
statistically significant adverse impact on the entire field, this effect was
swamped by the apparent intimidation factor associated with having to play with
Tiger side-by-side.
  We also demonstrate that Phil Mickelson's performance in major golf
championships over the 1998-2001 period was not nearly as bad as was frequently
mentioned in the golf press. Although Mickelson won no majors during this
period, he played sufficiently well to have won one or two majors under normal
circumstances. Moreover, his overall performance in majors, relative to his
estimated skill level, was comparable to that of Tiger Woods, who won five of
16 major golf championships during our four-year sample period. Thus, the
general characterization of Woods as golf's dominant player over the 1998-2001
period was accurate, but the frequent characterization of Phil Mickelson
choking in majors was not.
