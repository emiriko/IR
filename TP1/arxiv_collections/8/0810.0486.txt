The importance of peer-review in the scientific process can not be
overestimated. Yet, due to increasing pressures of research and exponentially
growing number of publications the task faced by the referees becomes ever more
difficult. We discuss here a few possible improvements that would enable more
efficient review of the scientific literature, using the growing Internet
connectivity. In particular, a practical automated model for providing the
referees with references to papers that might have strong relationship with the
work under review, based on general network properties of citations is
proposed.
