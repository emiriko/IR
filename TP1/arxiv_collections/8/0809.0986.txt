Let $T$ be the extinction moment of a critical branching process
$Z=(Z_{n},n\geq 0) $ in a random environment specified by iid probability
generating functions. We study the asymptotic behavior of the probability of
extinction of the process $Z$ at moment $n\to \infty$, and show that if the
logarithm of the (random) expectation of the offspring number belongs to the
domain of attraction of a non-gaussian stable law then the extinction occurs
owing to very unfavorable environment forcing the process, having at moment
$T-1$ exponentially large population, to die out. We also give an
interpretation of the obtained results in terms of random walks in random
environment.
