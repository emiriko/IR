A comprehensive determination of the quark mass dependence in the dispersion
relations of thermal excitations of gluons and quarks in non-Abelian gauge
theory (QCD) is presented for the one-loop approximation in Feynman gauge.
Larger values of the coupling are admitted, and the gauge dependence is
discussed. In a Dyson-Schwinger type approach, the effect of higher orders is
estimated for asymptotic thermal masses.
