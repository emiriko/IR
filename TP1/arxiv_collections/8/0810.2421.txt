The paper is devoted to the theoretical investigation of the magnetodipolar
interparticle interaction effect on remagnetization dynamics in moderately
concentrated ferrofluids. We consider a homogeneous (without particle
aggregates) ferrofluid consisting of identical spherical particles and employ a
rigid dipole model, where magnetic moment of a particle is fixed with respect
to the particle itself. In particular, for the magnetization relaxation after
the external field is instantly switched off, we show that the magnetodipolar
interaction leads to the increase of the initial magnetization relaxation time.
For the complex ac-susceptibility we find that the this interaction leads to an
overall increase of the imaginary susceptibility part and shifts the peak on
its frequency dependence towards lower frequencies. Comparing results obtained
with our analytical approach (second order virial expansion) to numerical
simulation data (Langevin dynamics method), we demonstrate that the employed
virial expansion approximation gives a good qualitative description of the
ferrofluid magnetization dynamics and provides a satisfactory quantitative
agreement with numerical simulations for the dc magnetization relaxation - up
to the particle volume fraction c ~ 10% and for the ac-susceptibility - up to c
~ 5 %.
