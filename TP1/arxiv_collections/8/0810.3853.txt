An experimental study of the 16O(e,e'K^+)16N_Lambda reaction has been
performed at Jefferson Lab. A thin film of falling water was used as a target.
This permitted a simultaneous measurement of the p(e,e'K^+)Lambda,Sigma_0
exclusive reactions and a precise calibration of the energy scale. A
ground-state binding energy of 13.76 +/- 0.16 MeV was obtained for 16N_Lambda
with better precision than previous measurements on the mirror hypernucleus
16O_Lambda. Precise energies have been determined for peaks arising from a
Lambda in s and p orbits coupled to the p_{1/2} and p_{3/2} hole states of the
15N core nucleus.
