We consider multiple teleportation in the Knill-Laflamme-Milburn (KLM)
scheme. We introduce adaptive teleportation, i.e., such that the choice of
entangled state used in the next teleportation depends on the results of the
measurements performed during the previous teleportations. We show that
adaptive teleportation enables an increase in the probability of faithful
multiple teleportation in the KLM scheme. In particular if a qubit is to be
teleported more than once then it is better to use nonmaximally entangled
states than maximally entangled ones in order to achieve the highest
probability of faithful teleportation.
