We present a versatile, inexpensive and simple optical phase lock for
applications in atomic physics experiments. Thanks to all-digital phase
detection and implementation of beat frequency pre-scaling, the apparatus
requires no microwave-range reference input, and permits phase locking at
frequency differences ranging from sub-MHz to 7 GHz (and with minor extension,
to 12 GHz). The locking range thus covers ground state hyperfine splittings of
all alkali metals, which makes this system a universal tool for many
experiments on coherent interaction between light and atoms.
