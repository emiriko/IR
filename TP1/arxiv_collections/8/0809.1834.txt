An optimal control problem related to the probability of transition between
stable states for a thermally driven Ginzburg-Landau equation is considered.
The value function for the optimal control problem with a spatial
discretization is shown to converge quadratically to the value function for the
original problem. This is done by using that the value functions solve similar
Hamilton-Jacobi equations, the equation for the original problem being defined
on an infinite dimensional Hilbert space. Time discretization is performed
using the Symplectic Euler method. Imposing a reasonable condition this method
is shown to be convergent of order one in time, with a constant independent of
the spatial discretization.
