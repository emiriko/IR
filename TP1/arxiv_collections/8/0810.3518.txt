The development of last years in quantum geometrodynamics highlights new
problems which were not obvious in its first formulation proposed by Wheeler
and DeWitt. At the first stage the main task was to apply known quantization
schemes to gravitational field or a certain cosmological model. This way has
led to the realization of the fact that a quantum description of the Universe
is impossible without implicit or explicit indication to a reference frame
presented by some medium, filling the whole Universe, with its own equation of
state and thermodynamical properties. Thus the questions arise, should one seek
for a "privileged" reference frame or consider all the variety of gauge
conditions and appropriate solutions for the wave function? It is worth noting
that thermodynamical properties of such a quantum Universe would also depend on
a chosen reference frame to some extent. So, we need a self-consistent quantum
theoretical and thermodynamical description of the Universe.
