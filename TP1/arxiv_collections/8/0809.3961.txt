It has long been known that the broken supersymmetric (susy) phase of the
singlet extended susy higgs model (SESHM) is at best metastable and the ground
states of the model have vanishing vacuum energy and are exactly
supersymmetric. If the SESHM is confirmed at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC),
the numerical values of the parameters of the model have a bearing on key
properties of the susy phase and might provide an estimate of the remaining
time before a possible decay of our false vacuum. We provide some analysis of
the model including a treatment of phases in the potential and soft higgs
masses.
