We consider a 6D extension of the Randall-Sundrum (RS) model, RS6, where the
Standard Model (SM) gauge fields are allowed to propagate in an additional
dimension, compactified on $S^1$ or $S^1/Z_2$. In a minimal scenario, fermions
propagate in the 5D RS subspace and their localization provides a model of
flavor. New Kaluza-Klein (KK) states, corresponding to excitations of the gauge
fields along the 6th dimension, appear near the TeV scale. The new gauge KK
modes behave differently from those in the 5D warped models. These RS6 states
have couplings with strong dependence on 5D field localization and, within the
SM, only interact with heavy fermions and the Higgs sector, to a very good
approximation. Thus, the collider phenomenology of the new gauge KK states
sensitively depends on the 5D fermion geography. We briefly discuss inclusion
of SM fermions in all 6 dimensions, as well as the possibility of going beyond
6D.
