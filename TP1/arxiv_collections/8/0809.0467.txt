This is the first in a planned series of papers giving an alternate approach
to Zlil Sela's work on the Tarski problems. The present paper is an exposition
of work of Kharlampovich-Myasnikov and Sela giving a parametrization of
Hom(G,F) where G is a finitely generated group and F is a non-abelian free
group.
