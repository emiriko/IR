An analytic theory of electron transport in disordered graphene in a
ballistic geometry is developed. We consider a sample of a large width W and
analyze the evolution of the conductance, the shot noise, and the full
statistics of the charge transfer with increasing length L, both at the Dirac
point and at a finite gate voltage. The transfer matrix approach combined with
the disorder perturbation theory and the renormalization group is used. We also
discuss the crossover to the diffusive regime and construct a ``phase diagram''
of various transport regimes in graphene.
