We investigate ideals in a polynomial ring which are generated by powers of
linear forms. Such ideals are closely related to the theories of fat point
ideals, Cox rings, and box splines.
  We pay special attention to a family of power ideals that arises naturally
from a hyperplane arrangement A. We prove that their Hilbert series are
determined by the combinatorics of A, and can be computed from its Tutte
polynomial. We also obtain formulas for the Hilbert series of the resulting fat
point ideals and zonotopal Cox rings.
  Our work unifies and generalizes results due to Dahmen-Micchelli, Holtz-Ron,
Postnikov-Shapiro-Shapiro, and Sturmfels-Xu, among others. It also settles a
conjecture of Holtz-Ron on the spline interpolation of functions on the
interior lattice points of a zonotope.
