In the asymptotic setting, the optimal test for hypotheses testing of the
maximally entangled state is derived under several locality conditions for
measurements. The optimal test is obtained in several cases with the asymptotic
framework as well as the finite-sample framework. In addition, the experimental
scheme for the optimal test is presented.
