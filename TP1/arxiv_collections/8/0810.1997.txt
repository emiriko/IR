We define and study exact, efficient representations of realization spaces of
a natural class of underconstrained 2D Euclidean Distance Constraint
Systems(EDCS) or Frameworks based on 1-dof Henneberg-I graphs. Each
representation corresponds to a choice of parameters and yields a different
parametrized configuration space. Our notion of efficiency is based on the
algebraic complexities of sampling the configuration space and of obtaining a
realization from the sample (parametrized) configuration. Significantly, we
give purely combinatorial characterizations that capture (i) the class of
graphs that have efficient configuration spaces and (ii) the possible choices
of representation parameters that yield efficient configuration spaces for a
given graph. Our results automatically yield an efficient algorithm for
sampling realizations, without missing extreme or boundary realizations. In
addition, our results formally show that our definition of efficient
configuration space is robust and that our characterizations are tight. We
choose the class of 1-dof Henneberg-I graphs in order to take the next step in
a systematic and graded program of combinatorial characterizations of efficient
configuration spaces. In particular, the results presented here are the first
characterizations that go beyond graphs that have connected and convex
configuration spaces.
