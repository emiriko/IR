The 1-D dimension harmonic oscillator in Snyder space is investigated in its
classical and quantum versions. The classical trajectory is obtained and the
semiclassical quantization from the phase space trajectories is discussed. In
the meanwhile, an effective cutoff to high frequencies is found. The quantum
version is developed and an equivalent usual harmonic oscillator is obtained
through an effective mass and an effective frequency introduced in the model.
This modified parameters give us an also modified energy spectra.
