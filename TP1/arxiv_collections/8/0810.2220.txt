The Tokai-to-Kamioka (T2K) long-baseline neutrino-oscillation experiment is
being prepared for start of operations in Fall 2009. The purpose of T2K is to
measure the oscillation parameters from an intense muon neutrino beam. In order
to make precision measurements of muon neutrino disappearence a new detector
complex (ND280) will be used to identify the profile and composition of the
neutrino beam near its production site. ND280 will also be used to study
important background processes in the measurement of an electron neutrino
appearance signal at Super-K. We will describe the physics goals and technology
choices of ND280.
