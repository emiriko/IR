We show a new and constructive proof of the following language-theoretic
result: for every context-free language L, there is a bounded context-free
language L' included in L which has the same Parikh (commutative) image as L.
Bounded languages, introduced by Ginsburg and Spanier, are subsets of regular
languages of the form w1*w2*...wk* for some finite words w1,...,wk. In
particular bounded subsets of context-free languages have nice structural and
decidability properties. Our proof proceeds in two parts. First, using Newton's
iterations on the language semiring, we construct a context-free subset Ls of L
that can be represented as a sequence of substitutions on a linear language and
has the same Parikh image as L. Second, we inductively construct a
Parikh-equivalent bounded context-free subset of Ls.
  We show two applications of this result in model checking: to
underapproximate the reachable state space of multithreaded procedural programs
and to underapproximate the reachable state space of recursive counter
programs. The bounded language constructed above provides a decidable
underapproximation for the original problems. By iterating the construction, we
get a semi-algorithm for the original problems that constructs a sequence of
underapproximations such that no two underapproximations of the sequence can be
compared. This provides a progress guarantee: every word w in L is in some
underapproximation of the sequence. In addition, we show that our approach
subsumes context-bounded reachability for multithreaded programs.
