Deeply virtual Compton scattering (DVCS) is the golden exclusive channel for
the study of the partonic structure of hadrons, within the universal framework
of generalized parton distributions (GPDs). This paper presents the aim and
general ideas of the DVCS experimental program off nuclei at the Jefferson
Laboratory. The benefits of the study of the coherent and incoherent channels
to the understanding of the EMC (European Muon Collaboration) effect are
discussed, along with the case of nuclear targets to access neutron GPDs.
