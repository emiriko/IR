This paper generalizes both the binary Deutsch-Jozsa and Grover algorithms to
$n$-valued logic using the quantum Fourier transform. Our extended
Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm is not only able to distinguish between constant and
balanced Boolean functions in a single query, but can also find closed
expressions for classes of affine logical functions in quantum oracles,
accurate to a constant term. Furthermore, our multi-valued extension of the
Grover algorithm for quantum database search requires fewer qudits and hence a
substantially smaller memory register, as well as fewer wasted information
states, to implement. We note several applications of these algorithms and
their advantages over the binary cases.
