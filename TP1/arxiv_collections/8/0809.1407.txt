Collider signatures containing bosons and jets are particularly interesting.
Recent theoretical effort has been devoted to determining predictions of W/Z +
multiple parton production; the high statistics sample of W/Z + jets events
collected at the Tevatron is a valuable testbed for probing the validity of
these calculations. The final state containing a Z or W boson and one or more
b-jets is a promising Higgs search channel at the Tevatron and could be a
window to new physics at the LHC. These searches benefit from a deep
understanding of the production of W/Z + heavy flavor jets which constitutes a
significant background to the more exotic sources of this signature. Herein the
latest Tevatron results on these production mechanisms are reviewed with an
emphasis on comparison of data results to the latest theoretical models.
