We exactly construct one- and two-qubit holonomic quantum gates in terms of
isospectral deformations of an Ising model Hamiltonian. A single logical qubit
is constructed out of two spin-1/2 particles; the qubit is a dimer. We find
that the holonomic gates obtained are discrete but dense in the unitary group.
Therefore an approximate gate for a desired one can be constructed with
arbitrary accuracy.
