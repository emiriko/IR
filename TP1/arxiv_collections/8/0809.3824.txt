In an incomplete financial market, the axiomatic of Time Consistent Pricing
Procedure (TCPP), recently introduced, is used to assign to any financial asset
a dynamic limit order book, taking into account both the dynamics of basic
assets and the limit order books for options.
  Kreps-Yan fundamental theorem is extended to that context. A characterization
of TCPP calibrated on options is given in terms of their dual representation.
In case of perfectly liquid options, these options can be used as the basic
assets to hedge dynamically. A generic family of TCPP calibrated on option
prices is constructed, from cadlag BMO martingales.
