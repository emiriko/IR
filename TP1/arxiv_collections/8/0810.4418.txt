Spin bases of relevance for quantum systems with cyclic symmetry as well as
for quantum information and quantum computation are constructed from the theory
of angular momentum. This approach is connected to the use of generalized Pauli
matrices (in dimension d) arising from a polar decomposition of the group
SU(2). Numerous examples are given for d=2, 3 and 4.
