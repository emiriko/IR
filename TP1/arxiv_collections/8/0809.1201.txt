We show that any separated essentially finite-type map $f$ of noetherian
schemes globally factors as $f = hi$ where $i$ is an injective localization map
and $h$ a separated finite-type map. In particular, via Nagata's
compactification theorem, $h$ can be chosen to be proper. We apply these
results to Grothendieck duality. We also obtain other factorization results and
provide essentialized versions of many general results such as Zariski's Main
Theorem, Chow's Lemma, and blow-up descriptions of birational maps.
