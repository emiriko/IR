In this paper, we propose a novel channel estimation technique based on 2D
spread pilots. The merits of this technique are its simplicity, its flexibility
regarding the transmission scenarios, and the spectral efficiency gain obtained
compared to the classical pilot based estimation schemes used in DVB standards.
We derive the analytical expression of the mean square error of the estimator
and show it is a function of the autocorrelation of the channel in both time
and frequency domains. The performance evaluated over a realistic channel model
shows the efficiency of this technique which turns out to be a promising
channel estimation for the future mobile video broadcasting systems.
