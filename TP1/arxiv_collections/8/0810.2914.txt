Recent measurements on the vector boson plus heavy-flavor jets production by
the CDF and D0 experiments are presented in comparisons with recent theoretical
predictions. Good understanding of such processes is important to improve our
understanding of QCD and also to enhance the potential to search for
yet-to-be-discovered new physics phenomena which lead to similar final states.
