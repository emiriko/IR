Based on the generalized hidden local symmetry as the chiral model of
pseudoscalar, vector, and axial vector mesons, the excitation curve of the
reaction e^+e^-\to\pi^+\pi^-\pi^+\pi^- is calculated for energies in the
interval 0.65\leq \sqrt{s}\leq1 GeV. The theoretical predictions are compared
to available data of CMD-2 and BaBaR. It is shown that the inclusion of heavy
isovector resonances \rho(1450) and \rho(1700) is necessary for reconciling
calculations with the data. It is found that at \sqrt{s}\approx1 GeV the
contributions of the above resonances are much larger, by the factor of 30,
than the \rho(770) one, and are amount to a considerable fraction \sim0.3-0.6
of the latter at \sqrt{s}\sim m_\rho.
