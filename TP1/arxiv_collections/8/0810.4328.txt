We calculate the light pseudoscalar decay constants, f_pi and f_K, and their
ratio using domain wall valence quarks and 2+1 flavors of dynamical staggered
quarks. Use of the MILC gauge configurations allows us to simulate at several
sea quark masses and spatial volumes, and with two lattice spacings. We study
how well our numerical lattice data for light decay constants and meson masses
is described by next-to-leading order SU(3) mixed action chiral perturbation
theory and explain our strategy for the chiral and continuum extrapolation.
Combining our result for f_K/f_pi with experimental measurements of pion and
kaon leptonic decays allows a model-independent determination of |V_us|/|V_ud|;
we find a preliminary value of |V_us|/|V_ud| = 0.2315(45)(7).
