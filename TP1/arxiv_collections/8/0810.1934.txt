The gravitational energy-momentum and angular momentum satisfy the algebra of
the Poincare group in the full phase space of the teleparallel equivalent of
general relativity. The expression for the gravitational energy-momentum may be
written as a surface integral in the three-dimensional spacelike hypersurface,
whereas the definition for the angular momentum is given by a volume integral.
It turns out that in practical calculations of the angular momentum of the
gravitational field generated by localized sources like rotating neutron stars,
the volume integral reduces to a surface integral, and the calculations can be
easily carried out. Similar to previous investigations in the literature, we
show that the total angular momentum is finite provided a certain asymptotic
behaviour is verified. We discuss the dependence of the gravitational angular
momentum on the frame, and argue that it is a measure of the dragging of
inertial frames.
