We report the observation of dipole-forbidden, but quadrupole-allowed,
one-photon transitions to high Rydberg states in Rb. Using pulsed UV excitation
of ultracold atoms in a magneto-optical trap, we excite $5s \to nd$ transitions
over a range of principal quantum numbers $n=27-59$. Compared to dipole-allowed
(E1) transitions from $5s \to np$, these E2 transitions are weaker by a factor
of approximately 2000. We also report measurements of the anomalous $np_{3/2} :
np_{1/2}$ fine-structure transition strength ratio for $n=28-75$. Both results
are in agreement with theoretical predictions.
