Excited neutral hyperons Y0* produced in the pp -> p K+ Y0* reaction with a
COSY beam momentum of 3.65 MeV/c have masses below 1540 MeV/c2. The ANKE
spectrometer allows the simultaneous observation of different decay modes: Y0*
-> pion0Sigma0, pion+-Sigma-+, pion0Lambda, K-p by measuring kaons and pions of
either charge in coincidence with protons. We have found indications for a
neutral excited hyperon resonance Y0* with a mass of (1480 +- 15) MeV/c2 and a
width of (60 +- 15) MeV/c2. The cross section for Y0* is of the order of few
hundred nanobarns. It can be either a Sigma0 or a Lambda hyperon and on the
basis of existing data no conclusion could be made whether it is a three-quark
baryon or an exotic state. Missing- and invariant-mass techniques have been
used to identify the Lambda(1405) resonance decaying via Sigma0pion0. The cross
section for Lambda(1405) production is equal to (4.5 +- 0.9(stat) +- 1.8(syst))
microbarn. The shape and position of the Lambda(1405) distribution are similar
to those found from other decay modes, so no support is given to the two-pole
model.
