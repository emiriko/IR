We study numerically the late-time behaviour of the coupled Einstein
Yang-Mills system. We restrict ourselves to spherical symmetry and employ
Bondi-like coordinates with radial compactification. Numerical results exhibit
tails with exponents close to -4 at timelike infinity $i^+$ and -2 at future
null infinity \Scri.
