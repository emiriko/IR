We consider the gravity in the system consisting of the
Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) D3-brane embedded in the flat background
geometry, produced by the solutions of the supergravity. The effective action
for this system is represented by the sum of the Hilbert-Einstein and DBI
actions. We derive the Wheeler-De Witt equation for this system and obtain
analytical solutions in some special cases. We also calculate tunneling
probability from Planckian size of D3-brane to the classical regime.
