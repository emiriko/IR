The radial polynomials of the 2D (circular) and 3D (spherical) Zernike
functions are tabulated as powers of the radial distance. The reciprocal
tabulation of powers of the radial distance in series of radial polynomials is
also given, based on projections that take advantage of the orthogonality of
the polynomials over the unit interval. They may play a role in the expansion
of products of the polynomials into sums, which is demonstrated by some
examples. Multiplication of the polynomials by the angular bases (azimuth,
polar angle) defines the Zernike functions, for which we derive and tabulate
transformations to and from the Cartesian coordinate system centered at the
middle of the circle or sphere.
