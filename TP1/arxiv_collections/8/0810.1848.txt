Parameters of nuclear density distributions are derived from least-squares
fits to strong interaction observables in exotic atoms. Global analyses of
antiprotonic and pionic atoms show reasonably good agreement between the two
types of probes regarding the average behaviour of root-mean-square radii of
the neutron distributions. Apparent conflict regarding the shape of the neutron
distribution is attributed to different radial sensitivities of these two
probes.
