On the basis of the recently developed lattice formulation of supersymmetric
theories which keeps a part of the supersymmetry, we propose a method of
observing dynamical SUSY breaking with lattice simulation. We use Hamiltonian
as an order parameter and measure the ground state energy as a zero temperature
limit of the finite temperature simulation. Our method provides a way of
obtaining a physical result from the lattice simulation for supersymmetric
theories.
