We report linear thermal expansion and magnetostriction measurements for
CeRu$_2$Si$_2$ in magnetic fields up to 52.6 mT and at temperatures down to 1
mK. At high temperatures, this compound showed Landau-Fermi-liquid behavior:
The linear thermal expansion coefficient and the magnetostriction coefficient
were proportional to the temperature and magnetic field, respectively. In
contrast, a pronounced non-Fermi-liquid effect was found below 50 mK. The
negative contribution of thermal expansion and magnetostriction suggests the
existence of an additional quantum critical point.
