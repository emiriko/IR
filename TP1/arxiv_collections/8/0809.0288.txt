We demonstrate a novel experimental arrangement which rotates a 2D optical
lattice at frequencies up to several kilohertz. Ultracold atoms in such a
rotating lattice can be used for the direct quantum simulation of strongly
correlated systems under large effective magnetic fields, allowing
investigation of phenomena such as the fractional quantum Hall effect. Our
arrangement also allows the periodicity of a 2D optical lattice to be varied
dynamically, producing a 2D accordion lattice.
