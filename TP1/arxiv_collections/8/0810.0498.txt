In order to understand the nonlinear stability of many types of time-periodic
travelling waves on unbounded domains, one must overcome two main difficulties:
the presence of embedded neutral eigenvalues and the time-dependence of the
associated linear operator. This problem is studied in the context of
time-periodic Lax shocks in systems of viscous conservation laws. Using spatial
dynamics and a decomposition into separate Floquet eigenmodes, it is shown that
the linear evolution for the time-dependent operator can be represented using a
contour integral similar to that of the standard time-independent case. By
decomposing the resulting Green's distribution, the leading order behavior
associated with the embedded eigenvalues is extracted. Sharp pointwise bounds
are then obtained, which are used to prove that time-periodic Lax shocks are
linearly and nonlinearly stable under the necessary conditions of spectral
stability and minimal multiplicity of the translational eigenvalues. The latter
conditions hold, for example, for small-oscillation time-periodic waves that
emerge through a supercritical Hopf bifurcation from a family of
time-independent Lax shocks of possibly large amplitude.
