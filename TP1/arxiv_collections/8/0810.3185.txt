I review the linearized hydrodynamical treatment of a fast parton traversing
a perturbative quark-gluon plasma. Using numerical solutions for the medium's
response to the fast parton, I obtain the medium's distribution function which
is then used in a Cooper-Frye freeze-out prescription to obtain an azimuthal
particle spectrum. Two different freeze-out scenarios are considered which
yield significantly different results. I conclude that any meaningful
comparison of azimuthal hadron correlation functions to RHIC data requires
implementing a realistic freeze-out scenario in an expanding medium.
