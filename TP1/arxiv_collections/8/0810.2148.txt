The phase equivalent relativistic NN potential, which is related by a
nonlinear equation to the original nonrelativistic potential, is used to
construct the mass operator (rest Hamiltonian) of the 3-nucleon system.
Employing the CD Bonn NN potential, the solution of the relativistic 3N Faddeev
equation for $^3$H shows slightly less binding energy than the corresponding
nonrelativistic result. The effect of the Wigner spin rotation on the binding
is very small.
