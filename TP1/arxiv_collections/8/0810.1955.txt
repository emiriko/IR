We consider an interface between two non-Abelian quantum Hall states: the
Moore-Read state, supporting anyons of Ising type, and the k=2 NASS
(non-Abelian spin-singlet) state, supporting anyons of Fibonacci type. It is
shown that the interface supports neutral excitations described by a 1+1
dimensional conformal field theory with central charge c=7/10. We discuss
effects of the mismatch of the quantum statistical properties of the
quasi-holes between the two sides, as reflected by the interface theory.
