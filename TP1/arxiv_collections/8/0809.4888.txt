SU(3) gauge theory with dynamical overlap fermions in the 2-index symmetric
(sextet) representation is considered. This model may be a viable model of the
electroweak symmetry breaking sector along the lines of the walking technicolor
paradigm. The number of fermion species is chosen such that the theory is
expected to be below the conformal window. We will discuss how the
epsilon-regime and random matrix theory can be used to test whether at any
given set of parameters (N_c, N_f, representation) the theory is in the
conformal phase or indeed just below it. Quenched Monte Carlo results are
included in the fundamental representation and also preliminary dynamical ones
in the 2-index symmetric representation.
