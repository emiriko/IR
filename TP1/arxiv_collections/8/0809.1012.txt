Using a Monte Carlo (MC) method, we study an effective model for the
Fe(II)Fe(III) bimetallic oxalates. Within a hybrid quantum-classical MC
algorithm, the Heisenberg S=2 and $S'=5/2$ spins on the Fe(II) and Fe(III)
sites are updated using a quantum MC loop while the Ising-like orbital angular
momenta on the Fe(II) sites are updated using a single-spin classical MC flip.
The effective field acting on the orbital angular momenta depends on the
quantum state of the system. We find that the mean-field phase diagram for the
model is surprisingly robust with respect to fluctuations. In particular, the
region displaying two compensation points shifts and shrinks but remains
finite.
