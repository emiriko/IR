We introduce history-dependent discrete-time quantum random walk models by
adding uncorrelated memory terms and also by modifying Hamiltonian of the
walker to include couplings with memory-keeping agents. We next numerically
study the correlation effects in these models. We also propose a correlation
exponent as a relevant and promising tool for investigation of correlation or
memory (hence non-Markovian) effects. Our analysis can easily be applied to
more realistic models in which different regimes may emerge because of
competition between different underlying physical mechanisms.
