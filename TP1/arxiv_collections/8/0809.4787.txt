Light bosons can be found in large classes of theories beyond the Standard
Model. These light bosons may not be ruled out by current experiments and,
indeed, may even provide an explanation for some anomalous experimental
results. The radiative decays of quarkonium ($c \bar c, b \bar b$) states offer
a promising opportunity to investigate such light bosons. Specifically, we
investigate the reach that current CLEO data can have on models with light
scalar and pseudoscalar bosons.
