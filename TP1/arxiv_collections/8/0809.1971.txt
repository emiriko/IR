With the ever-growing availability of so-called complex data, especially on
the Web, decision-support systems such as data warehouses must store and
process data that are not only numerical or symbolic. Warehousing and analyzing
such data requires the joint exploitation of metadata and domain-related
knowledge, which must thereby be integrated. In this paper, we survey the types
of knowledge and metadata that are needed for managing complex data, discuss
the issue of knowledge and metadata integration, and propose a CWM-compliant
integration solution that we incorporate into an XML complex data warehousing
framework we previously designed.
