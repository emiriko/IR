A new approach to study the equation of state in finite-temperature QCD is
proposed on the lattice. Unlike the conventional method in which the temporal
lattice size $N_t$ is fixed, the temperature $T$ is varied by changing $N_t$ at
fixed lattice scale. The pressure of the hot QCD plasma is calculated by the
integration of the trace anomaly with respect to $T$ at fixed lattice scale.
This "$T$-integral method" is tested in quenched QCD on isotropic and
anisotropic lattices and is shown to give reliable results especially at
intermediate and low temperatures.
