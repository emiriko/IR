We describe local light-ray rotation in terms of complex refractive indices.
We show that Fermat's principle holds, and we derive an extended Snell's law.
The change in the angle of a light ray with respect to the normal to a
refractive-index interface is described by the modulus of the refractive-index
ratio, the rotation around the interface normal is described by the argument of
the refractive-index ratio.
