We show that the shear rate at a fixed shear stress in a micellar gel in a
jammed state exhibits large fluctuations, showing positive and negative values,
with the mean shear rate being positive. The resulting probability distribution
functions (PDF's) of the global power flux to the system vary from Gaussian to
non-Gaussian, depending on the driving stress and in all cases show similar
symmetry properties as predicted by Gallavotti-Cohen steady state fluctuation
relation. The fluctuation relation allows us to determine an effective
temperature related to the structural constraints of the jammed state. We have
measured the stress dependence of the effective temperature. Further,
experiments reveal that the effective temperature and the standard deviation of
the shear rate fluctuations increase with the decrease of the system size.
