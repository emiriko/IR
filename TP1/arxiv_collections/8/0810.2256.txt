By fixing the internal CP factor of tachyon and massless Ramond vertex
operators in different pictures, we have shown that the internal CP factor of
the disk level S-matrix elements of two fermions and odd number of tachyon
vertex operators in the world volume of non-BPS D-branes/D-brane-anti-D-brane
is zero. We have calculated the S-matrix element of two fermions and two
tachyons which has non vanishing internal CP factor, and found the momentum
expansion of this amplitude. In the abelian case, we have compared the
two-fermion-two-tachyon coupling at low energy with the corresponding coupling
in the gauge-fixed supersymmetric tachyon DBI action. The couplings in the two
cases are exactly the same.
