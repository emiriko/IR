We present a full configuration interaction study of the spontaneous
recombination of neutral and singly charged excitons (trions) in semiconductor
quantum dots, from weak to strong coupling regimes. We find that the
enhancement of the recombination rate of neutral excitons with increasing dot
size is suppressed for negative trions, and even reversed for positive trions.
Our findings agree with recent comprehensive photoluminescence experiments in
self-assembled quantum dots [P. Dalgarno et al. Phys. Rev. B {\bf 77}, 245311
(2008)] and confirm the major role played by correlations in the valence
band.The effect of the temperature on the photoluminescence spectrum and that
of the ratio between the electron and hole wavefunction lengthscales are also
described.
