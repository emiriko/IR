We consider a quantum system consisting of N parts, each of which is a
"quKit" described by a K dimensional Hilbert space. We prove that in the
symmetric subspace, S, a pure state is not globally entangled, if and only if
it is a coherent state. It is also shown that in the orthogonal complement all
states are globally entangled.
