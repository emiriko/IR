We present preliminary results of lattice simulations of SU(2) gauge theory
with two Wilson fermions in the adjoint representation. This theory has
recently attracted considerable attention because it might possess an infrared
fixed point (or an almost-fixed-point), and hence be a candidate for a walking
technicolor theory. In this work we study the particle spectrum of the theory,
and compare it with more familiar spectrum of the theory with SU(2) gauge
fields and two flavors of fundamental representation fermions.
