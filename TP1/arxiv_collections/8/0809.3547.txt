The first exact interior solution to Einstein's field equations for a static
and non-uniform braneworld star with local and non-local bulk terms is
presented. It is shown that the bulk Weyl scalar ${\cal U}(r)$ is always
negative inside the stellar distribution, in consequence it reduces both the
effective density and the effective pressure. It is found that the anisotropy
generated by bulk gravity effect has an acceptable physical behaviour inside
the distribution. Using a Reissner-N\"{o}rdstrom-like exterior solution, the
effects of bulk gravity on pressure and density are found through matching
conditions.
