We investigate classical Heisenberg spins on the Shastry-Sutherland lattice
and under an external magnetic field. A detailed study is carried out both
analytically and numerically by means of classical Monte-Carlo simulations.
Magnetization pseudo-plateaux are observed around 1/3 of the saturation
magnetization for a range of values of the magnetic couplings. We show that the
existence of the pseudo-plateau is due to an entropic selection of a particular
collinear state. A phase diagram that shows the domains of existence of those
pseudo-plateaux in the $(h, T)$ plane is obtained.
