We study Manakov-Santini equation, starting from Lax-Sato form of associated
hierarchy. The waterbag reduction for Manakov-Santini hierarchy is introduced.
Equations of reduced hierarchy are derived.We construct new coordinates
transforming non-hydrodynamic evolution of waterbag reduction to
non-homogeneous Riemann invariants form of hydrodynamic type.
