Complex fluids exhibit structure on a wide range of length and time scales,
and hierarchical approaches are necessary to investigate all facets of their
often unusual properties. The study of idealized coarse-grained models at
different levels of coarse-graining can provide insight into generic structures
and basic dynamical processes at equilibrium and non-equilibrium.
  In the first part of this lecture, some popular coarse-grained models for
membranes and membrane systems are reviewed. Special focus is given to
bead-spring models with different solvent representations, and to
random-interface models. Selected examples of simulations at the molecular and
the mesoscopic level are presented, and it is shown how simulations of
molecular coarse-grained models can bridge between different levels.
  The second part addresses simulation methods for complex fluids under shear.
After a brief introduction into the phenomenology (in particular for liquid
crystals), different non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) methods are
introduced and compared to one another. Application examples include the
behavior of liquid crystal interfaces and lamellar surfactant phases under
shear. Finally, mesoscopic simulation approaches for liquid crystals under
shear are briefly discussed.
