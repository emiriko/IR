We find a new black hole in three dimensional anti-de Sitter space by
introducing an anisotropic perfect fluid inspired by the noncommutative black
hole. This is a regular black hole with two horizons. We compare thermodynamics
of this black hole with that of non-rotating BTZ black hole. The first-law of
thermodynamics is not compatible with the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy.
