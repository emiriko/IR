We present new developments of the "magnetic scenario" for the QCD Fluid
observed at RHIC. The recent lattice data for finite T monopoles are used to
pin down the parameters of the magnetic component of quark-gluon plasma: in
particular we show how the magnetic density and plasma coupling $\Gamma_M$
change with $T$. We then discuss one central issue imposed by the heavy ion
data: i.e. the extremely short dissipation length in the QCD fluid around
$T_c$. We show that the Lorentz trapping effect, present only in a plasma with
both electric and magnetic charges and maximal for an equal 50%-50% mixture, is
the microscopic mechanism leading to the nearly perfect fluidity.
