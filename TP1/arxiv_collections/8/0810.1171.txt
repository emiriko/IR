Employing the Worldline casting of the Dosch-Simonov Stochastic Vacuum
Model(SVM) for QCD, a simulated meson-meson scattering is studied in the Regge
kinematical regime. The process is modelled in terms of the "helicoidal" Wilson
contour first introduced by Janic and Peschanski in a related study based on an
AdS/CFT-type approach. Using lattice supported estimations for the behavior of
a two-point, field strength correlation function, as defined in the framework
of the SVM, the reggeon slope and intercept are calculated in a semiclassical
approximation. The resulting values are in good agreement with the accepted
phenomenological ones. Going beyond this approximation, the contribution
resulting from boundary fluctuations of the Wilson loop contour is also
estimated.
