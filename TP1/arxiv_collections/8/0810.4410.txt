Magneto-transmission of a thin layer of bulk graphite is compared with
spectra taken on multilayer epitaxial graphene prepared by thermal
decomposition of a SiC crystal. We focus on the spectral features evolving as
\sqrt{B}, which are evidence for the presence of Dirac fermions in both
materials. Whereas the results on multi-layer epitaxial graphene can be
interpreted within the model of 2D Dirac fermions, the data obtained on bulk
graphite can only be explained taking into account the 3D nature of graphite,
e.g. by using the standard Slonczewski-Weiss-McClure model.
