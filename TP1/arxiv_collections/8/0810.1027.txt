One of the first channels to be experimentally analyzed at the LHC is $ p + p
\longrightarrow l^+ + l ^- + X $. A resonance in this channel would be a clear
indication of a new gauge neutral boson, as proposed in many extended models.
In this paper we call attention to the possibility that the new resonance in
this channel could have spin zero. A new high mass spin zero state could be a
strong indication of the composite nature of the standard model particles. We
have made a comparison between spin zero and spin one for the new hypothetical
heavy gauge particle production and decays and we show some distributions that
can easily identify their spins.
