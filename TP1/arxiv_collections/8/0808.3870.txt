We propose a static and a dynamic approach to model biological signaling
networks, and show how each can be used to answer relevant biological
questions. For this we use the two different mathematical tools of
Propositional Logic and Integer Programming. The power of discrete mathematics
for handling qualitative as well as quantitative data has so far not been
exploited in Molecular Biology, which is mostly driven by experimental
research, relying on first-order or statistical models. The arising logic
statements and integer programs are analyzed and can be solved with standard
software. For a restricted class of problems the logic models reduce to a
polynomial-time solvable satisfiability algorithm. Additionally, a more dynamic
model enables enumeration of possible time resolutions in poly-logarithmic
time. Computational experiments are included.
