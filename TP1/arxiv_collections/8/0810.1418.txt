We report the synthesizing and characterization of the hole doped Ni-based
superconductor ($La_{1-x}Sr_{x})NiAsO$. By substituting La with Sr, the
superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ is increased from 2.4 K of the
parent phase $LaNiAsO$ to 3.7 K at the doping levels x= 0.1 - 0.2. The curve
$T_c$ versus hole concentration shows a symmetric behavior as the electron
doped samples $LaNiAs(O_{1-x}F_{x})$. The normal state resistivity in Ni-based
samples shows a good metallic behavior and reveals the absence of spin density
wave induced anomaly which appears in the Fe-based system at about 150 K. Hall
effect measurements indicate that the electron conduction in the parent phase
$LaNiAsO$ is dominated by electron-like charge carriers, while with more Sr
doping, a hole-like band will emerge and finally prevail over the conduction,
such a phenomenon reflects that the Fermi surface of $LaNiAsO$ comprises of
electron pockets and hole pockets, thus the sign of charge carriers could be
changed once the contribution of hole pockets overwhelms that of electron
pockets. Magnetoresistance measurements and the violation of Kohler rule
provide further proof that multiband effect dominate the normal state transport
of ($La_{1-x}Sr_{x})NiAsO$.
