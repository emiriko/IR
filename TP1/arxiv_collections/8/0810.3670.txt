We study the structure of a uniformly randomly chosen partial order of width
2 on n elements. We show that under the appropriate scaling, the number of
incomparable elements converges to the height of a one dimensional Brownian
excursion at a uniformly chosen random time in the interval [0,1], which
follows the Rayleigh distribution.
