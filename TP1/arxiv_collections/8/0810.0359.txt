This paper studies the multiplicative ideal structure of commutative rings in
which every finitely generated ideal is quasi-projective. Section 2 provides
some preliminaries on quasi-projective modules over commutative rings. Section
3 investigates the correlation with well-known Prufer conditions; namely, we
prove that this class of rings stands strictly between the two classes of
arithmetical rings and Gaussian rings. Thereby, we generalize Osofsky's theorem
on the weak global dimension of arithmetical rings and partially resolve
Bazzoni-Glaz's related conjecture on Gaussian rings. We also establish an
analogue of Bazzoni-Glaz results on the transfer of Prufer conditions between a
ring and its total ring of quotients. Section 4 examines various contexts of
trivial ring extensions in order to build new and original examples of rings
where all finitely generated ideals are subject to quasi-projectivity, marking
their distinction from related classes of Prufer rings.
