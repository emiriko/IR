Correlations between pairs of projectile-like fragments, emitted by the
system ${^{16}O}+{^{197}Au}$ at the laboratory bombarding energy of 515 MeV,
have been studied under two stipulated conditions: (1) at least one member of
the pair is emitted at an angle less than the grazing angle for the system, (2)
both the members of the pair are emitted at angles larger than the grazing
angle. A surprisingly large difference, by more than an order of magnitude, is
found between the correlations for the two cases. This observation could be
explained on the basis of a simple semi-classical break up model. Further
analysis of the variation of the charge correlation function with the
difference in the nuclear charges of the correlated pair showed trends which
are consistent with an "inelastic break up process", in which the projectile
breaks up at the radius of contact, in such a way that, one fragment
(preferably the lighter) is emitted to one side within the grazing angle, while
the other orbits around the target nucleus for a while and emerges on the other
side, at a negative scattering angle, much like in a deep inelastic scattering.
