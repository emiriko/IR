We show that using nonextensive entropy can lead to spontaneous symmetry
breaking when a parameter changes its value from that applicable for a
symmetric domain, as in field theory. We give the physical reasons and also
show that even for symmetric Dirichlet priors, such a defnition of the entropy
and the parameter value can lead to asymmetry when entropy is maximized.
