The strong coupling between individual optical emitters and propagating
surface plasmons confined to a conducting nanotip make this system act as an
ideal interface for quantum networks, through which a stationary qubit and a
flying photon (surface plasmon) qubit can be interconverted via a Raman
process. This quantum interface paves the way for many essential functions of a
quantum network, including sending, receiving, transferring, swapping, and
entangling qubits at distributed quantum nodes as well as a deterministic
source and an efficient detector of a single-photon. Numerical simulation shows
that this scheme is robust against experimental imperfections and has high
fidelity. Furthermore, being smaller this interface would significantly
facilitate the scalability of quantum computers.
