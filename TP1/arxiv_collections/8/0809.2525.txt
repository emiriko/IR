The core of a game $v$ on $N$, which is the set of additive games $\phi$
dominating $v$ such that $\phi(N)=v(N)$, is a central notion in cooperative
game theory, decision making and in combinatorics, where it is related to
submodular functions, matroids and the greedy algorithm. In many cases however,
the core is empty, and alternative solutions have to be found. We define the
$k$-additive core by replacing additive games by $k$-additive games in the
definition of the core, where $k$-additive games are those games whose M\"obius
transform vanishes for subsets of more than $k$ elements. For a sufficiently
high value of $k$, the $k$-additive core is nonempty, and is a convex closed
polyhedron. Our aim is to establish results similar to the classical results of
Shapley and Ichiishi on the core of convex games (corresponds to Edmonds'
theorem for the greedy algorithm), which characterize the vertices of the core.
