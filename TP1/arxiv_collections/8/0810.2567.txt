The interpretation of some electrovacuum spacetimes in terms of
counterrotating perfect fluid discs is presented. The interpretation is mades
by means of an "inverse problem" approach used to obtain disc sources of known
static solutions of the Einstein-Maxwell equations. In order to do such
interpretation, a detailed study is presented of the counterrotating model
(CRM) for generic electrovacuum static axially symmetric relativistic thin
discs with nonzero radial pressure. Four simple families of models of
counterrotating charged discs based on Chazy-Curzon-type, Zipoy-Voorhees-type,
Bonnor-Sackfield-type, and charged and magnetized Darmois electrovacuum metrics
are considered where we obtain some discs with a CRM well behaved.
