The Fermilab Tevatron offers unique opportunities to perform measurements of
the heavier b-hadrons that are not accessible at the Y(4S) resonance. In this
summary, we describe most important heavy flavor results from DO and CDF
collaborations and we discuss prospects for future measurements, that could
reveal New Physics before the start-up of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).
