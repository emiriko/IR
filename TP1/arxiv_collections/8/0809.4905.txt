We study the charge state of the diffusing O$_2$ molecule during silicon
oxidation through hybrid functional calculations. We calculate charge
transition levels of O$_2$ in bulk SiO$_2$ and use theoretical band offsets to
align these levels with respect to the Si band edges. To overcome the band-gap
problem of semilocal density fuctionals, we employ hybrid functionals with both
predefined and empirically adjusted mixing coefficients. We find that the
charge transition level $\epsilon^{0/-}$ in bulk SiO$_2$ occurs at $\sim$1.1 eV
above the silicon conduction band edge, implying that the O$_2$ molecule
diffuses through the oxide in the neutral charge state. While interfacial
effects concur to lower the charge transition level, our estimates suggest that
the neutral charge state persists until silicon oxidation.
