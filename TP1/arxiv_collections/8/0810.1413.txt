We present a numerical study of dephasing of electron spin ensembles in a
diffusive quasi-one-dimensional GaAs wire due to the D'yakonov-Perel'
spin-dephasing mechanism. For widths of the wire below the spin precession
length and for equal strength of Rashba and linear Dresselhaus spin-orbit
fields a strong suppression of spin-dephasing is found. This suppression of
spin-dephasing shows a strong dependence on the wire orientation with respect
to the crystal lattice. The relevance for realistic cases is evaluated by
studying how this effect degrades for deviating strength of Rashba and linear
Dresselhaus fields, and with the inclusion of the cubic Dresselhaus term.
