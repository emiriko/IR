The control of magnetic properties by means of an electric field is an
important aspect in magnetism and magnetoelectronics. We here utilize
magnetoelastic coupling in ferromagnetic/piezoelectric hybrids to realize a
voltage control of magnetization orientation at room temperature. The samples
consist of polycrystalline nickel thin films evaporated onto piezoelectric
actuators. The magnetic properties of these multifunctional hybrids are
investigated at room temperature as a function of the voltage controlled stress
exerted by the actuator on the Ni film. Ferromagnetic resonance spectroscopy
shows that the magnetic easy axis in the Ni film plane is rotated by 90 degree
upon changing the polarity of the voltage Vp applied to the actuator. In other
words, the in-plane uniaxial magnetic anisotropy of the Ni film can be inverted
via the application of an appropriate voltage Vp. Using SQUID magnetometry, the
evolution of the magnetization vector is recorded as a function of Vp and of
the external magnetic field. Changing Vp allows to reversibly adjust the
magnetization orientation in the Ni film plane within a range of approximately
70 degree. All magnetometry data can be quantitatively understood in terms of
the magnetic free energy determined from the ferromagnetic resonance
experiments. These results demonstrate that magnetoelastic coupling in hybrid
structures indeed is a viable option to control magnetization orientation in
technologically relevant ferromagnetic thin films at room temperature.
