We here present some recent developments of MadGraph/MadEvent since the
latest published version, 4.0. These developments include: Jet matching with
Pythia parton showers for both Standard Model and Beyond the Standard Model
processes, decay chain functionality, decay width calculation and decay
simulation, process generation for the Grid, a package for calculation of
quarkonium amplitudes, calculation of Matrix Element weights for experimental
events, automatic dipole subtraction for next-to-leading order calculations,
and an interface to FeynRules, a package for automatic calculation of Feynman
rules and model files from the Lagrangian of any New Physics model.
