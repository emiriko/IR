We experimentally investigate interference effects in transport across a
single incompressible strip at the edge of the quantum Hall system by using a
Fabry-Perot type interferometer. We find the interference oscillations in
transport across the incompressible strips with local filling factors $\nu_c=1,
4/3, 2/3$ even at high imbalances, exceeding the spectral gaps. In contrast,
there is no sign of the interference in transport across the principal Laughlin
$\nu_c=1/3$ incompressible strip. This indicates, that even at fractional
$\nu_c$, the interference effects are caused by "normal" electrons. The
oscillation's period is determined by the effective interferometer area, which
is sensitive to the filling factors because of screening effects.
