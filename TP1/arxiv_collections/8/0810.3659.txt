Non-abelian quantum Hall states are characterized by the simultaneous
appearance of charge and neutral gapless edge modes, with the structure of the
latter being intricately related to the existence of bulk quasi-particle
excitations obeying non-abelian statistics. In general, it is hard to probe the
neutral modes in charge transport measurements and a thermal transport
measurement seems to be inevitable. Here we propose a setup which can get
around this problem by having two point contacts in series separated by a
distance set by the thermal equilibration length of the charge mode. We show
that by using the first point contact as a heating device, the excess charge
noise measured at the second point contact carries a non-trivial signature of
the presence of the neutral mode hence leading to its indirect detection. We
also obtain explicit expressions for the thermal conductance and corresponding
Lorentz number for transport across a quantum point contact between two edges
held at different temperatures and chemical potentials.
