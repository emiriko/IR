This is an entry for the Gallery of Fluid Motion of the 61st Annual Meeting
of the APS-DFD (fluid dynamics videos). This video shows the collision and
rebound of viscoelastic drops against a solid wall. Using a high speed camera,
the process of approach, contact and rebound of drops of a viscoelastic liquid
is observed. We found that these drops first splash, similar to what is
observed in Newtonian colliding drops; after a few instants, the liquid
recoils, recovering its original drop shape and bounce off the wall.
