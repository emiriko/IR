We study the beta-deformation of N=4 SYM on S^3 with chemical potentials for
the U(1)_R as well as the two global U(1) symmetries. The one-loop effective
potential at weak coupling is computed for both the Coulomb and Higgs branches.
At near critical chemical potential and small finite temperature, we find a
metastable state at the origin of moduli space. On the Higgs branch, this has
the interpretation in terms of deconstruction as an extra-dimensional torus
which becomes metastable for infinite size and decays to zero size through
quantum tunnelling and thermal activation. At strong coupling, the theory is
described by its gravitational dual. The relevant background is found by
performing a TsT-transformation on the solution describing an AdS_5 black hole
spinning in S^5. A probe-brane calculation, using giant gravitons as probes,
reveals qualitative agreement with the weak coupling results.
