The magnetic-field-induced variations of the microwave surface resistance
have been investigated in a heavily neutron-irradiated MgB2 sample, in which
the irradiation has caused the merging of the two gaps into a single value. The
experimental results have been analyzed in the framework of the Coffey and Clem
model. By fitting the experimental data, we have determined the field
dependence of the depinning frequency, omega_0, at different values of the
temperature. Although the pinning is not particularly effective, the value of
omega_0 obtained at low temperatures is considerably higher than that observed
in conventional low-temperature superconductors.
