We present a method to convert certain single photon sources into devices
capable of emitting large strings of photonic cluster state in a controlled and
pulsed "on demand" manner. Such sources would greatly reduce the resources
required to achieve linear optical quantum computation. Standard spin errors,
such as dephasing, are shown to affect only 1 or 2 of the emitted photons at a
time. This allows for the use of standard fault tolerance techniques, and shows
that the photonic machine gun can be fired for arbitrarily long times. Using
realistic parameters for current quantum dot sources, we conclude high
entangled-photon emission rates are achievable, with Pauli-error rates per
photon of less than 0.2%. For quantum dot sources the method has the added
advantage of alleviating the problematic issues of obtaining identical photons
from independent, non-identical quantum dots, and of exciton dephasing.
