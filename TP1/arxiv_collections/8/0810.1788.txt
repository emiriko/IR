We discuss the properties of a strongly interacting spin-charge separated one
dimensional system coupled to ferromagnets and/or superconductors. Our results
are valid for arbitrary temperatures with respect to the spin energy, but
require temperature be small compared to the charge energy. We focus mainly on
the spin-incoherent regime where temperature is large compared to the spin
energy, but small compared to the charge energy. In the case of a ferromagnet
we study spin pumping and the renormalized dynamics of a precessing magnetic
order parameter. We find the interaction-dependent temperature dependence of
the spin pumping can be qualitatively different in the spin-incoherent regime
from the Luttinger liquid regime, allowing an identification of the former.
Likewise, the temperature dependence of the renormlized magnetization dynamics
can be used to identify spin-incoherent physics. For the case of a
spin-incoherent Luttinger liquid coupled to two superconductors, we compute the
ac and dc Josephson current for a wire geometry in the limit of tunnel coupled
superconductors. Both the ac and dc response contain "smoking gun" signatures
that can be used to identify spin-incoherent behavior. Experimental
requirements for the observation of these effects are laid out.
