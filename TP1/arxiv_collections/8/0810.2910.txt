We review photodetectors used in present running neutrino telescopes. After a
brief historical discourse, the photodetector requirements for the next
generation deep underwater neutrino telescopes are discussed. It is shown that
large area vacuum hybrid phototubes are the closest to the ideal photodetector
for such kind of applications when compared with other vacuum phototubes.
