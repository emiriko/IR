Recent experiments on bismuth have uncovered remarkably rich magnetization
structure at fields well beyond the regime in which all carriers are expected
to reside in the lowest Landau level. Motivated by these findings, we start
from a microscopic tight-binding model and derive a low-energy Hamiltonian for
the holes and three Dirac electrons pockets in bismuth. We find that an
unconventional electron Zeeman effect, overlooked previously, suppresses the
quantum limit for the electrons dramatically, giving rise to the observed
anomalous magnetization structure. We further study interaction effects near
fields at which the 2nd Landau level for one electron pocket empties, where
magnetization hysteresis was observed. Here we find instabilities towards both
charge density wave and Wigner crystal phases, and propose that hysteresis
arises from a first-order transition out of the latter.
