Based on the novel view that a micro-entity could be considered as a particle
associated with a field partaking of the energy of particle which are both
described by deterministic causal equations of motion, we examine the success
of our new theory in elucidating the underlying physics of the double-slit
experiment. Here, we explain with clear details how each micro-particle
scatters from one of the slits at a given time. After the scattering through
one of the slits, the particle shares some of its energy with its surrounding
field and a particle-field system is again formed which its motion is governed
by a deterministic dynamics during its flight towards the detecting screen. The
interference pattern is then explained by showing how the final location of
each particle-field system at the time of reaching the detecting screen is
distributed according to an angular distribution (equal to the what quantum
theory predicts for the fringe effects in a two-slit experiment). The
probabilistic nature of such a distribution can be explained by considering the
variations of the kinetic energy of the particle-field system at different
local situations.
