I examine a random network model where nodes are categorized by type and
linking probabilities can differ across types. I show that as homophily
increases (so that the probability to link to other nodes of the same type
increases and the probability of linking to nodes of some other types
decreases) the average distance and diameter of the network are unchanged,
while the average clustering in the network increases.
