We show that the spectrum of a complete submanifold properly immersed into a
ball of a Riemannian manifold is discrete, provided the norm of the mean
curvature vector is sufficiently small. In particular, the spectrum of a
complete minimal surface properly immersed into a ball of $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ is
discrete. This gives a positive answer to a question of Yau.
