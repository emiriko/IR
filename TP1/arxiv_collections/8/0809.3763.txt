Two extended cavity laser diodes are phase-locked, thanks to an intra-cavity
electro-optical modulator. The phase-locked loop bandwidth is on the order of
10 MHz, which is about twice larger than when the feedback correction is
applied on the laser current. The phase noise reaches -120 dBrad$^2$/Hz at 10
kHz. This new scheme reduces the residual laser phase noise, which constitutes
one of the dominant contributions in the sensitivity limit of atom
interferometers using two-photon transitions.
