An universal form of kinetic equation for open systems is considered which
naturally unifies classical and quantum cases and allows to extend concept of
wave function to open quantum systems. Corresponding stochastic Schr\"{o}dinger
equation is derived and illustrated by the example of inelastic scattering in
quantum conduction channel.
