We present lattice QCD results for the screening masses of light mesons and
charmonia. The lattice computations were performed with 2+1 flavors of improved
staggered quarks using quark masses which correspond to realistic pion and kaon
masses at zero temperature. For the light quark sector we have found that the
screening masses in the pseudo-scalar and the isovector scalar channels do not
become degenerate at the chiral crossover temperature indicating an effective
non-restoration of the axial symmetry. Also the splitting between the vector
and the pseudo-scalar screening masses persists even in the limit of zero
lattice spacing and at a moderately high temperature around 420 MeV. In the
charmonium sector our investigation shows that the screening masses of the
pseudo-scalar and the vector charmonia are almost (within a few percent) equal
to their zero temperature masses for temperatures less than 300 MeV. We also
present results for the charmonium screening masses using periodic boundary
conditions along the temporal direction and discuss their implications.
