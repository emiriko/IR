The results of the magnetization studies on Pr_{5}Ge_{3}and Tb_{5}Ge_{3}
single crystals are reported. Single Crystals of Pr_{5}Ge_{3} and Tb_{5}Ge_{3}
compounds were successfully grown by Czochralski method. These compounds
crystallize in a Mn_{5}Si_{3} type hexagonal structure with space group
P6_{3}/mcm. Ferromagnetic correlations set in at around 36 K in Pr_{5}Ge_{3} in
the ab plane followed by an antiferromagnetic transition at 13 K. Along the
c-axis the magnetization shows a ferromagnetic transition around 13 K with an
overall ferrimagnetic behavior. At 2K, the magnetic isotherm of the compound
along [0001] direction is typical for a ferromagnet, while a field induced
ferromagnetic type response is observed along the [10\overline{\mathit{1}}0]
direction. Hexagonal ab plane or [10\overline{\mathit{1}}0] direction was found
to be the easy axis of magnetization. Tb_{5}Ge_{3} orders antiferromagneticaly
at 85 K with the hexagonal ab plane as easy axis of magnetization. The compound
shows a field induced ferromagnetic behavior in its magnetic isotherm at 2 K.
