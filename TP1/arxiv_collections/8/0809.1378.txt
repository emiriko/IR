We study a SU(2)_L x U(1)_Y gauge theory in the Randall-Sundrum background,
including electroweak symmetry breaking due to a brane-localized Higgs sector.
We work in the decomposed four dimensional theory and treat the symmetry
breaking effects as a perturbation. Although there is an exact approach, this
method is widely used and quite intuitive. We extend existing studies by giving
explicit analytical expressions in a covariant R_xi gauge, needed for loop
calculations in the decomposed theory. The perturbative approach is also
applied to fermions and a comparison of the gauge boson and fermion spectra
with the exact results is presented, validating the perturbative method used in
the literature.
