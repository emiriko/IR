In this work, we try to propose, in a novel way using the Bose and Fermi
quantum network approach, a framework studying condensation and evolution of
space time network described by the Loop quantum gravity. Considering quantum
network connectivity features in the Loop quantum gravity, we introduce a link
operator, and through extending the dynamical equation for the evolution of
quantum network posed by Ginestra Bianconi to an operator equation, we get the
solution of the link operator. This solution is relevant to the Hamiltonian of
the network, and then is related to the energy distribution of network nodes.
Showing that tremendous energy distribution induce huge curved space-time
network, may have space time condensation in high-energy nodes. For example, in
the black hole circumstances, quantum energy distribution is related to the
area, thus the eigenvalues of the link operator of the nodes can be related to
quantum number of area, and the eigenvectors are just the spin network states.
This reveals that the degree distribution of nodes for space-time network is
quantized, which can form the space-time network condensation. The black hole
is a sort of result of space-time network condensation, however there may be
more extensive space-time network condensation, for example, the universe
singularity (big bang).
