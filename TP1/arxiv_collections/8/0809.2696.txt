Since many years, theoretical concepts of Data Mining have been developed and
improved. Data Mining has become applied to many academic and industrial
situations, and recently, soundings of public opinion about privacy have been
carried out. However, a consistent and standardized definition is still
missing, and the initial explanation given by Frawley et al. has pragmatically
often changed over the years. Furthermore, alternative terms like Knowledge
Discovery have been conjured and forged, and a necessity of a Data Warehouse
has been endeavoured to persuade the users. In this work, we pick up current
definitions and introduce an unified definition that covers existing attempted
explanations. For this, we appeal to the natural original of chemical states of
aggregation.
