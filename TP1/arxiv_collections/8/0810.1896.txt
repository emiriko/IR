Based on 58 million J/Psi events collected with the BESII detector at the
BEPC, the baryon pair processes J/Psi to $\Sigma^+ \bar{\Sigma}^-$ and J/Psi to
$\Xi^0 \bar{\Xi}^0$ are observed for the first time. The branching fractions
are measured to be ${\cal B}(J/Psi to \Sigma^+ \bar{\Sigma}^-)=(1.50\pm 0.10\pm
0.22)\times 10^{-3}$ and ${\cal B}(J/Psi to \Xi^0 \bar{\Xi}^0)=(1.20\pm 0.12\pm
0.21)\times 10^{-3}$, where the first errors are statistical and the second
ones are systematic.
