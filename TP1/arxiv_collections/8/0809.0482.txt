We prove uniqueness and give precise criteria for existence of split and
non-split Bessel models for a class of lowest and highest weight
representations of the groups GSp(4,R) and Sp(4,R) including all holomorphic
and anti-holomorphic discrete series representations. Explicit formulas for the
resulting Bessel functions are obtained by solving systems of differential
equations. The formulas are applied to derive an integral representation for a
global $L$-function on GSp(4)xGL(2) involving a vector-valued Siegel modular
form of degree 2.
