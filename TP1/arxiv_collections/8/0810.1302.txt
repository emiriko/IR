We investigate the electromagnetic mass splittings in the pseudoscalar meson
and nucleon systems by combining 2+1 flavor domain wall fermion gauge
configurations, generated by the RBC and UKQCD collaborations, and quenched,
non-compact, lattice QED configurations. We analyze finite volume effects by
using $16^3\times 32$ and $24^3\times 64$ lattices.
