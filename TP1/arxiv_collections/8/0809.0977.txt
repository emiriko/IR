We discuss cosmological consequences of the existence of physics beyond the
standard model that exhibits Banks-Zaks and unparticle behavior in the UV and
IR respectively. We first derive the equation of state for unparticles and use
it to obtain the temperature dependence of the corresponding energy and entropy
densities. We then formulate the Boltzmann and Kubo equations for both the
unparticles and the Banks-Zaks particles, and use these results to determine
the equilibrium conditions between the standard model and the new physics. We
conclude by obtaining the constraints on the effective number of degrees of
freedom of unparticles imposed by Big-Bang nucleosynthesis.
