In this paper, we give conditions under which we can compute the conjugate of
a convex function on the product of two Frechet spaces defined in terms of
another convex function on the product of two (possibly different) Frechet
spaces. We use this result to give simple proofs of some (both old and new)
results for Banach spaces, and deduce some (both old and new) stability results
for strongly representable multifunctions. We take as our starting point a
result on closed convex cones in the product of two Frechet spaces.
