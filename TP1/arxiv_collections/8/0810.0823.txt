There is presently disagreement between theory and experiment as well as
between different theoretical calculations concerning the fine-structure
splitting of the lowest P state of the neutral helium atom. We believe that we
have found a minor error in the formulas used by Drake et al. (Can. J. Phys.
80, 1195 (2002)) in their calculations, and we may have an explanation how the
error has occurred. To what extent this might resolve (part of) the discrepancy
is not known at present.
