An admissible observation operator is zero-class admissible if the norm of
the output map tends to zero as the time tends to zero. Sufficient and
necessary conditions for zero-class admissibility of observation operators are
developed and a modified Weiss condition is studied. It is shown that the
modified Weiss condition is in general necessary, but not sufficient for
zero-class admissibility. For several important classes of C_0-semigroups it is
proved that the modified Weiss condition is indeed equivalent to zero-class
admissibility. The methods are illustrated by certain PDE examples.
