I review the holographic theory of space-time and its applications to
cosmology. Much of this has appeared before, but the discussion is more unified
and concise. I also include some material on work in progress, whose aim is to
understand compactification in terms of finite dimensional super-algebras. This
is an expanded version of a lecture I gave at the conference on Liouville
Quantum Gravity and Statistical Systems, in memory of Alexei Zamolodchikov, at
the Poncelet Institute in Moscow, 21-24 June, 2008.
