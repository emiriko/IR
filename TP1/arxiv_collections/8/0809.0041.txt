We investigate the structural, electronic, and magnetic properties of the
hypothetical compound BaFePn2 (Pn = As and Sb), which is isostructural to the
parent compound of the high temperature superconductor LaFeAsO1-xFx. Using
density functional theory, we show that the Fermi surface, electronic structure
and the spin density wave instability of BaFePn2 are very similar to the Fe
based superconductors. Additionally, there are very dispersive metallic bands
of a spacer Pn layer, which are almost decoupled from FePn layer. Our results
show that experimental study of BaFePn2 can test the role of charge and
polarization fluctuation, importance of two dimensionality in mechanism of
superconductivity.
