We construct cohomology classes in the space of knots by considering a bundle
over this space and "integrating along the fiber" classes coming from the
cohomology of configuration spaces using a Pontrjagin-Thom construction. The
bundle we consider is essentially the one considered by Bott and Taubes, who
integrated differential forms along the fiber to get knot invariants. By doing
this "integration" homotopy-theoretically, we are able to produce integral
cohomology classes. We then show how this integration is compatible with the
homology operations on the space of long knots, as studied by Budney and Cohen.
In particular we derive a product formula for evaluations of cohomology classes
on homology classes, with respect to connect-sum of knots.
