The PHENIX experiment at RHIC has measured a variety of light neutral mesons
($\pi^{0}$, K$_{S}^{0}$, $\eta$, $\omega$, $\eta^{\prime}$, $\phi$) via
multi-particle decay channels over a wide range of transverse momentum. A
review of the recent results on the production rates of light mesons in p+p and
their nuclear modification factors in d+Au, Cu+Cu and Au+Au collisions at
different energies is presented.
