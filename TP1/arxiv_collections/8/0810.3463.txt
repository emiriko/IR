We present the constraints on the parameter space of the Lee-Wick Standard
Model coming from electroweak precision observables. The model predicts a large
positive S and a negative T. We show that it is possible to find some regions
in parameter space with a fermionic state as light as 2.4-3.5 TeV. We also
propose a simple extension of the model including a fourth generation. In this
case it is possible to pass the electroweak constraints with Lee-Wick fermionic
masses of order 0.4-1.5 TeV and Lee-Wick gauge masses of order 3 TeV.
