We study the problem of whether a coalgebra that generates its category of
left (right) comodules is left (right) quasi-coFrobenius or not. We prove it
does not hold in general, by giving a method of constructing counterexamples.
This gives a negative answer to a question stated in \cite{kn:coalgen}. We also
prove it is true for monomial pointed coalgebras and we characterize the
quivers $Q$ such that $\Bbbk Q$ admits a monomial subcoalgebra that is left
(right) quasi-coFrobenius.
