We study B->K(*)l+l- decays based on a large data sample of 657 million BB
pairs collected with the Belle detector at the KEKB e+e- collider. The
differential branching fraction, the isospin asymmetry, the K* polarization,
and the forward-backward asymmetry (A_FB) as functions of q^2 are reported. The
fitted A_FB spectrum tends to be shifted toward the positive side from the SM
expectation. The measured branching fractions and lepton flavor ratios
(electron/muon) are B(B->K*l+l-)=(10.8+1.1-1.0+-0.9)*10^-7,
B(B->Kl+l-)=(4.8+0.5-0.4+-0.3)*10^-7, R_K*=1.21+-0.25+-0.08, and
R_K=0.97+-0.18+-0.06, respectively.
