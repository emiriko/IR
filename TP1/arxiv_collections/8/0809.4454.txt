We study the dynamics of the transmission of the hanta virus infection among
mouse populations, taking into account, simultaneously, seasonal variations of
the environment and interactions within two classes in the mouse population:
adults and subadults. The interactions considered are not symmetric between the
two age-organized classes and are responsible for driving the younger members
away from home ranges. We consider the case of a bounded habitat affected by
seasonal variations.
