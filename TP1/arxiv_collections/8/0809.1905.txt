Single crystals FeSe_x have been grown in evacuated sealed quartz tube using
a NaCl/KCl flux. The products include two crystal structures of tetragon and
hexagon. The electronic transport and magnetic properties measurements of
FeSe_x single crystal exhibits a superconducting transition at about 10K.
