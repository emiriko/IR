We study three-dimensional Yang-Mills-Higgs theories with and without a
Chern-Simons interaction. We find that these theories admit a rich spectrum of
vortex solitons carrying both a topological charge and a global flavour charge.
We further derive a low-energy description of the vortex dynamics from a gauged
linear sigma model on the vortex worldline.
