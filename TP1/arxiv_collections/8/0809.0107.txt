A new wavefunction which improves the Gutzwiller-type local ansatz method has
been proposed to describe the correlated electron system. The ground-state
energy, double occupation number, momentum distribution function, and
quasiparticle weight have been calculated for the half-filled band Hubbard
model in infinite dimensions. It is shown that the new wavefunction improves
the local-ansatz approach (LA) proposed by Stollhoff and Fulde. Especially,
calculated momentum distribution functions show a reasonable momentum
dependence. The result qualitatively differs from those obtained by the LA and
the Gutzwiller wavefunction. Furthermore, the present approach combined with
the projection operator method CPA is shown to describe quantitatively the
excitation spectra in the insulator regime as well as the critical Coulomb
interactions for a gap formation in infinite dimensions.
