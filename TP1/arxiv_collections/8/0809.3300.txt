Recent data on $B$ meson mixings and decays are, in general, in accord with
the standard model expectations, except showing a few hiccups: (i) a large
phase in $B_s$ mixing, (ii) a significant difference ($> 3.5 \sigma$) between
CP-asymmetries in $B^\pm \to \pi^0 K^\pm$ and $B_d \to \pi^\mp K^\pm$ channels,
and (iii) a larger than expected branching ratio in $B_d \to \pi^0\pi^0$
channel. We show that selective baryon number violating Yukawa couplings in
R-parity violating supersymmetry can reconcile all the measurements.
