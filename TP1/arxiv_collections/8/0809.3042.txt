We present a generalized energy-depot model in which the conversion rate of
the internal energy into motion can be dependent on the position and the
velocity of a particle. When the conversion rate is a general function of the
velocity, the active particle exhibits diverse patterns of motion including a
braking mechanism and a stepping motion. The phase trajectories of the motion
are investigated in a systematic way. With a particular form of the conversion
rate dependent on the position and velocity, the particle shows a spontaneous
oscillation characterizing a negative stiffness. These types of active
behaviors are compared with the similar phenomena observed in biology such as
the stepping motion of molecular motors and the amplification in hearing
mechanism. Hence, our model can provide a generic understanding of the active
motion related to the energy conversion and also a new control mechanism for
nano-robots. We also investigate the noise effect, especially on the stepping
motion and observe the random walk-like behavior as expected.
