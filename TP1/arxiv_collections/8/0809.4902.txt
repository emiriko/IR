Mirror matter is considered as a candidate for dark matter. In connection
with this an experimental search for neutron - mirror neutron (nn') transitions
has been carried out using storage of ultracold neutrons in a trap with
different magnetic fields. As a result, a new limit for the neutron - mirror
neutron oscillation time has been obtained, tau_osc >= 448 s (90% C.L.),
assuming that there is no mirror magnetic field larger than 100 nT. Besides a
first attempt to obtain some restriction for mirror magnetic field has been
done.
