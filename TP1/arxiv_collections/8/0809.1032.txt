We devise a method for probing resonances of macroscopic matter waves in
shaken optical lattices by monitoring their response to slow parameter changes,
and show that such resonances can be disabled by particular choices of the
driving amplitude. The theoretical analysis of this scheme reveals far-reaching
analogies between dressed atoms and time-periodically forced matter waves.
