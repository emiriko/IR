We consider the dynamics of cargo driven by a collection of interacting
molecular motors in the context of an asymmetric simple exclusion processes
(ASEP). The model is formulated to account for i) excluded volume interactions,
ii) the observed asymmetry of the stochastic movement of individual motors and
iii) interactions between motors and cargo. Items (i) and (ii) form the basis
of ASEP models and have already been considered in the literature to study the
behavior of motor density profile [Parmeggiani 03]. Item (iii) is new. It is
introduced here as an attempt to describe explicitly the dependence of cargo
movement on the dynamics of motors. The steady-state solutions of the model
indicate that the system undergoes a phase transition of condensation type as
the motor density varies. We study the consequences of this transition to the
properties of cargo velocity.
