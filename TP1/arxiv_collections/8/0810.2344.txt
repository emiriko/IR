We apply the projection operator formalism to the problem of determining the
asymptotic behavior of the lattice BGK equation in the hydrodynamic limit. As
an alternative to the more usual Chapman-Enskog expansion, this approach offers
many benefits. Most remarkably, it produces absolutely exact, though
non-Markovian, hydrodynamic difference equations as an intermediate step. These
are accurate to all orders in Knudsen number and hence contain all of the
physics of the Burnett equations and beyond. If appropriate, these equations
may then be Taylor expanded to second order in Knudsen number to obtain the
usual hydrodynamic equations that result from the Chapman-Enskog analysis. The
method offers the potential to derive hydrodynamic difference equations for
complex fluids with sharp gradients, such as immiscible and amphiphilic flow,
for which the assumptions underlying the Chapman-Enskog approach are generally
invalid.
