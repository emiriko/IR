We solve numerically the equations of nonlinear fluctuating hydrodynamics
(NFH) for the supercooled liquid. The time correlation of the density
fluctuations in equilibrium obtained here shows quantitative agreement with
molecular dynamics(MD) simulation data. We demonstrate numerically that the
1/rho nonlinearity in the NFH equations of motion is essential in restoring the
ergodic behavior in the liquid. Under nonequilibrium conditions the time
correlation functions relax in a manner similar to that observed in the
molecular dynamics simulations in binary mixtures. The waiting time t_w
dependence of the non-equilibrium response function follows a Modified
Kohlrausch-Williams-Watts(MKWW) form similar to the behavior seen in dielectric
relaxation data.
