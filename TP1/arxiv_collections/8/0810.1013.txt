In this paper we consider a multi-dimensional damped semiliear wave equation
with dynamic boundary conditions, related to the Kelvin-Voigt damping. We
firstly prove the local existence by using the Faedo-Galerkin approximations
combined with a contraction mapping theorem. Secondly, the exponential growth
of the energy and the $L^p$ norm of the solution is presented.
