We investigate the competition between the extended $s_{\pm}$-wave and
$d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave pairing order parameters in the iron-based superconductors.
Because of the frustrating pairing interactions among the electron and the hole
fermi pockets, a time reversal symmetry breaking $s+id$ pairing state could be
favored. We analyze this pairing state within the Ginzburg-Landau theory, and
explore the experimental consequences. In such a state, spatial inhomogeneity
induces supercurrent near a non-magnetic impurity and the corners of a square
sample. The resonance mode between the $s_{\pm}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave order
parameters can be detected through the $B_{1g}$-Raman spectroscopy.
