Results on multi-lepton events at high transverse momenta, isolated lepton
events with large missing transverse energy and single W production reported to
this conference are based for the first time on the full data samples taken by
two colliding experiments, H1 and ZEUS, at HERA. The data correspond to an
integrated luminosity of about 1fb-1 from both experiments.
