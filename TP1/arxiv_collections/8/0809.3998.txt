Using recently derived relations between spin-dependent nuclear and nucleon
g_1 and g_2 structure functions at finite Q^2, we study nuclear effects in 3He
in the nucleon resonance and deep inelastic regions. Comparing the finite-Q^2
results with the standard convolution formulas obtained in the large-Q^2 limit,
we find significant broadening of the effective nucleon momentum distribution
functions, leading to additional suppression of the nuclear g_1 and g_2
structure functions around the resonance peaks.
