We develop a low-temperature expansion for the finite temperature dynamical
structure factor of the spin half Heisenberg chain with alternating nearest
neighbour exchange in the limit of strong alternation of the exchange
constants. We determine both the broadening of the low lying triplet lines and
the contribution of the thermally activated intraband scattering.
