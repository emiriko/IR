In this second part of the paper, dedicated to theories with extra
dimensions, a new physical notion about the "tensor length scale" is
introduced, based on the gravitational theories with covariant and
contravariant metric tensor components. Then the notion of "compactification"
in low energy type I string theory is supplemented by the operation of
"rescaling" of the contravariant metric components. For both the cases of
"rescaling + compactification" and "compactification + rescaling", quasilinear
differential equations in partial derivatives have been obtained and the
corresponding solutions have been found for the scale (length) function and for
the case of a flat 4D Minkowski space, embedded into a 5D space with an
exponential warp factor. A differential equation has been obtained and
investigated also from the equality of the "rescaled" scalar curvature with the
usual one.
