We show a new effect of the bow wave excitation by an intense short laser
pulse propagating in underdense plasma. Due to spreading of the laser pulse
energy in transverse direction, the bow wave causes a large-scale transverse
modulation of the electron density. This can significantly increase the
electric potential of the wake wave since the wake wave is generated in the
region much wider than the laser pulse waist.
