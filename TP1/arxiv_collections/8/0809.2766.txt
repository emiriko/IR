In this paper, a novel energy scavenger is proposed. The scavenger consists
of a cantilever beam on which piezoelectric films and a mass are mounted. The
mass at the tip of the beam is known as the proof mass and the device is called
either an energy scavenger or a beam-mass system. The beam-mass system is
mounted on a rotating shaft, where the axis of the shaft is horizontal. A
single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) mathematical model is derived for the scavenger
and its properties are carefully examined. From the model, it becomes clear
that the rotation of the shaft and gravity cause both parametric excitations
and exogenous forces which make the beam-mass system vibrate. Guidelines are
provided as how to choose the scavenger parameters in order to have it
resonate. Examples are given to illustrate the performance of the proposed
scavenger.
