We here investigate the model of interacting dark energy in the context of
five dimensional brane cosmology. The effective equations of state of dark
energy are evaluated for various choices of the variable time dependent
cosmological constant. We have found that the interacting dark energy obeys the
phantom divide/crossing scenario in this generalized model. It is also shown
that interacting dark energy in this generalized model also resolves the cosmic
coincidence problem.
