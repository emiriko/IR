We present a new measurement of the decay B- -> tau- nu_tau-bar with a
semileptonic B tagging method, using a data sample containing 657*10^6 BB-bar
pairs collected at the (4S) resonance with the Belle detector at the KEKB
asymmetric e+e- collider. A sample of BB pairs are tagged by reconstructing one
B meson decaying semileptonically. We detect the B- -> tau- nu_tau-bar
candidate in the recoil. We obtain a signal with a signicance of 3.8 standard
deviations including systematics, and measure the branching fraction to be B(B-
-> tau- nu_tau-bar)=(1.65+0.38-0.37(stat)+0.35-0.37(syst))*10^4. This result
confirms the evidence for B- -> tau- nu_tau-bartained in the previous Belle
measurement with a hadronic B tagging method.
