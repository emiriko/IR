We investigate the effect of a dynamical collective mode coupled with
quasiparticles at specific wavevectors only. This coupling describes the
incipient tendency to order and produces shadow spectral features at high
energies, while leaving essentially untouched the low energy quasiparticles.
This allows to interpret seemingly contradictory experiments on underdoped
cuprates, where many converging evidences indicate the presence of charge
(stripe or checkerboard) order, which remains instead elusive in the Fermi
surface obtained from angle-resolved photoemission experiments.
