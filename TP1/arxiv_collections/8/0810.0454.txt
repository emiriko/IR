We show that the dynamics of a doubly-excited 1D Heisenberg ferromagnetic
chain, subject to short pulses from a parabolic magnetic field may be analyzed
as a pair of quantum kicked rotors. By focusing on the two-magnon dynamics in
the kicked XXZ model we investigate how the anisotropy parameter - which
controls the strength of the magnon-magnon interaction - changes the nature of
the coupling between the two "image" coupled Kicked Rotors. We investigate
quantum state transfer possibilities and show that one may control whether the
spin excitations are transmitted together, or separate from each other.
