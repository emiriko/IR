We present the first measurement of reconstructed jets in ultra-relativistic
heavy ion collisions. Utilizing the large coverage of the STAR Time Projection
Chamber and Electromagnetic Calorimeter, we apply several modern jet
reconstruction algorithms and background subtraction techniques and explore
their systematic uncertainties in heavy ion events. The differential spectrum
for inclusive jet production in central Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt {s_{NN}}=
200$ GeV is presented. In order to assess the jet reconstruction biases, this
spectrum is compared with the jet cross section measured in $\sqrt{s}=200$ GeV
p+p collisions scaled by the number of binary N-N collisions to account for
nuclear geometric effects.
