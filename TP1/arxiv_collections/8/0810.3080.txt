We study the chiral logarithms in $\Delta S=1$ kaon decay amplitudes from new
flavor physics in beyond-standard-model theories. We systematically classify
the chiral structures of dimension-5, 6 and 7 effective QCD operators
constructed out of light-quark (up, down and strange) and gluon fields. Using
the standard chiral perturbation theory, we calculate the leading
chiral-logarithms associated with these operators. The result is useful for
lattice calculations of the QCD matrix elements in $K\to \pi\pi$ decay
necessary, for example, to understand the physical origin of the direct CP
violation parameter $\epsilon'$. As a concrete example, we consider the new
operators present in minimal left-right symmetric models.
