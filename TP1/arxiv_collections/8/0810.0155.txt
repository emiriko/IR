A liquid jet may develop different types of instabilities, like the so-called
Rayleigh-Plateau instability, which breaks the jet into droplets. However,
another type of instabilities may appear when we electrify a liquid jet and
induce some charge at his surface. Among them, the most common is the so-called
Whipping Instability, which is characterized by violent and fast lashes of the
jet. In the submitted fluid dynamic video(see
http://hdl.handle.net/1813/11422), we will show an unstable charged glycerine
jet in a dielectric liquid bath, which permits an enhanced visualization of the
instability. For this reason, it is probably the first time that these
phenomena are visualized with enough clarity to analyze features as the effect
of the feeding liquid flow rate through the jet or as the surprising
spontaneous stabilization at some critical distance to the ground electrode.
