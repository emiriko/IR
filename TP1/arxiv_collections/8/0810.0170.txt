A chain of interacting spin behaves like a quantum mediator (quantum link)
which allows two distant parties that control the ends of the chain to exchange
quantum messages. We show that over repeated uses without resetting the study
of a quantum link can be connected to correlated quantum channels with finite
dimensional environment (finite memory quantum channel). Then, using coding
arguments for such kind of channels and results on mixing channels we present a
protocol that allows us to achieve perfect information transmission through a
quantum link.
