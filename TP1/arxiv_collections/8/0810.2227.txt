This paper addresses the problem of efficiently storing and accessing massive
data blocks in a large-scale distributed environment, while providing efficient
fine-grain access to data subsets. This issue is crucial in the context of
applications in the field of databases, data mining and multimedia. We propose
a data sharing service based on distributed, RAM-based storage of data, while
leveraging a DHT-based, natively parallel metadata management scheme. As
opposed to the most commonly used grid storage infrastructures that provide
mechanisms for explicit data localization and transfer, we provide a
transparent access model, where data are accessed through global identifiers.
Our proposal has been validated through a prototype implementation whose
preliminary evaluation provides promising results.
