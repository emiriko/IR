Let S be a subset of {-1,0,1}^2 not containing (0,0). We address the
enumeration of plane lattice walks with steps in S, that start from (0,0) and
always remain in the first quadrant. A priori, there are 2^8 problems of this
type, but some are trivial. Some others are equivalent to a model of walks
confined to a half-plane: such models can be solved systematically using the
kernel method, which leads to algebraic generating functions. We focus on the
remaining cases, and show that there are 79 inherently different problems to
study. To each of them, we associate a group G of birational transformations.
We show that this group is finite in exactly 23 cases. We present a unified way
of solving 22 of the 23 models associated with a finite group. For each of
them, the generating function is found to be D-finite. The 23rd model, known as
Gessel's walks, has recently been proved by Bostan et al. to have an algebraic
(and hence D-finite) solution. We conjecture that the remaining 56 models,
associated with an infinite group, have a non-D-finite generating function. Our
approach allows us to recover and refine some known results, and also to obtain
new results. For instance, we prove that walks with N, E, W, S, SW and NE steps
have an algebraic generating function.
