We perform a systematic study of sneutrino production and decays in the
Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) with lepton flavour violation
(LFV). We study bosonic decays of sneutrinos as well as fermionic ones. We show
that the effect of slepton generation mixing on the sneutrino production and
decays can be quite large in a significant part of the MSSM parameter space
despite the very strong experimental limits on LFV processes. This could have
an important impact on the search for sneutrinos and the determination of the
MSSM parameters at LHC and future colliders, such as ILC, CLIC and muon
collider.
