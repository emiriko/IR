The theoretical aspects of spin-rotation coupling are presented. The approach
is based on the general covariance principle. It is shown that the
gyrogravitational ratio of the bare spin-1/2 and the spin-1 particles is equal
unity. That is why spin couples with rotation as an ordinary angular momentum.
This result is the rigorous substantiation of the cranking model. To observe
the phenomenon, the experiment with hydrogen-like ions in a storage ring is
suggested. It is found that the splitting of the $1 ^2!S_{1/2}, F=1/2$
hyperfine state of the $^{140}{\rm Pr}^{58+}$ and $^{142}{\rm Pm}^{60+}$ ions
circulating in the storage ring ESR in Darmstadt along a helical trajectory is
about 4.5 MHz. We argue that such splitting can be experimentally determined by
means of the ionic interferometry.
