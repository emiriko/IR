A search for the Higgs boson in H -> WW -> ll(l = e, mu) decays in ppbar
collisions at a center-of-mass energy of sqrt{s}=1.96 TeV is presented. The
data have been collected by the Run II DO detector between April 2002 and June
2008, corresponding to 3 fb^{-1} of integrated luminosity. In order to maximize
the sensitivity the multivariate technique of Artificial Neural Networks is
used. No excess above the Standard Model background is observed and limits on
the production cross section times branching ratio sigma x BR(H -> WW -> ll)
for m_H=115 - 200 GeV using a Higgs mass grid of 5 GeV have been set.
