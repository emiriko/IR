Any discrete approach to quantum gravity must provide some prescription as to
how to deduce continuum properties from the discrete substructure. In the
causal set approach it is straightforward to deduce timelike distances, but
surprisingly difficult to extract spacelike distances, because of the unique
combination of discreteness with local Lorentz invariance in that approach. We
propose a number of methods to overcome this difficulty, one of which
reproduces the spatial distance between two points in a finite region of
Minkowski space. We provide numerical evidence that this definition can be used
to define a `spatial nearest neighbor' relation on a causal set, and conjecture
that this can be exploited to define the length of `continuous curves' in
causal sets which are approximated by curved spacetime. This provides evidence
in support of the ``Hauptvermutung'' of causal sets.
