In this thesis we present new results relevant to two important problems in
quantum information science: the development of a theory of entanglement and
the exploration of the use of controlled quantum systems to the simulation of
quantum many-body phenomena.
  In the first part we introduce a new approach to the study of entanglement by
considering its manipulation under operations not capable of generating
entanglement and show there is a total order for multipartite quantum states in
this framework. We also present new results on hypothesis testing of correlated
sources and give further evidence on the existence of NPPT bound entanglement.
  In the second part, we study the potential as well as the limitations of a
quantum computer for calculating properties of many-body systems. First we
analyse the usefulness of quantum computation to calculate additive
approximations to partition functions and spectral densities of local
Hamiltonians. We then show that the determination of ground state energies of
local Hamiltonians with an inverse polynomial spectral gap is QCMA-hard.
  In the third and last part, we approach the problem of quantum simulating
many-body systems from a more pragmatic point of view. We analyze the
realization of paradigmatic condensed matter Hamiltonians in arrays of coupled
microcavities, such as the Bose-Hubbard and the anisotropic Heisenberg models,
and discuss the feasibility of an experimental realization with
state-of-the-art current technology.
