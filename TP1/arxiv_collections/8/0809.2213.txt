The Vaidya solution describes the gravitational collapse of a finite shell of
incoherent radiation falling into flat spacetime and giving rise to a
Schwarzschild black hole. There has been a question whether closed trapped
surfaces can extend into the flat region (whereas closed outer trapped surfaces
certainly can). For the special case of self-similar collapse we show that the
answer is yes, if and only if the mass function rises fast enough.
