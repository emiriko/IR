We investigate the mechanical unfolding of the tenth type III domain from
fibronectin, FnIII10, both at constant force and at constant pulling velocity,
by all-atom Monte Carlo simulations. We observe both apparent two-state
unfolding and several unfolding pathways involving one of three major, mutually
exclusive intermediate states. All the three major intermediates lack two of
seven native beta-strands, and share a quite similar extension. The unfolding
behavior is found to depend strongly on the pulling conditions. In particular,
we observe large variations in the relative frequencies of occurrence for the
intermediates. At low constant force or low constant velocity, all the three
major intermediates occur with a significant frequency. At high constant force
or high constant velocity, one of them, with the N- and C-terminal beta-strands
detached, dominates over the other two. Using the extended Jarzynski equality,
we also estimate the equilibrium free-energy landscape, calculated as a
function of chain extension. The application of a constant pulling force leads
to a free-energy profile with three major local minima. Two of these correspond
to the native and fully unfolded states, respectively, whereas the third one
can be associated with the major unfolding intermediates.
