The study of displaced vertices containing two b--jets may provide a double
discovery at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC): we show how it may not only
reveal evidence for supersymmetry, but also provide a way to uncover the Higgs
boson necessary in the formulation of the electroweak theory in a large region
of the parameter space. We quantify this explicitly using the simplest minimal
supergravity model with bilinear breaking of R-parity, which accounts for the
observed pattern of neutrino masses and mixings seen in neutrino oscillation
experiments.
