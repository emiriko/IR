Existing transport protocols, be it TCP, SCTP or DCCP, do not provide an
efficient congestion control mechanism for heterogeneous wired-cum-wireless
networks. Solutions involving implicit loss discrimination schemes have been
proposed but were never implemented. Appropriate mechanisms can dramatically
improve bandwidth usage over the Internet, especially for multimedia transport
based on partial reliability. In this paper we have implemented and evaluated a
congestion control mechanism that implicitly discriminates congestion and
wireless losses in the datagram congestion control protocol (DCCP) congestion
control identification (CCID) framework. The new CCID was implemented as a NS-2
module. Comparisons were made with the TCP-like CCID and showed that the
bandwidth utilization was improved by more than 30% and up to 50% in
significant setups.
