Nuclear reactors have served as the antineutrino source for many fundamental
physics experiments. The techniques developed by these experiments make it
possible to use these very weakly interacting particles for a practical
purpose. The large flux of antineutrinos that leaves a reactor carries
information about two quantities of interest for safeguards: the reactor power
and fissile inventory. Measurements made with antineutrino detectors could
therefore offer an alternative means for verifying the power history and
fissile inventory of a reactors, as part of International Atomic Energy Agency
(IAEA) and other reactor safeguards regimes. Several efforts to develop this
monitoring technique are underway across the globe.
