This is a review. Comments are welcome.
  The observation that the structure of string theory is rich enough to include
the standard model in rough outline is an old one, starting with the early
constructions of free field constructions, orbifold theories, and in particular
Calabi-Yau compactifications in the late 1980s and early 1990s. At the time
these constructions provided a large collection of different vacua, with
thousands of explicitly constructed Calabi-Yau manifolds, and estimates of vast
numbers of bosonic models, each one associated with its own moduli space. It
was clear even then that it would be impossible to systematically search this
string vacua landscape. This, however, is not a fundamental problem. Adopting
the point of view that any physical theory has to describe not only our
universe, but all possible consistent universes, leads to the obvious strategy
of using some phenomenological input to select viable models among the ocean of
models that obviously do not describe physics as we know it.
