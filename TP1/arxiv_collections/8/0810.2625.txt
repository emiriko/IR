Precise control of surface properties including electrical characteristics,
wettability, and friction is a prerequisite for manufacturing modern organic
electronic devices. The successful combination of bottom up approaches for
aligning and orienting the molecules and top down techniques to structure the
substrate on the nano and micrometer scale allows the cost efficient
fabrication and integration of future organic light emitting diodes and organic
thin film transistors. One possibility for the top down patterning of a surface
is to utilize different surface free energies or wetting properties of a
functional group. Here, we used friction force microscopy (FFM) to reveal
chemical patterns inscribed by a photolithographic process into a
photosensitive surface layer. FFM allowed the simultaneous visualization of at
least three different chemical surface terminations. The underlying mechanism
is related to changes in the chemical interaction between probe and film
surface.
