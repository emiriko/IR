We present evidence for hole injection into LaAlO3/LaVO3/LaAlO3 quantum wells
near a polar surface of LaAlO3 (001). As the surface is brought in proximity to
the LaVO3 layer, an exponential drop in resistance and a decreasing positive
Seebeck coefficient is observed below a characteristic coupling length of 10-15
unit cells. We attribute this behavior to a crossover from an atomic
reconstruction of the AlO2-terminated LaAlO3 surface to an electronic
reconstruction of the vanadium valence. These results suggest a general
approach to tunable hole-doping in oxide thin film heterostructures.
