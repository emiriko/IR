Let $\cD$ be the Dirichlet space, namely the space of holomorphic functions
on the unit disk whose derivative is square-integrable. We establish a new
sufficient condition for a function $f\in\cD$ to be {\em cyclic}, i.e. for
$\{pf: p\text{a polynomial}\}$ to be dense in $\cD$. This allows us to prove a
special case of the conjecture of Brown and Shields that a function is cyclic
in $\cD$ iff it is outer and its zero set (defined appropriately) is of
capacity zero.
