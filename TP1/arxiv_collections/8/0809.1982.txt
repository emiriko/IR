The impact of a kination-dominated phase generated by a quintessential
exponential model on the thermal abundance of Supersymmetric (SUSY) extremely
Weekly Interacting Massive Particles (e-WIMPs) is investigated. For values of
the quintessential energy-density parameter on the eve of nucleosynthesis close
to its upper bound, we find that: (i) the gravitino constraint is totally
evaded for unstable gravitinos; (ii) the thermal abundance of stable gravitinos
is not sufficient to account for the cold dark matter of the universe; (iii)
the thermal abundance of axinos can satisfy the cold dark matter constraint for
values of the initial (``reheating'') temperature well above those required in
the standard cosmology.
