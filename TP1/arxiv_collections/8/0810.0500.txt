Jets can be used to probe the physical properties of the high energy density
matter created in collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC).
Measurements of strong suppression of inclusive hadron distributions and
di-hadron correlations at high $p_{T}$ have already provided evidence for
partonic energy loss. However, these measurements suffer from well-known
geometric biases due to the competition of energy loss and fragmentation. These
biases can be avoided if the jets are reconstructed independently of their
fragmentation details - quenched or unquenched. In this paper, we discuss
modern jet reconstruction algorithms (cone and sequential recombination) and
their corresponding background subtraction techniques required by the high
multiplicities of heavy ion collisions. We review recent results from the STAR
experiment at RHIC on direct jet reconstruction in central Au+Au collisions at
$\sqrt {s_{NN}}= 200$ GeV.
