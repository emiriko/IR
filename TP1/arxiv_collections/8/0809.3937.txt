The goal of this paper is to develop a coherent theory for inhomogeneous
Diophantine approximation on curves in $R^n$ akin to the well established
homogeneous theory. More specifically, the measure theoretic results obtained
generalize the fundamental homogeneous theorems of R.C. Baker (1978), Dodson,
Dickinson (2000) and Beresnevich, Bernik, Kleinbock, Margulis (2002). In the
case of planar curves, the complete Hausdorff dimension theory is developed
