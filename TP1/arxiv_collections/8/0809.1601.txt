We consider construction of some Lagrangians which contain the Riemann zeta
function. The starting point in their construction is p-adic string theory.
These Lagrangians describe some nonlocal and nonpolynomial scalar field models,
where nonlocality is controlled by the operator valued Riemann zeta function.
The main motivation for this research is intention to find an effective
Lagrangian for adelic scalar strings.
