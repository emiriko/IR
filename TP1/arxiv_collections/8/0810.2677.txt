Double-lepton polarization asymmetries for the exclusive decay B->K_1 l^+ l^-
in the Universal Extra Dimension (UED) Model is studied. It is obtained that
double-lepton polarization asymmetries are very sensitive to the UED model
parameters. Experimental measurements of double lepton polarizations can give
valuable information on the physics beyond the Standard Model (SM).
