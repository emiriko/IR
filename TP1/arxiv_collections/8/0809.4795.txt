Muon ionization cooling is the only practical method for preparing
high-brilliance beams needed for a neutrino factory or muon collider. The muon
ionization cooling experiment (MICE) under development at the Rutherford
Appleton Laboratory comprises a dedicated beamline to generate a range of input
emittance and momentum, with time-of-flight and Cherenkov detectors to ensure a
pure muon beam. A first measurement of emittance is performed in the upstream
magnetic spectrometer with a scintillating-fiber tracker. A cooling cell will
then follow, alternating energy loss in liquid hydrogen with RF acceleration. A
second spectrometer identical to the first and a particle identification system
will measure the outgoing emittance. Plans for measurements of emittance and
cooling are described.
