We explore Jaeger's state model for the HOMFLYPT polynomial. We reformulate
this model in the language of Gauss diagrams and use it to obtain Gauss diagram
formulas for a two-parameter family of Vassiliev invariants coming from the
HOMFLYPT polynomial. These formulas are new already for invariants of degree 3.
