The effect of an external noise on the Lorenz model is investigated near the
onset of convection and near the Hopf bifurcation. We show the existence of a
diverging time scale near the onset of convection and a resonance near the Hopf
bifurcation. Our calculation provides an understanding of the noise induced
stabilization of the limit cycle that had been observed numerically.
