We introduce a method to construct conservation laws for a large class of
linear partial differential equations. In contrast to the classical result of
Noether, the conserved currents are generated by any symmetry of the operator,
including those of the non-Lie type. An explicit example is made of the Dirac
equation were we use our construction to find a class of conservation laws
associated with a 64 dimensional Lie algebra of discrete symmetries that
includes CPT.
