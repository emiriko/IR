We investigate Anderson localization in a three dimensional (3d) kicked
rotor. By a finite size scaling analysis we have identified a mobility edge for
a certain value of the kicking strength $k = k_c$. For $k > k_c$ dynamical
localization does not occur, all eigenstates are delocalized and the spectral
correlations are well described by Wigner-Dyson statistics. This can be
understood by mapping the kicked rotor problem onto a 3d Anderson model (AM)
where a band of metallic states exists for sufficiently weak disorder. Around
the critical region $k \approx k_c$ we have carried out a detailed study of the
level statistics and quantum diffusion. In agreement with the predictions of
the one parameter scaling theory (OPT) and with previous numerical simulations
of a 3d AM at the transition, the number variance is linear, level repulsion is
still observed and quantum diffusion is anomalous with $<p^2 > \propto
t^{2/3}$. We note that in the 3d kicked rotor the dynamics is not random but
deterministic. In order to estimate the differences between these two
situations we have studied a 3d kicked rotor in which the kinetic term of the
associated evolution matrix is random. A detailed numerical comparison shows
that the differences between the two cases are relatively small. However in the
deterministic case only a small set of irrational periods was used. A
qualitative analysis of a much larger set suggests that the deviations between
the random and the deterministic kicked rotor can be important for certain
choices of periods. Contrary to intuition correlations in the deterministic
case can either suppress or enhance Anderson localization effects.
