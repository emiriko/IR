The antiferromagnet CaFe$_2$As$_2$ does not become superconducting when
subject to ideal hydrostatic pressure conditions, where crystallographic and
magnetic states also are well defined. By measuring electrical resistivity and
magnetic susceptibility under quasi-hydrostatic pressure, however, we find that
a substantial volume fraction of the sample is superconducting in a narrow
pressure range where collapsed tetragonal and orthorhombic structures coexist.
At higher pressures, the collapsed tetragonal structure is stabilized, with the
boundary between this structure and the phase of coexisting structures strongly
dependent on pressure history. Fluctuations in magnetic degrees of freedom in
the phase of coexisting structures appear to be important for
superconductivity.
