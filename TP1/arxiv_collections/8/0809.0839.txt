In this poster, we present a model of large extra dimensions where the
internal space has the geometry of a hyperbolic disc. Compared with the ADD
model, this model provides a more satisfactory solution to the hierarchy
problem between the electroweak scale and the Planck scale, and it also avoids
constraints from astrophysics. Since there is no known analytic form of the
Kaluza-Klein spectrum for our choice of geometry, we obtain a spectrum based on
a combination of approximations and numerical computations. We study the
possible signatures of our model for hadron colliders, especially the LHC,
where the most important processes are the production of a graviton together
with a hadronic jet or a photon. We find that for the case of hadronic jet
production, it is possible to obtain relatively strong signals, while for the
case of photon production, this is much more difficult.
