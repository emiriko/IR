In this paper, using similar symbolical method of Burchnall and Chaundy
formulas of expansion for the generalized hypergeometric function were
constructed. By means of the found formulas of expansion the formulas of an
analytic continuation for hypergeometric function of Clausen is defined. The
obtained formulas of an analytic continuation express known hypergeometric
Appell function $ F_2 ({a;b_1, b_2 ;c_1, c_2 ;x,y}) $ which theory is well
studied.
