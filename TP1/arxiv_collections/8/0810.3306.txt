Given a compact Riemannian manifold $M$, we consider a warped product $\bar M
= I \times_h M$ where $I$ is an open interval in $\Rr$. We suppose that the
mean curvature of the fibers do not change sign. Given a positive
differentiable function $\psi$ in $\bar M$, we find a closed hypersurface
$\Sigma$ which is solution of an equation of the form $F(B)=\psi$, where $B$ is
the second fundamental form of $\Sigma$ and $F$ is a function satisfying
certain structural properties. As examples, we may exhibit examples of
hypersurfaces with prescribed higher order mean curvature.
