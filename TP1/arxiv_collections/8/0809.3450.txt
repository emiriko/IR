We study the effect of the QCD critical point on non-Gaussian moments
(cumulants) of fluctuations of experimental observables in heavy-ion
collisions. We find that these moments are very sensitive to the proximity of
the critical point, as measured by the magnitude of the correlation length xi.
For example, the cubic central moment of multiplicity ~ xi^4.5 and the quartic
cumulant ~ xi^7. We estimate the magnitude of critical point contributions to
non-Gaussian fluctuations of pion and proton multiplicities.
