The observation of neutrino oscillations has proven that neutrinos have mass.
This is direct evidence of physics beyond the Standard Model. This discovery
has renewed interest in neutrinoless double beta decay ($0\nu\beta\beta$)
experiments which provide the only practical way to determine whether neutrinos
are Majorana or Dirac particles. Such experiments also have the potential to
determine the absolute scale of the neutrino mass and help resolve the neutrino
mass hierarchy question. The NEMO-3 (Neutrino Ettore Majorana Observatory) is
currently one of the most sensitive searches for neutrinoless double beta
decay. The main goal of SuperNEMO is to extend the sensitivity of the NEMO-3
search for neutrinoless double beta decay (and to measure two-neutrino double
beta $2\nu\beta\beta$ decay). The two isotopes under consideration for
SuperNEMO are $^{82}$Se and $^{150}$Nd. The target sensitivity is a
$0\nu\beta\beta$ decay half-life at the level of $10^{26}$ years which will
explore the degenerate neutrino mass hierarchy down to 50 meV.
