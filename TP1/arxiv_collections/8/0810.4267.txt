We consider an extension of the Standard Model by a singlet scalar that
accounts for the dark matter of the Universe. Within this model we compute the
expected gamma ray flux from the annihilation of dark matter particles in a
consistent way. To do so, an updated analysis of the parameter space of the
model is first presented. By enforcing the relic density constraint from the
very beginning, the viable parameter space gets reduced to just two variables:
the singlet mass and the higgs mass. Current direct detection constraints are
then found to require a singlet mass larger than 50 GeV. Finally, we compute
the gamma ray flux and annihilation cross section and show that a large
fraction of the viable parameter space lies within the sensitivity of
Fermi-GLAST.
