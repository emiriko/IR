In this paper, we study the control system associated with the incompressible
3D Euler system. We show that the velocity field and pressure of the fluid are
exactly controllable in projections by the same finite-dimensional control.
Moreover, the velocity is approximately controllable. We also prove that 3D
Euler system is not exactly controllable by a finite-dimensional external
force.
