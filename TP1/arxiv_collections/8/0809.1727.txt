We report time-resolved photoluminescence spectra of point defects in
amorphous silicon dioxide (silica), in particular the decay kinetics of the
emission signals of extrinsic Oxygen Deficient Centres of the second type from
singlet and directly-excited triplet states are measured and used as a probe of
structural inhomogeneity. Luminescence activity in sapphire
($\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$) is studied as well and used as a model system to compare
the optical properties of defects in silica with those of defects embedded in a
crystalline matrix. Only for defects in silica, we observe a variation of the
decay lifetimes with emission energy and a time dependence of the first moment
of the emission bands. These features are analyzed within a theoretical model
with explicit hypothesis about the effect introduced by the disorder of
vitreous systems. Separate estimations of the homogenous and inhomogeneous
contributions to the measured emission linewidth are obtained: it is found that
inhomogeneous effects strongly condition both the triplet and singlet
luminescence activities of oxygen deficient centres in silica, although the
degree of inhomogeneity of the triplet emission turns out to be lower than that
of the singlet emission. Inhomogeneous effects appear to be negligible in
sapphire.
