We consider a novel version of the classical Jacquet-Langlands
{correspondence}, explore a $p$-adic extension of the Jacquet-Langlands
correspondence, and as an explicit example we find an overconvergent
automorphic form of weight~1 which corresponds to a classical modular form of
weight~1, using both experimental and theoretical methods.
