We present recent STAR results on photoproduction in ultra-peripheral
relativistic heavy ion collisions. In these collisions the impact parameter of
the beam particles is larger than the sum of their nuclear radii, so that they
interact via their long-range Coulomb fields. STAR has measured the production
of $\rho^0(770)$ mesons in exclusive reactions as well as in processes with
mutual nuclear excitation of the beam particles. We present results for the
$\rho^0$ production cross section in Au-Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$
GeV for coherent as well as incoherent coupling. The dependence of the cross
section on the $\rho^0$ rapidity is compared to theoretical models. We also
studied the ratio of coherent $\rho^0$ to direct $\pi^+\pi^-$ production as
well as the $\rho^0$ helicity matrix elements and we observe interference
effects in the $\rho^0$ production. In addition STAR has measured the
production of $\rho^0$ mesons in d-Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV and
that of $e^+e^-$-pairs in Au-Au at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV. We also see an
enhancement around 1510 MeV/c in $\pi^+\pi^-\pi^+\pi^-$ final states in Au-Au
collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV.
