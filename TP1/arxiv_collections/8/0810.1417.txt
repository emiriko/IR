We propose a quantum algorithm for the purification of a generic mixed state
$\rho$ of a $n$-qudit system by using an ancillary $n$-qudit system. The
algorithm is optimal in that (i) the number of ancillary qudits cannot be
reduced, (ii) the number of parameters which determine the purification state
$|\Psi>$ exactly equals the number of degrees of freedom of $\rho$, and (iii)
$|\Psi>$ is easily determined from the density matrix $\rho$. Moreover, we
introduce a quantum circuit in which the quantum gates are unitary
transformations acting on a $2n$-qudit system. These transformations are
determined by parameters that can be tuned to generate, once the ancillary
qudits are disregarded, any given mixed $n$-qudit state.
