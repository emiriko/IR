We investigate the rapidity and transverse momentum distributions of the
prompt photon production at the CERN LHC energies considering the current
perturbative QCD approaches for this scattering process. Namely, we compare the
predictions from the usual NLO pQCD calculations to the the color dipole
formalism, using distinct dipole cross sections. Special attention is paid to
parton saturation models at high energies, which are expected to be important
at the forward rapidities in pp collisions at the LHC.
