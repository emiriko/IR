The influence of the orientation angles of the target nucleus symmetry axis
relative to the beam direction on the production of the evaporation residues is
investigated for the $^{48}$Ca+$^{154}$Sm reaction as a function of the beam
energy. At low energies ($E_{\rm c.m.}<$137 MeV), the yield of evaporation
residues is observed only for collisions with small orientation angles
($\alpha_T<45^0$).
  At large energies (about $E_{\rm c.m.}=$140--180 MeV) all the orientation
angles $\alpha_T$ can contribute to the evaporation residue cross section
$\sigma_{ER}$ in the 10--100 mb range, and at $E_{c.m.}>$180 MeV $\sigma_{ER}$
ranges around 0.1--10 mb because the fission barrier for a compound nucleus
decreases by increasing its excitation energy and angular momentum.
