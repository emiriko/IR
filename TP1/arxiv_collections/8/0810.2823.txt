Inelastic neutron measurements of the high-temperature lattice excitations in
NaI show that in thermal equilibrium at 555 K an intrinsic mode, localized in
three dimensions, occurs at a single frequency near the center of the spectral
phonon gap, polarized along [111]. At higher temperatures the intrinsic
localized mode gains intensity. Higher energy inelastic neutron and x-ray
scattering measurements on a room-temperature NaI crystal indicate that the
creation energy of the ground state of the intrinsic localized mode is 299 meV.
