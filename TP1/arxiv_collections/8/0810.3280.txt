Sequence comparison and alignment has had an enormous impact on our
understanding of evolution, biology, and disease. Comparison and alignment of
biological networks will likely have a similar impact. Existing network
alignments use information external to the networks, such as sequence, because
no good algorithm for purely topological alignment has yet been devised. In
this paper, we present a novel algorithm based solely on network topology, that
can be used to align any two networks. We apply it to biological networks to
produce by far the most complete topological alignments of biological networks
to date. We demonstrate that both species phylogeny and detailed biological
function of individual proteins can be extracted from our alignments.
Topology-based alignments have the potential to provide a completely new,
independent source of phylogenetic information. Our alignment of the
protein-protein interaction networks of two very different species--yeast and
human--indicate that even distant species share a surprising amount of network
topology with each other, suggesting broad similarities in internal cellular
wiring across all life on Earth.
