We currently perform calculations with an improved staggered fermion action
(p4fat3). We use a strange quark mass that has been tuned to its physical value
and light quarks of mass m_s/20 on lattices of size 32^3x8. This corresponds to
an almost physical light quark mass. We present first results on the low
temperature part of the equation of state of QCD. Through comparison with the
preliminary hotQCD results on the N_tau=8 equation of state, which have been
obtained with twice heavier light quark masses, we can quantify the quark mass
dependence of the equation of state in the low temperature regime. We also
comment on the quark mass dependence of the equation of state at high
temperature.
