Unstable 10C nuclei are produced as quasi-projectiles in 12C+24Mg collisions
at E/A = 53 and 95 MeV. The decay of their short-lived states is studied with
the INDRA multidetector array via multi-particle correlation functions. The
obtained results show that heavy-ion collisions can be used as a tool to access
spectroscopic information of unbound states in exotic nuclei, such as their
energies and the relative importance of different sequential decay widths.
