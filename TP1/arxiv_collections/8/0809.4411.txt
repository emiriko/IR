The vector meson $\omega$-$\phi$ mixing is studied in two alternative
scenarios with different numbers of mixing angles, i.e., the one-mixing-angle
scenario and the two-mixing-angle scenario, in both the octect-singlet mixing
scheme and the quark flavor mixing scheme. Concerning the reproduction of
experimental data and the $Q^2$ behavior of transition form factors,
one-mixing-angle scenario in the quark flavor scheme performs better than that
in the octet-singlet scheme, while the two-mixing-angle scenario works well for
both mixing schemes. The difference between the two mixing angles in the
octet-singlet scheme is bigger than that in the quark flavor scheme.
