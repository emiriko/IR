Three experiments, among the LHC project, are getting ready to explore the b
quark flavour sector. While ATLAS and CMS are general purpose experiments,
where the study of B mesons is going to proceed in parallel with the Higgs
boson and supersymmetry searches, the LHCb experiment is devoted to B physics
studies. The key parameters entering the physics analyses and the performances
achieved in all the three experiments are presented. Given the large B physics
program foreseen in the LHC experiments, the studies reported in this paper
have been selected as those with higher likelihood to provide solid and
interesting new results on Standard Model validation and New Physics processes
search with early data.
