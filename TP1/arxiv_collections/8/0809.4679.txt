In this paper, we develop a multistage approach for estimating the mean of a
bounded variable. We first focus on the multistage estimation of a binomial
parameter and then generalize the estimation methods to the case of general
bounded random variables. A fundamental connection between a binomial parameter
and the mean of a bounded variable is established. Our multistage estimation
methods rigorously guarantee prescribed levels of precision and confidence.
