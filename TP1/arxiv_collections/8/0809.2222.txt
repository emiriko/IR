Photonic or electronic confinement effects in nanostructures become
significant when one of their dimension is in the 5-300 nm range. Improving
their development requires the ability to study their structure - shape, strain
field, interdiffusion maps - using novel techniques. We have used coherent
diffraction imaging to record the 3-dimensionnal scattered intensity of single
silicon nanowires with a lateral size smaller than 100 nm. We show that this
intensity can be used to recover the hexagonal shape of the nanowire with a
28nm resolution. The article also discusses limits of the method in terms of
radiation damage.
