The implementation of the Type III seesaw mechanism for neutrino masses in
the context of left-right theories where parity is broken spontaneously is
investigated. We propose a simple left-right symmetric theory where the
neutrinos masses are generated through a double seesaw mechanism which is a
combination of Type I and Type III seesaw. In this context we find a possible
candidate for the cold dark matter in the Universe and discuss the Baryogenesis
via Leptogenesis mechanisms. The spectrum of the theory, the phenomenological
constraints and the possibility to test the theory at the Large Hadron Collider
are investigated.
