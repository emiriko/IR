Speckle structure of parametric down conversion light has recently received a
large attention due to relevance in view of applications to quantum imaging
  The possibility of tailoring the speckle size by acting on the pump
properties is an interesting tool for the applications to quantum imaging and
in particular to the detection of weak object under shot-noise limit.
  Here we present a systematic detailed experimental study of the speckle
structure produced in type II PDC with particular attention to its variation
with pump beam properties.
