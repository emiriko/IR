The synchronization transition of correlated ensembles of coupled Kuramoto
oscillators on sparse random networks is investigated. Extensive numerical
simulations show that correlations between the native frequencies of adjacent
oscillators on the network systematically shift the critical point as well as
the critical exponents characterizing the transition. Negative correlations
imply an onset of synchronization for smaller coupling, whereas positive
correlations shift the critical coupling towards larger interaction strengths.
For negatively correlated oscillators the transition still exhibits critical
behaviour similar to the all-to-all coupled Kuramoto system, while positive
correlations change the universality class of the transition depending on the
correlation strength. Crucially, the paper demonstrates that the
synchronization behaviour is not only determined by the coupling architecture,
but is also strongly influenced by the oscillator placement on the coupling
network.
