General Very Special Relativity (GVSR) is the curved space-time of Very
Special Relativity (VSR) proposed by Cohen and Glashow. The geometry of GVSR
possesses a line element of Finsler Geometry proposed by Bogoslovsky. We
calculate the Einstein field equations and derive a modified FRW cosmology, for
an osculating Riemannian space. The Friedman equation of motion leads to an
explanation of the cosmological acceleration in terms of an alternative
non-Lorentz invariant theory. A first order approach for a primordial spurionic
vector field introduced into the metric, gives back an estimation of the energy
evolution and inflation
