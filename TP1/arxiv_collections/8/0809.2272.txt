We dedicate this article to our father, Prof. Dr. Guenter Vojta, on the
occasion of his 80th birthday. While colleagues appreciate him as an excellent
scientist with widespread interests and an amazingly broad knowledge, we see in
him the father, teacher, friend, and much more. Thanks to him, we grew up
immersed in the fascinating world of physics from an early age. His example and
encouragement have crucially influenced our own lives.
