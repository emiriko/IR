We discuss the noncommutative generalizations of polynomial algebras which
after appropriate completions can be used as coordinate algebras in various
noncommutative settings, (noncommutative differential geometry, noncommutative
algebraic geometry, etc.). These algebras have finite presentations and are
completely characterized and classified by their (noncommutative) volume forms.
