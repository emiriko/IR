We study the behavior of charge carriers in graphene in inhomogeneous
perpendicular magnetic fields. We consider two types of one-dimensional
magnetic profiles, uniform in one direction: a sequence of N magnetic barriers,
and a sequence of alternating magnetic barriers and wells. In both cases, we
compute the transmission coefficient of the magnetic structure by means of the
transfer matrix formalism, and the associated conductance. In the first case
the structure becomes increasingly transparent upon increasing N at fixed total
magnetic flux. In the second case we find strong wave-vector filtering and
resonant effects. We also calculate the band structure of a periodic magnetic
superlattice, and find a wave-vector-dependent gap around zero-energy.
