We compute the spectrum of excited nucleons using the anisotropic Wilson
lattice with two flavors of dynamical fermions. Using optimized sets of
operators which transform irreducibly under the octahedral group, matrices of
correlation functions are computed. We apply the variational method to these
matrices to extract excited energy eigenstates. We obtain several states for
each irrep and identify the continuum spin for the lowest-lying states,
including a $J^P={5/2}^-$ state.
