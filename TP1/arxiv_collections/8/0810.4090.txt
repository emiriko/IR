We introduce a new method to estimate BaroReflex Sensitivity (BRS) . The
methodology, based on the CZF formulation, recently published (see Conte et al
2008), enables to evaluate simultaneous variability of RR and SBP and to
estimate the coupling strength. The technique is applied to subjects (female
and men with age ranging from 21 to 28 years old) and it is compared with the
results that may be obtained by using the standard Fourier spectral analysis
technique. The comparison is also performed by using the technique of
Lomb-Scargle periodogram, based on Fourier analysis.
