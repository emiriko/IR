We identify a generic new form of collective flavor oscillations in dense
neutrino gases that amounts to a self-induced parametric resonance. It occurs
in a homogeneous and isotropic ensemble when a range of neutrino modes is
prepared in a different flavor than the neighboring modes with lower and higher
energies. The flavor content of the intermediate spectral part librates
relative to the other parts with a frequency corresponding to a typical Delta
m^2/2E. This libration persists in the limit of an arbitrarily large neutrino
density where one would have expected synchronized flavor oscillations.
