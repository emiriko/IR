Precise knowledge of the cross sections for neutrino interactions with nuclei
is important not only for existing experiments but also for development of
future detectors. When momentum transferred to the nucleus by the probe is high
enough, the impulse approximation is valid, i.e. the nucleus can be described
as composed of independent nucleons and the interaction happens between
neutrino and a single bound nucleon. The cross section of the nucleus is then
expressed as an integral of the free cross section (modified by the off-shell
effect) folded with the so-called spectral function, describing the
distribution of nucleon momenta and energies.
  I present results obtained for the approximate spectral functions of argon
and calcium. The accuracy of the approach is verified by comparison with a
broad spectrum of precise electron-scattering data for the calcium target. Some
of these data lie in the kinematical region corresponding to neutrino
interactions what indirectly shows that a similar level of accuracy is achieved
for neutrinos. The calculated Ar(nu_mu,mu) cross section is significantly lower
than the one predicted within the Fermi gas model.
