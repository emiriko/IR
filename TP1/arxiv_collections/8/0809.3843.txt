To investigate the x-ray absorption (XAS) branching ratio from the core 4d to
valence 5f states, we set up a theoretical framework by using a combination of
density functional theory in the local density approximation and Dynamical Mean
Field Theory (LDA+DMFT), and apply it to several actinides. The results of the
LDA+DMFT reduces to the band limit for itinerant systems and to the atomic
limit for localized f electrons, meaning a spectrum of 5f itinerancy can be
investigated. Our results provides a consistent and unified view of the XAS
branching ratio for all elemental actinides, and is in good overall agreement
with experiments.
