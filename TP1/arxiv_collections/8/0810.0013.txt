The energy interval between the ground and the P-wave excited states of the
recently discovered positronium molecule Ps_2 is evaluated, including the
relativistic and the leading logarithmic radiative corrections, E_P-E_S = 0.181
586 7(8) a.u. The P-state, decaying usually via annihilation, is found to decay
into the ground state by an electric dipole transition 19 percent of the time.
Anticipated observation of this transition will provide insight into this
exotic system.
