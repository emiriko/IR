Conformally gauge-fixed Polyakov D1 brane action is seen to be a constrained
sys tem in the sense of Dirac when it is considered on the light-front in
contrast t o the case when it is consdired in the instant-form. The model is
quantized usin g the standard constraint quantization techniques on the
light-front.
