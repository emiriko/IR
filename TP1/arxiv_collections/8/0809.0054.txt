We propose an elegant scheme towards phase locking of two independent
degenerate coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) processes. The optical
implementation involves a modified Mach-Zehnder interferometer that is utilized
to transfer phase coherence from three totally uncorrelated laser beams into
two degenerate CARS beams which are independently produced in two distinct
Raman active samples. Such a phase-transport interferometer allows for explicit
measurement and control of phase differences between the two phase-locked
degenerate CARS processes, hence may lead to applications in other pertinent
research fields.
