The Cartan control problem of the quantum circuits discussed from the
differential geometry point of view. Abstract unitary transformations of
$SU(2^n)$ are realized physically in the projective Hilbert state space
$CP(2^n-1)$ of the n-qubit system. Therefore the Cartan decomposition of the
algebra $AlgSU(2^n-1)$ into orthogonal subspaces $h$ and $b$ such that $[h,h]
\subseteq h, [b,b] \subseteq h, [b,h] \subseteq b$ is state-dependent and thus
requires the representation in the local coordinates.
