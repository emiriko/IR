We numerically study a two-dimensional granular gas of rigid disks where an
external driving force is applied to each particle in such a way that the
system is driven into a steady state by balancing the energy input and the
dissipation due to inelastic collisions. Two intruder particles embedded in
this correlated medium experience a fluctuation-induced force -- that is itself
a fluctuating quantity -- due to the confinement of the hydrodynamic
fluctuations between them. We find that the probability distribution of this
force is a Gaussian centered on a value that is proportional to the
steady-state temperature and grows logarithmically with system size. We
investigate the effect of the other relevant parameters and estimate the force
using the Fourier transform of the fluctuating hydrodynamic fields.
