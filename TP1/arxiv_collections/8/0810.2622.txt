We study the effects of final state interactions on the eta(b) => J/psi J/psi
decay. In particular, we discuss the effects of the annihilation of eta(b) into
two charmed meson and their rescattering into J/psi J/psi. We find that the
inclusion of this contribution may enhance the short-distance branching ratio
up to about 2 orders of magnitude.
