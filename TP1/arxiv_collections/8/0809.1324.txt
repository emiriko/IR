In extradimensional holographic approaches the flavour symmetry is gauged in
the bulk, that is, treated as a local symmetry. Imposing such a local symmetry
admits fewer terms coupling the (axial) vectors and (pseudo)scalars than if a
global symmetry is imposed. The latter is the case in standard low-energy
effective Lagrangians. Here we incorporate these additional, a priori only
globally invariant terms into a holographic treatment by means of a
Stueckelberg completion and alternatively by means of a Legendre
transformation. This work was motivated by our investigations concerning
dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking by walking technicolour and we apply
our findings to these theories.
