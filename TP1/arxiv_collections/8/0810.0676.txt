I apply a recently developed algorithm for reweighting simulations of lattice
QCD from one quark mass to another to simulations performed with overlap
fermions in the epsilon regime. I test it by computing the condensate from
distributions of the low lying eigenvalues of the Dirac operator. Results seem
favorable.
