The influence of screening on the condensed state of bilayer graphene is
studied within the framework of the Thomas Fermi approximation. We find that
screening has little effect on the Kosterlitz-Thouless temperature in the
strongly interacting regime. Furthermore, we predict that the phase transition
to the condensed state is first order.
