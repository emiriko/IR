Liquids in contact with solids are submitted to intermolecular forces making
liquids heterogeneous and stress tensors are not any more spherical as in
homogeneous bulks. The aim of this article is to show that a square-gradient
functional representing liquid-vapor interface free energy corrected with a
liquid density functional at solid surfaces is a well adapted model to study
structures of very thin nanofilms near solid walls. This result makes it
possible to study the motions of liquids in nanolayers and to generalize the
approximation of lubrication in long wave hypothesis.
