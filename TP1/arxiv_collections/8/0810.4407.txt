The relation between the angular transverse shifts of the beams reflected and
transmitted at a plane interface of two isotropic transparent media is
established. The derivation of this relation is based on the conservation law
of the transverse component of the Minkowski linear momentum, which takes place
in the processes of the reflection and transmission of wave packets.
