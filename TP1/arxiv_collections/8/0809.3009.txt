Legacy spreadsheets are both, an asset, and an enduring problem concerning
spreadsheets in business. To make spreadsheets stay alive and remain correct,
comprehension of a given spreadsheet is highly important. Visualization
techniques should ease the complex and mindblowing challenges of finding
structures in a huge set of spreadsheet cells for building an adequate mental
model of spreadsheet programs. Since spreadsheet programs are as diverse as the
purpose they are serving and as inhomogeneous as their programmers, to find an
appropriate representation or visualization technique for every spreadsheet
program seems futile. We thus propose different visualization and
representation methods that may ease spreadsheet comprehension but should not
be applied with all kind of spreadsheet programs. Therefore, this paper
proposes to use (complexity) measures as indicators for proper visualization.
