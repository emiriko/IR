The remarkable transport properties of graphene follow not only from the the
Dirac-like energy dispersion, but also from the chiral nature of its
excitations, which makes unclear the limits of applicability of the standard
semiclassical Boltzmann approach. In this paper we provide a quantum derivation
of the transport scattering time in graphene in the case of electron-phonon
interaction. By using the Kubo formalism, we compute explicitly the vertex
corrections to the dc conductivity by retaining the full chiral matrix
structure of graphene. We show that at least in the regime of large chemical
potential the Boltzmann picture is justified, and it is also robust against a
small sublattice inequivalence which partly spoils the role of chirality.
