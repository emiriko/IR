Time-frequency representations of audio signals often resemble texture
images. This paper derives a simple audio classification algorithm based on
treating sound spectrograms as texture images. The algorithm is inspired by an
earlier visual classification scheme particularly efficient at classifying
textures. While solely based on time-frequency texture features, the algorithm
achieves surprisingly good performance in musical instrument classification
experiments.
