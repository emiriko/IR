Electrical resistivity under high pressure have been measured on nominally
pure SrFe2As2 up to 14 GPa. The resistivity drop appeared with increasing
pressure, and we clearly observed zero resistivity. The maximum of
superconducting transition temperature (Tc) is 38 K. The value is corresponding
to the one of optimally doping AFe2As2 (A=Sr, Ba) system with K+ ions at the
A2+ site.
