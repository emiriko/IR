In this paper we present the latest results from the MINOS Experiment. This
includes a new measurement of the atmospheric neutrino oscillation parameters
based on 3.36 x 10^20 protons-on-target of data and a first analysis of neutral
current events in the Far Detector. The prospects for nu-e appearance
measurements in MINOS are also discussed.
