The Classical-map Hyper-Netted-Chain (CHNC) technique is a simple method of
calculating quantum pair-distribution functions, spin-dependent energies, etc.,
of strongly-interacting {\it uniform} systems. We present CHNC calculations of
charge densities and energies of {\it non-uniform} systems, viz., quantum dots,
and compare with quantum Monte Carlo and density -functional results. Results
for up to 210 electrons are reported.
