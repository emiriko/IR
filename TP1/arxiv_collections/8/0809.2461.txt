The most costly and annoying characteristic of the e-mail communication
system is the large number of unsolicited commercial e-mails, known as spams,
that are continuously received. Via the investigation of the statistical
properties of the spam delivering intertimes, we show that spams delivered to a
given recipient are time correlated: if the intertime between two consecutive
spams is small (large), then the next spam will most probably arrive after a
small (large) intertime. Spam temporal correlations are reproduced by a
numerical model based on the random superposition of spam sequences, each one
described by the Omori law. This and other experimental findings suggest that
statistical approaches may be used to infer how spammers operate.
