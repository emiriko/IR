We have synthesized Cr1.4Fe0.6O3 compound through mechanical alloying of
Cr2O3 and Fe2O3 powders and subsequent thermal annealing. The XRD spectrum, SEM
picture and microanalysis of EDAX spectrum have been used to understand the
structural evolution in the alloyed compound. The alloyed samples are matching
to rhombohedral structure with R3C space group. The observation of a modulated
magnetic order confirmed a systematic diffusion of Fe atoms into the Cr sites
of lattice structure. A field induced magnetic behaviour is seen in the field
dependence of magnetization data of the annealed samples. The behaviour is
significantly different from the mechanical alloyed samples. The experimental
results provided the indications of considering the present material as a
potential candidate for opto-electronic applications.
