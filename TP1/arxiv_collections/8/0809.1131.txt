In this paper, with an appropriate combination of three Liouville-type
dilaton potentials, we obtain the higher dimensional charged slowly rotating
dilaton black hole solution for asymptotically anti-de Sitter spacetime. The
angular momentum and the gyromagnetic ratio of such a black hole are determined
for the arbitrary values of the dilaton coupling constant. It is shown that the
dilaton field modifies the gyromagnetic ratio of the rotating dilaton black
holes.
