A search for events with one or more isolated leptons in the final state is
performed on a data sample collected in e+-p collisions with the H1 and ZEUS
detectors at the HERA collider. The data sample corresponds to an integrated
luminosity of ~1 fb-1, representing the full HERA high-energy data set. The
yields of single, di- and tri-lepton events are measured and compared to the
Standard Model predictions, looking for possible deviations. No significant
discrepancy with respect to the Standard Model expectations is observed.
