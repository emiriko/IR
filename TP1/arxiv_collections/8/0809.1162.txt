It is widely assumed that the dominant source of scattering in graphene is
charged impurities in a substrate. We have tested this conjecture by studying
graphene placed on various substrates and in high-k media. Unexpectedly, we
have found no significant changes in carrier mobility either for different
substrates or by using glycerol, ethanol and water as a top dielectric layer.
This suggests that Coulomb impurities are not the scattering mechanism that
limits the mean free path currently attainable for graphene on a substrate.
