We examine the efficiency of pure, nondegenerate quantum-error
correction-codes for Pauli channels. Specifically, we investigate if correction
of multiple errors in a block is more efficient than using a code that only
corrects one error per block. Block coding with multiple-error correction
cannot increase the efficiency when the qubit error-probability is below a
certain value and the code size fixed. More surprisingly, existing
multiple-error correction codes with a code length equal or less than 256
qubits have lower efficiency than the optimal single-error correcting codes for
any value of the qubit error-probability. We also investigate how efficient
various proposed nondegenerate single-error correcting codes are compared to
the limit set by the code redundancy and by the necessary conditions for
hypothetically existing nondegenerate codes. We find that existing codes are
close to optimal.
