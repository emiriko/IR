We consider time delay and symmetrised time delay (defined in terms of
sojourn times) for quantum scattering pairs $\{H_0=h(P),H\}$, where $h(P)$ a
dispersive operator of hypoelliptic-type. For instance $h(P)$ can be one of the
usual elliptic operators such as the Schr\"odinger operator $h(P)=P^2$ or the
square-root Klein-Gordon operator $h(P)=\sqrt{1+P^2}$. We show under general
conditions that the symmetrised time delay exists for all smooth even
localization functions. It is equal to the Eisenbud-Wigner time delay plus a
contribution due to the non-radial component of the localization function. If
the scattering operator $S$ commutes with some function of the velocity
operator $\nabla h(P)$, then the time delay also exists and is equal to the
symmetrised time delay. As an illustration of our results we consider the case
of a one-dimensionnal Friedrichs Hamiltonian perturbed by a finite rank
potential.
  Our study put into evidence an integral formula relating the operator of
differentiation with respect to the kinetic energy $h(P)$ to the time evolution
of localization operators.
