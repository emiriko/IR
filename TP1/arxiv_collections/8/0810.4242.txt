Using molecular-dynamics simulation, we study the crater volumes induced by
energetic impacts ($v= 1- 250$ km/s) of projectiles containing up to N=1000
atoms. We find that for Lennard-Jones bonded material the crater volume depends
solely on the total impact energy $E$. Above a threshold $\Eth$, the volume
rises linearly with $E$. Similar results are obtained for metallic materials.
By scaling the impact energy $E$ to the target cohesive energy $U$, the crater
volumes become independent of the target material. To a first approximation,
the crater volume increases in proportion with the available scaled energy,
$V=aE/U$. The proportionality factor $a$ is termed the cratering efficiency and
assumes values of around 0.5.
