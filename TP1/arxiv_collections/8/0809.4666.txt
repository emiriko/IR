A resonant chiral tunneling (CT) across a graphene junction (GJ) induced by
an external electromagnetic field (EF) is studied. Modulation of the electron
and hole wavefunction phases $\varphi$ by the external EF during the CT
processes strongly impacts the CT directional diagram. Therefore the a.c.
transport characteristics of GJs depend on the EF polarization and frequency
considerably. The GJ shows great promises for various nanoelectronic
applications working in the THz diapason.
