Direct photon emission in heavy-ion collisions is calculated within the
relativistic microscopic transport model UrQMD. We compare the results from the
pure transport calculation to a hybrid-model calculation, where the
high-density part of the evolution is replaced by an ideal 3-dimensional
fluiddynamic calculation. The effects of viscosity, present in the transport
model but neglected in ideal fluid-dynamics, are examined. We study the
contribution of different production channels and non-thermal collisions to the
spectrum of direct photons. Detailed comparison to the measurements by the
WA~98-collaboration are undertaken.
