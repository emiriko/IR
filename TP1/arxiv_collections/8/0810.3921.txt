Low-energy SUSY and several other theories that address the hierarchy problem
predict pair-production at the LHC of particles with Standard Model quantum
numbers that decay to jets, missing energy, and possibly leptons. If an excess
of such events is seen in LHC data, a theoretical framework in which to
describe it will be essential to constraining the structure of the new physics.
We propose a basis of four deliberately simplified models, each specified by
only 2-3 masses and 4-5 branching ratios, for use in a first characterization
of data. Fits of these simplified models to the data furnish a quantitative
presentation of the jet structure, electroweak decays, and heavy-flavor content
of the data, independent of detector effects. These fits, together with plots
comparing their predictions to distributions in data, can be used as targets
for describing the data within any full theoretical model.
