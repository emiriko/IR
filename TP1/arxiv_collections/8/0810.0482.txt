For a non-interacting Bose gas on a lattice we compute the shift of the
critical temperature for condensation when random-bond and onsite disorder are
present. We evidence that the shift depends on the space dimensionality D and
the filling fraction f. For D -> infinity (infinite-range model), using results
from the theory of random matrices, we show that the shift of the critical
temperature is negative, depends on f, and vanishes only for large f. The
connections with analogous results obtained for the spherical model are
discussed. For D=3 we find that, for large f, the critical temperature Tc is
enhanced by disorder and that the relative shift does not sensibly depend on f;
at variance, for small f, Tc decreases in agreement with the results obtained
for a Bose gas in the continuum. We also provide numerical estimates for the
shift of the critical temperature due to disorder induced on a non-interacting
Bose gas by a bichromatic incommensurate potential.
