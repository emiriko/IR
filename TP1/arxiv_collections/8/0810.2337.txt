The Monte Carlo wave function method or the quantum trajectory/jump approach
is a powerful tool to study dissipative dynamics governed by the Markovian
master equation, in particular for high-dimensional systems and when it is
difficult to simulate directly. In this paper, we extend this method to the
non-Markovian case described by the generalized Lindblad master equation. Two
examples to illustrate the method are presented and discussed. The results show
that the method can correctly reproduce the dissipative dynamics for the
system. The difference between this method and the traditional Markovian jump
approach and the computational efficiency of this method are also discussed.
