The idea is considered that a quantum wormhole in a spacetime foam can be
described as a Ricci flow. In this interpretation the Ricci flow is a
statistical system and every metric in the Ricci flow is a microscopical state.
The probability density of the microscopical state is connected with a
Perelman's functional of a rescaled Ricci flow.
