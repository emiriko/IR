The steps at the crystal surfaces could be transparent for the migrating
adatoms. In the case of significant transparency the velocity of a given step
in a given moment is affected by detachment of atoms from rather distant steps
in rather earlier moments. The reason is that the adatom needs time to cross
many steps before attaching to a kink position. The theory of the
crystallization should account for the time dependence of the adatom
concentrations on the terraces. Such a transient growth model is developed here
for the limit of slow kinetics at the steps and fast surface diffusion. The
model accounts for the non-local electromigration of the adatoms. The central
results of this study are: - The vicinal surface with transparent steps is
unstable when the drift velocity of the adatoms multiplied with the relative
deviation of the adatom concentration from equilibrium is larger than the
critical velocity of the steps. - The most unstable mode has a wavelength
(expressed as a number of terraces) which is independent of the surface
orientation (the miscut angle of the vicinal) as well as on the magnitude of
step repulsion and the electromigration force and depends only on the relative
transparency of the steps.
