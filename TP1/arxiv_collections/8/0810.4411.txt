We suggest that measuring the variation of the radius of an atomic cloud when
the harmonic tap confinement is varied make it possible to monitor the
disappearance of the insulating Mott phase of an ultracold atomic gas trapped
in a disordered optical lattice. This paves the way for an unambiguous
identification of a Bose glass phase in the system.
