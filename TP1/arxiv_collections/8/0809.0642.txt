A multi-phase-field model for the description of the discontinuous
precipitation reaction is formulated which takes into account surface diffusion
along grain boundaries and interfaces as well as volume diffusion. Simulations
reveal that the structure and steady-state growth velocity of spatially
periodic precipitation fronts strongly depend on the relative magnitudes of the
diffusion coefficients. Steady-state solutions always exist for a range of
interlamellar spacings that is limited by a fold singularity for low spacings,
and by the onset of tip-splitting or oscillatory instabilities for large
spacings. A detailed analysis of the simulation data reveals that the
hypothesis of local equilibrium at interfaces, used in previous theories, is
not valid for the typical conditions of discontinuous precipitation.
