We present a model for a vacuum-like effective medium composed of the
absorbing and gain media under the special designed parameters. Within the
linear response theory, we prove that any pulse signal (with or without a
discontinuity) through such a kind of vacuum-like effective media is always
equal to the light speed in vacuum () without any distortion. As well known
that the group velocity in anomalous or normal dispersive media may be smaller
or larger than, or even become negative, but the discontinuous point always
propagates at the velocity . Therefore we present some discussions on different
definitions of the signals, based on the light pulses with a well-defined shape
or with a sudden change, for trying to understand two possibilities for the
signal velocity without violating the causality.
