Up until now a complete scan in all phenomenologically relevant directions of
the MSSM at the TeV scale for performing global fit has not been done. Given
the imminent start of operation of the LHC, this is a major gap on our quest to
discovering and understanding the physical implications of low energy
supersymmetry. The main reason for this is the large number of parameters
involved that makes it computationally extremely expensive using the
traditional methods. In this talk I demonstrate that with advanced sampling
techniques the problem is solvable. The results from the explored 24-parameter
TeV scale MSSM (phenoMSSM) are remarkably distinct from previous studies and
are independent of models for supersymmetry breaking and mediation mechanisms.
Hence they are a more robust guide to searches for supersymmetry and dark
matter.
