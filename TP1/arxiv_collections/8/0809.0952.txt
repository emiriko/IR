The current-induced resonant excitation of a magnetic vortex core is
investigated by means of analytical and micromagnetic calculations. We find
that the radius and the phase shift of the resonant motion are not correctly
described by the analytical equations because of the dynamic distortion of a
vortex core. In contrast, the initial tilting angle of a vortex core is free
from the distortion and determined by the nonadiabaticity of the spin torque.
It is insensitive to experimentally uncontrollable current-induced in-plane
Oersted field. We propose that a time-resolved imaging of the very initial
trajectory of a core is essential to experimentally estimate the
nonadiabaticity.
