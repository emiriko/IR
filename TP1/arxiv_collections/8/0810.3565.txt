This paper contains a detailed derivation of the photoinduced current density
at third order in the coupling between a semiconductor and a multifrequency
photon field, starting from its standard textbook expression as a third order
time integral of a triple commutator. Due to a major intrinsic problem linked
to this triple commutator, such a derivation has been made possible quite
recently only, thanks to the tools developed in the composite-boson many-body
theory we have just constructed. The photoinduced current density is shown to
ultimately read in a compact form, in terms of the Pauli and Coulomb
scatterings for exciton-exciton interactions introduced in this theory.
Representation in Shiva diagrams is also given to better grasp the physics of
the various contributions.
