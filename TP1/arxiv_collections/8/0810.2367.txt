The energy bands of a semiconductor are lowered by an external magnetic
field. When a field is switched on, the straight-line trajectories near the top
of the occupied valence band are curved into Landau orbits and Bremsstrahlung
is emitted until the electrons have settled in their final Fermi distribution.
We calculate the radiated energy, which should be experimentally detectable,
and suggest that a semiconductor can be cooled by an oscillating magnetic
field.
