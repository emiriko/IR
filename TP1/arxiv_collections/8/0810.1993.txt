Nonequilibrium dynamics are studied near the quantum phase transition point
in the one-dimensional quantum Blume-Emery-Griffiths model. Its pseudo-spin
component $ S^z $ represents an electric polarization, and $ (S^z)^2 $
corresponds to ionicity, in mixed-stack charge-transfer complexes that exhibit
a transition between neutral quantum-paraelectric and ionic ferroelectric (or
antiferroelectric) phases. The time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation is solved
for the exact many-body wave function in the quantum paraelectric phase. After
impact force is introduced on a polarization locally in space and time,
polarizations and ionicity coherently oscillate. The oscillation amplitudes are
large near the quantum phase transition point. The energy supplied by the
impact flows linearly into these oscillations, so that the nonequilibrium
behavior is uncooperative.
