We test the absorber hypothesis of the action-at-a-distance electrodynamics
for globally-bounded solutions of a finite-particle universe. We find that the
absorber hypothesis forbids globally-bounded motions for a universe containing
only two charged particles, otherwise the condition alone does not forbid
globally-bounded motions. We discuss the implication of our results for the
various forms of electrodynamics of point charges.
