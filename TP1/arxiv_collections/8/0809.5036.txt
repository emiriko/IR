In the present paper we are discussing the influence of the fractal
distribution of defects on the critical behavior of the system. We consider a
case when the equation of motion for the order parameter contains influences of
defects of random field and random temperature types at the same time and we
show that it can lead to a change of distribution function from Gibbs
distribution to Tsallis distribution or more general statistics of q-type. We
are able to extend the Landau-Khalatnikov equation for the order parameter and
represent it in the form of a differential equation of the fractional order. We
deduce and we solve the corresponding renormalization group equation with the
nonlinear dispersion law and we calculate the critical indices of the system.
