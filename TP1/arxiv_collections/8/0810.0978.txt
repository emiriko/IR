We demonstrate spin torque induced auto-oscillation in MgO-based magnetic
tunnel junctions. At the generation threshold, we observe a strong line
narrowing down to 6 MHz at 300K and a dramatic increase in oscillator power,
yielding spectrally pure oscillations free of flicker noise. Setting the
synthetic antiferromagnet into autooscillation requires the same current
polarity as the one needed to switch the free layer magnetization. The induced
auto-oscillations are observed even at zero applied field, which is believed to
be the acoustic mode of the synthetic antiferromagnet. While the phase
coherence of the auto-oscillation is of the order of microseconds, the power
autocorrelation time is of the order of milliseconds and can be strongly
influenced by the free layer dynamics.
