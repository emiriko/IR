This paper deals with connections on $p$-adic analytic curves, in the sense
of Berkovich. The curves must be compact but the connections are allowed to
have a finite number of meromorphic singularities on them. For any choice of a
semistable formal model of the curve, we define an intrinsic notion of
normalized radius of convergence as a function on the curve, with values in
$(0,1]$. For a sufficiently refined choice of the semistable model, we prove
continuity and logarithmic concavity of that function. We characterize
\emph{Robba connections}, that is connections whose sheaf of solutions is
constant on any open disk contained in the curve.
