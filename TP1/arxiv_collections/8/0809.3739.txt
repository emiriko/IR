The eigenvalue-function pair of the 3D Schr\"odinger equation can be
efficiently computed by use of high order, imaginary time propagators. Due to
the diffusion character of the kinetic energy operator in imaginary time,
algorithms developed so far are at most fourth-order. In this work, we show
that for a grid based algorithm, imaginary time propagation of any even order
can be devised on the basis of multi-product splitting. The effectiveness of
these algorithms, up to the 12$^{\rm th}$ order, is demonstrated by computing
all 120 eigenstates of a model C$_{60}$ molecule to very high precisions. The
algorithms are particularly useful when implemented on parallel computer
architectures.
