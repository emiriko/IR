We give a detailed analysis of the origin of spurious divergences and finite
steps that have been recently identified in particle-number restoration
calculations within the nuclear energy density functional framework. We isolate
two distinct levels of spurious contributions to the energy. The first one is
encoded in the definition of the basic energy density functional itself whereas
the second one relates to the canonical procedure followed to extend the use of
the energy density functional to multi-reference calculations. The first level
of spuriosity relates to the long-known self-interaction problem and to the
newly discussed self-pairing interaction process which might appear when
describing paired systems with energy functional methods using auxiliary
reference states of Bogoliubov or BCS type. A minimal correction to the second
level of spuriosity to the multi-reference nuclear energy density functional
proposed in [D. Lacroix, T. Duguet, M. Bender, arXiv:0809.2041] is shown to
remove completely the anomalies encountered in particle-number restored
calculations. In particular, it restores sum-rules over (positive) particle
numbers that are to be fulfilled by the particle-number-restored formalism. The
correction is found to be on the order of several hundreds of keVs up to about
1 MeV in realistic calculations, which is small compared to the total binding
energy, but often accounts for a substantial percentage of the energy gain from
particle-number restoration and is on the same energy scale as the excitations
one addresses with multi-reference energy density functional methods.
