The interpretation of a family of electrovacuum stationary Taub-NUT-type
fields in terms of finite charged perfect fluid disks is presented. The
interpretation is mades by means of an "inverse problem" approach used to
obtain disk sources of known solutions of the Einstein or Einstein-Maxwell
equations. The diagonalization of the energy-momentum tensor of the disks is
facilitated in this case by the fact that it can be written as an upper right
triangular matrix. We find that the inclusion of electromagnetic fields changes
significatively the different material properties of the disks and so we can
obtain, for some values of the parameters, finite charged perfect fluid disks
that are in agreement with all the energy conditions.
