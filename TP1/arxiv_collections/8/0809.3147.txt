A continuum one dimensional model of homoepitaxial growth under oblique
incidence is investigated. We carried out numerical integration of a continuum
equation incorporating a shadowing search algorithm. The interplay between the
Ehrlich-Schwoebel (ES) effect and shadowing is clearly highlighted. It was
found that different growth phases are separated by a well defined crossover
time after which the ES and shadowing are the dominating mechanisms. Also, the
model identified the existence of a transition period where deep grooves
develop on the surface before the shadowing regime is fully developed. We found
that growth under oblique angles accelerates the coarsening of mounds on the
surface and we determined the corresponding critical exponent.
