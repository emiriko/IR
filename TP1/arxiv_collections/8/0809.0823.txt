We present a summary of strangeness enhancement results comparing data from
Cu+Cu and Au+Au collisions at sqrt(SNN) = 200GeV measured by the STAR
experiment. Relative yields in central Cu+Cu data seem to be higher than the
equivalent sized peripheral Au+Au collision. In addition, strange particle
production from these two systems is compared in terms of a statistical model,
applying a Grand-Canonical ensemble and also applying a canonical correlation
volume for the strange particles. Thermal fit results from the Grand-Canonical
formalism shows little dependence on the system size but, when considering a
strange canonical ensemble, strangeness enhancement shows a strong dependency
on the correlation volume.
