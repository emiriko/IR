The Daya Bay Reactor Neutrino Experiment is designed to determine the yet
unknown neutrino mixing angle theta_13 by measuring the disappearance of
electron antineutrinos from several nuclear reactor cores, using multiple
underground detectors at different baselines to minimize systematic errors and
to suppress the cosmogenic background. The civil construction has begun since
October 2007, enabling first commissioning data in 2009, and full data taking
will begin in late 2010. The planned sensitivity in sin^2 (2theta_13) of better
than 0.01 at 90% CL will be achieved in three years of data-taking. I will
present an overview and current status of the experiment.
