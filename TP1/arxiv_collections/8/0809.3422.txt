We show that new massless Dirac fermions are generated when a slowly varying
periodic potential is applied to graphene. These quasiparticles, generated near
the supercell Brillouin zone boundaries with anisotropic group velocity, are
different from the original massless Dirac fermions. The quasiparticle
wavevector (measured from the new Dirac point), the generalized pseudospin
vector, and the group velocity are not collinear. We further show that with an
appropriate periodic potential of triangular symmetry, there exists an energy
window over which the only available states are these quasiparticles, thus,
providing a good system to probe experimentally the new massless Dirac
fermions. The required parameters of external potentials are within the realm
of laboratory conditions.
