We define Jones's planar algebra as a map of multicategories and constuct a
planar algebra starting from a 1-cell in a pivotal strict 2-category. We prove
finiteness results for the affine representations of finite depth planar
algebras. We also show that the radius of convergence of the dimension of an
affine representation of the planar algebra associated to a finite depth
subfactor is at least as big as the inverse-square of the modulus.
