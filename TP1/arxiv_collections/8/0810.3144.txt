The search for a Higgs boson produced via Vector Boson Fusion and
subsequently decaying to two tau leptons is discussed. Significances for the
di-lepton and lepton-hadron decay channels are presented, and the fully
hadronic decay channel is shown to be feasible in terms of trigger, mass
reconstruction and signal efficiency. We consider performance issues for tau
ID, missing transverse energy, forward jet identification, and central jet and
b-jet vetoes, and outline several methods to estimate background contributions.
