In this note we analyze the geometry of maximally symmetric boundary
conditions in Lie supergroup Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten models. We find that
generically the worldvolume of a brane is a twisted superconjugacy class, very
much like in the Lie group case. Whenever the brane is not completely
delocalized in the fermionic directions a new atypical class of branes arises.
We give an example of these new branes and show for type I supergroups and
trivial gluing conditions that they can be naturally associated with atypical
representations of the affine Lie superalgebra.
