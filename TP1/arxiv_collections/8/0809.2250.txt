We use current-perpendicular-to-plane (CPP) exchange-biased spin-valves to
directly measure spin diffusion lengths lsf for N = Cu(2.1 at.%Ge) and Ag(3.6
at.%Sn) alloys. We find lsf(Cu2%Ge)) = 117+10-6 nm and lsf(Ag4%Sn)= 39 +/- 3
nm. The good agreement of this lsf(Cu2%Ge) with the value lsf(Cu2%Ge) = 121 +/-
10 nm derived from an independent spin-orbit cross-section measurement for Ge
in Cu, quantitatively validates the use of Valet-Fert theory for CPP-MR data
analysis to layer thicknesses several times larger than had been done before.
  From the value of lsf(Ag4%Sn), we predict the ESR spin-orbit cross-section
for Sn impurities in Ag.
