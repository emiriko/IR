Just as war is sometimes fallaciously represented as a zero sum game -- when
in fact war is a negative sum game - stock market trading, a positive sum game
over time, is often erroneously represented as a zero sum game. This is called
the "zero sum fallacy" -- the erroneous belief that one trader in a stock
market exchange can only improve their position provided some other trader's
position deteriorates. However, a positive sum game in absolute terms can be
recast as a zero sum game in relative terms. Similarly it appears that negative
sum games in absolute terms have been recast as zero sum games in relative
terms: otherwise, why would zero sum games be used to represent situations of
war? Such recasting may have heuristic or pedagogic interest but recasting must
be clearly explicited or risks generating confusion.
