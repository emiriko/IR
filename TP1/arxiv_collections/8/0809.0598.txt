We theoretically study the effects of spin-orbit coupling on spin exchange in
a low-density Wigner crystal. In addition to the familiar antiferromagnetic
Heisenberg exchange, we find general anisotropic interactions in spin space if
the exchange paths allowed by the crystal structure form loops in real space.
In particular, it is shown that the two-electron exchange interaction can
acquire ferromagnetic character.
