Recent results of searches for new physics at HERA using the complete data
sample corresponding to about 0.5/fb per experiment are reviewed. Searches for
leptoquarks, isolated leptons (electrons, muons and taus) and a generic search
for new physics in many topologies are reported. No evidence for new physics is
found. The ep collisions at HERA are ideally suited to search for resonantly
produced squarks in SUSY with R-parity violation. It is highlighted how the
present results can be interpreted in this way.
