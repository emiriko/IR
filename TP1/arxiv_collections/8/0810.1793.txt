In this paper we consider exact tests of a multiple logistic regression,
where the levels of covariates are equally spaced, via Markov beses. In usual
application of multiple logistic regression, the sample size is positive for
each combination of levels of the covariates. In this case we do not need a
whole Markov basis, which guarantees connectivity of all fibers. We first give
an explicit Markov basis for multiple Poisson regression. By the Lawrence
lifting of this basis, in the case of bivariate logistic regression, we show a
simple subset of the Markov basis which connects all fibers with a positive
sample size for each combination of levels of covariates.
