In numerical experiments involving nonlinear solitary waves propagating
through nonhomogeneous media one observes "breathing" in the sense of the
amplitude of the wave going up and down on a much faster scale than the motion
of the wave. In this paper we investigate this phenomenon in the simplest case
of stationary waves in which the evolution corresponds to relaxation to a
nonlinear ground state. The particular model is the popular $ \delta_0 $
impurity in the cubic nonlinear Schroedinger equation on the line. We give
asymptotics of the amplitude on a finite but relevant time interval and show
their remarkable agreement with numerical experiments. We stress the nonlinear
origin of the "breathing patterns" caused by the selection of the ground state
depending on the initial data, and by the non-normality of the linearized
operator.
