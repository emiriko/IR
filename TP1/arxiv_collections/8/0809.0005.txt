Motivated by the puzzles in understanding how Black Holes evaporate into a
strongly coupled Conformal Field Theory, we study particle creation by an
accelerating mirror. We model the mirror as a gravitating Domain Wall and
consider a CFT coupled to it through gravity, in asymptotically Anti de Sitter
space. This problem (backreaction included) can be solved exactly at one loop.
At strong coupling, this is dual to a Domain Wall localized on the brane in the
Karch-Randall model, which can be fully solved as well. Hence, in this case one
can see how the particle production is affected by A) strong coupling and B)
its own backreaction. We find that A) the amount of CFT radiation at strong
coupling is not suppressed relative to the weak coupling result; and B) once
the boundary conditions in the AdS_5 bulk are appropriately mapped to the
conditions for the CFT on the boundary of AdS_4, the Karch-Randall model and
the CFT side agree to leading order in the backreaction. This agreement holds
even for a new class of self-consistent solutions (the `Bootstrap' Domain Wall
spacetimes) that have no classical limit. This provides a quite precise check
of the holographic interpretation of the Karch-Randall model. We also comment
on the massive gravity interpretation.
  As a byproduct, we show that relativistic Cosmic Strings (pure tension
codimension 2 branes) in Anti de Sitter are repulsive and generate long-range
tidal forces even at classical level. This is the phenomenon dual to particle
production by Domain Walls.
