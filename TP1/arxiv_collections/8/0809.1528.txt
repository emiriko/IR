This paper is devoted to the study of matter collineations of plane symmetric
spacetimes (for a particular class of spacetimes) when the energy-momentum
tensor is non-degenerate. There exists many interesting cases where we obtain
proper matter collineations. The matter collineations in these cases are {\it
four}, \emph{five}, {\it six}, \emph{seven} and {\it ten} with some constraints
on the energy-momentum tensor. We have solved some of these constraints to
obtain solutions of the Einstein field equations.
