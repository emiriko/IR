The adiabatic theorem provides the basis for the adiabatic model of quantum
computation. Recently the conditions required for the adiabatic theorem to hold
have become a subject of some controversy. Here we show that the reported
violations of the adiabatic theorem all arise from resonant transitions between
energy levels. In the absence of fast driven oscillations the traditional
adiabatic theorem holds. Implications for adiabatic quantum computation is
discussed.
