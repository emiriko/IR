We generated -2.2 dB of broadband amplitude squeezing at 1064 nm in a
periodically poled KTiOPO_4 (PPKTP) waveguide, by coupling of the fundamental
and second harmonic continuous-wave fields. This is the largest amount of
squeezing obtained to date in a KTP waveguide, limited by propagation losses.
This result paves the way for further improvements by use of lower-loss buried
ion-exchanged waveguides.
