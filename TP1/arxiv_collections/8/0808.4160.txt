We develop a maximum relative entropy formalism to generate optimal
approximations to probability distributions. The central results consist in (a)
justifying the use of relative entropy as the uniquely natural criterion to
select a preferred approximation from within a family of trial parameterized
distributions, and (b) to obtain the optimal approximation by marginalizing
over parameters using the method of maximum entropy and information geometry.
As an illustration we apply our method to simple fluids. The "exact" canonical
distribution is approximated by that of a fluid of hard spheres. The proposed
method first determines the preferred value of the hard-sphere diameter, and
then obtains an optimal hard-sphere approximation by a suitably weighed average
over different hard-sphere diameters. This leads to a considerable improvement
in accounting for the soft-core nature of the interatomic potential. As a
numerical demonstration, the radial distribution function and the equation of
state for a Lennard-Jones fluid (argon) are compared with results from
molecular dynamics simulations.
