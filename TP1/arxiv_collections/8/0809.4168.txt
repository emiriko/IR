We investigate polyhedral $2k$-manifolds as subcomplexes of the boundary
complex of a regular polytope. We call such a subcomplex {\it $k$-Hamiltonian}
if it contains the full $k$-skeleton of the polytope. Since the case of the
cube is well known and since the case of a simplex was also previously studied
(these are so-called {\it super-neighborly triangulations}) we focus on the
case of the cross polytope and the sporadic regular 4-polytopes. By our results
the existence of 1-Hamiltonian surfaces is now decided for all regular
polytopes.
  Furthermore we investigate 2-Hamiltonian 4-manifolds in the $d$-dimensional
cross polytope. These are the "regular cases" satisfying equality in Sparla's
inequality. In particular, we present a new example with 16 vertices which is
highly symmetric with an automorphism group of order 128. Topologically it is
homeomorphic to a connected sum of 7 copies of $S^2 \times S^2$. By this
example all regular cases of $n$ vertices with $n < 20$ or, equivalently, all
cases of regular $d$-polytopes with $d\leq 9$ are now decided.
