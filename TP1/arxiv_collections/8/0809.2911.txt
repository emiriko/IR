A gravitational wave must be nonlinear to be able to transport its own
source, that is, energy and momentum. A physical gravitational wave, therefore,
cannot be represented by a solution to a linear wave equation. Relying on this
property, the second-order solution describing such physical waves is obtained.
The effects they produce on free particles are found to consist of nonlinear
oscillations along the direction of propagation.
