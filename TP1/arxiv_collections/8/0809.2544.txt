Single lateral InGaAs quantum dot molecules have been embedded in a planar
micro-cavity in order to increase the luminescence extraction efficiency. Using
a combination of metal-organic vapor phase and molecular beam epitaxy samples
could be produced that exhibit a 30 times enhanced single-photon emission rate.
We also show that the single-photon emission is fully switchable between two
different molecular excitonic recombination energies by applying a lateral
electric field. Furthermore, the presence of a polarization fine-structure
splitting of the molecular neutral excitonic states is reported which leads to
two polarization-split classically correlated biexciton exciton cascades. The
fine-structure splitting is found to be on the order of 10 micro-eV.
