The measurement of transverse spin effects in semi-inclusive deep-inelastic
scattering is an important part of the COMPASS physics program. In the years
2002-2004 data were taken by scattering a 160 GeV muon beam on a transversely
polarized deuteron target. In 2007, additional data were collected on a
transversely polarized proton target. New results for the Collins and Sivers
asymmetries from the analysis of the proton data are presented.
