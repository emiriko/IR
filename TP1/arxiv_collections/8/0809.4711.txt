We discuss the possible extension of the bosonic classical field theory
simulations to include fermions. This problem has been addressed in terms of
the inhomogeneous mean field approximation by Aarts and Smit. By performing a
stochastic integration of an equivalent set of equations we can extend the
original 1+1 dimensional calculations so that they become feasible in higher
dimensions. We test the scheme in 2 + 1 dimensions and discuss some classical
applications with fermions for the first time, such as the decay of oscillons.
