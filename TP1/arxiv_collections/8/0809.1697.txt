Oscillations represent a ubiquitous phenomenon in biological systems. The
conventional models of biological periodic oscillations are usually proposed as
interconnecting transcriptional feedback loops. Some specific proteins function
as transcription factors, which in turn negatively regulate the expression of
the genes that encode those "clock protein". These loops may lead to rhythmic
changes in gene expression of a cell. In the case of multi-cellular tissue, the
collective oscillation is often obtained from synchronization of these cells,
which manifest themselves as autonomous oscillators. In contrast, here, we
propose a different scenario for the occurrence of collective oscillation in a
multi-cellular system independent of oscillation, neither intrinsically
oscillatory cells nor periodic external stimulation. It is a coupling induced
oscillation, with the consideration of wave propagation due to the
intracellular communication.
