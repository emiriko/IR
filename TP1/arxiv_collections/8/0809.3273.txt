We define the direct and reverse secret-key capacities of a memoryless
quantum channel as the optimal rates that entanglement-based quantum key
distribution protocols can reach by using a single forward classical
communication (direct reconciliation) or a single feedback classical
communication (reverse reconciliation). In particular, the reverse secret-key
capacity can be positive for antidegradable channels, where no forward strategy
is known to be secure. This property is explicitly shown in the continuous
variable framework by considering arbitrary one-mode Gaussian channels.
