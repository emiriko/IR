A spherical topological manifold of dimension n-1 forms a prototile on its
cover, the (n-1)-sphere. The tiling is generated by the fixpoint-free action of
the group of deck transformations. By a general theorem, this group is
isomorphic to the first homotopy group. Multiplicity and selection rules appear
in the form of reduction of group representations. A basis for the harmonic
analysis on the (n-1)-sphere is given by the spherical harmonics which
transform according to irreducible representations of the orthogonal group. The
deck transformations form a subgroup, and so the representations of the
orthogonal group can be reduced to those of this subgroup. Upon reducing to the
identity representation of the subgroup, the reduced subset of spherical
harmonics becomes periodic on the tiling and tunes the harmonic analysis on the
(n-1)-sphere to the manifold. A particular class of spherical 3-manifolds
arises from the Platonic polyhedra. The harmonic analysis on the Poincare
dodecahedral 3-manifold was analyzed along these lines. For comparison we
construct here the harmonic analysis on simplicial spherical manifolds of
dimension n=1,2,3. Harmonic analysis applied to the cosmic microwave background
by selection rules can provide evidence for multiply connected cosmic
topologies.
