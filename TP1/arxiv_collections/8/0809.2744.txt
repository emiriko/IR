We present a covariant extension of the relativistic Fermi gas model which
incorporates correlation effects in nuclei. Within this model, inspired by the
BCS descriptions of systems of fermions, we obtain the nuclear spectral
function and from it the superscaling function for use in treating high-energy
quasielastic electroweak processes. Interestingly, this model has the
capability to yield the asymmetric tail seen in the experimental scaling
function.
