We reconsider the problem of optimal time to sell a stock studied recently by
Shiryaev, Xu and Zhou using path integral methods. This method allows us to
confirm the results obtained by these authors and extend them to a parameter
region inaccessible to the method used by Shiryaev et. al. We also obtain the
full distribution of the time t_m at which the maximum of the price is reached
for arbitrary values of the drift.
