It's been a remarkable decade in neutrino physics. Ten years ago this summer,
at the 1998 neutrino conference in Takayama, the Super-Kamiokande collaboration
reported the observation of neutrinos changing flavor, thereby establishing the
existence of neutrino mass. A few years later, the SNO experiment solved the
long-standing solar neutrino problem demonstrating that it too was due to
neutrino oscillation. Just a few years after that, these effects were confirmed
and the oscillation parameters were measured with man-made neutrino sources.
Now, just in this last year, the same neutrinos which were the source of the 30
year old solar neutrino problem were measured for the first time in a real-time
experiment.
  In this talk, I will explain how a set of experiments, especially ones in the
last few years, have established a consistent framework of neutrino physics and
also explain some outstanding questions. Finally, I will cover how a set of
upcoming experiments hope to address these questions in the coming decade.
