We report single-mode lasing in subwavelength GaAs disks under optical
pumping. The disks are fabricated by standard photolithography and two steps of
wet chemical etching. The simple fabrication method can produce submicron disks
with good circularity, smooth boundary and vertical sidewalls. The smallest
lasing disks have a diameter of 627 nm and thickness of 265 nm. The ratio of
the disk diameter to the vacuum lasing wavelength is about 0.7. Our numerical
simulations confirm that the lasing modes are whispering-gallery modes with the
azimuthal number as small as 4 and very small mode volume.
