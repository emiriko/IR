In the model of low-energy quantum gravity by the author, the redshift
mechanism is quantum and local, and it is not connected with any expansion of
the Universe. A few possibilities to verify its predictions are considered
here: the specialized ground-based laser experiment; a deceleration of massive
bodies and the Pioneer anomaly; a non-universal character of the Hubble diagram
for soft and hard radiations; galaxy/quasar number counts.
