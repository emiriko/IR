We consider a Josephson junction where the weak-link is formed by a
non-centrosymmetric ferromagnet. In such a junction, the superconducting
current acts as a direct driving force on the magnetic moment. We show that the
a.c. Josephson effect generates a magnetic precession providing then a feedback
to the current. Magnetic dynamics result in several anomalies of current-phase
relations (second harmonic, dissipative current) which are strongly enhanced
near the ferromagnetic resonance frequency.
