We report on a new variant of the hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm employing a
polynomial approximation of the inverse of the non-Hermitian Dirac-Wilson
operator. Our approximation relies on simple and stable recurrence relations of
complex Chebyshev polynomials. First performance figures are presented.
