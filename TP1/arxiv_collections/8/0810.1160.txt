A powerful method for solving non-linear first-order ordinary differential
equations, which is based on geometrical understanding of the corresponding
dynamics of the so called Lie systems, is developed. This method allows us not
only to solve some of these equations, but also gives a geometrical
explanations for some, already known, ad hoc methods of dealing with such
problems.
