In this paper we analyze four examples of birational transformations between
local Calabi-Yau 3-folds: two crepant resolutions, a crepant partial
resolution, and a flop. We study the effect of these transformations on
genus-zero Gromov-Witten invariants, proving the
Coates-Corti-Iritani-Tseng/Ruan form of the Crepant Resolution Conjecture in
each case. Our results suggest that this form of the Crepant Resolution
Conjecture may also hold for more general crepant birational transformations.
They also suggest that Ruan's original Crepant Resolution Conjecture should be
modified, by including appropriate "quantum corrections", and that there is no
straightforward generalization of either Ruan's original Conjecture or the
Cohomological Crepant Resolution Conjecture to the case of crepant partial
resolutions. Our methods are based on mirror symmetry for toric orbifolds.
