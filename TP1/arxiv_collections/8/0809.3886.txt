In this paper we develop a QCD motivated model for both hard and soft
interactions at high energies. In this model the long distance behavior of the
scattering amplitude is determined by the approximate solution to the
non-linear evolution equation for parton system in the saturation domain. All
phenomenological parameters for dipole-proton interaction were fitted from the
deep inelastic scattering data and the soft processes are described with only
one new parameter, related to the wave function of hadron. It turns out that we
do not need to introduce the so called soft Pomeron that has been used in high
energy phenomenology for four decades. The model described all data on soft
interactions: the values of total, elastic and diffractive cross sections as
well as their $s$ and $t$ behavior. The value for the survival probability of
the diffractive Higgs production is calculated being less 1% for the LHC energy
range.
