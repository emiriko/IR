We discuss multi-dimensional generalizations of multicanonical algorithm,
simulated tempering, and replica-exchange method. We generalize the original
potential energy function $E_0$ by adding any physical quantity $V$ of interest
as a new energy term with a coupling constant $\lambda$. We then perform a
multi-dimensional multicanonical simulation where a random walk in $E_0$ and
$V$ space is realized. We can alternately perform a multi-dimensional simulated
tempering simulation where a random walk in temperature $T$ and parameter
$\lambda$ is realized. The results of the multi-dimensional replica-exchange
simulations can be used to determine the weight factors for these
multi-dimensional multicanonical and simulated tempering simulations.
