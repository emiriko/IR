Measurement and theory of the two-terminal conductance of monolayer and
bilayer graphene in the quantum Hall regime are compared. We examine features
of conductance as a function of gate voltage that allow monolayer, bilayer, and
gapped samples to be distinguished, including N-shaped distortions of quantum
Hall plateaus and conductance peaks and dips at the charge neutrality point.
Generally good agreement is found between measurement and theory. Possible
origins of discrepancies are discussed.
