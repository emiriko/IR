We study both theoretically and experimentally the process of subdiffusive
substance releasing from a thick membrane. The theoretical model uses the
subdiffusion equation with fractional time derivative and specific boundary
conditions at the membrane surfaces. Using a special \textit{ansatz} we find
analytical formulas describing the time evolution of concentration profiles and
an amount of the substance remains in the membrane. Fitting the theoretical
functions to the experimental results, we estimate the subdiffusion coefficient
of polyethylene glycol 2000 in agarose hydrogel.
