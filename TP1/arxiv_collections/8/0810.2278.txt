The CDF and D0 experiments have successfully collected data since start of
the Run II at the Tevatron Collider in 2001. The large B-meson production
cross-section and the possibility to produce all kind of B hadron states,
opened to the two collaborations the possibility to study with high precision
the tiny effects of CP-violation in the Heavy B hadrons system, and to search
for new physics effects in rare decays, in a way unavailable to the previous
generation experiments. A new and largely unknown sector of the Heavy Flavor
physics, complementary to the one already tested with precision at the
B-factories, as recently pointed out by I. Bigi, has begun to be explored in
search of possible signs of new physics. In this short note a selection of the
most recent results on heavy B hadrons (mostly Bs mesons) from the Fermilab
Tevatron, and from the Belle experiment running at the Y(5S) are reviewed.
