In this work, we demonstrate a self-standing bulk three-dimensional
metamaterial based on the network of silver nanowires in an alumina membrane.
This constitutes an anisotropic effective medium with hyperbolic dispersion,
which can be used in sub-diffraction imaging or optical cloaks. Highly
anisotropic dielectric constants of the material range from positive to
negative, and the transmitted laser beam shifts both toward the normal to the
surface, as in regular dielectrics, and off the normal, as in anisotropic
dielectrics with the refraction index smaller than one. The designed photonic
metamaterial is the thickest reported in the literature, both in terms of its
physical size 1cm x 1cm x 51 mm, and the number of vacuum wavelengths, N=61 at
l=0.84 mm.
