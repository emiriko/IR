Conformal Killing vectors (CKVs) preserve the spacetime metric up to a
factor. Homothetic vectors and Killing vectors are special cases of CKVs.
Classification of some classes of spacetimes on the basis of CKVs give
interesting results showing how homothetic and Killing vectors which form
subsets of the set of CKVs can be recovered as a result of the above
classification.
