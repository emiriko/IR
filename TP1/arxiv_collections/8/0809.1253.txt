We depict the use of x-ray diffraction as a tool to directly probe the strain
status in rolled-up semiconductor tubes. By employing continuum elasticity
theory and a simple model we are able to simulate quantitatively the strain
relaxation in perfect crystalline III-V semiconductor bi- and multilayers as
well as in rolled-up layers with dislocations. The reduction in the local
elastic energy is evaluated for each case. Limitations of the technique and
theoretical model are discussed in detail.
