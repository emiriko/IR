The conical structure around the away-side jets is discussed. The equations
of in-medium gluodynamics are proposed. Their classical lowest order solution
is explicitly shown for a color charge moving with constant speed. For nuclear
permittivity larger than 1 it describes the shock wave induced by emission of
Cherenkov gluons. The values of real and imaginary parts of nuclear
permittivity are estimated from fits of RHIC data. Specific effects at LHC
energies are described.
