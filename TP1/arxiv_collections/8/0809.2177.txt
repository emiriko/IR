We study the properties of a capacitive 13.56 MHz discharge properties with a
mixture of Ar/C2H2 taking into account the plasmochemistry and growth of heavy
hydrocarbons. A hybrid model was developed to combine the kinetic description
for electron motion and the fluid approach for negative and positive ions
transport and plasmochemical processes. A significant change of plasma
parameters related to injection of 5.8% portion of acetylene in argon was
observed and analyzed. We found that the electronegativity of the mixture is
about 30%. The densities of negatively and positively charged heavy
hydrocarbons are sufficiently large to be precursors for the formation of
nanoparticles in the discharge volume.
