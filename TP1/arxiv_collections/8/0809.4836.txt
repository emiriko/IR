These lectures review the large N Schwinger Bosons Mean Field approach to the
quantum Heisenberg model. The method applies to ordered and disordered phases
in all dimensions, at zero and at finite temperature. Extension to frustrated
models is explained. An example for an experimentally useful application, is
the temperature dependent staggered magnetization of the layered
antiferromagnet.
