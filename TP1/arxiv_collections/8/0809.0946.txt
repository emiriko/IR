In this paper we study two types of fibrations associated with a
3-dimensional unital associative irreducible algebra and their basic
properties. We investigate trivial principal fibrations of degenerate
semi-Euclidean sphere and their semi-conformal and projective models. We use
Norden normalization method for constructing second model.
