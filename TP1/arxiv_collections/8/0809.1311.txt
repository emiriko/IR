The reconstruction of f(R)-gravity is showed by using an auxiliary scalar
field in the context of cosmological evolution, this development provide a way
of reconstruct the form of the function f (R) for a given evolution of the
Hubble parameter. In analogy, f(R)-gravity may be expressed by a perfect fluid
with an inhomogeneous equation of state that depends on the Hubble parameter
and its derivatives. This mathematical equivalence that may confuse about the
origin of the mechanism that produces the current acceleration, and possibly
the whole evolution of the Hubble parameter, is shown here.
