We consider the natural Lie algebra structure on the (associative) group
algebra of a finite group $G$, and show that the Lie subalgebras associated to
natural involutive antiautomorphisms of this group algebra are reductive ones.
We give a decomposition in simple factors of these Lie algebras, in terms of
the ordinary representations of $G$.
