The SU(3) gauge theory with fermions in the sextet representation is one of
several theories of interest for technicolor models. We have carried out a
Schrodinger functional (SF) calculation for the lattice theory with two flavors
of Wilson fermions. We find that the discrete beta function changes sign when
the SF renormalized coupling is in the neighborhood of g^2 = 2.0, showing a
breakdown of the perturbative picture even though the coupling is weak. The
most straightforward interpretation is an infrared-stable fixed point.
