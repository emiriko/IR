We report a correlation between structural phase stability and magnetic
properties of Co2FeO4 spinel oxide. We employed mechanical alloying and
subsequent annealing to obtain the desired samples. The particle size of the
samples changes from 25 nm to 45 nm. The structural phase separation of
samples, except sample annealed at 9000C, into Co rich and Fe rich spinel phase
has been examined from XRD spectrum, SEM picture, along with EDAX spectrum, and
magnetic measurements. The present study indicated the ferrimagnetic character
of Co2FeO4, irrespective of structural phase stability. The observation of
mixed ferrimagnetic phases, associated with two Curie temperatures at TC1 and
TC2 (>TC1), respectively, provides the additional support of the splitting of
single cubic spinel phase in Co2FeO4 spinel oxide.
