We present a novel optical device based on an integrated system of
micro-lenses and single mode optical fibers. It allows to collect and direct
into many modes two photons generated by spontaneous parametric down
conversion. By this device multiqubit entangled states and/or multilevel
qu-$d$it states of two photons, encoded in the longitudinal momentum degree of
freedom, are created. The multi-path photon entanglement realized by this
device is expected to find important applications in modern quantum information
technology.
