We report on the triggered generation of indistinguishable photons by
solid-state single-photon sources in two separate cryogenic laser scanning
microscopes. Organic fluorescent molecules were used as emitters and
investigated by means of high resolution laser spectroscopy. Continuous-wave
photon correlation measurements on individual molecules proved the isolation of
single quantum systems. By using frequency selective pulsed excitation of the
molecule and efficient spectral filtering of its emission, we produced
triggered Fourier-limited single photons. In a further step, local electric
fields were applied to match the emission wavelengths of two different
molecules via Stark effect. Identical single photons are indispensible for the
realization of various quantum information processing schemes proposed. The
solid-state approach presented here prepares the way towards the integration of
multiple bright sources of single photons on a single chip.
