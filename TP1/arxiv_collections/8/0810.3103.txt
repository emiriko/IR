We consider Lotka-Volterra systems in three dimensions depending on three
real parameters. By using elementary algebraic methods we classify the Darboux
polynomials (also known as second integrals) for such systems for various
values of the parameters, and give the explicit form of the corresponding
cofactors. More precisely, we show that a Darboux polynomial of degree greater
than one is reducible. In fact, it is a product of linear Darboux polynomials
and first integrals.
