Considering the Cauchy problem for the modified Korteweg-de Vries-Burgers
equation $u_t+u_{xxx}+\epsilon |\partial_x|^{2\alpha}u=2(u^{3})_x, u(0)=\phi$,
where $0<\epsilon,\alpha\leq 1$ and $u$ is a real-valued function, we show that
it is uniformly globally well-posed in $H^s (s\geq1)$ for all $\epsilon \in
(0,1]$. Moreover, we prove that for any $s\geq 1$ and $T>0$, its solution
converges in $C([0,T]; H^s)$ to that of the MKdV equation if $\epsilon$ tends
to 0.
