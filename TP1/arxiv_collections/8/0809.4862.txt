We establish a theory for the existence and regularity of solutions to the
cohomological equation over an accessible, partially hyperbolic diffeomorphism.
As a by-product of our techniques, we show that for $r>1$, any $C^r$
homogeneous, locally compact submanifold of a $C^r$ manifold is in fact a $C^r$
submanifold.
