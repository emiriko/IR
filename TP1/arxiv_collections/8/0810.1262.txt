The current status of the reaction rate of $^{22}$Ne($\alpha$,n)$^{25}$Mg is
summarized. Among the latest new results, probably the most relevant is the
conclusion that the E$_x$=11.15 MeV state in $^{26}$Mg has a non-natural
parity, so it does not contribute to the rates of the $\alpha$ + $^{22}$Ne
reactions. However, it may be possible that other neighboring states contribute
to the neutron yield at stellar temperatures. Here we make an account of some
of the experimental work in the literature that is relevant to this state.
Indeed, it would have been possible to avoid the controversy regarding this
state before it even started.
