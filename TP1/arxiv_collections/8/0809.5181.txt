The renormalization-group theory of the d=3 tJ model is extended to
further-neighbor antiferromagnetic or electron-hopping interactions, including
the ranges of frustration. The global phase diagram of each model is calculated
for the entire ranges of temperatures, electron densities, and
further/first-neighbor interaction strength ratios. In addition to the
\tau_{tJ} phase seen in earlier studies of the nearest-neighbor d=3 tJ model,
the \tau_{Hb} phase seen before in the d=3 Hubbard model appears both near and
away from half-filling. These distinct \tau phases potentially correspond to
different (BEC-like and BCS-like) superconducting phases.
