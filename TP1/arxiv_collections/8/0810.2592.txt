A combined theoretical and experimental analysis of the normal modes of
three-dimensional spherially confined Yukawa clusters is presented. Particular
attention is paid to the breathing mode and the existence of multiple monopole
oscillations in Yukawa systems. Finally, the influence of dissipation on the
mode spectrum is investigated.
