A search for periodic gravitational-wave signals from isolated neutron stars
in the NAUTILUS detector data is presented. We have analyzed half a year of
data over the frequency band $<922.2; 923.2>$ Hz, the spindown range
$<-1.463\times10^{-8}; 0>$ Hz/s and over the entire sky. We have divided the
data into 2 day stretches and we have analyzed each stretch coherently using
matched filtering. We have imposed a low threshold for the optimal detection
statistic to obtain a set of candidates that are further examined for
coincidences among various data stretches. For some candidates we have also
investigated the change of the signal-to-noise ratio when we increase the
observation time from two to four days. Our analysis has not revealed any
gravitational-wave signals. Therefore we have imposed upper limits on the
dimensionless gravitational-wave amplitude over the parameter space that we
have searched. Depending on frequency, our upper limit ranges from $3.4 \times
10^{-23}$ to $1.3 \times 10^{-22}$. We have attempted a statistical
verification of the hypotheses leading to our conclusions. We estimate that our
upper limit is accurate to within 18%.
