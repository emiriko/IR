Model (BSM). ATLAS and CMS concentrate on B decays that can be registered by
a di-muon signature. B-hadrons decaying to J/psi(mumu) will statistically
dominate B-physics analyses allowing high precision measurements, in particular
a test of BSM effects in the CP violation of Bs-Jpsiphi. In the so-called rare
B-decay sector, ATLAS and CMS will concentrate on a family of semi-muonic
exclusive channels, b - s mumu and on the purely muonic decay Bs - mumu. After
three years of LHC running at a luminosity of a few times 1033 cm-2 s-1
(corresponding to 30 fb-1), each of these two experiments can measure the
Bs-mumu signal with 3 sigma significance, assuming the Standard Model (SM)
value for the decay probability.
