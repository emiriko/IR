Using data samples in excess of 1 fb^-1 collected by the CDF II detector we
present several world's best measurements of B hadron lifetimes. They include
B_s meson lifetime in a flavor-specific decay mode, combining fully and
partially reconstructed hadronic decays, B_c^+ meson lifetimes in semileptonic
B_c^+ -> J/psi l+ X, l+=mu+,e+ decays and Lambda_b baryon lifetime in
Lambda_c^+ pi- fully-reconstructed decays. In addition, we introduce a Monte
Carlo independent technique for measuring B hadron lifetimes in data samples
biased by displaced vertex triggers.
