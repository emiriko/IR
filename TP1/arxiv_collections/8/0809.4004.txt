We evaluate speculation about the possibility of a dangerous release of
energy within the liquid Helium of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) cryogenic
system due to the occurrence of a "Bose-Nova". Bose-Novae are radial bursts of
rapidly moving atoms which can occur when a Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC)
undergoes a collapse due the interatomic potential being deliberately made
attractive using a magnetic field close to the Feshbach resonance. Liquid 4He
has a monatomic structure with s-wave electrons, zero nuclear spin, no
hyperfine splitting, and as a consequence no Feshbach resonance which would
allow one to change its normally repulsive interactions to be attractive.
Because of this, a Bose-Nova style collapse of 4He is impossible. Additional
speculations concerning cold fusion during these events are easily dismissed
using the usual arguments about the Coulomb barrier at low temperatures, and
are not needed to explain the Bose-Einstein condensate Bose-Nova phenomenon. We
conclude that that there is no physics whatsoever which suggests that Helium
could undergo any kind of unforeseen catastrophic explosion.
