The parastatistics algebra is a superalgebra with (even) parafermi and (odd)
parabose creation and annihilation operators. The states in the parastatistics
Fock-like space are shown to be in one-to-one correspondence with the Super
Semistandard Young Tableaux (SSYT) subject to further constraints. The
deformation of the parastatistics algebra gives rise to a monoidal structure on
the SSYT which is a super-counterpart of the plactic monoid.
