Using the complex stereographic variable representation for the macrospin,
from a study of the nonlinear dynamics underlying the generalized
Landau-Lifshitz(LL) equation with Gilbert damping, we show that the
spin-transfer torque is effectively equivalent to an applied magnetic field. We
study the macrospin switching on a Stoner particle due to spin-transfer torque
on application of a spin polarized current. We find that the switching due to
spin-transfer torque is a more effective alternative to switching by an applied
external field in the presence of damping. We demonstrate numerically that a
spin-polarized current in the form of a short pulse can be effectively employed
to achieve the desired macro-spin switching.
