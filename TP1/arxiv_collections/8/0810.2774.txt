Much effort has been invested on effective-field-theoretical studies of the
near-threshold NN \to NN\pi reactions and, in order to deal with the rather
large three-momentum transfers involved, the momentum counting scheme was
proposed as an alternative to the usual Weinberg counting scheme. To examine
the practical utility of the momentum counting scheme, we study here the
contributions of higher-order terms to the pp\to pp\pi^0 reaction. We discuss
the consequences of the different treatments of the nucleon propagators in
these two counting schemes. We also investigate certain higher chiral-order
pion-rescattering terms and the five-point counter-term, which turn out to give
important contributions.
