Using the dual string theory, we study a circular baryonic configuration in a
wind of strongly coupled N=4 Yang-Mills plasma blowing in the plane of the
baryon, before and after a quark has dissociated from it. A simple enough model
that captures many interesting features is when there are four quarks in the
baryon. As a step towards phenomenology, we compare representative dissociated
configurations, and make some comments about their energetics and other
properties. Related results that we find include the observation that the
screening length formula L_s T ~ (1-v^2)^{1/4} obtained previously for other
color singlet configurations, is robust for circular baryons as well.
