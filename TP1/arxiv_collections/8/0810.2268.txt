A global study of the electric dipole strength in and below the isovector
giant dipole resonance (GDR) is presented for mass numbers A>80. It relies on
the recently established remarkably good match between data for the nuclear
photo effect to novel photon scattering data covering the region below the
neutron emission threshold as well as by average resonance neutron capture
(ARC). From the wide energy coverage of these data the correlation of the GDR
spreading width with energy can be studied with remarkable accuracy. A clear
sensitivity to details of the nuclear shape, i.e. the beta- and
gamma-deformations, is demonstrated. Based hereon a new parameterization of the
energy dependence of the nuclear electric-dipole strength is proposed which -
with only two new parameters - allows to describe the dipole strength in all
heavy nuclei with A>80. Although it differs significantly from previous
parameterizations it holds for spherical, transitional, triaxial and well
deformed nuclei. The GDR spreading width depends in a regular way on the
respective resonance energy, but it is independent of the photon energy.
