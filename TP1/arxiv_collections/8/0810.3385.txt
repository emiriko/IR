The formation of atomic nanoclusters on suspended graphene sheets have been
investigated by employing a Molecular dynamics simulation at finite
temperature. Our systematic study is based on temperature dependent Molecular
dynamics simulations of some transition and alkali atoms on suspended graphene
sheets. We find that the transition atoms aggregate and make various size
nanoclusters distributed randomly on graphene surface. We also report that most
alkali atoms make one atomic layer on graphene sheets. Interestingly, the
potassium atoms almost deposit regularly on the surface at low temperature. We
expect from this behavior that the electrical conductivity of a suspended
graphene doped by potassium atoms would be much higher than the case doped by
the other atoms at low temperature.
