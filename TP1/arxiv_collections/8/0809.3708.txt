We discuss how the CMS and ATLAS experiments are preparing for the analysis
of first LHC data with emphasis on the search for supersymmetry. We will show
the importance of the understanding of detector, trigger, reconstruction and
backgrounds, and we will present realistic estimates of the reach of CMS and
ATLAS.
