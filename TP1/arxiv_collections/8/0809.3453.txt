In the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (the MSSM), the electroweak
symmetry is restored as supersymmetry-breaking terms are turned off. We
describe a generic extension of the MSSM where the electroweak symmetry is
broken in the supersymmetric limit. We call this limit the "sEWSB" phase, short
for supersymmetric electroweak symmetry breaking. We define this phase in an
effective field theory that only contains the MSSM degrees of freedom. The
sEWSB vacua naturally have an inverted scalar spectrum, where the heaviest
CP-even Higgs state has Standard Model-like couplings to the massive vector
bosons; experimental constraints in the scalar Higgs sector are more easily
satisfied than in the MSSM.
