We evaluate the mixed partition function for dyonic BPS black holes using the
recently proposed degeneracy formula for the STU model. The result factorizes
into the OSV mixed partition function times a proportionality factor. The
latter is in agreement with the measure factor that was recently conjectured
for a class of N=2 black holes that contains the STU model.
