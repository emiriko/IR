We study a holographic model of a relativistic quantum system with a global
U(1) symmetry, at non-zero temperature and density. When the temperature falls
below a critical value, we find a second-order superfluid phase transition with
mean-field critical exponents. In the symmetry-broken phase, we determine the
speed of second sound as a function of temperature. As the velocity of the
superfluid component relative to the normal component increases, the superfluid
transition goes through a tricritical point and becomes first-order.
