We study an extended two-dimensional Shastry-Sutherland model in a magnetic
field where besides the usual Heisenberg exchanges of the Shastry-Sutherland
model two additional SU(2) invariant couplings are included. Perturbative
continous unitary transformations are used to determine the leading order
effects of the additional couplings on the pure hopping and on the long-range
interactions between the triplons which are the most relevant terms for small
magnetization. We then compare the energy of various magnetization plateaux in
the classical limit and we discuss the implications for the two-dimensional
quantum magnet SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$.
