By using sheaf-theoretical methods such as constructible sheaves, we
generalize the formula of Libgober-Sperber concerning the zeta functions of
monodromy at infinity of polynomial maps into various directions. In
particular, some formulas for the zeta functions of global monodromy along the
fibers of bifurcation points of polynomial maps will be obtained.
