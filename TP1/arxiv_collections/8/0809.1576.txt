The spin polarization P of the transport current through the interface
between superconducting Al and ferromagnetic Fe is determined by means of
Andreev reflection at nanostructured point contacts. We observe a systematic
decrease of P with decreasing contact resistance. Our data provide evidence for
the reduction of P by spin-orbit scattering and thus establish a link between
density-of-states and transport spin polarizations.
