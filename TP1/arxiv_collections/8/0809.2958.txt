In the spirit of a classical results for Crump-Mode-Jagers processes, we
prove a strong law of large numbers for homogenous fragmentation processes.
Specifically, for self-similar fragmentation processes, including homogenous
processes, we prove the almost sure convergence of an empirical measure
associated with the stopping line corresponding to first fragments of size
strictly smaller than $\eta$ for $1\geq \eta >0$.
