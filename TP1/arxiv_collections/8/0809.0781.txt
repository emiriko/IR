We write out the generic Dirac neutrino mass operator which possesses the
Friedberg-Lee (FL) symmetry and find that its corresponding neutrino mass
matrix is asymmetric. Following a simple way to break the FL symmetry, we
calculate the neutrino mass eigenvalues and show that the resultant neutrino
mixing pattern is nearly tri-bimaximal. Imposing the Hermitian condition on the
neutrino mass matrix, we also show that the simplified ansatz is consistent
with current experimental data and favors the normal neutrino mass hierarchy.
