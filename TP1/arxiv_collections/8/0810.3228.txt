We investigate the resolution and absorption losses of a Ag/GaP multilayer
superlens. For a fixed source to image distance the resolution is independent
of the position of the lens but the losses depend strongly on the lens
placement. The absorption losses associated with the evanescent waves can be
significantly larger than losses associated with the propagating waves
especially when the superlens is close to the source. The interpretation of
transmittance values greater than unity for evanescent waves is clarified with
respect to the associated absorption losses.
