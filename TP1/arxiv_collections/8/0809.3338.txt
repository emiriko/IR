In this letter, the first spin noise spectroscopy measurements in
semiconductor systems of reduced effective dimensionality are reported. The
non-demolition measurement technique gives access to the otherwise concealed
intrinsic, low temperature electron spin relaxation time of n-doped GaAs (110)
quantum wells and to the corresponding low temperature anisotropic spin
relaxation. The Brownian motion of the electrons within the spin noise probe
laser spot becomes manifest in a modification of the spin noise line width.
Thereby, the spatially resolved observation of the stochastic spin polarization
uniquely allows to study electron dynamics at equilibrium conditions with a
vanishing total momentum of the electron system.
