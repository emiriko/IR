We consider B3 mSUGRA models where we have one lepton number violating LQD
operator at the GUT scale. This can alter the supersymmetric mass spectrum
leading to a sneutrino as the lightest supersymmetric particle in a large
region of parameter space. We take into account the restrictions from neutrino
masses, the muon anomalous magnetic moment, b -> s gamma and other precision
measurements. We furthermore investigate existing restrictions from direct
searches at LEP, the Tevatron and the CERN p\bar p collider. We then give
examples for characteristic signatures at the LHC.
