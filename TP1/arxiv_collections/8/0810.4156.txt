We theoretically investigate the absorption and emission of light carrying
orbital angular momentum (twisted-light) by quasi-two-dimensional (disc-shaped)
quantum dots in the presence of a static magnetic field. We calculate the
transition matrix element for the light-matter interaction and use it to
explore different scenarios, depending on the initial and final state of the
electron undergoing the optically-induced transition. We make explicit the
selection rule for the conservation of the z-projection of the orbital angular
momentum. For a realistic set of parameters (quantum dots size, beam waist,
photon energy, etc.) the strength of the transition induced by twisted light is
10% of that induced by plane-waves. Finally, our analysis indicates that it may
be possible to select precisely the electronic level one wishes to populate
using the appropriate combination of light-beam parameters suggesting
technological applications to the quantum control of electronic states in
quantum dots.
