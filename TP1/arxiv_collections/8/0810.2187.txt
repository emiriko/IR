We present our study of the hadronization structure of both vector and
axial-vector currents leading to decays of the tau into two kaons and a pion.
The cornerstones of our framework are the large-N_C limit of QCD, the chiral
structure exhibited at low energies and the proper asymptotic behaviour, ruled
by QCD, that is demanded to the associated form factors. The couplings of the
theory are mostly constrained by this procedure and upon the analysis of BaBar
data on e^+e^- -> KK pi we are able to predict the hadronic spectra.
