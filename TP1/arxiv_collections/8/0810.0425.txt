We prove explicit Harris-Kudla type formulas for triples of Maass forms,
holomorphic forms, and combinations thereof, on the hyperbolic plane modulo
congruence groups and co-compact lattices arising from Eichler orders of
quaternion algebras. These formulas relate the central value of the
corresponding Rankin triple product L-function to a squared trilinear period
integral. Assuming subconvexity estimates for these L-values, we prove Quantum
Unique Ergodicity on such quotients; the relevant Lindelof hypotheses imply a
quantitative form of QUE, with an optimal rate. In connection with the
Berry/Hejhal Random Wave conjecture, we prove decay of third moments in the
high energy limit, making use of a subconvexity result of Iwaniec/Ivic/Jutila
and Kim-Shahidi's result on cuspidality of the symmetric cube.
