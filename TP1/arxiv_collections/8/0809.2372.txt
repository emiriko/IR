Fermilab operates the world's most intense antiproton source. Newly proposed
experiments can use those antiprotons either parasitically during Tevatron
Collider running or after the Tevatron Collider finishes in about 2010. In
particular, the annihilation of 8 GeV antiprotons might make the world's most
intense source of tagged $D^0$ mesons, and thus the best near-term opportunity
to study charm mixing and, via CP violation, to search for new physics; a
Penning trap and atom interferometer could be used to measure for the first
time the gravitational force on antimatter.
