Global One--Dimensional Quantum General Relativity is the toy model with
nontrivial field theoretical content, describing classical one-dimensional
massive bosonic fields related to any 3+1 metric, where the dimension is a
volume of three-dimensional embedding. In fact it constitutes the
midisuperspatial Quantum Gravity model. We use one-particle density operator
method in order to building macrostates thermodynamics related with any 3+1
metric. Taking the Boltzmann gas limit, which is given by the energy
equipartition law for the Bose-Einstein gas of space quantum states generated
from the Bogoliubov vacuum, we receive consistent with General Relativity
thermodynamical degrees of freedom number. It confirms that the proposed
Quantum Gravity toy model has well-defined classical limit in accordance with
classical gravity theory.
