We report measurements of the phonon density-of-states in iron oxypnictide
superconductors by inelastic x-ray scattering. A good agreement with ab-initio
calculations that do not take into account strong electronic correlations is
found, and an unpredicted softening of phonon branches under F doping of these
compounds is observed. Raman scattering experiments lead us to conclude that
this softening is not related to zone center phonons, and consequently imply an
important softening of the relevant phonon branches at finite momentum transfer
