Within the context of Born-Infeld (BI) nonlinear electrodynamics (NED) we
revisit the non-relativistic, spinless H-atom. The pair potential computed from
the Born-Infeld equations is approximated by the Morse type potential with
remarkable fit over the critical region where the convergence of both the short
and long distance expansions slows down dramatically. The Morse potential is
employed to determine both the ground state energy of the electron and the BI
parameter.
