The effects of charge and finite 't Hooft coupling correction on drag force
and jet quenching parameter are investigated. To study charge effect and finite
't Hooft coupling correction, we consider Maxwell charge and Gauss-Bonnet
terms, respectively. The background is Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m-AdS black brane
solution in Gauss-Bonnet gravity. It is shown that these corrections affect
drag force and jet quenching parameter. We find an analytic solution of drag
force in this background which depends on Gauss-Bonnet coupling and charge. We
set Gauss-Bonnet coupling to be zero and find drag force in the case of
Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m-AdS background. Also we discuss the relaxation time of a
moving heavy quark in this gravity background.
