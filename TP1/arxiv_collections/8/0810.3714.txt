We study nonlinear modes in subwavelength slot waveguides created by a
nonlinear dielectric slab sandwiched between two metals. We present the
dispersion diagrams of the families of nonlinear plasmonic modes and reveal
that the symmetric mode undergoes the symmetry-breaking bifurcation with the
energy primarily localized near one of the interfaces. We also find that the
antisymmetric mode may split into two brunches giving birth to two families of
nonlinear antisymmetric modes.
