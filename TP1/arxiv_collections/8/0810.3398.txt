We consider traveling fronts to the nonlocal bistable equation. We do not
assume that the Borel-measure is absolutely continuous with respect to the
Lebesgue measure. We show that there is a traveling wave solution with monotone
profile. In order to prove this result, we would develop a recursive method for
abstract monotone dynamical systems and apply it to the equation.
