The thermal fluctations of vortices in a superconductor can be usefully
mapped onto the quantum fluctations of a collection of bosons at T=0 moving in
2 dimensions. When the superconductor is a thin platelet with the magnetic
field parallel to its surface, the interacting quantum bosons are effectively
moving in 1 dimension, allowing for powerful Luttinger liquid methods to be
applied. Here we consider how this 1 dimensional limit is approached, studying
the interaction of vortices with the platelet surfaces and each other. Using
realistic parameters and vortex interactions for an underdoped YBCO platelet we
determine the scattering length, a, characterizing the low energy interaction
of a vortex pair as a function of the platelet thickness. a determines the
Luttinger parameter, g, for the quantum system at low densities, n_0: g ->
1-2an_0.
