Entanglement swapping allows to establish entanglement between independent
particles that never interacted nor share any common past. This feature makes
it an integral constituent of quantum repeaters. Here, we demonstrate
entanglement swapping with time-synchronized independent sources with a
fidelity high enough to violate a Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality by more
than four standard deviations. The fact that both entangled pairs are created
by fully independent, only electronically connected sources ensures that this
technique is suitable for future long-distance quantum communication
experiments as well as for novel tests on the foundations of quantum physics.
