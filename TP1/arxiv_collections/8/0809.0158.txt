Inference of the network structure (e.g., routing topology) and dynamics
(e.g., link performance) is an essential component in many network design and
management tasks. In this paper we propose a new, general framework for
analyzing and designing routing topology and link performance inference
algorithms using ideas and tools from phylogenetic inference in evolutionary
biology. The framework is applicable to a variety of measurement techniques.
Based on the framework we introduce and develop several polynomial-time
distance-based inference algorithms with provable performance. We provide
sufficient conditions for the correctness of the algorithms. We show that the
algorithms are consistent (return correct topology and link performance with an
increasing sample size) and robust (can tolerate a certain level of measurement
errors). In addition, we establish certain optimality properties of the
algorithms (i.e., they achieve the optimal $l_\infty$-radius) and demonstrate
their effectiveness via model simulation.
