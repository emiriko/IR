We introduce three compact graph states that can be used to perform a
measurement-based Toffoli gate. Given a weighted graph of six, seven or eight
qubits, we show that success probabilities of 1/4, 1/2 and 1 respectively can
be achieved. Our study puts a measurement-based version of this important
quantum logic gate within the reach of current experiments. As the graphs are
setup-independent, they could be realized in a variety of systems, including
linear optics and ion-traps.
