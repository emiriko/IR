We study duals to field theories in two dimensions with N=(4,4) SUSY. The
string backgrounds reproduce certain non-perturbative aspects of the dual field
theory with a large number of colors N_c and a tunable number of flavors N_f.
Different aspects of the two-dimensional field theory are discussed, among them
the running of gauge couplings, the spectrum of mesons in Higgs and Coulomb
branches, entanglement entropy and the non-relativistic version of our string
backgrounds.
