We derive logarithmically enhanced two-loop virtual electroweak corrections
for arbitrary fermion-scattering processes at the TeV scale. This extends
results previously obtained for massless fermion scattering to processes that
involve also bottom and top quarks. The contributions resulting from soft,
collinear, and ultraviolet singularities in the complete electroweak Standard
Model are explicitly extracted from two-loop diagrams to
next-to-leading-logarithmic accuracy including all effects associated with
symmetry breaking and Yukawa interactions.
