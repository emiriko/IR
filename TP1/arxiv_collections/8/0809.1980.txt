We investigate which chordal graphs have a representation as intersection
graphs of pseudosegments. For positive we have a construction which shows that
all chordal graphs that can be represented as intersection graph of subpaths on
a tree are pseudosegment intersection graphs. We then study the limits of
representability. We describe a family of intersection graphs of substars of a
star which is not representable as intersection graph of pseudosegments. The
degree of the substars in this example, however, has to get large. A more
intricate analysis involving a Ramsey argument shows that even in the class of
intersection graphs of substars of degree three of a star there are graphs that
are not representable as intersection graph of pseudosegments.
  Motivated by representability questions for chordal graphs we consider how
many combinatorially different k-segments, i.e., curves crossing k distinct
lines, an arrangement of n pseudolines can host. We show that for fixed k this
number is in O(n^2). This result is based on a k-zone theorem for arrangements
of pseudolines that should be of independent interest.
