We show using a realistic Hamiltonian-type model that definite outcomes of
quantum measurements may emerge from quantum evolution of pure states, i.e
quantum dynamics provides a deterministic collapse of the wavefunction in a
quantum measurement process. The relaxation of the wavefunction into a pointer
state with classical properties is driven by the interaction with an
environment. The destruction of superpositions, i.e. choosing a preferred
attraction basin and thereby a preferred pointer state, is caused by a tiny
nonlinearity in the macroscopic measurement apparatus. In more details, we
numerically studied the many-body quantum dynamics of a closed Universe
consisting of a system spin measured by a ferromagnet embedded in a spin-glass
environment. The nonlinear term is the self-induced magnetic field of the
ferromagnet. The statistics for the outcomes of this quantum measurement
process depends on the size of the attraction basins in the measurement
apparatus and are in accordance to Born's rule.
