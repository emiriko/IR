Vector Schwinger model with a mass term for the photon, describing 2D
electrodyn amics with massless fermions, studied by us recently, represents a
new class of models. This theory becomes gauge-invariant when studied on the
light-front. Thi s is in contrast to the instant-form theory which is
gauge-noninvariant. We quan tize this theory on the light-front.
