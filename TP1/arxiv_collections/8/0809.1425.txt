We develop an Effective Medium Theory to study the electrical transport
properties of disordered graphene. The theory includes non-linear screening and
exchange-correlation effects allowing us to consider experimentally relevant
strengths of the Coulomb interaction. Assuming random Coulomb impurities, we
calculate the electrical conductivity as a function of gate voltage describing
quantitatively the full cross-over from the fluctuations dominated regime
around the Dirac point to the large doping regime at high gate voltages. We
find that the conductivity at the Dirac point is strongly affected by exchange
correlation effects.
