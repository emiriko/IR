We have prototyped a "spreadsheet component repository" Web site, from which
users can copy "components" into their own Excel or Google spreadsheets.
Components are collections of cells containing formulae: in real life, they
would do useful calculations that many practitioners find hard to program, and
would be rigorously tested and documented. Crucially, the user can tell the
repository which cells in their spreadsheet to use for a componen's inputs and
outputs. The repository will then reshape the component to fit. A single
component can therefore be used in many different sizes and shapes of
spreadsheet. We hope to set up a spreadsheet equivalent of the high-quality
numerical subroutine libraries that revolutionised scientific computing, but
where instead of subroutines, the library contains such components.
