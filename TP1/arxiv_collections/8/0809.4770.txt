We show that the exactly solved low-temperature branch of the two-dimensional
O($n$) model is equivalent with an O($n$) model with vacancies and a different
value of $n$. We present analytic results for several universal parameters of
the latter model, which is identified as a tricritical point. These results
apply to the range $n \leq 3/2$, and include the exact tricritical point, the
conformal anomaly and a number of scaling dimensions, among which the thermal
and magnetic exponent, the exponent associated with crossover to ordinary
critical behavior, and to tricritical behavior with cubic symmetry. We describe
the translation of the tricritical model in a Coulomb gas. The results are
verified numerically by means of transfer-matrix calculations. We use a
generalized ADE model as an intermediary, and present the expression of the
one-point distribution function in that language. The analytic calculations are
done both for the square and the hexagonal lattice.
