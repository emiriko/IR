We describe observations of a novel hysteresis behavior in the growth of ice
crystals under near-vacuum conditions. Above a threshold supersaturation, we
find that the ice growth rate often exhibits a sudden increase that we
attribute to an impurity-driven growth instability. We examine possible
mechanisms for this instability, which can be used to produce clean, faceted
ice surfaces.
