The paper introduces in a new although maybe unusual form the examples of
types provided by J. von Neumann and F.J. Murray in their outstanding papers on
algebraic factorization (1936-1943)pursuing three main aims: speculating about
the physical reasons and motivations that are likely to have been at the origin
of von Neumann's investigation; describing the examples of factors provided by
those authors with the purpose of clarifying the general concepts standing at
the base of the classification of factors into three general types; outlining
the perspective of extending the theory to non--separable Hilbert spaces with
the purpose of suggesting a novel approach to the representation of infinite
systems controlled by external gauge fields.
