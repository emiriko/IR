We study the thermal and electric transport of a fluid of interacting Dirac
fermions as they arise in single-layer graphene. We include Coulomb
interactions, a dilute density of charged impurities and the presence of a
magnetic field to describe both the static and the low frequency response as a
function of temperature T and chemical potential mu. In the critical regime mu
<< T where both bands above and below the Dirac point contribute to transport
we find pronounced deviations from Fermi liquid behavior, universal,
collision-dominated values for transport coefficients and a cyclotron resonance
of collective nature. In the collision-dominated high temperature regime the
linear thermoelectric transport coefficients are shown to obey the constraints
of relativistic magnetohydrodynamics which we derive microscopically from
Boltzmann theory. The latter also allows us to describe the crossover to
disorder-dominated Fermi liquid behavior at large doping and low temperatures,
as well as the crossover to the ballistic regime at high fields.
