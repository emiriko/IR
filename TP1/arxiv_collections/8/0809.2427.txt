We study Coxeter diagrams of some unitary reflection groups. Using solely the
combinatorics of diagrams, we give a new proof of the classification of root
lattices defined over $\cE = \ZZ[e^{2 \pi i/3}]$: there are only four such
lattices, namely, the $\cE$-lattices whose real forms are $A_2$, $D_4$, $E_6$
and $E_8$. Next, we address the issue of characterizing the diagrams for
unitary reflection groups, a question that was raised by Brou\'{e}, Malle and
Rouquier. To this end, we describe an algorithm which, given a unitary
reflection group $G$, picks out a set of complex reflections. The algorithm is
based on an analogy with Weyl groups. If $G$ is a Weyl group, the algorithm
immediately yields a set of simple roots. Experimentally we observe that if $G$
is primitive and $G$ has a set of roots whose $\ZZ$--span is a discrete subset
of the ambient vector space, then the algorithm selects a minimal generating
set for $G$. The group $G$ has a presentation on these generators such that if
we forget that the generators have finite order then we get a (Coxeter-like)
presentation of the corresponding braid group. For some groups, such as
$G_{33}$ and $G_{34}$, new diagrams are obtained. For $G_{34}$, our new diagram
extends to an "affine diagram" with $\ZZ/7\ZZ$ symmetry.
