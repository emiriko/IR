We propose a potentially practical scheme for realization of an n-qubit (n>2)
conditional phase flip (CPF) gate and implementation of Grover search algorithm
in the ion-trap system. We demonstrate both analytically and numerically that,
our scheme could be achieved efficiently to find a marked state with high
fidelity and high success probability. We also show the merits of the proposal
that the increase of the ion number can improve the fidelity and the success
probability of the CPF gate. The required operations for Grover search are very
close to the capabilities of current ion-trap techniques.
