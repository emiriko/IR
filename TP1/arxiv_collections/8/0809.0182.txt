We propose a second renormalization group method to handle the tensor-network
states or models. This method reduces dramatically the truncation error of the
tensor renormalization group. It allows physical quantities of classical
tensor-network models or tensor-network ground states of quantum systems to be
accurately and efficiently determined.
