Photoluminescence data from single, self-assembled InAs/InP quantum dots in
magnetic fields up to 7 T are presented. Exciton g-factors are obtained for
dots of varying height, corresponding to ground state emission energies ranging
from 780 meV to 1100 meV. A monotonic increase of the g-factor from -2 to +1.2
is observed as the dot height decreases. The trend is well reproduced by sp3
tight binding calculations, which show that the hole g-factor is sensitive to
confinement effects through orbital angular momentum mixing between the
light-hole and heavy-hole valence bands. We demonstrate tunability of the
exciton g-factor by manipulating the quantum dot dimensions using pyramidal InP
nanotemplates.
