An efficient computer algorithm is described for the perspective drawing of a
wide class of surfaces. The class includes surfaces corresponding lo
single-valued, continuous functions which are defined over rectangular domains.
The algorithm automatically computes and eliminates hidden lines. The number of
computations in the algorithm grows linearly with the number of sample points
on the surface to be drawn. An analysis of the algorithm is presented, and
extensions lo certain multi-valued functions are indicated. The algorithm is
implemented and tested on .Net 2.0 platform that left interactive use. Running
times are found lo be exceedingly efficient for visualization, where
interaction on-line and view-point control, enables effective and rapid
examination of a surfaces from many perspectives.
