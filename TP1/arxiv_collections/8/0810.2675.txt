The status of W and Z cross-section and width measurements from the CDF and
D0 experiments is reviewed. Recent results that are discussed: the
cross-section for Z production times the branching ratio to tau pairs, the
rapidity and transverse momentum distributions of Z production in the electron
channel, and the direct measurements of the W width and the Z invisible width;
the latter from an analysis of events with large missing transverse energy and
one or more energetic jets.
