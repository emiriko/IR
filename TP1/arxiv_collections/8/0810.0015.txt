Experiments in bulk water confirm the existence of two local arrangements of
water molecules with different densities, but, because of inevitable freezing
at low temperature $T$, can not ascertain whether the two arrangements separate
in two phases. To avoid the freezing, new experiments measure the dynamics of
water at low $T$ on the surface of proteins, finding a crossover from a
non-Arrhenius regime at high $T$ to a regime that is approximately Arrhenius at
low $T$. Motivated by these experiments, Kumar et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 100,
105701 (2008)] investigated, by Monte Carlo simulations and mean field
calculations, the relation of the dynamic crossover with the coexistence of two
liquid phases in a cell model for water and predict that: (i) the dynamic
crossover is isochronic, i.e. the value of the crossover time $\tau_{\rm L}$ is
approximately independent of pressure $P$; (ii) the Arrhenius activation energy
$E_{\rm A}(P)$ of the low-$T$ regime decreases upon increasing $P$; (iii) the
temperature $T^*(P)$ at which $\tau$ reaches a fixed macroscopic time
$\tau^*\geq \tau_{\rm L}$ decreases upon increasing $P$; in particular, this is
true also for the crossover temperature $T_{\rm L}(P)$ at which $\tau=\tau_{\rm
L}$. Here, we compare these predictions with recent quasi elastic neutron
scattering (QENS) experiments performed by X.-Q. Chu {\it et al.} on hydrated
proteins at different values of $P$. We find that the experiments are
consistent with these three predictions.
