Two-dimensional graphene, carbon nanotubes and graphene nanoribbons represent
a novel class of low dimensional materials that could serve as building blocks
for future carbon-based nanoelectronics. Although these systems share a similar
underlying electronic structure, whose exact details depend on confinement
effects, crucial differences emerge when disorder comes into play. In this
short review, we consider the transport properties of these materials, with
particular emphasis to the case of graphene nanoribbons. After summarizing the
electronic and transport properties of defect-free systems, we focus on the
effects of a model disorder potential (Anderson-type), and illustrate how
transport properties are sensitive to the underlying symmetry. We provide
analytical expressions for the elastic mean free path of carbon nanotubes and
graphene nanoribbons, and discuss the onset of weak and strong localization
regimes, which are genuinely dependent on the transport dimensionality. We also
consider the effects of edge disorder and roughness for graphene nanoribbons in
relation to their armchair or zigzag orientation.
