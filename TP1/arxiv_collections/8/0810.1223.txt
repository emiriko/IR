Main aim of this topical issue is to report recent advances in noisy
nonequilibrium processes useful to describe the dynamics of ecological systems
and to address the mechanisms of spatio-temporal pattern formation in ecology
both from the experimental and theoretical points of view. This is in order to
understand the dynamical behaviour of ecological complex systems through the
interplay between nonlinearity, noise, random and periodic environmental
interactions. Discovering the microscopic rules and the local interactions
which lead to the emergence of specific global patterns or global dynamical
behaviour and the noises role in the nonlinear dynamics is an important, key
aspect to understand and then to model ecological complex systems.
