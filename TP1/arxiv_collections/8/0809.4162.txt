The electronic shell structure of triangular, hexagonal and round graphene
quantum dots (flakes) near the Fermi level has been studied using a
tight-binding method. The results show that close to the Fermi level the shell
structure of a triangular flake is that of free massless particles, and that
triangles with an armchair edge show an additional sequence of levels ("ghost
states"). These levels result from the graphene band structure and the plane
wave solution of the wave equation, and they are absent for triangles with an
zigzag edge. All zigzag triangles exhibit a prominent edge state at the Fermi
level, and few low-energy conduction electron states occur both in triangular
and hexagonal flakes due to symmetry reasons. Armchair triangles can be used as
building blocks for other types of flakes that support the ghost states. Edge
roughness has only a small effect on the level structure of the triangular
flakes, but the effect is considerably enhanced in the other types of flakes.
In round flakes, the states near the Fermi level depend strongly on the flake
radius, and they are always localized on the zigzag parts of the edge.
