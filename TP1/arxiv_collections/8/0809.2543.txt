We analyze the electronic properties of a simple stacking defect in Bernal
graphite. We show that a bound state forms, which disperses as $|\bfk-\bfK|^3$
in the vicinity of either of the two inequivalent zone corners $\bfK$. In the
presence of a strong c-axis magnetic field, this bound state develops a Landau
level structure which for low energies behaves as $E\nd_n\propto |n B|^{3/2}$.
We show that buried stacking faults have observable consequences for surface
spectroscopy, and we discuss the implications for the three-dimensional quantum
Hall effect (3DQHE). We also analyze the Landau level structure and chiral
surface states of rhombohedral graphite, and show that, when doped, it should
exhibit multiple 3DQHE plateaus at modest fields.
