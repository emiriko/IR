A steady horizontal air stream flows across a book clamped at its downstream
end. Pages lift off to form a growing bent stack whose shape is determined by
the torques associated with aerodynamic forces, weight and elastic resistance
to bending. As more pages lift off to join the bent stack, the increasing
importance of bending rigidity to dynamic pressure eventually causes the book
to clap shut. The process restarts, and self-sustained oscillations emerge.
