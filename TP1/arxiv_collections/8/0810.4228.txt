The overlap Dirac operator at nonzero quark chemical potential involves the
computation of the sign function of a non-Hermitian matrix. In this talk we
present iterative Krylov subspace approximations, with deflation of critical
eigenvalues, which we developed to compute the operator on large lattices. We
compare the accuracy and efficiency of two alternative approximations based on
the Arnoldi and on the two-sided Lanczos method. The short recurrences used in
the latter method make it faster and more effective for realistic lattice
simulations.
