The quantum gravitational contribution to the renormalization group behavior
of the electric charge in Einstein-Maxwell theory with a cosmological constant
is considered. Quantum gravity is shown to lead to a contribution to the
running charge not present when the cosmological constant vanishes. This
re-opens the possibility, suggested by Robinson and Wilczek, of altering the
scaling behaviour of gauge theories at high energies although our result
differs. We show the possibility of an ultraviolet fixed point that is linked
directly to the cosmological constant.
