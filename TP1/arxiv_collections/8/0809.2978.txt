We present an algorithm for computing a Smith form with multipliers of a
regular matrix polynomial over a field. This algorithm differs from previous
ones in that it computes a local Smith form for each irreducible factor in the
determinant separately and then combines them into a global Smith form, whereas
other algorithms apply a sequence of unimodular row and column operations to
the original matrix. The performance of the algorithm in exact arithmetic is
reported for several test cases.
