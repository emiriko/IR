We report the emission of strong coherent broadband terahertz radiation from
6H-Silicon-Carbide (SiC) excited with optical pulses. The measured terahertz
spectral signal-to-noise ratio is better than one thousand. We determine that
the terahertz radiation is generated via second order optical nonlinearity
(optical rectification). We present a measurement of the ratio of nonlinear
susceptibility tensor elements $\chi_{zzz}^{(2)}/\chi_{zxx}^{(2)}$ and the
complex index of refraction of silicon carbide at THz frequencies.
