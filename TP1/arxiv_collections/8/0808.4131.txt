The paper shows that silicon-based 2D photonic crystal can be a promising
material for acoustooptical devices. Isotropic and anisotropic Bragg
diffraction of light in photonic crystal is considered. The computational
method for calculation of frequency dependences of Bragg angle is developed. A
simple method of optimization of photonic crystal parameters to obtain Bragg
diffraction at necessary light and sound frequency is suggested.
