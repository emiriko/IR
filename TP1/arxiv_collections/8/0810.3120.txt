We present a many-body calculation for the conductance of a conducting bridge
of a simple hydrogen molecule between $Pt$ electrodes.The experimental results
showed that the conductance $G=dI/dV$ has the maximum value near the quantum
unit $G_{0}=2e^{2}/h$.
  The $I-V$ dependence presents peak and dip and we consider that the
electron-phonon interaction is responsible for this behavior. At T=0 there is a
step in this dependence for the energy of phonons $\omega_{0}$ which satisfies
$eV=\omega_{0}$. We calculated the conductance at finite temperature and showed
that $dG(T)/dV\propto 1/4T\cosh^{2}\frac{eV-\omega_{0}}{2T}$.
