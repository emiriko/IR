We present an accurate implementation of total energy calculations into the
local density approximation plus dynamical mean-field theory (LDA+DMFT) method.
The electronic structure problem is solved through the full potential linear
Muffin-Tin Orbital (FP-LMTO) and Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker (FP-KKR) methods with a
perturbative solver for the effective impurity suitable for moderately
correlated systems. We have tested the method in detail for the case of Ni and
investigated the sensitivity of the results to the computational scheme and to
the complete self-consistency. It is demonstrated that the LDA+DMFT method can
resolve a long-standing controversy between the LDA/GGA density functional
approach and experiment for equilibrium lattice constant and bulk modulus of
Mn.
