We study the dynamical response of a circularly-driven rigid body, focusing
on the description of intrinsic rotational behavior (reverse rotations). The
model system we address is integrable but nontrivial, allowing for qualitative
and quantitative analysis. A scale free expression defining the separation
between possible spinning regimes is obtained.
