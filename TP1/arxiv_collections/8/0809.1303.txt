Our previous paper \cite{MFNEW} is generalized within the field theoretical
formulation with the quark degrees of freedom \cite{HW,H,N,Z}, where pions and
nucleons are treated as the bound systems of quarks. It is shown that relations
generated by current conservation for the on shell $\pi N$ bremsstrahlung
amplitude with composite nucleons and pions have the same form as in the usual
quantum field theory \cite{IZ,BD} without quark degrees of freedom
\cite{MFNEW}. Consequently, the model independent relations for the magnetic
dipole moments of the $\Delta^+$ and $\Delta^{++}$ resonances in \cite{MFNEW}
remain be the same in the quantum field theory with the quark degrees of
freedom. These relations are extended for the magnetic dipole moments of the
$\Delta^o$ and $\Delta^-$ resonances which are determined via the anomalous
magnetic moment of the neutron $\mu_n$ as $\mu_{\Delta^o}={{M_{\Delta}}\over
{m_p}} \mu_n$ and $\mu_{\Delta^{-}}={3\over 2}\mu_{\Delta^o}$.
