Motivated by the possibility of the formation of CP-odd domains in heavy ion
collisions, we investigate the effects of CP violation on the chiral transition
within the linear sigma model with two flavors of quarks. We also study how the
CP-odd system is affected by the presence of a strong magnetic field, that is
presumably generated in a non-central heavy ion collision. We find that both
ingredients play an important role, influencing drastically the nature of the
phase transition and the critical temperature.
