Gauge transformations are potential transformations that leave only specific
Maxwell fields invariant. To reveal more, I develop Lorenz field equations with
full Maxwell form for nongauge, sans gauge function, transformations yielding
mixed, superposed retarded and outgoing, potentials. The form invariant Lorenz
condition is then a charge conservation equivalent. This allows me to define
three transformation classes that screen for Lorenz relevance. The nongauge
Lorentz conditions add polarization fields which support emergent, light-like
rays that convey energy on charge conserving phase points. These localized rays
escape discovery in modern Maxwell fields where the polarizations are
suppressed by gauge transformations.
