We consider a class of multidimensional conservation laws with vanishing
nonlinear diffusion and dispersion terms. Under a condition on the relative
size of the diffusion and dispersion coefficients, we establish that the
diffusive-dispersive solutions are uniformly bounded in a space Lp ($p$
arbitrary large, depending on the nonlinearity of the diffusion) and converge
to the classical, entropy solution of the corresponding multidimensional,
hyperbolic conservation law. Previous results were restricted to
one-dimensional equations and specific spaces Lp. Our proof is based on
DiPerna's uniqueness theorem in the class of entropy measure-valued solutions.
