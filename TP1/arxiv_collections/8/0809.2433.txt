Three dimensional spacelike warped anti-de Sitter space is studied in the
context of Einstein theories of gravity and string theory, where there is no
gravitational Chern-Simons term in the action. We propose that it is
holographically dual to a two-dimensional conformal field theory with equal
left and right moving central charges. Various checks of the central charges
are offered, based on the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of the stretched warped
black holes and warped self-dual solutions. The proposed central charges are
applied to compute the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of the Hopf T-dual of
six-dimensional dyonic black strings which have a near horizon consisting of
three dimensional warped anti-de Sitter space times a three-sphere. We find
that the Hopf T-duality is a map between thermal states with equal entropy of
the CFTs dual to the dyonic black string and the Hopf T-dualized black string.
