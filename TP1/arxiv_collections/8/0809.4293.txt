We discuss some recent developments in chameleon models presented at the
Fourth Patras workshop on Axions, WIMPs and WISPs. In particular we discuss the
possibility of searching for chameleons in axion-like particle searches
performed in the laboratory. Such chameleons may couple to both photons and
matter with different coupling strengths. We discuss the exciting possibility
of searching for these dark energy candidates in quantum vacuum experiments -
in particular for the GammeV experiment at Fermilab.
