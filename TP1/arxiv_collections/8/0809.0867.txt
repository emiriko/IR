We theoretically study bipartite entanglement purification with neutral atoms
via cavity-assistant interaction and linear optical elements. We focus on
entanglement distillation and the recurrence protocol, whose performances under
idealized and realistic conditions are discussed. The implementation of these
purification protocols has been tested with numerical simulations. We analyze
the performance and stability of all required operations and emphasize that all
techniques are feasible with current experimental technology.
