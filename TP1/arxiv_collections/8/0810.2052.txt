The energetic ground state of gold clusters with up to 314 atoms consists of
rather complicated geometries that have only a weak resemblance to the perfect
icosahedra, decahedra and octahedra that are encountered for some magic
numbers. The structure changes in most cases completely by the addition of a
single atom. Other low energy structures are so close in energy that their
Boltzmann weight is not negligible at room temperature.
