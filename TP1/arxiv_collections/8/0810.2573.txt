We characterize the zero-temperature limits of minimal free energy states for
interacting corpora -- that is, for objects with finitely many degrees of
freedom, such as articulated rods. These limits are measures supported on
zero-level-sets of the interaction potential. We describe a selection mechanism
for the limits that is mediated by evanescent entropic contributions.
