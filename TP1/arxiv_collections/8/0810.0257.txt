This thesis concerns the study of random walks in random environments (RWRE).
Since there are two levels of randomness for random walks in random
environments, there are two different distributions for the random walk that
can be studied. The quenched distribution is the law of the random walk
conditioned on a given environment. The annealed distribution is the quenched
law averaged over all environments. The main results of the thesis fall into
two categories: quenched limiting distributions for one-dimensional, transient
RWRE and annealed large deviations for multidimensional RWRE.
  The analysis of the quenched distributions for transient, one-dimensional
RWRE falls into two separate cases. First, when an annealed central limit
theorem holds, we prove that a quenched central limit theorem also holds but
with a random (depending on the environment) centering. In contrast, when the
annealed limit distribution is not Gaussian, we prove that there is no quenched
limiting distribution for the RWRE. Moreover, we show that for almost every
environment, there exist two random (depending on the environment) sequences of
times, along which random walk has different quenched limiting distributions.
  While an annealed large deviation principle for multidimensional RWRE was
known previously, very little qualitative information was available about the
annealed large deviation rate function. We prove that if the law on
environments is non-nestling, then the annealed large deviation rate function
is analytic in a neighborhood of its unique zero (which is the limiting
velocity of the RWRE).
