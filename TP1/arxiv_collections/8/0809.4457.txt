K\"{u}lshammer, Olsson and Robinson conjectured that a certain set of numbers
determined the invariant factors of the $\ell$-Cartan matrix for $S_n$
(equivalently, the invariant factors of the Cartan matrix for the Iwahori-Hecke
algebra $\mathcal{H}_n(q)$, where $q$ is a primitive $\ell$th root of unity).
We call these invariant factors Cartan invariants.
  In a previous paper, the second author calculated these Cartan invariants
when $\ell=p^r$, $p$ prime, and $r\leq p$ and went on to conjecture that the
formulae should hold for all $r$. Another result was obtained, which is
surprising and counterintuitive from a block theoretic point of view. Namely,
given the prime decomposition $\ell=p_1^{r_1}... p_k^{r_k}$, the Cartan matrix
of an $\ell$-block of $S_n$ is a product of Cartan matrices associated to
$p_i^{r_i}$-blocks of $S_n$. In particular, the invariant factors of the Cartan
matrix associated to an $\ell$-block of $S_n$ can be recovered from the Cartan
matrices associated to the $p_i^{r_i}$-blocks.
  In this paper, we formulate an explicit combinatorial determination of the
Cartan invariants of $S_n$--not only for the full Cartan matrix, \emph{but for
an individual block}. We collect evidence for this conjecture, by showing that
the formulae predict the correct determinant of the $\ell$-Cartan matrix. We
then go on to show that Hill's conjecture implies the conjecture of KOR.
