This paper presents new lower and upper bounds for the optimal compression of
binary prefix codes in terms of the most probable input symbol, where
compression efficiency is determined by the nonlinear codeword length objective
of minimizing maximum pointwise redundancy. This objective relates to both
universal modeling and Shannon coding, and these bounds are tight throughout
the interval. The upper bounds also apply to a related objective, that of dth
exponential redundancy.
