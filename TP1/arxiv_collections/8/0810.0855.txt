We prove an analogue of the celebrated Hall-Higman theorem, which gives a
lower bound for the degree of the minimal polynomial of any semisimple element
of prime power order $p^{a}$ of a finite classical group in any nontrivial
irreducible cross characteristic representation. With a few explicit
exceptions, this degree is at least $p^{a-1}(p-1)$.
