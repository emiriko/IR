We present the first numerical code based on the Galerkin and Collocation
methods to integrate the field equations of the Bondi problem. The Galerkin
method like all spectral methods provide high accuracy with moderate
computational effort. Several numerical tests were performed to verify the
issues of convergence, stability and accuracy with promising results. This code
opens up several possibilities of applications in more general scenarios for
studying the evolution of spacetimes with gravitational waves.
