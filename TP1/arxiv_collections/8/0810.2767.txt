Generalizing the centralizer construction of Molev and Olshanski on symmetric
groups, we study the structures of the centralizer $\mZ_{m,n}$ of the wreath
product $G_{n-m}$ in the group algebra of $G_n$ for any $n\geq m$. We establish
the connection between $\mZ_{m,n}$ and a generalization of degenerate affine
Hecke algebras introduced in our earlier work.
