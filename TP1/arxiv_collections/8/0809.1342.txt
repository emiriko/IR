We numerically test the method of non-sequential recursive pair substitutions
to estimate the entropy of an ergodic source. We compare its performance with
other classical methods to estimate the entropy (empirical frequencies, return
times, Lyapunov exponent). We considered as a benchmark for the methods several
systems with different statistical properties: renewal processes, dynamical
systems provided and not provided with a Markov partition, slow or fast decay
of correlations. Most experiments are supported by rigorous mathematical
results, which are explained in the paper.
