We have designed a tiered security system for mobile devices where each
security tier holds user-defined security triggers and actions. It has a
friendly interface that allows users to easily define and configure the
different circumstances and actions they need according to context. The system
can be set up and activated from any browser or directly on the mobile device
itself. When the security system is operated from a Web site or server, its
configuration can be readily shared across multiple devices. When operated
directly from the mobile device, no server is needed for activation. Many
different types of security circumstances and actions can be set up and
employed from its tiers. Security circumstances can range from temporary
misplacement of a mobile device at home to malicious theft in a hostile region.
Security actions can range from ringing a simple alarm to automatically
erasing, overwriting, and re-erasing drives.
