Defects introduced in ferromagnetic nanodisks may deeply affect the structure
and dynamics of stable vortex-like magnetization. Here, analytical techniques
are used for studying, among other dynamical aspects, how a small cylindrical
cavity modify the oscillatory modes of the vortex. For instance, we have
realized that if the vortex is nucleated out from the hole its gyrotropic
frequencies are shifted below. Modifications become even more pronounced when
the vortex core is partially or completely captured by the hole. In these
cases, the gyrovector can be partially or completely suppressed, so that the
associated frequencies increase considerably, say, from some times to several
powers. Possible relevance of our results for understanding other aspects of
vortex dynamics in the presence of cavities and/or structural defects are also
discussed.
