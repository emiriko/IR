Analytic approximants for the eigenvalues of the one-dimensional
Schr\"odinger equation with potentials of the form $V(x)= Ax^a + Bx^b$ are
found using a multi-point quasi-rational approximation technique. This
technique is based on the use of the power series and asymptotic expansion of
the eigenvalues in $\lambda=A^{-\frac{b+2}{a+2}}B$, as well as the expansion at
intermediate points. These expansions are found through a system of
differential equations. The approximants found are valid and accurate for any
value of $\lambda$. As examples, the technique is applied to the quartic and
sextic anharmonic oscillators.
