The time resolution of a double-stage Thick-GEM (THGEM) detector was measured
with UV-photons and relativistic electrons. The photon detector, with
semitransparent- or reflective-photocathode yielded time resolution of about
8-10ns RMS for single photoelectrons and 0.5-1ns RMS for few-hundred
photoelectrons per photon-pulse. Time resolution of about 10ns RMS was recorded
for relativistic electrons from a 106Ru source.
