Let $W$ be a finite irreducible real reflection group, which is a Coxeter
group. We explicitly construct a basis for the module of differential 1-forms
with logarithmic poles along the Coxeter arrangement by using a primitive
derivation. As a consequence, we extend the Hodge filtration, indexed by
nonnegative integers, into a filtration indexed by all integers. This
filtration coincides with the filtration by the order of poles. The results are
translated into the derivation case.
