We propose a way of making graphene superconductive by putting on it small
superconductive islands which cover a tiny fraction of graphene area. We show
that the critical temperature, T_c, can reach several Kelvins at the
experimentally accessible range of parameters. At low temperatures, T<<T_c, and
zero magnetic field, the density of states is characterized by a small gap
E_g<T_c resulting from the collective proximity effect. Transverse magnetic
field H_g(T) E_g is expected to destroy the spectral gap driving graphene layer
to a kind of a superconductive glass state. Melting of the glass state into a
metal occurs at a higher field H_{g2}(T).
