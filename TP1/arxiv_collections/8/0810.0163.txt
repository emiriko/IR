Here we review the main results of LFV in the semileptonic tau decays $\tau
\to \mu PP$ ($PP = \pi^+ \pi^-, \pi^0 \pi^0, K^+ K^-, K^0 \bar{K}^0$), $\tau
\to \mu P$ ($P = \pi, \eta, \eta^{\prime}$), and $\tau \to \mu V$ ($V = \rho,
\phi$) as well as in $\mu-e$ conversion in nuclei within SUSY-seesaw scenarios,
and compare our predictions with the present experimental bounds
