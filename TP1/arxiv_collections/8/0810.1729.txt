In this work, we present a novel construction for solving the linear
multiuser detection problem using the Gaussian Belief Propagation algorithm.
Our algorithm yields an efficient, iterative and distributed implementation of
the MMSE detector. We compare our algorithm's performance to a recent result
and show an improved memory consumption, reduced computation steps and a
reduction in the number of sent messages. We prove that recent work by
Montanari et al. is an instance of our general algorithm, providing new
convergence results for both algorithms.
