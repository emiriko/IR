The manifestly supersymmetric pure spinor formulations of the
Bagger-Lambert-Gustavsson models with N=8 supersymmetry and the
Aharony-Bergman-Jafferis-Maldacena models with N=6 supersymmetry are given. The
structures of the pure spinors are investigated in both cases, and
non-degenerate measures are formed using non-minimal sets of variables,
allowing for the formulation of an action principle.
