Curvature squared terms are added to a consistent formulation of supergravity
on manifolds with boundary which is meant to represent the low energy limit of
the strongly coupled heterotic string. These terms are necessary for the
cancellation of gravitational anomalies and for reduction to lower dimensions
with broken chiral symmetry. The consequences of anomaly cancellation when flux
and extrinsic curvature terms are taken into account have yet to be fully
exploited, but some implications for flux terms are discussed.
