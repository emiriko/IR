Ultra-relativistic electromagnetic plasmas can be used for improving our
understanding of the quark-gluon plasma. In the weakly coupled regime both
plasmas can be described by transport theoretical and quantum field theoretical
methods leading to similar results for the plasma properties (dielectric
tensor, dispersion relations, plasma frequency, Debye screening, transport
coefficients, damping and particle production rates). In particular, future
experiments with ultra-relativistic electron-positron plasmas in ultra-strong
laser fields might open the possibility to test these predictions, e.g. the
existence of a new fermionic plasma wave (plasmino). In the strongly coupled
regime electromagnetic plasmas such as complex plasmas can be used as models or
at least analogies for the quark-gluon plasma possibly produced in relativistic
heavy-ion experiments. For example, pair correlation functions can be used to
investigate the equation of state and cross section enhancement for parton
scattering can be explained.
