We summarize the recent progress in a new approach to precision LHC physics
based on the IR-improved DGLAP-CS theory as it relates to a new MC friendly
exponentiated scheme for precision calculation of higher order corrections to
LHC physics in which IR singularities from both QED and QCD are canceled to all
orders in \alpha and in \alpha_s simultaneously in the presence of rigorous
shower/ME matching. We present the first MC data comparing the implied new
showers themselves with the standard ones using the HERWIG6.5 MC event
generator as a test case at LHC energies.
