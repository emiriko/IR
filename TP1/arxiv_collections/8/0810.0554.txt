The distribution of votes of one of the corporate parties in Mexico during
elections of 2000, 2003 and 2006 is analyzed. After proper normalization and
unfolding the agreement of the votes distributions with those of daisy models
of several ranks is good. These models are generated by retaining each $r+1$
level in a sequence which follows a Poisson distribution.Beyond the fact that
rank 2 daisy model resembles the distribution of the quasi-optimal distances
for the Traveling Salesman Problem no clear explanation exists for this
behavior, but the agreement is not fortuitous and the possibility of a
universal phenomena for corporate vote is discussed.
