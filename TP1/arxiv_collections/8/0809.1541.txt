Welschinger invariants of the real projective plane can be computed via the
enumeration of enriched graphs, called marked floor diagrams. By a purely
combinatorial study of these objects, we prove a Caporaso-Harris type formula
which allows one to compute Welschinger invariants for configurations of points
with any number of complex conjugated points.
