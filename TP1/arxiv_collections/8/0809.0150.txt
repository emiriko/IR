We hereby introduce and study the notion of self-contracted curves, which
encompasses orbits of gradient systems of convex and quasiconvex functions. Our
main result shows that bounded self-contracted planar curves have a finite
length. We also give an example of a convex function defined in the plane whose
gradient orbits spiral infinitely many times around the unique minimum of the
function.
