The Osher-Chakrabarthy family of linear flux-modification schemes is
considered. Improved lower bounds on the compression factors are provided,
which suggest the viability of using the unlimited version. The LLF flux
formula is combined with these schemes in order to obtain efficient
finite-difference algorithms. The resulting schemes are applied to a battery of
numerical tests, going from advection and Burgers equations to Euler and MHD
equations, including the double Mach reflection and the Orszag-Tang 2D vortex
problem. Total-variation-bounded behavior is evident in all cases, even with
time-independent upper bounds. The proposed schemes, however, do not deal
properly with compound shocks, arising from non-convex fluxes, as shown by
Buckley-Leverett test simulations.
