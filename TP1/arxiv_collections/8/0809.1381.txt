We present phase coherence time measurements in quasi-one-dimensional
mesoscopic wires made from high mobility two-dimensional electron gas. By
implanting gallium ions into a GaAs/AlGaAs heterojunction we are able to vary
the diffusion coefficient over 2 orders of magnitude. We show that in the
diffusive limit, the decoherence time follows a power law as a function of
diffusion coefficient as expected by theory. When the disorder is low enough so
that the samples are semi-ballistic, we observe a new and unexpected regime in
which the phase coherence time is independent of disorder. In addition, for all
samples the temperature dependence of the phase coherence time follows a power
law down to the lowest temperatures without any sign of saturation and strongly
suggests that the frequently observed low temperature saturation is not
intrinsic.
