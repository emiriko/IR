We propose a discrete traffic flow model with discrete time. Continuum limit
of this model is equivalent to the optimal velocity model. It has also an
ultradiscrete limit and a piecewise-linear type of traffic flow model is
obtained. Both models show phase transition from free flow to jam in a
fundamental diagram. Moreover, the ultradiscrete model includes the
Fukui-Ishibashi model in a special case.
