We use a partially Gutzwiller projected BCS d-wave wavefunction with an
antiferromagentic weighting factor to study the ground state phase diagram of a
half filled Hubbard-Heisenberg model in a square lattice with nearest neighbor
hopping $t$ and a diagonal hopping $t'$. The calculations are carried out by
using variational Monte Carlo method which treats the Gutzwiller projection
explicitly. At large on-site Coulomb interaction $U$, the ground state is
antiferromagnetic. As $U$ decreases, the ground state becomes superconducting
and eventually metallic. The phase diagram is obtained by extensive
calculations. As compared to the strong effect of $U/t$, the phase boundaries
turn out to be less sensitive to $t'/t$. The result is consistent with the
phase diagram in layered organic conductors, and is compared to the earlier
mean field result based on the Gutzwiller approximation.
