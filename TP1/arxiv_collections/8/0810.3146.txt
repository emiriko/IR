We describe the Polyak-Viro arrow diagram formulas for the coefficients of
the Conway polynomial. As a consequence, we obtain the Conway polynomial as a
state sum over some subsets of the crossings of the knot diagram. It turns out
to be a simplification of a special case of Jaeger's state model for the HOMFLY
polynomial.
