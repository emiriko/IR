It is known that the Lawrence-Krammer representation of the Artin group of
type $A_{n-1}$ based on the two parameters $t$ and $q$ that was used by Krammer
and independently by Bigelow to show the linearity of the braid group on $n$
strands is generically irreducible. Here, we recover this result and show
further that for some complex specializations of the parameters the
representation is reducible. We give all the values of the parameters for which
the representation is reducible as well as the dimensions of the invariant
subspaces. We deduce some results of semisimplicity of the
Birman-Murakami-Wenzl algebra of type $A_{n-1}$.
