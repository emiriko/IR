We compute the O(\alpha_s^2) corrections to the differential rate of the
semileptonic decay b -> clv at the "intermediate recoil" point, where the
c-quark mass and the invariant mass of the leptons are equal. The calculation
is based on an expansion around two opposite limits of the quark masses
m_{b,c}: m_c ~ m_b and m_c << m_b. The former case was previously studied; we
correct and extend that result. The latter case is new. The smooth matching of
both expansions provides a check of both. We clarify the discrepancy between
the recent determinations of the full NNLO QCD correction to the semileptonic b
-> c rate, and its earlier estimate.
