New measurements of AC magnetic susceptibility and DC resistivity of a high
quality single crystal MnSi were carried out at high pressure making use of
helium as a pressure medium. The form of the AC magnetic susceptibility curves
at the magnetic phase transition suddenly changes upon helium solidification.
This implies strong sensitivity of magnetic properties of MnSi to non
hydrostatic stresses and suggests that the early claims on the existence of a
tricritical point at the phase transition line are probably a result of
misinterpretation of the experimental data. At the same time resistivity
behavior at the phase transition does not show such a significant influence of
helium solidification. The sharp peak at the temperature derivative of
resistivity, signifying the first order nature of the phase transition in MnSi
successfully survived helium crystallization and continued the same way to the
highest pressure.
