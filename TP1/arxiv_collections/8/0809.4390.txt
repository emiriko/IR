There is hope that the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN will tell us about
the fate of supersymmetry at the TeVscale. Therefore we might try to identify
our expectations for the discovery of SUSY, especially in the first years of
operation of this machine. In this talk we shall concentrate on the simplest
SUSY scheme: the MSSM with SUSY broken in a hidden sector mediated by
interactions of gravitational strength (gravity-, modulus and
mirage-mediation). Such a situation might be favoured in a large class of
string inspired models. There is a good chance to identify such simple schemes
by knowing the properties of the gaugino mass spectrum such as the
gluino/neutralino mass ratios.
