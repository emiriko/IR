In previous works effective non-local $SU(2)\times SU(2)$ NJL model was
derived in the framework of the fundamental QCD. All the parameters of the
model are expressed through QCD parameters: current light quark mass $m_0$ and
average non-perturbative $\alpha_s$. The results for scalar and pseudo-scalar
mesons are in satisfactory agreement to existing data. In the present work the
same model without introduction of any additional parameters is applied for a
description of masses and strong decay widths of $\rho$- and $a_1$-mesons. The
results for both scalar and vector sectors agree with data with only one
adjusted parameter $m_0$, with account of average $\alpha_s \simeq 0.415$,
which is obtained in a previous work as well.
