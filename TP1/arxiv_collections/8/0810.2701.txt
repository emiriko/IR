The origin of the very large piezoelectric response observed in the vicinity
of the morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) in perovskite lead zirconate titanate
and related systems has been under intensive studies. Polarization rotation
ideas are frequently invoked to explain the piezoelectric properties. It was
recently reported that lead titanate undergoes a phase transformation sequence
$P4mm\to Pm\to Cm\to R\bar{3}c$ at 10 K as a function of hydrostatic pressure
[M. Ahart et al. Nature Letters. \textbf{451}, 545 (2008)]. We demonstrate that
this interpretation is not correct by (i) simulating the reported diffraction
patterns, and (ii) by density-functional theory computations which show that
neither the $Pm$, $Cm$ nor $Pmm2$ phase is stable in the studied pressure
range, and further show that octahedral tilting is the key stabilization
mechanism under high pressure. Notes on a more general ground are given to
demonstrate that a continuous phase transition between rhombohedral and
tetragonal phases via intermediate monoclinic phase is not possible. Thus,
two-phase co-existence in the vicinity of the phase transition region is
probable and has an important role for electromechanical properties.
