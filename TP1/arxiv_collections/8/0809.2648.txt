Numerical calculations have been performed to elucidate unconventional
electronic transport properties in disordered nanographene ribbons with zigzag
edges (zigzag ribbons). The energy band structure of zigzag ribbons has two
valleys that are well separated in momentum space, related to the two Dirac
points of the graphene spectrum. The partial flat bands due to edge states make
the imbalance between left- and right-going modes in each valley, {\it i.e.}
appearance of a single chiral mode. This feature gives rise to a perfectly
conducting channel in the disordered system, i.e. the average of conductance
$<g>$ converges exponentially to 1 conductance quantum per spin with increasing
system length, provided impurity scattering does not connect the two valleys,
as is the case for long-range impurity potentials. Ribbons with short-range
impurity potentials, however, through inter-valley scattering, display ordinary
localization behavior. Symmetry considerations lead to the classification of
disordered zigzag ribbons into the unitary class for long-range impurities, and
the orthogonal class for short-range impurities. The electronic states of
graphene nanoribbons with general edge structures are also discussed, and it is
demonstrated that chiral channels due to the edge states are realized even in
more general edge structures except for armchair edges.
