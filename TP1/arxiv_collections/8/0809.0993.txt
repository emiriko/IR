We have theoretically studied vortex waves of Bose-Einstein condensates in
elongated harmonic traps. Our focus is on the axisymmetric varicose waves and
helical Kelvin waves of singly quantized vortex lines. Growth and decay
dynamics of both types of vortex waves are discussed. We propose a method to
experimentally create these vortex waves on demand.
