We study a two dimensional XXZ-Ising on square-hexagon (4-6) lattice with
spin-1/2. The phase diagram of the ground state energy is discussed, shown two
different ferrimagnetic states and two type of antiferromagnetic states, beside
of a ferromagnetic state. To solve this model, it could be mapped into the
eight-vertex model with union jack interaction term. Imposing exact solution
condition we find the region where the XXZ-Ising model on 4-6 lattice have
exact solutions with one free parameter, for symmetric eight-vertex model
condition. In this sense we explore the properties of the system and analyze
the competition of the interaction parameters providing the region where it has
an exact solution. However the present model does not satisfy the \textit{free
fermion} condition, unless for a trivial situation. Even so we are able to
discuss their critical points region, when the exactly solvable condition is
ignored.
