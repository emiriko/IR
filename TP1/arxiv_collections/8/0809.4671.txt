Many seemingly different macroscopic systems (magnets, ferroelectrics, CDW,
vortices,..) can be described as generic disordered elastic systems.
Understanding their static and dynamics thus poses challenging problems both
from the point of view of fundamental physics and of practical applications.
Despite important progress many questions remain open. In particular the
temperature has drastic effects on the way these systems respond to an external
force. We address here the important question of the thermal effect close to
depinning, and whether these effects can be understood in the analogy with
standard critical phenomena, analogy so useful to understand the zero
temperature case. We show that close to the depinning force temperature leads
to a rounding of the depinning transition and compute the corresponding
exponent. In addition, using a novel algorithm it is possible to study
precisely the behavior close to depinning, and to show that the commonly
accepted analogy of the depinning with a critical phenomenon does not fully
hold, since no divergent lengthscale exists in the steady state properties of
the line below the depinning threshold.
