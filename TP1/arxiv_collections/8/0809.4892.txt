We consider a pionless effective theory with dibaryon fields for the
description of the weak process involving two nucleons. We construct leading
order Lagrangians that contain nucleon-dibaryon weak coupling constants. We
calculate the physical observable in the photodisintegration of the deuteron at
threshold and obtain the result in terms of the nucleon-dibaryon weak coupling
constants. Relation to existing calculations is discussed.
