We study the discrete light cone quantization of Kerr-AdS_{d+3} black holes
with a plane wave boundary. The resulting backgrounds are conjectured to be
dual of non-relativist conformal quantum mechanical theories in d spatial
dimensions at finite temperature and finite chemical potential. This includes
the discrete light cone quantization of Kerr-AdS_4 and Kerr-AdS_6 black holes.
These are conjectured to be dual of non-relativistic conformal quantum
mechanical theories in one and three spatial dimensions, respectively, which
are defined on plane wave backgrounds. We also consider the case of the BTZ
black hole. We calculate thermodynamic properties of these systems by using the
gravity dual models. We discuss the embedding of these backgrounds in string
theory and M-theory. We give general formulas for the discrete light cone
quantization of Kerr-AdS black holes in higher dimensions and their
thermodynamic properties.
