We have studied the field induced magnetic structures in the spin liquid
Tb$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$, in a wide temperature (0.3$<$$T$$<$270 K) and field
(0$<$$H$$<$7 T) range, by single crystal neutron diffraction with $\bf{H}$ //
[110] axis. We combined unpolarized neutron data with polarized ones, analyzed
within the local susceptibility model. A ferromagnetic-like structure with
$\bf{k}$ = 0 propagation vector is induced, whose local order at low field and
low temperature is akin to spin ice. The four Tb ions separate in $\alpha$ and
$\beta$ chains having different values of the magnetic moments, which is
quantitatively explained by taking the crystal field anisotropy into account.
Above 2 T and below 2 K, an antiferromagnetic-like structure with $\bf{k}$ =
(0,0,1) is induced besides the $\bf{k}$ = 0 structure. It shows a reentrant
behavior and extends over a finite length scale. It occurs together with a
broadening of the nuclear peaks, which suggests a field induced distortion and
magnetostriction effect.
