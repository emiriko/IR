We study the tunneling current between edge states of quantum Hall liquids
across a single long contact region, and predict a resonance at a bias voltage
set by the scale of the edge velocity. For typical devices and edge velocities
associated with charged modes, this resonance occurs outside the physically
accessible bias domain. However, for edge states that are expected to support
neutral modes, such as the $\nu={2/3}$, and $\nu={5/2}$ Pfaffian and
anti-Pfaffian states, the neutral velocity can be orders of magnitude smaller
than the charged mode and if so the resonance would be accessible. Therefore,
such long tunneling contacts can resolve the presence of neutral edge modes in
certain quantum Hall liquids.
