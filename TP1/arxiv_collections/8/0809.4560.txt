Let B_0(s,t) be a Brownian pillow with continuous sample paths, and let
h,u:[0,1]^2\to R be two measurable functions. In this paper we derive upper and
lower bounds for the boundary non-crossing probability
\psi(u;h):=P{B_0(s,t)+h(s,t) \le u(s,t), \forall s,t\in [0,1]}. Further we
investigate the asymptotic behaviour of $\psi(u;\gamma h)$ with $\gamma$
tending to infinity, and solve a related minimisation problem.
