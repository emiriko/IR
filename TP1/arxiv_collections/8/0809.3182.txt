This paper presents SinguLab, a graphical user interface for the singularity
analysis of parallel robots. The algorithm is based on Grassmann-Cayley
algebra. The proposed tool is interactive and introduces the designer to the
singularity analysis performed by this method, showing all the stages along the
procedure and eventually showing the solution algebraically and graphically,
allowing as well the singularity verification of different robot poses.
