From the perspective of AdS/CFT correspondence, we study the gravitational
Chern-Simons term correction to the holographic entanglement entropy of CFT on
the conformal boundary of asymptotically AdS$_3$ spacetime using the off-shell
Euclidean path integral method. We show that, like the BTZ black hole entropy,
the holographic entanglement entropy is indeed modified due to the
gravitational Chern-Simons term although the bulk geometry does not change.
