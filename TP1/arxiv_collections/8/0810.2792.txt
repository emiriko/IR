We describe an ion-based cavity-QED system in which the internal dynamics of
an atom is coupled to the modes of an optical cavity by vacuum-stimulated Raman
transitions. We observe Raman spectra for different excitation polarizations
and find quantitative agreement with theoretical simulations. Residual motion
of the ion introduces motional sidebands in the Raman spectrum and leads to ion
delocalization. The system offers prospects for cavity-assisted
resolved-sideband ground-state cooling and coherent manipulation of ions and
photons.
