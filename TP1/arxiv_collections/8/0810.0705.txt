Domain walls in a tetragonal chiral p-wave superconductors with broken time
reversal symmetry are analyzed in the framework of the Ginsburg-Landau theory.
The energy and the jump of the magnetic induction on the wall were determined
for different types of walls as functions of the parameters of the
Ginzburg-Landau theory and orientation of the domain wall with respect to the
crystallographic axes. We discuss implications of the analysis for
$Sr_{2}RuO_{4}$, where no stray magnetic fields from domain walls were detected
experimentally.
