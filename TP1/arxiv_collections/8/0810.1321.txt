We propose to use a two-species Fermi gas with the interspecies s-wave
Feshbach resonance to realize p-wave superfluidity in two dimensions. By
confining one species of fermions in a two-dimensional plane immersed in the
background three-dimensional Fermi sea of the other species, an attractive
interaction is induced between two-dimensional fermions. We compute the pairing
gap in the weak-coupling regime and show that it has the symmetry of p_x+ip_y.
Because the magnitude of the pairing gap increases toward the unitarity limit,
it is possible that the critical temperature for the p_x+ip_y-wave
superfluidity becomes within experimental reach. The resulting system has a
potential application to topological quantum computation using vortices with
non-Abelian statistics. We also discuss aspects of our system in the unitarity
limit as a "nonrelativistic defect conformal field theory (CFT)". The reduced
Schr\"odinger algebra, operator-state correspondence, scaling dimensions of
composite operators, and operator product expansions are investigated.
