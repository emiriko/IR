Interferometry with Heisenberg limited phase resolution may play an important
role in the next generation of atomic clocks, gravitational wave detectors, and
in quantum information science. For experimental implementations the robustness
of the phase resolution is crucial since any experimental realization will be
subject to imperfections. In this article we study the robustness of phase
reconstruction with two number states as input subject to fluctuations in the
state preparation. We find that the phase resolution is insensitive to
fluctuations in the total number of particles and robust against noise in the
number difference at the input. The phase resolution depends on the uncertainty
in the number difference in a universal way that has a clear physical
interpretation: Fundamental noise due to the Heisenberg limit and noise due to
state preparation imperfection contribute essentially independently to the
total uncertainty in the phase. For number difference uncertainties less than
one the first noise source is dominant and the phase resolution is essentially
Heisenberg limited. For number difference uncertainties greater than one the
noise due to state preparation imperfection is dominant and the phase
resolution deteriorates linearly with the number difference uncertainty.
