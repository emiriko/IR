We show that certain integral positive definite symmetric tridiagonal
matrices of determinant $n$ are in one to one correspondence with elements of
$(\mathbb Z/n\mathbb Z)^*$. We study some properties of this correspondence. In
a somewhat unrelated second part we discuss a construction which associates a
sequence of integral polytopes to every integral symmetric matrix.
