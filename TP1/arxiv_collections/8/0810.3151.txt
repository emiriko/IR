Let $X$ be an $n$-dimensional simply connected manifold of pinched sectional
curvature $-a^2 \leq K \leq -1$. There exist a positive constant $C(n,a)$ such
that for any finitely generated discrete group $\Gamma$ acting on $X$, then
either $\Gamma$ is virtually nilpotent or the algebraic entropy $Ent (\Gamma)
\geq C(n,a)$.
