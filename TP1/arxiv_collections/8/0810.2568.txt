In this paper, we explore holomorphic Segre preserving maps. First, we
investigate holomorphic Segre preserving maps sending the complexification
$\mathcal{M}$ of a generic real analytic submanifold $M \subseteq \C^N$ of
finite type at some point $p$ into the complexification $\mathcal{M}'$ of a
generic real analytic submanifold $M' \subseteq \C^{N'}$, finitely
nondegenerate at some point $p'$. We prove that for a fixed $M$ and $M'$, the
germs at $(p,\bar{p})$ of Segre submersive holomorphic Segre preserving maps
sending $(\M,(p,\bar{p}))$ into $(\M',(p', \bar{p}'))$ can be parametrized by
their $r$-jets at $(p,\bar{p})$, for some fixed $r$ depending only on $M$ and
$M'$. (If, in addition, $M$ and $M'$ are both real algebraic, then we prove
that any such map must be holomorphic algebraic.) From this parametrization, it
follows that the set of germs of holomorphic Segre preserving automorphisms
$\mathcal{H}$ of the complexification $\mathcal{M}$ of a real analytic
submanifold finitely nondegenerate and of finite type at some point $p$, and
such that $\mathcal{H}$ fixes $(p,\bar{p})$, is an algebraic complex Lie group.
We then explore the relationship between this automorphism group and the group
of automorphisms of $M$ at $p$.
