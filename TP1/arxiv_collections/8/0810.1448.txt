The orientation fluctuations of the director of a liquid crystal are
measured, by a sensitive polarization interferometer, close to the
Fr\'eedericksz transition, which is a second order transition driven by an
electric field. Using mean field theory, we define the work injected into the
system by a change of the electric field and we calibrate it using
Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem. We show that the work fluctuations satisfy the
Transient Fluctuation Theorem. An analytical justification of this result is
given. The open problems for the out of equilibrium case are finally discussed.
