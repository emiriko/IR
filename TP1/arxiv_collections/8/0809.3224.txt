An overview of the searches for the Standard Model Higgs boson at the LHC is
presented. The main Higgs production and decay modes that have been studied are
introduced, and the analysis techniques and the recent developments done by the
ATLAS and CMS experiments are described. Some preliminary results from current
studies are included. The discovery potential within the first few years of
physics running is evaluated.
