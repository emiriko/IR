We propose a new method that fixes the coupling to two photons of the
recently found lightest QCD resonance, the sigma. This coupling provides
crucial information for discriminating the yet unknown nature of this special
state. Our method uses available data on the nucleon polarizabilities together
with analyticity and unitarity. Taking into account all the uncertainties, our
result is Gamma_{pole}= 1.2 +- 0.4 keV.
