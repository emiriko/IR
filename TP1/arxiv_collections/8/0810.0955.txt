In the CF-LERN field (Cold Fusion and Low Energy Nuclear reactions) many
experimental results are available: unexplained energy production, presence of
unusual patterns of classical fusion reaction products, isotopic composition
variations, sporadic emission of nuclear radiations. These effects are not
always observed, for similar experimental conditions. Should a fundamental
reason exist for these effects to occur, funding would be justified, to make
them repeatable and more intense (this step being likely to be a trial and
error process, might require a substantial amount of money). In this article, a
possible fundamental explanation of the phenomenon is described, together with
the experimental plan to assess it.
