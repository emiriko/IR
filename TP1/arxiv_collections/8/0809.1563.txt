Let G be an algebraic group over an algebraically closed field, acting on a
variety X with finitely many orbits. "Staggered sheaves" are certain complexes
of G-equivariant coherent sheaves on X that seem to possess many remarkable
properties. In this paper, we construct "standard" and "costandard" objects in
the category of staggered sheaves, and we prove that that category has enough
projectives and injectives.
