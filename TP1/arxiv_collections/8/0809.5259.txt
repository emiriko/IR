In this lecture we discuss various properties of the phase factor of the
fermion determinant for QCD at nonzero chemical potential. Its effect on
physical observables is elucidated by comparing the phase diagram of QCD and
phase quenched QCD and by illustrating the failure of the Banks-Casher formula
with the example of one-dimensional QCD. The average phase factor and the
distribution of the phase are calculated to one-loop order in chiral
perturbation theory. In quantitative agreement with lattice QCD results, we
find that the distribution is Gaussian with a width $\sim \mu T \sqrt V$ (for
$m_\pi \ll T \ll \Lambda_{\rm QCD}$). Finally, we introduce, so-called teflon
plated observables which can be calculated accurately by Monte Carlo even
though the sign problem is severe.
