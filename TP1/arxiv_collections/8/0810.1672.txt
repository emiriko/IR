We use an extended two-band Kondo lattice model (KLM) to investigate the
occurrence of different (anti-)ferromagnetic phases or phase separation
depending on several model parameters. With regard to CMR-materials like the
manganites we have added a Jahn-Teller term, direct antiferromagnetic coupling
and Coulomb interaction to the KLM. The electronic properties are
self-consistently calculated in an interpolating self-energy approach with no
restriction to classical spins and going beyond mean-field treatments. Further
on we do not have to limit the Hund's coupling to low or infinite values.
Zero-temperature phase diagrams are presented for large parameter intervals.
There are strong influences of the type of Coulomb interaction (intraband,
interband) and of the important parameters (Hund's coupling, direct
antiferromagnetic exchange, Jahn-Teller distortion), especially at intermediate
couplings.
