We introduce two additive invariants of output quantum channels. If the value
of one these invariants is less than 1 then the logarithm of the inverse of its
value is a positive lower bound for the regularized minimum entropy of an
output quantum channel. We give a few examples in which one of these invariants
is less than 1. We also study the special cases where the above both invariants
are equal to 1.
