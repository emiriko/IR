We present the most recent results on searches for squarks and gluinos in
ppbar collisions at sqrt(s)=1.96 TeV, in events with large missing transverse
energy, leptons and multiple jets in the final state, based on 1.8 to 2.8 fb-1
of data collected by the CDF Run II detector at the Tevatron. No evidence of
new physics is found and exclusion limits in several MSSM scenarios are
extracted.
