We definitively show, using an explicit and broadly applicable model, that
local phase noise that is capable of eliminating state coherence only in the
infinite-time limit is capable of eliminating nonlocality in finite time in
three two-level systems prepared in the Bell-nonlocal tripartite states of the
generic entanglement class.
