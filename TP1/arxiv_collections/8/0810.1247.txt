Single pion production in neutrino-nucleon scattering is discussed. The
neutrino energies characteristic for T2K project are considered. Two new
parameterizations of $C_5^A$ axial form factor are proposed. Both of them are
obtained in simultaneous fit to ANL and BNL data. One of them (which fits
better to BNL data) leads to $d\sigma/dQ^2$ differential cross section which is
significantly reduced at low $Q^2$.
