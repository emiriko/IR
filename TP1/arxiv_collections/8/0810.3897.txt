In this paper we derive the universal R-matrix for the Yangian Y(u(2|2)),
which is an abstract algebraic object leading to rational solutions of the
Yang-Baxter equation on representations. We find that on the fundamental
representation the universal R-matrix reduces to the standard rational R-matrix
R = R_0(1 + P/u), where the scalar prefactor is surprisingly simple compared to
prefactors one finds e.g. for sl(n) R-matrices. This leads precisely to the
S-matrix giving the Bethe Ansatz of one-loop N = 4 Super Yang-Mills theory and
two-loop N = 6 Chern-Simons theory.
