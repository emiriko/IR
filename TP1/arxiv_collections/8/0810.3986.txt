In this paper the coherence and crossing symmetry of the electromagnetic
interaction of photons involved in the spontaneous parametric down conversion
(SPDC) phenomena in nonlinear crystals, are investigated. On this basis a new
interpretation of the recent results on the two photon entangled experiment is
obtained. A new field of applications is suggested.
