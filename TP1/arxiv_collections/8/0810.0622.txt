System-size dependence of the ground-state energy E^N is investigated for
N-site one-dimensional (1D) quantum systems with open boundary condition, where
the interaction strength decreases towards the both ends of the system. For the
spinless Fermions on the 1D lattice we have considered, it is shown that the
finite-size correction to the energy per site, which is defined as E^N / N -
\lim_{N \to \infty} E^N / N, is of the order of 1 / N^2 when the reduction
factor of the interaction is expressed by a sinusoidal function. We discuss the
origin of this fast convergence from the view point of the spherical geometry.
