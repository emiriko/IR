The Time Projection Chamber of the ALICE Experiment has been installed in the
experimental setup in the underground area at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN
in Geneva. The Alice TPC ReadOut (ALTRO) chip implements intelligent signal
processing on the Front-End-Electronics. During the years of 2007 and 2008
commissioning and calibration of the TPC have been carried out with cosmic
rays, radioactive Krypton isotopes and with tracks produced by a UV laser
system. In addition to these in this publication we present first results on
energy loss measurements and on the momentum resolution.
