In constructing collinear operators, which describe the production of
energetic jets or energetic hadrons, important constraints are provided by
reparameterization invariance (RPI). RPI encodes Lorentz invariance in a power
expansion about a collinear direction, and connects the Wilson coefficients of
operators at different orders in this expansion to all orders in alphas. We
construct reparameterization invariant collinear objects. The expansion of
operators built from these objects provides an efficient way of deriving RPI
relations and finding a minimal basis of operators, particularly when one has
an observable with multiple collinear directions and/or soft particles.
Complete basis of operators are constructed for pure glue currents at twist-4,
and for operators involving multiple collinear directions, including those
appearing in e+e- -> 3 jets, and for pp-> 2 jets initiated via gluon-fusion.
