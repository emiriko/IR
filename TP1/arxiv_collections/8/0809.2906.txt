Quantum criticality is the intriguing possibility offered by the laws of
quantum mechanics when the wave function of a many-particle physical system is
forced to evolve continuously between two distinct, competing ground states.
This phenomenon, often related to a zero-temperature magnetic phase transition,
can be observed in several strongly correlated materials such as heavy fermion
compounds or possibly high-temperature superconductors, and is believed to
govern many of their fascinating, yet still unexplained properties. In contrast
to these bulk materials with very complex electronic structure, artificial
nanoscale devices could offer a new and simpler vista to the comprehension of
quantum phase transitions. This long-sought possibility is demonstrated by our
work in a fullerene molecular junction, where gate voltage induces a crossing
of singlet and triplet spin states at zero magnetic field. Electronic tunneling
from metallic contacts into the $\rm{C_{60}}$ quantum dot provides here the
necessary many-body correlations to observe a true quantum critical behavior.
