We demonstrate how the zitterbewegung charge oscillations can be detected
through a charge conductance measurement in a three-terminal junction. By
tuning the spin-orbit interaction strength or an external magnetic field the
zitterbewegung period can be modulated, translating into complementary
conductance oscillations in the two outgoing leads of the junction. The
proposed experimental setup is within the reach of demonstrated technology and
material parameters, and enables the observation of the so far elusive
zitterbewegung phenomenon.
