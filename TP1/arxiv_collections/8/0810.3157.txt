Results are presented from a one-neutron knockout reaction at relativistic
energies on 56Ti using the GSI FRS as a two-stage magnetic spectrometer and the
Miniball array for gamma-ray detection. Inclusive and exclusive longitudinal
momentum distributions and cross-sections were measured enabling the
determination of the orbital angular momentum of the populated states.
First-time observation of the 955(6) keV nu p3/2-hole state in 55Ti is
reported. The measured data for the first time proves that the ground state of
55Ti is a 1/2- state, in agreement with shell-model calculations using the
GXPF1A interaction that predict a sizable N=34 gap in 54Ca.
