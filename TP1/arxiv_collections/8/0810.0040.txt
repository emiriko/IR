Following the successful application of the relativistic heavy quark(RHQ)
action to the charmonium and charm-strange meson spectrum, we study here the
bottom system to explore the validity of this method in a regime with larger
heavy quark momenta. The spectrum is calculated using the same dynamical 2+1
flavor, $24^3\times 64$ domain wall fermion lattice configurations generated by
the RBC and UKQCD collaborations and used in the earlier charm study. The 3
parameters in the RHQ action are determined by matching to the experimental
bottom-strange meson masses and extrapolated to the chiral limit from three
different sea quark masses. We predict the bottomonium mass spectrum and
compare it with experiment. A theoretical estimation is also carried out to
understand the $O(a^2p^2)$ systematic errors found in the numerical study.
