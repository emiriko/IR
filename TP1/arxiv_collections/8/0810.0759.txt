We show that oscillations of a homogeneous medium with constant material
coefficients produce pairs of photons. Classical analysis of an oscillating
medium reveals regions of parametric resonance where the electromagnetic waves
are exponentially amplified. The quantum counterpart of parametric resonance is
an exponentially growing number of photons in the same parameter regions. This
process may be viewed as another manifestation of the dynamical Casimir effect.
However, in contrast to the standard dynamical Casimir effect, photon
production here takes place in the entire volume and is not due to time
dependence of the boundary conditions or material constants.
