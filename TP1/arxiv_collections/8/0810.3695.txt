Many exponential speedups that have been achieved in quantum computing are
obtained via hidden subgroup problems (HSPs). We show that the HSP over
Weyl-Heisenberg groups can be solved efficiently on a quantum computer. These
groups are well-known in physics and play an important role in the theory of
quantum error-correcting codes. Our algorithm is based on non-commutative
Fourier analysis of coset states which are quantum states that arise from a
given black-box function. We use Clebsch-Gordan decompositions to combine and
reduce tensor products of irreducible representations. Furthermore, we use a
new technique of changing labels of irreducible representations to obtain
low-dimensional irreducible representations in the decomposition process. A
feature of the presented algorithm is that in each iteration of the algorithm
the quantum computer operates on two coset states simultaneously. This is an
improvement over the previously best known quantum algorithm for these groups
which required four coset states.
