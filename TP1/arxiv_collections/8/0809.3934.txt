The filamentary structures and associated electromagnetic fields of a
relativistic electron beam have been studied by three dimensional
particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations in the context of Fast Ignition fusion. The
simulations explicitly include collisions in return plasma current and
distinctly examine the effects of beam temperature and collisions on the growth
of filamentary structures generated.
