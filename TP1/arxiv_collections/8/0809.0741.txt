Adopting the definition of excedances of type B due to Brenti, we give a type
B analogue of the q-derangement polynomials. The connection between
q-derangement polynomials and Eulerian polynomials naturally extends to the
type B case. Based on this relation, we derive some basic properties of the
q-derangement polynomials of type B, including the generating function formula,
the Sturm sequence property, and the asymptotic normal distribution. We also
show that the q-derangement polynomials are almost symmetric in the sense that
the coefficients possess the spiral property.
