The addition of the EMTiming system installed to provide the time
measurements of the electromagnetic calorimeter signals has significantly
increased the sensitivity of CDF to events with a photon and a missing energy.
Here I review recent searches in this signature performed by CDF using data
from proton-antiproton collisions at the center of mass energy of 1.96 TeV.
They provide new constraints on models with large extra dimensions and with
gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking.
