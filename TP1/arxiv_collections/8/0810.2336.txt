In this paper we prove an analogue of Mordell's inequality for lattices in
finite-dimensional complex or quaternionic Hermitian space that are modules
over a maximal order in an imaginary quadratic number field or a totally
definite rational quaternion algebra. This inequality implies that the
16-dimensional Barnes-Wall lattice has optimal density among all 16-dimensional
lattices with Hurwitz structures.
