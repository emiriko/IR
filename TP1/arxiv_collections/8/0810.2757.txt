The CLIC linear collider aims at accelerating multiple bunches of electrons
and positrons and colliding them at a centre of mass energy of 3 TeV. These
bunches will be accelerated through X-band linacs, operating at an accelerating
frequency of 12 GHz. Each beam readily excites wake-fields within the
accelerating cavities of each linac. The transverse components of the
wake-fields, if left unchecked, can dilute the beam emittance. The present CLIC
design relies on heavy damping of these wake-fields in order to ameliorate the
effects of the wake-fields on the beam emittance. Here we present initial
results on simulations of the long-range wake-fields in these structures and on
beam dynamics simulations. In particular, detailed simulations are performed,
on emittance dilution due to beams initially injected with realistic offsets
from the electrical centre of the cavities.
