We derive a numerical method for Darcy flow, hence also for Poisson's
equation in mixed (first order) form, based on discrete exterior calculus
(DEC). Exterior calculus is a generalization of vector calculus to smooth
manifolds and DEC is one of its discretizations on simplicial complexes such as
triangle and tetrahedral meshes. DEC is a coordinate invariant discretization,
in that it does not depend on the embedding of the simplices or the whole mesh.
We start by rewriting the governing equations of Darcy flow using the language
of exterior calculus. This yields a formulation in terms of flux differential
form and pressure. The numerical method is then derived by using the framework
provided by DEC for discretizing differential forms and operators that act on
forms. We also develop a discretization for spatially dependent Hodge star that
varies with the permeability of the medium. This also allows us to address
discontinuous permeability. The matrix representation for our discrete
non-homogeneous Hodge star is diagonal, with positive diagonal entries. The
resulting linear system of equations for flux and pressure are saddle type,
with a diagonal matrix as the top left block. The performance of the proposed
numerical method is illustrated on many standard test problems. These include
patch tests in two and three dimensions, comparison with analytically known
solution in two dimensions, layered medium with alternating permeability
values, and a test with a change in permeability along the flow direction. We
also show numerical evidence of convergence of the flux and the pressure. A
convergence experiment is also included for Darcy flow on a surface. A short
introduction to the relevant parts of smooth and discrete exterior calculus is
included in this paper. We also include a discussion of the boundary condition
in terms of exterior calculus.
