By means of two typical kinds of quark energy loss parametrization and the
nuclear parton distributions determined only with lepton-nuclear deep inelastic
scattering experimental data, a leading order analysis are performed on the
proton-induced Drell-Yan differential cross section ratios of tungsten versus
deuterium as a function of the quark momentum fraction in the beam proton and
target nuclei. It is found that the theoretical results with quark energy loss
are in good agreement with the experimental data. The quark energy loss effect
produce approximately 3% to 11% suppression on the Drell-Yan differential cross
section ratios $R_{W/D}$ in the range $0.05\leq x_2\leq0.3$. The application of
nuclear Drell-Yan data with heavy targets is remarkably subject to difficulty
in the constraints of the nuclear sea-quark distribution.
