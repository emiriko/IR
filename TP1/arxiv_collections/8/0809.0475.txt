One of the possible mechanisms of high Tc superconductivity is Cooper pairing
with the help of bosons, which change the slope of the electronic dispersion as
observed by photoemission. Giustino et al. calculated that in the high
temperature superconductor La1.85Sr0.15CuO4 crystal lattice vibrations
(phonons) should have a negligible effect on photoemission spectra and
concluded that phonons do not play an important role. We show that the
calculations employed by Giustino et al. fail to reproduce huge influence of
electron-phonon coupling on important phonons observed in experiments. Thus one
would expect these calculations to similarly fail in explaining the role of
electron-phonon coupling for the electronic dispersion.
