In this paper we show that for any affine complete rational surface
singularity there is a correspondence between the dual graph of the minimal
resolution and the quiver of the endomorphism ring of the special CM modules.
We thus call such an algebra the reconstruction algebra. As a consequence the
derived category of the minimal resolution is equivalent to the derived
category of an algebra whose quiver is determined by the dual graph. Also, for
any finite subgroup G of GL(2,C), it means that the endomorphism ring of the
special CM C[[x,y]]^G modules can be used to build the dual graph of the
minimal resolution of C^2/G, extending McKay's observation for finite subgroups
of SL(2,C) to all finite subgroups of GL(2,C).
