In this note we make a very elementary technical observation to the effect
that Ruelle's construction of the thermodynamic limit of the classical entropy
density defined with a regularized microcanonical measure actually establishes
the thermodynamic limit for the entropy density defined with the proper
microcanonical measure. At this stage a key formula is still derived from the
regularized measures. We also show that with only minor changes in the proof
the regularization of the microcanonical measure is actually not needed at all.
