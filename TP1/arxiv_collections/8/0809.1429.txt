Using Tevatron bounds we derive upper limits on the LHC Higgs production rate
under the assumption that no beyond the Standard Model (BSM) particles are
being produced near their mass shell. A violation of these limits would
constitute a smoking gun for light BSM particles. Furthermore, we demonstrate
how R_T, the ratio of the partially integrated Higgs transverse momentum
distribution to the inclusive rate, can also be used as a probe of light BSM
particles. This ratio is insensitive to heavy virtual effects and can be
well-approximated by its SM value, i.e. it is model independent. The
perturbative expansion for R_T has reduced renormalization scale dependence, at
the order of 5% at next-to-leading order in QCD, due to a cancellation of
Wilson coefficients. A deviation from the SM value implies that light BSM
particles are being produced near their mass shell. We discuss a possible
loophole to this conclusion, namely the existence of a non-perturbative, CP
violating sector that couples to the Higgs. We use a toy model with colored
scalars to demonstrate how the model independent prediction for R_T is
approached as the mass of the scalar becomes large.
