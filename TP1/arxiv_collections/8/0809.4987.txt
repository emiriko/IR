This article introduces a 3D space-time-space block code for future
terrestrial digital TV in single frequency networks. The proposed 3D code is
based on a double layer structure designed for inter-cell and intra-cell space
time coded transmissions. We show that this new structure is particularly
efficient for SFN environments regardless of the location of the receiver. It
is then suitable for fixed, portable and mobile receptions.
