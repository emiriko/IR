In a previous paper (arXiv:0704.1001), Losev, me, and Shneiberg constructed a
full descendant potential associated to an arbitrary cyclic Hodge dGBV algebra.
This contruction extended the construction of Barannikov and Kontsevich of
solution of the WDVV equation, based on the earlier paper of Bershadsky,
Cecotti, Ooguri, and Vafa. In the present paper, we give an interpretation of
this full descendant potential in terms of Givental group action on
cohomological field theories. In particular, the fact that it satisfies all
tautological equations becomes a trivial observation.
