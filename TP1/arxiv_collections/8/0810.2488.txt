We provide a formula describing the G-module structure of the Hurwitz-Hodge
bundle for admissible G-covers in terms of the Hodge bundle of the base curve,
and more generally, for describing the G-module structure of the push-forward
to the base of any sheaf on a family of admissible G-covers. This formula can
be interpreted as a representation-ring-valued relative Riemann-Hurwitz formula
for families of admissible G-covers.
