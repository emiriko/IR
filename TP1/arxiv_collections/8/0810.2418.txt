We report density dependent instabilities in the localised regime of
mesoscopic two-dimensional electron systems (2DES) with intermediate strength
of background disorder. They are manifested by strong resistance oscillations
induced by high perpendicular magnetic fields B_{\perp}. While the amplitude of
the oscillations is strongly enhanced with increasing B_{\perp}, their position
in density remains unaffected. The observation is accompanied by an unusual
behaviour of the temperature dependence of resistance and activation energies.
We suggest the interplay between a strongly interacting electron phase and the
background disorder as a possible explanation.
