During the last ten years or so, derivations of the Born rule based on
decision theory have been proposed and developed, and it is claimed that these
are valid in the context of the Everett interpretation. This claim is
critically assessed and it is shown that one of its key assumptions, although
natural in the context of the Copenhagen interpretation, is not consistent with
that of Everett. It is further argued that any interpretation that relates
outcome likelihood to the expansion coefficients connecting the wavefunction
with the eigenfunctions of the measurement operator must be inconsistent with
the Everett interpretation.
