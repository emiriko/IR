Lawler, Schramm and Werner showed that the scaling limit of the loop-erased
random walk on $\mathbb{Z}^2$ is $\mathrm{SLE}_2$. We consider scaling limits
of the loop-erasure of random walks on other planar graphs (graphs embedded
into $\mathbb{C}$ so that edges do not cross one another). We show that if the
scaling limit of the random walk is planar Brownian motion, then the scaling
limit of its loop-erasure is $\mathrm{SLE}_2$. Our main contribution is showing
that for such graphs, the discrete Poisson kernel can be approximated by the
continuous one. One example is the infinite component of super-critical
percolation on $\mathbb{Z}^2$. Berger and Biskup showed that the scaling limit
of the random walk on this graph is planar Brownian motion. Our results imply
that the scaling limit of the loop-erased random walk on the super-critical
percolation cluster is $\mathrm{SLE}_2$.
