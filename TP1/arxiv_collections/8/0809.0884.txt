The concept of metaphor, in particular graphical (or visual) metaphor, is
central to the field of information visualization. Information graphics and
interactive information visualization systems employ a variety of metaphorical
devices to make abstract, complex, voluminous, or otherwise
difficult-to-comprehend information understandable in graphical terms. This
paper explores the use of metaphor in information visualization, advancing the
theory previously argued by Johnson, Lakoff, Tversky et al. that many
information graphics are metaphorically understood in terms of cognitively
entrenched spatial patterns known as image schemas. These patterns serve to
structure and constrain abstract reasoning processes via metaphorical
projection operations that are grounded in everyday perceptual experiences with
phenomena such as containment, movement, and force dynamics. Building on
previous research, I argue that information graphics promote comprehension of
their target information through the use of graphical patterns that invoke
these preexisting schematic structures. I further theorize that the degree of
structural alignment of a particular graphic with one or more corresponding
image schemas accounts for its perceived degree of intuitiveness. Accordingly,
image schema theory can provide a powerful explanatory and predictive framework
for visualization research. I review relevant theories of analogy and metaphor,
and discuss the image schematic properties of several common types of
information graphic. I conclude with the proposal that the inventory of image
schemas culled from linguistic studies can serve as the basis for an inventory
of design elements suitable for developing intuitive and effective new
information visualization techniques.
