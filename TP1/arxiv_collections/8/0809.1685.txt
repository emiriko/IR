In this paper, we show a general way to interpret the infrastructure of a
global field of arbitrary unit rank. This interpretation generalizes the prior
concepts of the giant step operation and f-representations, and makes it
possible to relate the infrastructure to the (Arakelov) divisor class group of
the global field. In the case of global function fields, we present results
that establish that effective implementation of the presented methods is indeed
possible, and we show how Shanks' baby-step giant-step method can be
generalized to this situation.
