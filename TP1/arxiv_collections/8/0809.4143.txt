It is known that the total gravitational energy in localized sources having
static spherical symmetry and satisfying energy conditions is negative
(attractive gravity). A natural query is how the gravitational energy behaves
under circumstances where energy conditions are violated. To answer this, the
known expression for the gravitational energy is suitably modified to account
for situations like the ones occurring in wormhole spacetime. It is then
exemplified that in many cases the modified expression yields desirable
answers. The implications are discussed.
