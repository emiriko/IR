Given any fixed $N \times N$ positive semi-definite diagonal matrix $G\ge 0$
we derive the explicit formula for the density of complex eigenvalues for
random matrices $A$ of the form $A=U\sqrt{G}$} where the random unitary
matrices $U$ are distributed on the group $\mathrm{U(N)}$ according to the Haar
measure.
