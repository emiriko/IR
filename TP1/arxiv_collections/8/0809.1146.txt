We study the transport properties of disordered electron systems that contain
perfectly conducting channels. Two quantum network models that belong to
different universality classes, unitary and symplectic, are simulated
numerically. The perfectly conducting channel in the unitary class can be
realized in zigzag graphene nano-ribbons and that in the symplectic class is
known to appear in metallic carbon nanotubes. The existence of a perfectly
conducting channel leads to novel conductance distribution functions and a
shortening of the conductance decay length.
