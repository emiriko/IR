Hole propagator of spin 1/2 Calogero-Sutherland model is derived using
Uglov's method, which maps the exact eigenfunctions of the model, called
Yangian Gelfand-Zetlin basis, to a limit of Macdonald polynomials (gl_2-Jack
polynomials). To apply this mapping method to the calculation of 1-particle
Green's function, we confirm that the sum of the field annihilation operator on
Yangian Gelfand-Zetlin basis is transformed to the field annihilation operator
on gl_2-Jack polynomials by the mapping. The resultant expression for hole
propagator for finite-size system is written in terms of renormalized momenta
and spin of quasi-holes and the expression in the thermodynamic limit coincides
with the earlier result derived by another method. We also discuss the
singularity of the spectral function for a specific coupling parameter where
the hole propagator of spin Calogero-Sutherland model becomes equivalent to
dynamical colour correlation function of SU(3) Haldane-Shastry model.
