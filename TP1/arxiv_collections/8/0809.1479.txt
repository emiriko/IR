The effects of an unconditional move rule in the spatial Prisoner's Dilemma,
Snowdrift and Stag Hunt games are studied. Spatial structure by itself is known
to modify the outcome of many games when compared with a randomly mixed
population, sometimes promoting, sometimes inhibiting cooperation. Here we show
that random dilution and mobility may suppress the inhibiting factors of the
spatial structure in the Snowdrift game, while enhancing the already larger
cooperation found in the Prisoner's dilemma and Stag Hunt games.
