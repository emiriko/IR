By means of the isoconfigurational method we calculate the change in the
propensity for motion that the structure of a glass-forming system experiences
during its relaxation dynamics. The relaxation of such a system has been
demonstrated to evolve by means of rapid crossings between metabasins of its
potential energy surface (a metabasin being a group of mutually similar,
closely related structures which differ markedly from other metabasins), as
collectively relaxing units (d-clusters) take place. We now show that the
spatial distribution of propensity in the system does not change significantly
until one of these d-clusters takes place. However, the occurrence of a
d-cluster clearly de-correlates the propensity of the particles, thus ending up
with the dynamical influence of the structural features proper of the local
metabasin. We also show an important match between particles that participate
in d-clusters and that which show high changes in their propensity.
