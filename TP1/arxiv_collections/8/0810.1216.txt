This document presents the technical layout and the envisaged performance of
the Electromagnetic Calorimeter (EMC) for the PANDA target spectrometer. The
EMC has been designed to meet the physics goals of the PANDA experiment, which
is being developed for the Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR) at
Darmstadt, Germany. The performance figures are based on extensive prototype
tests and radiation hardness studies. The document shows that the EMC is ready
for construction up to the front-end electronics interface.
