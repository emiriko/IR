We revisit the previously unsolved problems of ensuring Lorentz invariance
and non-perturbative unitarity in Lee-Wick theories. We base our discussion on
an ultraviolet completion of QED by Lee-Wick ghost fields, which is argued to
be asymptotically safe. We argue that as long as the state space is based upon
a suitable choice of distributions of a type invented by Gel'fand and Shilov,
the Lee-Wick ghosts can be eliminated while preserving Lorentz invariance to
produce a unitary theory. The method for eliminating ghosts is in principle
non-perturbatively well-defined, in contrast with some previous proposals. We
also point out a second, independent mechanism for producing a unitary theory,
based on a covariant constraint on the maximum four-momentum, which would imply
an amusing connection, based on naturalness, between the coupling constant and
the hierarchy of scales in the theory. We further emphasize that the resulting
theory is causal, and point out some analogies between between the behaviour of
Lee-Wick ghost degrees of freedom and black holes.
