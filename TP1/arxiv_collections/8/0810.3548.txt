We present an update of results from the HPQCD collaboration on charm physics
using the Highly Improved Staggered Quark action. This includes a precise
determination of m_c using moments of current-current correlators combined with
high-order continuum QCD perturbation theory. We also include an update on the
determination of alpha_s from lattice QCD, preliminary results on the
determination of m_b and a summary plot of the status of the gold-plated meson
spectrum. There is an appendix on tackling systematic errors in fitting using
the Bayesian approach.
