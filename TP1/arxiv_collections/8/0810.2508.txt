We analyze the constituents stocks of the Dow Jones Industrial Average
(DJIA30) and the Standard & Poor's 100 index (S&P100) of the NYSE stock
exchange market. Surprisingly, we discover the data collapse of the histograms
of the DJIA30 price fluctuations and of the S&P100 price fluctuations to the
universal non-parametric Bramwell-Holdsworth-Pinton (BHP) distribution. Since
the BHP probability density function appears in several other dissimilar
phenomena, our result reveals an universal feature of the stock exchange
market.
