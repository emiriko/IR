Quasi-bound states in an open system do in general not form an orthogonal and
complete basis. It is, however, expected that the non-orthogonality is weak in
the case of well-confined states except close to a so-called exceptional point
in parameter space. We present numerical evidence showing that for passive
optical microspiral cavities the parameter regime where the non-orthogonality
is significant is rather broad. Here we observe almost-degenerate pairs of
well-confined modes which are highly non-orthogonal. Using a non-Hermitian
model Hamiltonian we demonstrate that this interesting phenomenon is related to
the asymmetric scattering between clockwise and counterclockwise propagating
waves in the spiral geometry. Numerical simulations of ray dynamics reveal a
clear ray-wave correspondence.
