We discuss quantum information processing with trapped electrons. After
recalling the operation principle of planar Penning traps we sketch the
experimental conditions to load, cool and detect single electrons. Here we
present a detailed investigation of a scalable scheme including feasibility
studies and the analysis of all important elements, relevant for the
experimental stage. On the theoretical side, we discuss different methods to
couple electron qubits. We estimate the relevant qubit coherence times and draw
implications for the experimental setting. A critical assessment of quantum
information processing with trapped electrons is concluding the article.
