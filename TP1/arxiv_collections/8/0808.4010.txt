In this paper, we consider the following type of non-local
  (pseudo-differential) operators $\LL $ on $\R^d$:
  $$
  \LL u(x) =\frac12 \sum_{i, j=1}^d \frac{\partial}{\partial x_i} (a_{ij}(x)
\frac{\partial}{\partial x_j}) +
  \lim_{\eps \downarrow 0} \int_{\{y\in \R^d: |y-x|>\eps\}}
  (u(y)-u(x)) J(x, y) dy,
  $$ where $A(x)=(a_{ij}(x))_{1\leq i, j\leq d}$ is a measurable $d\times d$
matrix-valued function on $\R^d$ that is uniform elliptic and bounded and $J$
is a symmetric measurable non-trivial non-negative kernel on $\R^d\times \R^d$
satisfying certain conditions. Corresponding to $\LL$ is a symmetric strong
Markov process $X$ on $\R^d$ that has both the diffusion component and pure
jump component. We establish a priori H\"older estimate for bounded parabolic
functions of $\LL$ and parabolic Harnack principle for positive parabolic
functions of $\LL$. Moreover, two-sided sharp heat kernel estimates are derived
for such operator $\LL$ and jump-diffusion $X$. In particular, our results
apply to the mixture of symmetric diffusion of uniformly elliptic divergence
form operator and mixed stable-like processes on $\R^d$. To establish these
results, we employ methods from both probability theory and analysis.
