We show that single walled carbon nanotubes with different isotope
compositions exhibit distinct Raman Gband peaks and can be used for multiplexed
multi-color Raman imaging of biological systems. Cancer cells with specific
receptors are selectively labeled with 3 differently colored SWNTs conjugated
with various targeting ligands including Herceptin, anti-Her2, Erbitux,
anti-Her1, and RGD peptide, allowing for multi-color Raman imaging of cells in
a multiplexed manner. SWNT Raman signals are highly robust against
photo-bleaching, allowing long term imaging and tracking. With narrow peak
features, SWNT Raman signals are easily differentiated from the
auto-fluorescence background. The SWNT Raman excitation and scattering photons
are in the near-infrared region, which is the most transparent optical window
for biological systems in vitro and in vivo. Thus, SWNTs are novel Raman tags
promising for multiplexed biological detection and imaging.
