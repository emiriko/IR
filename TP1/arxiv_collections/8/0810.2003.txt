The stability of steady, dynamic, anti-plane slipping at a planar interface
between two dissimilar anisotropic linear elastic solids is studied. The solids
are assumed to possess a plane of symmetry normal to the slip direction, so
that in-plane displacements and normal stress changes on the slip plane do not
occur. Friction at the interface is assumed to follow a rate and state
dependent law with velocity-weakening behavior in the steady state. The
stability to spatial perturbations of the form exp(ikx_1), where k is the
wavenumber and x_1 is the coordinate along the interface is studied. The
critical wavenumber magnitude, |k|_cr, above which there is stability and the
corresponding phase velocity, c, of the neutrally stable mode are obtained from
the stability analysis. Numerical plots showing the dependence of |k|_cr and c
on the unperturbed sliding velocity, V_o, are provided for various bi-material
combinations of practical interest.
