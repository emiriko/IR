The recently discovered high-temperature superconductivity in doped
quaternary iron oxypnictides correlates experimentally with a magnetic
instability. We have used first-principles calculations to determine a magnetic
phase diagram of ReO$_{1-\delta}$FeAs (Re=La--Dy) as a function of the doping
$\delta$, of the FeAs in-plane lattice constant $a$, and of the distance
between the Fe and As planes, that is qualitatively consistent with recent
experimental findings on the doping, internal (chemical) and external pressure
dependence. The existence of a tricritical point (TCP) in the phase diagram
suggests new ways of enhancing $T_c$.
