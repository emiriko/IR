We experimentally and numerically study a NbN superconducting stripline
resonator integrated with a microbridge. We find that the response of the
system to monochromatic excitation exhibits intermittency, namely,
noise-induced jumping between coexisting steady-state and limit-cycle
responses. A theoretical model that assumes piecewise linear dynamics yields
partial agreement with the experimental findings.
