The article presents a new interpretation for Zipf-Mandelbrot's law in
natural language which rests on two areas of information theory. Firstly, we
construct a new class of grammar-based codes and, secondly, we investigate
properties of strongly nonergodic stationary processes. The motivation for the
joint discussion is to prove a proposition with a simple informal statement: If
a text of length $n$ describes $n^\beta$ independent facts in a repetitive way
then the text contains at least $n^\beta/\log n$ different words, under
suitable conditions on $n$. In the formal statement, two modeling postulates
are adopted. Firstly, the words are understood as nonterminal symbols of the
shortest grammar-based encoding of the text. Secondly, the text is assumed to
be emitted by a finite-energy strongly nonergodic source whereas the facts are
binary IID variables predictable in a shift-invariant way.
