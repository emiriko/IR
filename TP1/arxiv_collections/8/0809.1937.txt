We use the torsional angles of the protein chain as generalized coordinates
in the canonical formalism, derive canonical equations of motion, and
investigate the coordinate dependence of the kinetic energy expressed in terms
of the canonical momenta. We use the formalism to compute the normal-frequency
distributions of the alpha-helix and the beta-sheet, under the assumption that
they are stabilized purely through hydrogen bonding. Comparison of their free
energies show the existence of a phase transition between the alpha-helix and
the beta-sheet at a critical temperature.
