The propagation of a modulated beam of charged particles in a planar crystal
channel is investigated. It is demonstrated that the beam preserves its
modulation at sufficiently large penetration depths to ensure the feasibility
of using a crystalline undulator as a coherent source of hard X rays. This
finding is a crucial milestone in developing a new type of lasers radiating in
the hard X ray and gamma ray range.
