We report systematic $^{75}$As NMR studies on LaFeAs(O$_{1-x}$F$_{x}$) ($0\le
x\le0.14$). At $x=0.04$ near the phase boundary, from resistivity, spin-lattice
relaxation rate $1/T_1$, and NMR spectrum measurements, we found weak magnetic
order at $T_N\simeq 30$ K. Antiferromagnetic (AFM) fluctuations proved through
$1/T_1$ are suppressed significantly with F-doping, and pseudogap behavior
without pronounced AFM fluctuations is observed at $x=0.11$ where $T_c$ is
maximum. This significant suppression of $1/T_1T$ upon F-doping while $T_c$
remains nearly unchanged suggests that low-energy AFM fluctuations probed with
$^{75}$As NMR do not play a crucial role in the superconductivity.
