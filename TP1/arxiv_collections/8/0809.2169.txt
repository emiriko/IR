The recent discovery of arsenic-based high temperature superconductors has
reignited interest in the study of superconductor : biological interfaces.
However, the new superconductor materials involve the chemistry of arsenic,
their toxicity remain unclear [ Nature, 2008, 452(24):922]. In this study the
possible adverse effects of this new family of superconductors on cells have
been examined. Cell culture studies in conjunction with microscopy and
viability assays were employed to examine the influence of arsenic-based
superconductor PrOxFeAs (x=0.75) material in vitro. Imaging data revealed that
cells were well adhered and spread on the surface of the superconductor.
Furthermore, cytotoxicity studies showed that cells were unaffected during the
time-course of the experiments, providing support for the biocompatibility
aspects of PrOxFeAs-based superconductor material.
