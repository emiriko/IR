It is proven that K-causality coincides with stable causality, and that in a
K-causal spacetime the relation K^+ coincides with the Seifert's relation. As a
consequence the causal relation "the spacetime is strongly causal and the
closure of the causal relation is transitive" stays between stable causality
and causal continuity.
