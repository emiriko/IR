An electrical method is used to study the early stages of coalescence of two
low-viscosity drops. A drop of aqueous NaCl solution is suspended in air above
a second drop of the same solution which is grown until the drops touch. At
that point a rapidly widening bridge forms between them. By measuring the
resistance and capacitance of the system during this coalescence event, one can
obtain information about the time dependence of the characteristic bridge
radius and its characteristic height. At early times, a new asymptotic regime
is observed that is inconsistent with previous theoretical predictions. The
measurements at several drop radii and approach velocities are consistent with
a model in which the two liquids coalesce with a slightly deformed interface.
