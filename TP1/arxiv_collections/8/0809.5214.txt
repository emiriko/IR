In this paper, we discuss the phenomenon of a spontaneous polarisation of a
neutral hard planar interface for valence asymmetric coulombic systems. Within
a field theoretical description, we account for the existence of non trivial
charge density and electric potential profiles. The analysis of the phenomenon
shows that the effect is related to combinatorics in relation with the
existence of the two independent species cations and anions. This simple and
basic feature is related to the quantum mechanical properties of the system.
The theoretical results are compared with numerical simulations data and are
shown to be in very good agreement, which a fortiori justifies our physical
interpretation.
