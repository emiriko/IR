In arXiv:0806.4682 the self-energy and self-angular momentum (i.e.,
electromagnetic mass and spin) of a classical point-electron were calculated in
a Colombeau algebra. In the present paper these quantities are calculated in
the better known framework of `regularized distributions,' i.e., the customary
setting used in field-theory to manipulate diverging integrals, distributions,
and their products. The purpose is to compare these two frameworks, and to
highlight the reasons why the Colombeau theory of nonlinear generalized
functions could be the physically preferred setting for making these
calculations. In particular, it is shown that, in the Colombeau algebra, the
point-electron's mass and spin are {exact} integrals of squares of
delta-functions, whereas this is only an approximation in the customary
framework.
