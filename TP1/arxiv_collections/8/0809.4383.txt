In extra dimensional models with Kaluza-Klein graviton states that are well
separated in mass, such states may be observed as resonances in collider
experiments. We extend previous works on such scenarios by considering the
one-loop resonant production of a Z boson in association with a photon. We find
the production rate to be negligible in conservative scenarios, and
sufficiently small for observation to be very difficult even for reasonable
luminosity in less conservative scenarios.
