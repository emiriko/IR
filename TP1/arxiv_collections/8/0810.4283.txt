The capability of density-functional theory to deal with the ground-state of
strongly correlated low-dimensional systems, such as semiconductor quantum
dots, depends on the accuracy of functionals developed for the exchange and
correlation energies. Here we extend a successful approximation for the
correlation energy of the three dimensional inhomogeneous electron gas,
originally introduced by Becke [J. Chem. Phys. {\bf 88}, 1053 (1988)], to the
two-dimensional case. The approach aims to non-empirical modeling of the
correlation-hole functions satisfying a set of exact properties. Furthermore,
the electron current and spin are explicitly taken into account. As a result,
good performance is obtained in comparison with numerically exact data for
quantum dots with varying external magnetic field, and for the homogeneous
two-dimensional electron gas, respectively.
