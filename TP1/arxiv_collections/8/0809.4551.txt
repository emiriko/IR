We study the bosonic Boltzmann-Nordheim kinetic equation, which describes the
kinetic regime of weakly interacting bosons with s-wave scattering only. We
consider a spatially homogeneous fluid with an isotropic momentum distribution.
The issue of the dynamical formation of a Bose-Einstein condensate has been
studied extensively. We supply here the completed equations of motion for the
coupled system, the energy density distribution of the normal fluid and the
density of the condensate. With this information the post-nucleation
self-similar solution is investigated in more detail than before.
