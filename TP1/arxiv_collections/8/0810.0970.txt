We report on a photoconductive gain in semiconductor quantum wires which are
lithographically defined in an AlGaAs/GaAs quantum well via a shallow-etch
technique. The effect allows resolving the one-dimensional subbands of the
quantum wires as maxima in the photoresponse across the quantum wires. We
interpret the results by optically induced holes in the valence band of the
quantum well which shift the one-dimensional subbands of the quantum wire. Here
we demonstrate that the effect persists up to a temperature of about 17 Kelvin.
