We derive a class of charged rotating dilaton black string solutions in the
background of anti-de-Sitter spaces with an appropriate combination of three
Liouville-type dilaton potentials. We also present the suitable counterterm
which removes the divergences of the action in the presence of dilaton
potential. The solutions are analyzed and their thermodynamics is discussed by
using the counterterm method.
