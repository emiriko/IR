We present preliminary results on inclusive direct photon production in
$p\bar{p}$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}$=1.96 TeV, using data collected with the
upgraded Collider Detector at Fermilab in Run II, corresponding to an
integrated luminosity of 451 pb$^{-1}$. Measurements are performed as a
function of the photon transverse momentum for photons with $p_{T}>$30 GeV and
$|\eta|<$1.0. Photons are required to be isolated in the calorimeter. The
measurement is corrected to the hadron level and compared to NLO pQCD
predictions.
