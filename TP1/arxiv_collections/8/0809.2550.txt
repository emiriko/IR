We present a model for electron scattering off nuclei and photon absorption
in the resonance energy region (W <= 2 GeV). The elementary gamma/gamma*
N-vertex is described using in-medium kinematics and up-to-date form factors
for QE-scattering, pion-production form-factors and resonance helicity
amplitudes of the MAID analysis. We find good agreement with inclusive data on
electron scattering off Oxygen. For photon absorption in Carbon we find a large
impact of the momentum dependent mean-field acting on initial- and final-state
baryons.
