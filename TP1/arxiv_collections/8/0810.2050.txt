Recent experimental results on the spectroscopy of B hadrons are presented.
The focus is primarily on the heavier states currently accessible only at the
Tevatron and the B factories running at the Upsilon(5S) resonance, i.e., Bs*,
the L = 1 orbitally excited states B** and $Bs**, and the new b-baryon states
Sigma(*)_b, Xi_b, and Omega_b.
