In this work, we have investigated whether Y(4260) and ${\rm Z^{+}_2(4250)}$
could be ${\rm D_1D}$ or ${\rm D_0D^{*}}$ molecules in the framework of meson
exchange model. The off-diagonal interaction induced by $\pi$ exchange plays a
dominant role. The $\sigma$ exchange has been taken into account, which leads
to diagonal interaction. The contribution of $\sigma$ exchange is not favorable
to the formation of molecular state ${\rm with I^{G}(J^{PC})=0^{-}(1^{--})}$,
however, it is beneficial to the binding of molecule ${\rm with
I^{G}(J^{P})=1^{-}(1^{-})}$. Light vector meson exchange leads to diagonal
interaction as well. For ${\rm Z^{+}_2(4250)}$, the contribution from $\rho$
and $\omega$ exchange almost cancels each other. For the currently allowed
values of the effective coupling constants and a reasonable cutoff $\Lambda$ in
the range 1-2 GeV, We find that Y(4260) could be accommodated as a ${\rm D_1D}$
and ${\rm D_0D^{*}}$ molecule, whereas the interpretation of ${\rm
Z^{+}_2(4250)}$ as a ${\rm D_1D}$ or ${\rm D_0D^{*}}$ molecule is disfavored.
The bottom analog of Y(4260) and ${\rm Z^{+}_2(4250)}$ may exist, and the most
promising channels to discovery them are $\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\Upsilon$ and
$\pi^{+}\chi_{b1}$ respectively.
