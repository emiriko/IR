The appearance of the big bounce (BB) in the evolution of the universe is
analyzed in the setting of loop quantum cosmology (LQC). Making use of an idea
of a minimum length turns classical Big Bang into BB. We argue why the spectrum
of the kinematical area operator of loop quantum gravity cannot be used for the
determination of this length. We find that the fundamental length, at the
present stage of development of LQC, is a free parameter of this model.
