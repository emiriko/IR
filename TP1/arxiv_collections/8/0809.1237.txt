We have discussed dynamical properties of the Tsallis entropy and the
generalized Fisher information in nonextensive systems described by the
Langevin model subjected to additive and multiplicative noise. Analytical
expressions for the time-dependent Tsallis entropy and generalized Fisher
information have been obtained with the use of the $q$-moment approach to the
Fokker-Planck equation developed in a previous study [H. Hasegawa, Phys. Rev. E
{\bf 77}, 031133 (2008)]. Model calculations of the information entropies in
response to an applied pulse and sinusoidal inputs have been presented.
