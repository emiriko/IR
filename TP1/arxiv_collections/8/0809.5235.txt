We discuss the renormalization of gauge-invariant transverse-momentum
dependent (TMD), i.e., unintegrated, parton distribution functions (PDFs) and
carry out the calculation of their anomalous dimension at one loop. We show
that in the light-cone gauge, TMD PDFs contain UV divergences that may be
attributed to the renormalization effect on a cusp-like junction point of the
gauge contours at infinity. In order to eliminate the anomalous dimension
ensuing from this cusp, we propose to use in the definition of the TMD PDFs, a
soft counter term in terms of a path-ordered phase factor along a particular
cusped contour extending to transverse light-cone infinity and comprising
light-like and transverse segments. We argue that this additional factor is
analogous to the "intrinsic" Coulomb phase factor found before in QED.
