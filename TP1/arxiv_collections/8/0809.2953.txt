As a follow up to the previous talk about the beta function of SU(3) gauge
theory with Nf=2 symmetric representation (clover) fermions [arXiv:0809.2885
[hep-lat]], we describe our explorations of the beta-kappa plane, away from the
massless limit. Our simulations are mostly done on lattices of length L=8 and
12. We observe a phase transition from a strong coupling confined phase to a
deconfined, chirally restored phase. The line of transitions avoids (so far)
the location of the infrared fixed point discussed in the last talk.
