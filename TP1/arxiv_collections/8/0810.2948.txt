The Double Chooz experiment returns to the site of the Chooz experiment with
a pair of detectors for a differential neutrino flux measurement, providing
sensitivity to sin^2(2theta13) > 0.03. Reaching this goal requires significant
improvements in systematic uncertainties, based on the experience with previous
reactor neutrino experiments.
