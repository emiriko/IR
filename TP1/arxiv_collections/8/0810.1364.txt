Pure phases of a new oxyarsenide superconductor of the nominal composition
CeOFe0.9Co0.1As was successfully synthesized by solid state reaction in sealed
silica ampoules at 1180 C. It crystallizes in the layered tetragonal ZrCuSiAs
type structure (sp gp P4/nmm) with lattice parameter of a = 3.9918(5) angstrom
and c = 8.603(1) angstrom. A sharp superconducting transition is observed at
11.31 K with an upper critical field of 45.22 T at ambient pressure. The
superconducting transition temperature is drastically lowered (~ 4.5, 4.9 K) on
increasing the concentration (x = 0.15, 0.2) of cobalt.
