We prove cocycle and orbit equivalence superrigidity for lattices in SL(n,R)
acting linearly on R^n, as well as acting projectively on certain flag
manifolds, including the real projective space. The proof combines operator
algebraic techniques with the property (T) in the sense of Zimmer for the
action of SL(n,Z) on R^n, n \geq 4. We also show that the restriction of the
associated orbit equivalence relation to a subset of finite Lebesgue measure,
provides a II_1 equivalence relation with property (T) and yet fundamental
group equal to R_+.
