The latest measurements of the cross sections for neutral and charged current
deep inelastic scattering in e+/-p collisions at HERA with longitudinally
polarised lepton beams are presented. The measured cross sections are compared
with the predictions of the Standard Model. Next-to-leading-order QCD analyses
of HERA data are also presented. The analyses yield the parton distribution
functions of the proton and are extended to also extract electroweak
parameters. The determinations from HERA are compared with those from LEP and
the Tevatron.
