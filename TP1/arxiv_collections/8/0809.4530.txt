Wikipedia is a goldmine of information; not just for its many readers, but
also for the growing community of researchers who recognize it as a resource of
exceptional scale and utility. It represents a vast investment of manual effort
and judgment: a huge, constantly evolving tapestry of concepts and relations
that is being applied to a host of tasks.
  This article provides a comprehensive description of this work. It focuses on
research that extracts and makes use of the concepts, relations, facts and
descriptions found in Wikipedia, and organizes the work into four broad
categories: applying Wikipedia to natural language processing; using it to
facilitate information retrieval and information extraction; and as a resource
for ontology building. The article addresses how Wikipedia is being used as is,
how it is being improved and adapted, and how it is being combined with other
structures to create entirely new resources. We identify the research groups
and individuals involved, and how their work has developed in the last few
years. We provide a comprehensive list of the open-source software they have
produced.
