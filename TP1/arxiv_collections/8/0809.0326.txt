We introduce the concept of non-deterministic noiseless linear amplification.
We propose a linear optical realization of this transformation that could be
built with current technology. We discuss two applications; ideal probabilistic
cloning of coherent states and distillation of continuous variable
entanglement. For the latter example we demonstrate that highly pure
entanglement can be distilled from transmission over a lossy channel.
