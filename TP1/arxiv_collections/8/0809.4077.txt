We present low temperature tunneling density-of-states measurements in Al
films in high parallel magnetic fields. The thickness range of the films, t=6-9
nm, was chosen so that the orbital and Zeeman contributions to their parallel
critical fields were comparable. In this quasi-spin paramagnetically limited
configuration, the field produces a significant suppression of the gap, and at
high fields the gapless state is reached. By comparing measured and calculated
tunneling spectra we are able to extract the value of the antisymmetric
Fermi-liquid parameter G^0 and thereby deduce the quasiparticle density
dependence of the effective parameter G^0_{eff} across the gapless state.
