The longitudinal resistivity of two dimensional (2D) electrons placed in
strong magnetic field is significantly reduced by applied electric field, an
effect which is studied in a broad range of magnetic fields and temperatures in
GaAs quantum wells with high electron density. The data are found to be in good
agreement with theory, considering the strong nonlinearity of the resistivity
as result of non-uniform spectral diffusion of the 2D electrons. Inelastic
processes limit the diffusion. Comparison with the theory yields the inelastic
scattering time of the two dimensional electrons. In the temperature range
T=2-10(K) for overlapping Landau levels, the inelastic scattering rate is found
to be proportional to T^2, indicating a dominant contribution of the
electron-electron scattering to the inelastic relaxation. In a strong magnetic
field, the nonlinear resistivity demonstrates scaling behavior, indicating a
specific regime of electron heating of well-separated Landau levels. In this
regime the inelastic scattering rate is found to be proportional to T^3,
suggesting the electron-phonon scattering as the dominant mechanism of the
inelastic relaxation.
