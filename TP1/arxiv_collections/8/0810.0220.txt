For zero-sum two-player continuous-time games with integral payoff and
incomplete information on one side, one shows that the optimal strategy of the
informed player can be computed through an auxiliary optimization problem over
some martingale measures. One also characterizes the optimal martingale
measures and compute it explicitely in several examples.
