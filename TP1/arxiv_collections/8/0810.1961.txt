We extend our previous calculation of the quasi-local contribution to the
self-force on a scalar particle to general (not necessarily geodesic) motion in
a general spacetime. In addition to the general case and the case of a particle
at rest in a stationary spacetime, we consider as examples a particle held at
rest in Reissner-Nordstrom and Kerr-Newman space-times. This allows us to most
easily analyse the effect of non-geodesic motion on our previous results and
also allows for comparison to existing results for Schwarzschild spacetime.
