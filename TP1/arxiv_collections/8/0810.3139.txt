An update profile of the CKM matrix is given, providing numerical and
graphical constraints on the CKM parameters in the Standard Model. Constraints
on additional parameters accounting for possible new physics contribution in a
model-independent analysis are also reported with emphasis on the leptonic
decay of the Bd and on the Bs mixing phase.
