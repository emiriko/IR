We consider in this paper a two-pulse photon echo sequence as a potential
quantum light storage protocol. It is widely believed that a two-pulse scheme
should lead to very low efficiency and is then not relevant for this specific
application. We show experimentally by using a Tm${}^{3+}$:YAG crystal that
such a protocol is on contrary very efficient and even too efficient to be
considered as a good quantum storage protocol. Our experimental work allows us
to point out on one side the real limitations of this scheme and on the other
side its benefits which can be a source of inspiration to conceive more
promising procedures with rare-earth ion doped crystals.
