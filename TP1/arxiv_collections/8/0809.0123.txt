We derive the exact modified London equation for the two-gap superconductor,
compare it with its single-gap counterpart. We show that the vortices in the
two-gap superconductor are soft (or continuous) core vortices. In particular,
we discuss the topological structure of the finite energy vortices
(Abrikosov-like vortices), and find that they can be viewed as the incarnation
of the baby skyrmion stretched in the third direction. Besides, we point out
that the knot soliton in the two-gap superconductor is the twisted
Abrikosov-like vortex with its two periodic ends connected smoothly. The
relation between the magnetic monopoles and the Abrikosov-like vortices is also
discussed briefly.
