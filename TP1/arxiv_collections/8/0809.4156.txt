We consider the ADE-series of (2, 0) supersymmetric quantum theories on T^5
\times R, where the first factor is a flat spatial five-torus, and the second
factor denotes time. The quantum states of such a theory \Phi are characterized
by a discrete quantum number f \in H^3 (T^5, C), where the finite abelian group
C is the center subgroup of the corresponding simply connected simply laced Lie
group G. At energies that are low compared to the inverse size of the T^5, the
spectrum consists of a set of continua of states, each of which is
characterized by the value of f and some number 5r of additional continuous
parameters. By exploiting the interpretation of this theory as the ultraviolet
completion of maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory on T^4 \times S^1
\times R with gauge group G_{adj} = G/C and coupling constant g given by the
square root of the radius of the S^1 factor, one may compute the number N_f^r
(\Phi) of such continua. We perform these calculations in detail for the A- and
D-series. While the Yang-Mills theory formalism is manifestly invariant under
the \SL_4 (Z) mapping class group of T^4, the results are actually found to be
invariant under the \SL_5 (Z) mapping class group of T^5, which provides a
strong consistency check.
