The CAST (CERN Axion Solar Telescope) experiment is searching for solar
axions by their conversion into photons inside the magnet pipe of an LHC
dipole. The analysis of the data recorded during the first phase of the
experiment with vacuum in the magnet pipes has resulted in the most restrictive
experimental limit on the coupling constant of axions to photons. In the second
phase, CAST is operating with a buffer gas inside the magnet pipes in order to
extent the sensitivity of the experiment to higher axion masses. We will
present the first results on the $^{4}{\rm He}$ data taking as well as the
system upgrades that have been operated in the last year in order to adapt the
experiment for the $^{3}{\rm He}$ data taking. Expected sensitivities on the
coupling constant of axions to photons will be given for the recent $^{3}{\rm
He}$ run just started in March 2008.
