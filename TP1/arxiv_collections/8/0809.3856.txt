We propose a new approach to quantum phase transitions in terms of the
density-functional fidelity, which measures the similarity between density
distributions of two ground states in parameter space. The key feature of the
approach, as we will show, is that the density-functional fidelity can be
measured easily in experiments. Both the validity and versatility of the
approach are checked by the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model and the one-dimensional
Hubbard model.
