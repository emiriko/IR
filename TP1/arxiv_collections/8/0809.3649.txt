Generalization of a known theorem to generate static, spherically symmetric
black-hole solutions in higher dimensional Lovelock gravity is presented.
Particular limits, such as Gauss-Bonnet (GB) and/or Einstein-Hilbert (EH) in
any dimension $N$ yield all the solutions known to date with an
energy-momentum. In our generalization, with special emphasis on the third
order Lovelock gravity, we have found two different class of solutions
characterized by the matter field parameter. Several particular cases are
studied and properties related to asymptotic behaviours are discussed. Our
general solution which covers topological black holes as well, splits naturally
into distinct classes such as Chern-Simon (CS) and Born-Infeld (BI) in higher
dimensions. The occurence of naked singularities are studied and it is found
that, the spacetime behaves nonsingular in quantum mechanical sense when it is
probed with quantum test particles. The theorem is extended to cover
Bertotti-Robinson (BR) type solutions in the presence of the GB parameter
alone. Finally we prove also that extension of the theorem for a scalar-tensor
source of higher dimensions $(N>4)$ fails to work.
