Nuclear electromagnetic currents derived in a chiral-effective-field-theory
framework including explicit nucleons, $\Delta$ isobars, and pions up to
N$^2$LO, {\it i.e.} ignoring loop corrections, are used in a study of neutron
radiative captures on protons and deuterons at thermal energies, and of $A$=2
and 3 nuclei magnetic moments. With the strengths of the $\Delta$-excitation
currents determined to reproduce the $n$-$p$ cross section and isovector
combination of the trinucleon magnetic moments, we find that the cross section
and photon circular polarization parameter, measured respectively in $n$-$d$
and $\vec{n}$-$d$ processes, are significantly underpredicted by theory.
