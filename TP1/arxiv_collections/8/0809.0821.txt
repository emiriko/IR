In the context of 331 models we analyze the phenomenology of exotic $T$
quarks with electric charge 2/3. We establish bounds for the corresponding
masses and mixing angles and study the decay modes $T\to bW$, $tZ$ and $qH$. It
is found that the decays into scalars are strongly dependent on the model
parameters, and can be the dominant ones in a scenario with approximate flavor
symmetry.
