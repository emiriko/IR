We solve the O(n) model, defined in terms of self- and mutually avoiding
loops coexisting with voids, on a 3-simplex fractal lattice, using an exact
real space renormalization group technique. As the density of voids is
decreased, the model shows a critical point, and for even lower densities of
voids, there is a dense phase showing power-law correlations, with critical
exponents that depend on n, but are independent of density. At n=-2 on the
dilute branch, a trivalent vertex defect acts as a marginal perturbation. We
define a model of biconnected clusters which allows for a finite density of
such vertices. As n is varied, we get a line of critical points of this
generalized model, emanating from the point of marginality in the original loop
model. We also study another perturbation of adding local bending rigidity to
the loop model, and find that it does not affect the universality class.
