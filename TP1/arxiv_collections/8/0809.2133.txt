Cavity quantum electrodynamic schemes for quantum gates are amongst the
earliest quantum computing proposals. Despite continued progress, and the
dramatic recent demonstration of photon blockade, there are still issues with
optimal coupling and gate operation involving high-quality cavities. Here we
show dynamic control techniques that allow scalable cavity-QED based quantum
gates, that use the full bandwidth of the cavities. When applied to quantum
gates, these techniques allow an order of magnitude increase in operating
speed, and two orders of magnitude reduction in cavity Q, over passive
cavity-QED architectures. Our methods exploit Stark shift based Q-switching,
and are ideally suited to solid-state integrated optical approaches to quantum
computing.
