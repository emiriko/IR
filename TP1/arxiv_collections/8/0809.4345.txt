In the present paper MAPLE subroutines computing Milnor and Tyurina numbers
of an isolated algebraic hypersurface singularity are presented and described
in detail. They represents examples, and perhaps the first ones, of a MAPLE
implementation of local monomial ordering.
  As an application, the last section is devoted to writing down equations of
algebraic stratifications of Kuranishi spaces of simple Arnol'd singularities:
they geometrically represents, by means of inclusions of algebraic subsets, the
partial ordering on classes of simple singularities induced by the adjacency
relation.
