We demonstrate that exclusive B decays to P-wave charmonium factorize in the
non-relativistic limit provided that colour-octet contributions are taken into
account, and estimate the branching fractions. Although there are very large
uncertainties, we find reasonable parameter choices, where the main features of
the data -- large corrections to (naive) factorization and suppression of the
chi_{c2} and h_c final states -- are reproduced though the suppression of
chi_{c2} is not as strong as seen in the data. Our results also provide an
example, where an endpoint divergence in hard spectator-scattering factorizes
and is absorbed into colour-octet operator matrix elements.
