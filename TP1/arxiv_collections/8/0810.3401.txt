In this paper, the crossing symmetry of the photons, from spontaneous
parametric down conversion (SPDC) phenomena in nonlinear crystals, is used for
the development of a new geometric optics based on quantum kinematic
correlations. On this basis, a new interpretation of the recent results on the
two photon entangled experiment is obtained. A new field of applications is
suggested.
