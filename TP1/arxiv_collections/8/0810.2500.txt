We establish a description of the maximal C*-algebra of quotients of a unital
C*-algebra $A$ as a direct limit of spaces of completely bounded bimodule
homomorphisms from certain operator submodules of the Haagerup tensor product
$A\otimes_h A$ labelled by the essential closed right ideals of $A$ into $A$.
In addition the invariance of the construction of the maximal C*-algebra of
quotients under strong Morita equivalence is proved.
