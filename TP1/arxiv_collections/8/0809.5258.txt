We study four dimensional gravity with a negative cosmological constant
deformed by the Nieh-Yan torsional topological invariant with a
spacetime-dependent coefficient. We find an exact solution of the Euclidean
system, which we call the torsion vortex, having two asymptotic AdS4 regimes
supported by a pseudoscalar with a kink profile. We propose that the torsion
vortex is the holographic dual of a three dimensional system that exhibits
distinct parity breaking vacua. The torsion vortex represents a (holographic)
transition between these distinct vacua. We expect that from the boundary point
of view, the torsion vortex represents a `domain wall' between the two distinct
vacua.
  From a bulk point of view, we point out an intriguing identification of the
parameters of the torsion vortex with those of an Abrikosov vortex in a Type I
superconductor. Following the analogy, we find that external Kalb-Ramond flux
then appears to support bubbles of flat spacetime within an asymptotically AdS
geometry.
