The dynamic observation of domain wall motion induced by electric field in
magnetoelectric iron garnet film is reported. Measurements in 800 kV/cm
electric field pulses gave the domain wall velocity ~45 m/s. Similar velocity
was achieved in magnetic field pulse about 50 Oe. Reversible and irreversible
micromagnetic structure transformation is demonstrated. These effects are
promising for applications in spintronics and magnetic memory.
