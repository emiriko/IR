We propose to improve medical decision making and reduce global health care
costs by employing a free Internet-based medical information system with two
main target groups: practicing physicians and medical researchers. After
acquiring patients' consent, physicians enter medical histories, physiological
data and symptoms or disorders into the system; an integrated expert system can
then assist in diagnosis and statistical software provides a list of the most
promising treatment options and medications, tailored to the patient.
Physicians later enter information about the outcomes of the chosen treatments,
data the system uses to optimize future treatment recommendations. Medical
researchers can analyze the aggregate data to compare various drugs or
treatments in defined patient populations on a large scale.
