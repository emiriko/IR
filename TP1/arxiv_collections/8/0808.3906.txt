In this paper, we describe some applications of Self Organizing feature map
Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (SONFIS) and Self Organizing feature map Rough Set
(SORST) in analysis of permeability at a dam site and lost circulation in the
drilling of three wells in Iran. Elicitation of the best rules on the
information tables, exploration of the dominant structures on the behaviour of
systems while they fall in to the balance of the second granulation level
(rules) and highlighting of most effective attributes (parameters) on the
selected systems, are some of the benefits of the proposed methods. In the
other process, using complex networks (graphs) theory - as another method in
not 1:1 modelling branch- mechanical behaviour of a rock joint has been
investigated. Keywords: Information Granules; SONFIS; SORST; Complex Networks;
