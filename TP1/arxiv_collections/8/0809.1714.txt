A limitation on simultaneous measurement of two arbitrary positive operator
valued measures is discussed. In general, simultaneous measurement of two
noncommutative observables is only approximately possible. Following Werner's
formulation, we introduce a distance between observables to quantify an
accuracy of measurement. We derive an inequality that relates the achievable
accuracy with noncommutativity between two observables. As a byproduct a
necessary condition for two positive operator valued measures to be
simultaneously measurable is obtained.
