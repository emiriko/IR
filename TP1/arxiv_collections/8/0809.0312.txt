Spin noise spectroscopy with a single laser beam is demonstrated
theoretically to provide a direct probe of the spatial correlations of cold
fermionic gases. We show how the generic many-body phenomena of anti-bunching,
pairing, antiferromagnetic, and algebraic spin liquid correlations can be
revealed by measuring the spin noise as a function of laser width, temperature,
and frequency.
