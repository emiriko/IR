We simulate lattice models in the three-dimensional XY universality class in
the low and the high temperature phase. This allows us to compute a number of
universal amplitude ratios with unprecedented precision: R_{\Upsilon}=0.411(2),
R_B=2.83(1), R_{\xi}^+=0.3562(10) and R_{\xi}^-=0.850(5). These results can be
compared with those obtained from other theoretical methods, such as field
theoretic methods or the high temperature series expansion and also with
experimental results for the lambda-transition of $^4$He. In addition to the XY
model, we study the three-dimensional two-component $\phi^4$ model on the
simple cubic lattice. The parameter of the $\phi^4$ model is chosen such that
leading corrections to scaling are small.
