We discuss superstatistics theory of labour productivity. Productivity
distribution across workers, firms and industrial sectors are studied
empirically and found to obey power-distributions, in sharp contrast to the
equilibrium theories of mainstream economics. The Pareto index is found to
decrease with the level of aggregation, {\it i.e.}, from workers to firms and
to industrial sectors. In order to explain these phenomenological laws, we
propose a superstatistics framework, where the role of the fluctuating
temperature is played by the fluctuating demand.
