Future high precision electroweak measurements require understanding of
Standard Model expectations to multi-loop accuracy, both, for the predictions
of production cross-sections of signal and background, as well as for
pseudo-observables. I review recent results from precision calculations and
summarize projections and implications for the Tevatron, the LHC, CEBAF, and
the ILC.
