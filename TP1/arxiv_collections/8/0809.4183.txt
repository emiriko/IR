Relay attacks are a major concern for RFID systems: during an authentication
process an adversary transparently relays messages between a verifier and a
remote legitimate prover.
  We present an authentication protocol suited for RFID systems. Our solution
is the first that prevents relay attacks without degrading the authentication
security level: it minimizes the probability that the verifier accepts a fake
proof of identity, whether or not a relay attack occurs.
