We provide an in depth analysis of the theory proposed by Holzmann,
Chevallier and Krauth (HCK) [Europhys. Lett., {\bf 82}, 30001 (2008)] for
predicting the temperature at which the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT)
transition to a superfluid state occurs in the harmonically trapped
quasi-two-dimensional (2D) Bose gas. Their theory is based on a meanfield model
of the system density and we show that the HCK predictions change appreciably
when an improved meanfield theory and identification of the transition point is
used. In this analysis we develop a consistent theory that provides a lower
bound for the BKT transition temperature in the trapped quasi-2D Bose gas.
