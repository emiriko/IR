We study the continuous absorbing-state phase transition in the contact
process on the Voronoi-Delaunay lattice. The Voronoi construction is a natural
way to introduce quenched coordination disorder in lattice models. We simulate
the disordered system using the quasistationary simulation method and determine
its critical exponents and moment ratios. Our results suggest that the critical
behavior of the disordered system is unchanged with respect to that on a
regular lattice, i.e., that of directed percolation.
