Analytical queries defined on data warehouses are complex and use several
join operations that are very costly, especially when run on very large data
volumes. To improve response times, data warehouse administrators casually use
indexing techniques. This task is nevertheless complex and fastidious. In this
paper, we present an automatic, dynamic index selection method for data
warehouses that is based on incremental frequent itemset mining from a given
query workload. The main advantage of this approach is that it helps update the
set of selected indexes when workload evolves instead of recreating it from
scratch. Preliminary experimental results illustrate the efficiency of this
approach, both in terms of performance enhancement and overhead.
