We have developed a new efficient and accurate impurity solver for the single
impurity Anderson model (SIAM), which is based on a non-perturbative recursion
technique in a space of operators and involves expanding the self-energy as a
continued fraction. The method has no special occupation number or temperature
restrictions; the only approximation is the number of levels of the continued
fraction retained in the expansion. We also show how this approach can be used
as a new approach to Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMTF) and illustrate this
with the Hubbard model. The three lowest orders of recursion give the
Hartree-Fock, Hubbard I, and Hubbard III approximations. A higher level of
recursion is able to reproduce the expected 3-peak structure in the spectral
function and Fermi liquid behavior.
