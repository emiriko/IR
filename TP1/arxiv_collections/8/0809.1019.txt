The shape and size of the objects, which we see on the screen, when the
application is running, are defined at the design time. By using some sort of
adaptive interface, developers give users a chance to resize these objects or
on rare occasion even change, but all these changes are predetermined by a
developer; user can't go out of the designer's scenario. Making each and all
elements moveable / resizable and giving users the full control of these
processes, changes the whole idea of applications; programs become user-driven
and significantly increase the effectiveness of users' work. This article is
about the instrument to turn any screen object into moveable / resizable.
