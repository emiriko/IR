This report concerns the inverse problem of estimating a spacially dependent
coefficient of a partial differential equation from observations of the
solution at the boundary. Such a problem can be formulated as an optimal
control problem with the coefficient as the control variable and the solution
as state variable. The heat or the wave equation is here considered as state
equation. It is well known that such inverse problems are ill-posed and need to
be regularized. The powerful Hamilton-Jacobi theory is used to construct a
simple and general method where the first step is to analytically regularize
the Hamiltonian; next its Hamiltonian system, a system of nonlinear partial
differential equations, is solved with the Newton method and a sparse Jacobian.
