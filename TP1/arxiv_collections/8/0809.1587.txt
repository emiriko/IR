Dynamical aspects of quantum Brownian motion in a low temperature environment
are investigated. We give a systematic calculation of quantum entanglement
among two Brownian oscillators without invoking Born-Markov approximation
widely used for the study of open systems. Our approach is suitable to probe
short time dynamics at cold temperatures where many experiments on quantum
information processing are performed.
