Numerical simulations are used to study how fiber supercontinuum generation
seeded by picosecond pulses can be actively controlled through the use of input
pulse modulation. By carrying out multiple simulations in the presence of
noise, we show how tailored supercontinuum Spectra with increased bandwidth and
improved stability can be generated using an input envelope modulation of
appropriate frequency and depth. The results are discussed in terms of the
non-linear propagation dynamics and pump depletion.
