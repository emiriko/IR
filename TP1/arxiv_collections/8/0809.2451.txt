We perform a multichannel analysis in context of the Large Hadron Collider
(LHC) for supersymmetric (SUSY) theories with high-scale non-universal gaugino
masses arising from different non-singlet representations of SU(5) and SO(10)
gauge groups in a SUSY-GUT scenario and non-universal scalar masses in form of
squark-slepton non-universality, third family scalar non-universality and that
arising due to SO(10) $D$-terms. We present the numerical predictions over a
wide region of parameter space using event generator {\tt Pythia}. Certain
broad features emerge from the study which may be useful to identify these
non-universal schemes and distinguish them from the minimal supergravity
(mSUGRA) framework.
