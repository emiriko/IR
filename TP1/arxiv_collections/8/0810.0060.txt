This work lies across three areas (in the title) of investigation that are by
themselves of independent interest. A problem that arose in quantum computing
led us to a link that tied these areas together. This link consists of a single
formal power series with a multifaced interpretation. The deeper exploration of
this link yielded results as well as methods for solving some numerical
problems in each of these separate areas.
