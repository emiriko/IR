We describe more precisely the mechanism of spontaneous mass generation in
the previously proposed model of hidden sector of the Universe. The hidden
sector is conjectured to consist of sterile spin-1/2 fermions (sterinos) whose
mass is spontaneously generated by sterile scalar bosons (sterons), while their
interactions are mediated by sterile antisymmetric-tensor bosons (A bosons).
Such a sector communicates with the familiar Standard Model sector through a
photonic portal acting weakly between both sectors (but stronger than the
universal gravity). This is due to photons which, beside sterinos and sterons,
contribute to the source of the A bosons. Sterinos can be candidates for
thermal cold dark matter. They can be also produced in sterino-antisterino
pairs through virtual photons emitted in high-energy collisions of Standard
Model charged particles. Sterinos display a tiny magnetic moment spontaneously
generated by sterons.
