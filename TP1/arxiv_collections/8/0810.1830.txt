We present a study of the phononic thermal conductivity of isotopically
disordered carbon nanotubes. In particular, the behavior of the thermal
conductivity as a function of the system length is investigated, using Green's
function techniques to compute the transmission across the system. The method
is implemented using linear scaling algorithms, which allows us to reach
systems of lengths up to $L=2.5\mu$m (with up to 400,000 atoms). As for 1D
systems, it is observed that the conductivity diverges with the system size
$L$. We also observe a dramatic decrease of the thermal conductance for systems
of experimental sizes (roughly 80% at room temperature for $L = 2.5$ $\mu$m),
when a large fraction of isotopic disorder is introduced. The results obtained
with Green's function techniques are compared to results obtained with a
Boltzmann description of thermal transport. There is a good agreement between
both approaches for systems of experimental sizes, even in presence of Anderson
localization. This is particularly interesting since the computation of the
transmission using Boltzmann's equation is much less computationally expensive,
so that larger systems may be studied with this method.
