We perform simulations of an effective theory of SU(2) Wilson lines in three
dimensions. Our action includes a kinetic term, the one-loop perturbative
potential for the Wilson line, a non-perturbative "fuzzy-bag" contribution and
spatial gauge fields. We determine the phase diagram of the theory and confirm
that, at moderately weak coupling, the non-perturbative term leads to
eigenvalue repulsion in a finite region above the deconfining phase transition.
