Extended defects in graphene, such as linear edges, break the translational
invariance and can also have an impact on the symmetries specific to massless
Dirac-like quasiparticles in this material. The paper examines the consequences
of a broken Dirac fermion parity in the framework of the effective boundary
conditions varying from the Berry-Mondragon mass confinement to a zigzag edge.
The parity breaking reflects the structural sublattice asymmetry of zigzag-type
edges and is closely related to the previously predicted time-reversal
symmetric edge states. We calculate the local and global densities of the edge
states and show that they carry a specific polarization, resembling, to some
extent, that of spin-polarized materials. The lack of the parity leads to a
nonanalytical particle-hole asymmetry in the edge-state properties. We use our
findings to interpret recently observed tunneling spectra in zigzag-terminated
graphene. We also propose a graphene-based tunneling device where the
particle-hole asymmetric edge states result in a strongly nonlinear
conductance-voltage characteristics, which could be used to manipulate the
tunneling transport.
