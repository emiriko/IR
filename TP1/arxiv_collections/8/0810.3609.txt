VISPA is a novel development environment for high energy physics analyses,
based on a combination of graphical and textual steering. The primary aim of
VISPA is to support physicists in prototyping, performing, and verifying a data
analysis of any complexity. We present example screenshots, and describe the
underlying software concepts.
