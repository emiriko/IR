We predict solitary vortices in quasi-planar condensates of dipolar atoms,
polarized parallel to the confinement direction, with the effective sign of the
dipole-dipole interaction inverted by means of a rapidly rotating field. Energy
minima corresponding to vortex solitons with topological charges ${% \ell}=1$
and 2 are predicted for moderately strong dipole-dipole interaction, using an
axisymmetric Gaussian ansatz. The stability of the solitons with $\ell =1$ is
confirmed by full 3D simulations, whereas their counterparts with $\ell =2$ are
found to be unstable against splitting into a set of four fragments
(quadrupole).
