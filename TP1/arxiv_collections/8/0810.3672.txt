SrTiO3 ceramics are investigated by piezoresponse force microscopy.
Piezoelectric contrast is observed on polished surfaces in both vertical and
lateral regimes and depends on the grain orientation varying in both sign
(polarization direction) and amplitude. The observed contrast is attested to
the surface piezoelectricity due to flexoelectric effect (strain
gradient-induced polarization) caused by the surface relaxation. The estimated
flexoelectric coefficient is approximately one order of magnitude smaller as
compared to those recently measured in SrTiO3 single crystals. The observed
enhancement of piezoresponse signal at the grain boundaries is explained by the
dipole moments associated with inhomogeneous distribution of oxygen vacancies.
