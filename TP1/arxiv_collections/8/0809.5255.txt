Using X- ray photon correlation spectroscopy measurements on gold
nanoparticles embedded in polymethylmethacrylate we provide evidence for
existence of an intrinsic length scale for dynamic heterogeneity in polymer
nanocomposites similar to that in other soft materials.We also show how the
dynamics varies in a complex way with various parameters.
