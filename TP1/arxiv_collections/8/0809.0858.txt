Standard results for the fluctuations of thermodynamic quantities are derived
under the assumption of sampling identical systems that are in different, not
fully equilibrated states. These results apply to fluctuations with time in a
particular macroscopic body and can be traced to the fluctuations of thermal
occupancy. When many identically prepared - but not identical - systems are
studied, mesoscopic fluctuations due to variations from sample to sample
contribute to the fluctuations of thermodynamic quantities. We study the
combined effect of mesoscopic fluctuations and fluctuations of thermal
occupancy. In particular, we evaluate the total particle number and specific
heat fluctuations in a two-dimensional, non-interacting electron gas in
classically integrable and chaotic circumstances.
