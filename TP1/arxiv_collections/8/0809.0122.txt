We review recent developments in heavy-quarkonium phenomenology within the
nonrelativistic QCD factorization approach. Main issues we consider in this
work include the polarization of prompt J/psi at the Fermilab Tevatron and the
large relativistic and QCD corrections to double-charmonium production at the B
factories. We also consider inclusive charm production in bottomonia decays.
