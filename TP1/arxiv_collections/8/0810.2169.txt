We measured the local density of states of a quasi two-dimensional electron
system (2DES) near defects, artificially created by Ar-ion sputtering, on
surfaces of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) with scanning tunneling
spectroscopy (STS) in high magnetic fields. At valley energies of the Landau
level spectrum, we found two typical localized distributions of the 2DES
depending on the defects. These are new types of distributions which are not
observed in the previous STS work at the HOPG surface near a point defect [Y.
Niimi \textit{et al}., Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 97}, 236804 (2006).]. With
increasing energy, we observed gradual transformation from the localized
distributions to the extended ones as expected for the integer quantum Hall
state. We show that the defect potential depth is responsible for the two
localized distributions from comparison with theoretical calculations.
