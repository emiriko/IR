We study discrete complex analysis and potential theory on a large family of
planar graphs, the so-called isoradial ones. Along with discrete analogues of
several classical results, we prove uniform convergence of discrete harmonic
measures, Green's functions and Poisson kernels to their continuous
counterparts. Among other applications, the results can be used to establish
universality of the critical Ising and other lattice models.
