The transport and fluctuation properties of organic molecules ordered
parallel between two Au contact leads are investigated by the method of surface
Green function. From first-principles simulation the relevant hopping
parameters are extracted and used to calculate nonlinear transport coefficients
with respect to an external bias voltage. A staggering of conductance is found
in dependence on the number of molecules squeezed in between the contacts. The
thermal properties show an anomalous behavior whenever the voltage reaches the
values of the molecular energy levels active for transport. The thermoelectric
figure of merit shows a resonance allowing to reach values even larger than
one.
