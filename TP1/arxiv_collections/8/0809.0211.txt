We present a theoretical analysis of phase separation in the presence of a
spatially periodic forcing of wavenumber q traveling with a velocity v. By an
analytical and numerical study of a suitably generalized 2d-Cahn-Hilliard model
we find as a function of the forcing amplitude and the velocity three different
regimes of phase separation. For a sufficiently large forcing amplitude a
spatially periodic phase separation of the forcing wavenumber takes place,
which is dragged by the forcing with some phase delay. These locked solutions
are only stable in a subrange of their existence and beyond their existence
range the solutions are dragged irregularly during the initial transient period
and otherwise rather regular. In the range of unstable locked solutions a
coarsening dynamics similar to the unforced case takes place. For small and
large values of the forcing wavenumber analytical approximations of the
nonlinear solutions as well as for the range of existence and stability have
been derived.
