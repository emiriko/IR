The field theoretic renormalization group is applied to the stochastic
Navier-Stokes equation with the stirring force correlator of the form
k^(4-d-2\epsilon) in the d-dimensional space, in connection with the problem of
construction of the 1/d expansion for the fully developed fluid turbulence
beyond the scope of the standard epsilon expansion. It is shown that in the
large-d limit the number of the Feynman diagrams for the Green function (linear
response function) decreases drastically, and the technique of their analytical
calculation is developed. The main ingredients of the renormalization group
approach -- the renormalization constant, beta function and the ultraviolet
correction exponent omega, are calculated to order epsilon^3 (three-loop
approximation). The two-point velocity-velocity correlation function, the
Kolmogorov constant C_K in the spectrum of turbulent energy and the
inertial-range skewness factor S are calculated in the large-d limit to third
order of the epsilon expansion. Surprisingly enough, our results for C_K are in
a reasonable agreement with the existing experimental estimates.
