We study photon pair generation through scalar spontaneous four-wave mixing
in single-mode fibre and for frequency-degenerate pumps; we concentrate on
source geometries which fulfil full group velocity matching (GVM), i.e. where
the pump, signal and idler propagate at identical group velocities. We discuss
two experimental techniques which permit the attainment of full GVM, and
discuss the resulting two-photon state properties. In particular, we show that
full GVM can lead to sources which approach phasematching unconstrained by
dispersion and therefore with a remarkably large bandwidth. We also discuss the
generation of nearly-factorablestates as an application of full GVM.
