We investigate in some detail an alternative simulation strategy for lattice
field theory based on the so-called worm algorithm introduced by Prokof'ev and
Svistunov in 2001. It amounts to stochastically simulating the strong coupling
expansion rather than the usual configuration sum. A detailed error analysis
and an important generalization of the method are exemplified here in the
simple Ising model. It allows for estimates of the two point function where in
spite of exponential decay the signal to noise ratio does not degrade at large
separation. Critical slowing down is practically absent. In the outlook some
thoughts on the general applicability of the method are offered.
