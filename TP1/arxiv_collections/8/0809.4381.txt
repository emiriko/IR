A monic polynomial in F_q[t] of degree n over a finite field F_q of odd
characteristic can be written as the sum of two irreducible monic elements in
F_q[t] of degrees n and n-1 if q is larger than a bound depending only on n.
The main tool is a sufficient condition for simultaneous primality of two
polynomials in one variable x with coefficients in F_q[t].
