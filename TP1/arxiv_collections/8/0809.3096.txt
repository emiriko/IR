We demonstrate that the angular distribution of photoelectrons from a
strongly polarizable target exposed to a laser field can deviate noticeably
from the prediction of conventional theory. Even within the dipole-photon
approximation the profile of distribution is modified due to the action of the
field of alternating dipole moment induced at the residue by the laser field.
This effect, being quite sensitive to the dynamic polarizability of the residue
and to its geometry, depends also on the intensity and frequency of the laser
field. Numerical results, presented for sodium cluster anions, demonstrate that
dramatic changes to the profile occur for the photon energies in vicinities of
the plasmon resonances, where the effect is enhanced due to the increase in the
residue polarizability. Strong modifications of the characteristics of a
single-photon ionization process can be achieved by applying laser fields of
comparatively low intensities $I_0 \sim10^{10}-10^{11}$ W/cm$^2$.
