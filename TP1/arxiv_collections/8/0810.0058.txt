All $q$-Painlev\'e equations which are obtained from the $q$-analog of the
sixth Painlev\'e equation are expressed in a Lax formalism. They are
characterized by the data of the associated linear $q$-difference equations.
The degeneration pattern from the $q$-Painlev\'e equation of type $A_2$ is also
presented.
