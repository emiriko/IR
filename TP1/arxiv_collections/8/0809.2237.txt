We present a photoemission study of La$_{0.8-x}$Eu$_{0.2}$Sr$_x$CuO$_{4}$
with doping level $x$=1/8, where the charge carriers are expected to order
forming static stripes. Though the local probes in direct space seem to be
consistent with this idea, there has been little evidence found for such
ordering in quasiparticle dispersions. We show that the Fermi surface topology
of the 1/8 compound develops notable deviations from that observed for La$_{2-
x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_{4}$ in a way consistent with the FS reconstruction expected for
the scattering on the antiphase stripe order.
