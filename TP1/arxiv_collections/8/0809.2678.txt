In this paper, we have considered the curved universe which is filled by
tachyonic field. We have found the exact solutions for the field, pressure,
density, and scale factor and some cosmological parameters. In such universe,
we have investigated the role of tachyonic field in different stages of k for
the evolution of the universe. Finally we draw the graphs for the scale factor,
Hubble's parameter, energy density, pressure, acceleration parameter, equation
of state and potential for the different values of k. Also we obtained the
exact form of field which shows that the tachyonic field has the kink form.
