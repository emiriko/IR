We consider the production of squarks and gluinos at hadronic colliders. An
overview over the class of processes is given. We investigate in detail the
tree-level and higher order EW contributions to the cross sections. Special
care has to be taken to obtain infrared finite observables. We study
numerically stop--anti-stop and squark--gluino production at the LHC.
