The aim of this article is to prove a Thom-Sebastiani theorem for the
asymptotics of the fiber-integrals. This means that we describe the asymptotics
of the fiber-integrals of the function $f \oplus g : (x,y) \to f(x) + g(y)$ \
on $(\mathbb{C}^p\times \mathbb{C}^q, (0,0))$ in term of the asymptotics of the
fiber-integrals of the holomorphic germs $f : (\mathbb{C}^p,0) \to
(\mathbb{C},0)$ and $g : (\mathbb{C}^q,0) \to (\mathbb{C},0)$. This reduces to
compute the asymptotics of a convolution $\Phi_*\Psi$ from the asymptotics of
$\Phi$ and $\Psi$ modulo smooth terms. To obtain a precise theorem, giving the
non vanishing of expected singular terms in the asymptotic expansion of
$f\oplus g$, we have to compute the constants coming from the convolution
process. We show that they are given by rational fractions of Gamma factors.
This enable us to show that these constants do not vanish.
