We present a quantum-mechanical description of quark-hadron fragmentation in
a nuclear environment. It employs the path-integral formulation of quantum
mechanics, which takes care of all phases and interferences, and which contains
all relevant time scales, like production, coherence, formation, etc. The cross
section includes the probability of pre-hadron (colorless dipole) production
both inside and outside the medium. Moreover, it also includes inside-outside
production, which is a typical quantum-mechanical interference effect (like
twin-slit electron propagation). We observe a substantial suppression caused by
the medium, even if the pre-hadron is produced outside the medium and no energy
loss is involved. This important source of suppression is missed in the usual
energy-loss scenario interpreting the effect of jet quenching observed in heavy
ion collisions. This may be one of the reasons of a too large gluon density,
reported by such analyzes.
