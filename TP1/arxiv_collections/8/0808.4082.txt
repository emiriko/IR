As part of his work to develop an explicit trace formula for Hecke operators
on congruence subgroups of $SL_2(\Z)$, Hijikata defines and characterizes the
notion of a split order in $M_2(k)$, where $k$ is a local field. In this paper,
we generalize the notion of a split order to $M_n(k)$ for $n>2$ and give a
natural geometric characterization in terms of the affine building for
$SL_n(k)$. In particular, we show that there is a one-to-one correspondence
between split orders in $M_n(k)$ and a collection of convex polytopes in
apartments of the building such that the split order is the intersection of all
the maximal orders representing the vertices in the polytope. This generalizes
the geometric interpretation in the $n=2$ case in which split orders correspond
to geodesics in the tree for $SL_2(k)$ with the split order given as the
intersection of the endpoints of the geodesic.
