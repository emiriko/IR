A stochastic deformation of a thermodynamic symplectic structure is studied.
The stochastic deformation procedure is analogous to the deformation of an
algebra of observables like deformation quantization, but for an imaginary
deformation parameter (the Planck constant). Gauge symmetries of thermodynamics
and corresponding stochastic mechanics, which describes fluctuations of a
thermodynamic system, are revealed and gauge fields are introduced. A physical
interpretation to the gauge transformations and gauge fields is given. An
application of the formalism to a description of systems with distributed
parameters in a local thermodynamic equilibrium is considered.
