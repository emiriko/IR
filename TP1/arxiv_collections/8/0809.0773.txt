While ordinary differential equations (ODEs) form the conceptual framework
for modelling many cellular processes, specific situations demand stochastic
models to capture the influence of noise. The most common formulation of
stochastic models for biochemical networks is the chemical master equation
(CME). While stochastic simulations are a practical way to realise the CME,
analytical approximations offer more insight into the influence of noise.
Towards that end, the two-moment approximation (2MA) is a promising addition to
the established analytical approaches including the chemical Langevin equation
(CLE) and the related linear noise approximation (LNA). The 2MA approach
directly tracks the mean and (co)variance which are coupled in general. This
coupling is not obvious in CME and CLE and ignored by LNA and conventional ODE
models. We extend previous derivations of 2MA by allowing a) non-elementary
reactions and b) relative concentrations. Often, several elementary reactions
are approximated by a single step. Furthermore, practical situations often
require the use relative concentrations. We investigate the applicability of
the 2MA approach to the well established fission yeast cell cycle model. Our
analytical model reproduces the clustering of cycle times observed in
experiments. This is explained through multiple resettings of MPF, caused by
the coupling between mean and (co)variance, near the G2/M transition.
