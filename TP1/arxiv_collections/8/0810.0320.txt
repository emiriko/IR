We systematically calculate the total reaction cross sections of oxygen
isotopes, $^{15-24}$O, on a $^{12}$C target at high energies using the Glauber
theory. The oxygen isotopes are described with Slater determinants generated
from a phenomenological mean-field potential. The agreement between theory and
experiment is generally good, but a sharp increase of the reaction cross
sections from ^{21}O to ^{23}O remains unresolved. To examine the sensitivity
of the diffraction pattern of elastic scattering to the nuclear surface, we
study the differential elastic-scattering cross sections of proton-^{20,21,23}O
at the incident energy of 300 MeV by calculating the full Glauber amplitude.
