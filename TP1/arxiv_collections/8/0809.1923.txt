We discuss rotating wormholes in general relativity with a scalar field with
negative kinetic energy. To solve the problem, we use the assumption about slow
rotation. The role of a small dimensionless parameter plays the ratio of the
linear velocity of rotation of the wormhole's throat and the velocity of light.
We construct the rotating wormhole solution in the second order approximation
with respect to the small parameter. The analysis shows that the asymptotical
mass of the rotating wormhole is greater than that of the non-rotating one, and
the NEC violation in the rotating wormhole spacetime is weaker than that in the
non-rotating one.
