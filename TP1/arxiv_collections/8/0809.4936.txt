We consider a uniform distribution on the set $\mathcal{M}_k$ of moments of
order $k \in \mathbb{N}$ corresponding to probability measures on the interval
$[0,1]$. To each (random) vector of moments in $\mathcal{M}_{2n-1}$ we consider
the corresponding uniquely determined monic (random) orthogonal polynomial of
degree $n$ and study the asymptotic properties of its roots if $n \to \infty$.
