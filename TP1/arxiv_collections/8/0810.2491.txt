Effective transport of quantum information is an essential element of quantum
computation. We consider the problem of transporting a quantum state by using a
moving potential well, while maintaining the encoded quantum information. In
particular, we look at a set of cases where the input control defining the
position of the potential well is subject to different types of distortion,
each of which is motivated by experimental considerations. We show that even
under these conditions, we are able to perfectly transfer the quantum
information non-adiabatically over any given distance.
