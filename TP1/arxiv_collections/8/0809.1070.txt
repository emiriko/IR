Almost identical thermal properties of type-I clathrate compounds to those of
glasses follow naturally from the consideration that off-centered guest ions
possess electric dipole moments. Local fields from neighbor dipoles create many
potential minima in the configuration space. A theoretical analysis based on
two-level tunneling states demonstrates that interacting dipoles are a key to
quantitatively explain the glass-like behaviors of low-temperature thermal
properties of type-I clathrate compounds with off-centered guest ions.From this
analysis, we predict the existence of a glass transition.
