In his 2003 paper, Varadhan proves the averaged large deviation principle for
the mean velocity of a particle taking a nearest-neighbor random walk in a
uniformly elliptic i.i.d. environment on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ with $d\geq1$, and
gives a variational formula for the corresponding rate function $I_a$. Under
Sznitman's transience condition (T), we show that $I_a$ is strictly convex and
analytic on a non-empty open set $\mathcal{A}$, and that the true velocity of
the particle is an element (resp. in the boundary) of $\mathcal{A}$ when the
walk is non-nestling (resp. nestling). We then identify the unique minimizer of
Varadhan's variational formula at any velocity in $\mathcal{A}$.
