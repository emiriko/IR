We show that the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff of a half-duplex
single-relay channel with identically distributed Rayleigh fading channel gains
meets the 2 by 1 MISO bound. We generalize the result to the case when there
are N non-interfering relays and show that the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff
is equal to the N + 1 by 1 MISO bound.
