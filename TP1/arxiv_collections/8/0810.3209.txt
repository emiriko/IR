We find an explicit combinatorial interpretation of the coefficients of Kerov
character polynomials which express the value of normalized irreducible
characters of the symmetric groups S(n) in terms of free cumulants R_2,R_3,...
of the corresponding Young diagram. Our interpretation is based on counting
certain factorizations of a given permutation.
