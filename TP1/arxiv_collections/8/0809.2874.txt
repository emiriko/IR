For many quantum models an apparent non-Hermiticity of observables
corresponds to their hidden Hermiticity in another, physical Hilbert space. For
these models we show that the existence of observables which are manifestly
time-dependent may require the use of a manifestly time-dependent
representation of the physical Hilbert space of states.
