We review the 5 sigma discovery contours for the charged MSSM Higgs boson at
the CMS experiment with 30/fb for the two cases M_H+ < m_t and M_H+ > m_t. In
order to analyze the search reach we combine the latest results for the CMS
experimental sensitivities based on full simulation studies with
state-of-the-art theoretical predictions of MSSM Higgs-boson production and
decay properties. Special emphasis is put on the SUSY parameter dependence of
the 5 sigma contours. The variation of $\mu$ can shift the prospective
discovery reach in tan_beta by up to Delta tan_beta = 40.
