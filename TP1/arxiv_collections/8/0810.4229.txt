It has been proposed that the ability to perform joint weak measurements on
post-selected systems would allow us to study quantum paradoxes. These
measurements can investigate the history of those particles that contribute to
the paradoxical outcome. Here, we experimentally perform weak measurements of
joint (i.e. nonlocal) observables. In an implementation of Hardy's Paradox, we
weakly measure the locations of two photons, the subject of the conflicting
statements behind the Paradox. Remarkably, the resulting weak probabilities
verify all these statements but, at the same time, resolve the Paradox.
