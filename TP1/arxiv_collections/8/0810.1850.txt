We present here a comprehensive investigation of the magnetic ordering in
Ni50Mn35In15 composition. A concomitant first order martensitic transition and
the magnetic ordering occurring in this off-stoichiometric Heusler compound at
room temperature signifies the multifunctional character of this magnetic shape
memory alloy. Unusual features are observed in the dependence of the
magnetization on temperature that can be ascribed to a frustrated magnetic
order. It is compelling to ascribe these features to the cluster type
description that may arise due to inhomogeneity in the distribution of magnetic
atoms. However, evidences are presented from our ac susceptibility, electrical
resistivity and dc magnetization studies that there exists a competing
ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic order within crystal structure of this
system. We show that excess Mn atoms that substitute the In atoms have a
crucial bearing on the magnetic order of this compound. These excess Mn atoms
are antiferromagnetically aligned to the other Mn, which explains the peculiar
dependence of magnetization on temperature.
