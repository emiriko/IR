We consider power control in cognitive radio networks where secondary users
identify and exploit instantaneous and local spectrum opportunities without
causing unacceptable interference to primary users. We qualitatively
characterize the impact of the transmission power of secondary users on the
occurrence of spectrum opportunities and the reliability of opportunity
detection. Based on a Poisson model of the primary network, we quantify these
impacts by showing that (i) the probability of spectrum opportunity decreases
exponentially with respect to the transmission power of secondary users, where
the exponential decay constant is given by the traffic load of primary users;
(ii) reliable opportunity detection is achieved in the two extreme regimes in
terms of the ratio between the transmission power of secondary users and that
of primary users. Such analytical characterizations allow us to study power
control for optimal transport throughput under constraints on the interference
to primary users. Furthermore, we reveal the difference between detecting
primary signals and detecting spectrum opportunities, and demonstrate the
complex relationship between physical layer spectrum sensing and MAC layer
throughput. The dependency of this PHY-MAC interaction on the application type
and the use of handshake signaling such as RTS/CTS is illustrated.
