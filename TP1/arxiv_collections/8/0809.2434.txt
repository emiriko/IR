The gamma-spectra were calculated for the set of different level densities
and radiative strength functions. The sufficiently precise reproduction of the
experiment is impossible without taking into account the influence of the
process of the nucleons Cooper pairs breaking on any nuclei cascade gamma-decay
parameters.
