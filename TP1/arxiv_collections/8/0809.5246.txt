We study the time-dependent transport of charge and spin through a
ring-shaped region sequentially coupled to a weakly interacting quantum dot in
the presence of an Aharonov-Bohm flux and spin-orbit interaction. The
time-dependent modulation of the spin-orbit interaction, or of the
corresponding Aharonov-Casher flux, together with the modulation of the
dot-level induces an electrically pumped spin current even in absence of a
charge current. The results beyond the adiabatic regime show that an additional
rectification current proportional to \cos(\phi), being \phi the relative phase
between the time varying parameters, is generated. We discuss the relevance of
such term in connection with recent experiments on out-of-equilibrium quantum
dots.
