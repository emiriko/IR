It was experimentally found that the evolution of dielectric loss with
processing temperature displays a common trend in ferroelectric and dielectric
thin oxide films: firstly an increase and then a decrease in dielectric loss
when the processing temperature is gradually raised. Such a dielectric response
of ferroelectric/dielectric thin films has been theoretically addressed in this
work. We propose that at the initial stage of the crystallization process in
thin films, the transformation from amorphous to crystalline phase should
increase substantially the dielectric loss; then, with further increase in the
processing temperature, the coalescent growth of small crystalline grains into
big ones could be helpful in reducing the dielectric loss by lowering grain
boundary densities. The obtained experimental data for (Ba,Sr)TiO3 thin films
with 500 nm in thickness were analyzed in terms of the model developed and
shown to be in a reasonable agreement with the theoretical results.
