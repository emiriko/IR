Erd\"os conjectured that if $G$ is a triangle free graph of chromatic number
at least $k\geq 3$, then it contains an odd cycle of length at least
$k^{2-o(1)}$ \cite{sudakovverstraete, verstraete}. Nothing better than a linear
bound (\cite{gyarfas}, Problem 5.1.55 in \cite{West}) was so far known. We make
progress on this conjecture by showing that $G$ contains an odd cycle of length
at least $O(k\log\log k)$. Erd\"os' conjecture is known to hold for graphs with
girth at least 5. We show that if a girth 4 graph is $C_5$ free, then Erd\"os'
conjecture holds. When the number of vertices is not too large we can prove
better bounds on $\chi$. We also give bounds on the chromatic number of graphs
with at most $r$ cycles of length $1\bmod k$, or at most $s$ cycles of length
$2\bmod k$, or no cycles of length $3\bmod k$. Our techniques essentially
consist of using a depth first search tree to decompose the graph into ordered
paths, which are then fed to an online coloring algorithm. Using this technique
we give simple proofs of some old results, and also obtain several simpler
results. We also obtain a lower bound on the number of colors an online
coloring algorithm needs to use on triangle free graphs.
