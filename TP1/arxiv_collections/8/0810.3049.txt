We exploit theoretically the occurrence and tunability of photonic Bloch
oscillations (PBOs) in one-dimensional photonic crystals (PCs) containing
nonlinear composites. Because of the enhanced third-order nonlinearity (Kerr
type nonlinearity) of composites, photons undergo oscillations inside tilted
photonic bands, which are achieved by the application of graded external pump
electric fields on such PCs, varying along the direction perpendicular to the
surface of layers. The tunability of PBOs (including amplitude and period) is
readily achieved by changing the field gradient. With an appropriate graded
pump AC or DC electric field, terahertz PBOs can appear and cover a terahertz
band in electromagnetic spectrum.
