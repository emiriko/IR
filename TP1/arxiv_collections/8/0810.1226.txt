Two important aspects of the Internet, namely the properties of its topology
and the characteristics of its data traffic, have attracted growing attention
of the physics community. My thesis has considered problems of both aspects.
First I studied the stochastic behavior of TCP, the primary algorithm governing
traffic in the current Internet, in an elementary network scenario consisting
of a standalone infinite-sized buffer and an access link. The effect of the
fast recovery and fast retransmission (FR/FR) algorithms is also considered. I
showed that my model can be extended further to involve the effect of link
propagation delay, characteristic of WAN. I continued my thesis with the
investigation of finite-sized semi-bottleneck buffers, where packets can be
dropped not only at the link, but also at the buffer. I demonstrated that the
behavior of the system depends only on a certain combination of the parameters.
Moreover, an analytic formula was derived that gives the ratio of packet loss
rate at the buffer to the total packet loss rate. This formula makes it
possible to treat buffer-losses as if they were link-losses. Finally, I studied
computer networks from a structural perspective. I demonstrated through fluid
simulations that the distribution of resources, specifically the link
bandwidth, has a serious impact on the global performance of the network. Then
I analyzed the distribution of edge betweenness in a growing scale-free tree
under the condition that a local property, the in-degree of the "younger" node
of an arbitrary edge, is known in order to find an optimum distribution of link
capacity. The derived formula is exact even for finite-sized networks. I also
calculated the conditional expectation of edge betweenness, rescaled for
infinite networks.
