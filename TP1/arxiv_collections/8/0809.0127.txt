We prove the reverse ultra log-concavity of the Boros-Moll polynomials. We
further establish an inequality which implies the log-concavity of the sequence
$\{i!d_i(m)\}$ for any $m\geq 2$, where $d_i(m)$ are the coefficients of the
Boros-Moll polynomials $P_m(a)$. This inequality also leads to the fact that in
the asymptotic sense, the Boros-Moll sequences are just on the borderline
between ultra log-concavity and reverse ultra log-concavity. We propose two
conjectures on the log-concavity and reverse ultra log-concavity of the
sequence $\{d_{i-1}(m) d_{i+1}(m)/d_i(m)^2\}$ for $m\geq 2$.
