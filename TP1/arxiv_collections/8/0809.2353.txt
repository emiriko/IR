In this paper we calculate the evolution of black holes at colliders in the
Randall-Sundrum scenario, taking the effect of accretion from the quark-gluon
plasma into account. We calculate the evolution using both the canonical and
microcanonical ensemble approaches and compare the results to each other and to
the well-known corresponding lifetimes for ADD. We find that for an initial
mass of 10TeV the canonical lifetime is of the order of $10^{-25}s$, which is
of the same order of magnitude as its ADD counterpart. In the microcanonical
approach, like in ADD, the microcanonical deviations from thermality slow down
the evaporation of the black hole, but, unlike in ADD, the black hole does not
completely evaporate; it tends to a stable final state of 0.16GeV. As far as we
are aware this is the first prediction of a stable black hole remnant using
semiclassical gravity.
