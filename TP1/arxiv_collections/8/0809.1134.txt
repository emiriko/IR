As well known, if the Higgs boson were not observed at LHC, the technicolor
model would be the most favorable candidate responsible for the symmetry
breaking. To overcome some defects in the previous model, some extended
versions have been proposed. In the TC2 model typical signature is existence of
heavy $H_{TC}$ and technipion $\Pi$. A direct proof of validity of the model is
to produce them at accelerator. Thus we study the production rates of $ e^ + e^
- \to H_{TC} \Pi ^0 $ and $e^ + e^ - \to \Pi ^ + \Pi ^ -$ at ILC in the
topcolor-assisted technicolor (TC2) model. In fact, there is a flood of models
belonging to new physics which can result in products with characteristics
similar to $H_{TC}+\Pi$ of the TC2 model. Therefore to distinguish this model
from others one may need to investigate some details by calculating the cross
section to NLO. We indeed find that the NLO corrections are significant, namely
the ratio $\delta \equiv (\sigma_{NLO} - \sigma_{LO})/\sigma_{LO} $ in $ e^ +
e^ - \to H_{TC} \Pi ^0 $ exceeds 100% within a plausible parameter space.
