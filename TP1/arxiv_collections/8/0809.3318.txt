A fundamental issue in classical electrodynamics is represented by the search
of the exact equation of motion for a classical charged particle under the
action of its electromagnetic (EM) self-field - the so-called
radiation-reaction equation of motion (RR equation). In the past, several
attempts have been made assuming that the particle electric charge is localized
point-wise (point-charge). These involve the search of possible so-called
"regularization" approaches able to deal with the intrinsic divergences
characterizing point-particle descriptions in classical electrodynamics. In
this paper we intend to propose a new solution to this problem based on the
adoption of a variational approach and the treatment of finite-size
spherical-shell charges. The approach is based on three key elements: 1) the
adoption of the relativistic synchronous Hamilton variational principle
recently pointed out (Tessarotto et al, 2006); 2) the variational treatment of
the EM self-field, for finite-size charges, taking into account the exact
particle dynamics; 3) the adoption of the axioms of classical mechanics and
electrodynamics. The new RR equation proposed in this paper, departing
significantly from previous approaches, exhibits several interesting
properties. In particular: a) unlike the LAD (Lorentz-Abraham-Dirac) equation,
it recovers a second-order ordinary differential equation which is fully
consistent with the law of inertia, Newton principle of determinacy and
Einstein causality principle and b) unlike the LL (Landau-Lifschitz) equation,
it holds also in the case of sudden forces. In addition, it is found that the
new equation recovers the customary LAD equation in a suitable asymptotic
approximation.
