The affine ring A of the affine Jacobian variety of a hyperelliptic curve of
genus 3 is studied as a D-module. The conjecture on the minimal D-free
resolution previously proposed is proved in this case. As a by-product a linear
basis of A is explicitly constructed in terms of derivatives of Klein's
hyperelliptic pe functions.
