We present a study of the $\pi\pi$ scattering amplitude in the $\sigma$ and
$\rho$ channels at finite temperature and nuclear density within a chiral
unitary framework. Meson resonances are dynamically generated in our approach,
which allows us to analyze the behavior of their associated scattering poles
when the system is driven towards chiral symmetry restoration. Medium effects
are incorporated in three ways: (a) by thermal corrections of the unitarized
scattering amplitudes, (b) by finite nuclear density effects associated to a
renormalization of the pion decay constant, and complementarily (c) by
extending our calculation of the scalar-isoscalar channel to account for finite
nuclear density and temperature effects in a microscopic many-body
implementation of pion dynamics. Our results are discussed in connection with
several phenomenological aspects relevant for nuclear matter and Heavy-Ion
Collision experiments, such as $\rho$ mass scaling vs broadening from dilepton
spectra and chiral restoration signals in the $\sigma$ channel. We also
elaborate on the molecular nature of $\pi\pi$ resonances.
