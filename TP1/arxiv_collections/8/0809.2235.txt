A model describing spin-polarized current via discrete energy levels of a
metallic nanoparticle, which has strongly asymmetric tunnel contacts to two
ferromagnetic leads, is presented.
  In absence of spin-relaxation, the model leads to a spin-accumulation in the
nanoparticle, a difference ($\Delta\mu$) between the chemical potentials of
spin-up and spin-down electrons, proportional to the current and the Julliere's
tunnel magnetoresistance. Taking into account an energy dependent
spin-relaxation rate $\Omega (\omega)$, $\Delta\mu$ as a function of bias
voltage ($V$) exhibits a crossover from linear to a much weaker dependence,
when $|e|\Omega (\Delta\mu)$ equals the spin-polarized current through the
nanoparticle. Assuming that the spin-relaxation takes place via electron-phonon
emission and Elliot-Yafet mechanism, the model leads to a crossover from linear
to $V^{1/5}$ dependence. The crossover explains recent measurements of the
saturation of the spin-polarized current with $V$ in Aluminum nanoparticles,
and leads to the spin-relaxation rate of $\approx 1.6 MHz$ in an Aluminum
nanoparticle of diameter $6nm$, for a transition with an energy difference of
one level spacing.
