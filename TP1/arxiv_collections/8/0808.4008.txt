We have setup a simple field mapping measure system to describe graphically
the 2D quasi-free-space electromagnetic wave in a parallel plate waveguide at
the X-band frequencies. Our apparatus illustrates a potential application in
characterizing the microwave absorbing materials. The visual demonstration
about the physical process and quantitative measurement of reflectivity
coefficients can be achieved. This simple apparatus has have an advantage over
with conventional testing methods which usually involve huge, expensive
anechoic chambers and demand samples of large size.
