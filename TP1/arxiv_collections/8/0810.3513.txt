We study the tunneling density of states (TDOS) for a junction of three
Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid wires. We show that there are fixed points which
allow for the enhancement of the TDOS, which is unusual for Luttinger liquids.
The distance from the junction over which this enhancement occurs is of the
order of x = v/(2 \omega), where v is the plasmon velocity and \omega is the
bias frequency. Beyond this distance, the TDOS crosses over to the standard
bulk value independent of the fixed point describing the junction. This finite
range of distances opens up the possibility of experimentally probing the
enhancement in each wire individually.
