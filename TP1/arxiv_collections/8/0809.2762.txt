There have been many reports of non-statistical effects in neutron-capture
measurements. However, reports of deviations of reduced-neutron-width
distributions from the expected Porter-Thomas (PT) shape largely have been
ignored. Most of these deviations have been reported for odd-A nuclides.
Because reliable spin (J) assignments have been absent for most resonances for
such nuclides, it is possible that reported deviations from PT might be due to
incorrect J assignments. We recently developed a new method for measuring spins
of neutron resonances by using the DANCE detector at LANSCE. Measurements made
with a 147Sm sample allowed us to determine spins of almost all known
resonances below 1 keV. Furthermore, analysis of these data revealed that the
reduced-neutron-width distribution was in good agreement with PT for resonances
below 350 eV, but in disagreement with PT for resonances between 350 and 700
eV. Our previous (n,alpha) measurements had revealed that the alpha strength
function also changes abruptly at this energy. There currently is no known
explanation for these two non-statistical effects. Recently, we have developed
another new method for determining the spins of neutron resonances. To
implement this technique required a small change (to record pulse-height
information for coincidence events) to a much simpler apparatus: A pair of C6D6
gamma-ray detectors which we have employed for many years to measure
neutron-capture cross sections at ORELA. Measurements with a 95Mo sample
revealed that not only does the method work very well for determining spins,
but it also makes possible parity assignments. Taken together, these new
techniques at LANSCE and ORELA could be very useful for further elucidation of
non-statistical effects.
