We present an approach to tune the effective mass in an oxide semiconductor
by a double doping mechanism. We demonstrate this in a model oxide system
Sr$_{1-x}$La$_x$TiO$_{3-\delta}$, where we can tune the effective mass ranging
from 6--20$\mathrm{m_e}$ as a function of filling or carrier concentration and
the scattering mechanism, which are dependent on the chosen lanthanum and
oxygen vacancy concentrations. The effective mass values were calculated from
the Boltzmann transport equation using the measured transport properties of
thin films of Sr$_{1-x}$La$_x$TiO$_{3-\delta}$. Our method, which shows that
the effective mass decreases with carrier concentration, provides a means for
understanding the nature of transport processes in oxides, which typically have
large effective mass and low electron mobility, contrary to the tradional high
mobility semiconductors.
