We describe various aspects of the Al-Salam-Chihara $q$-Laguerre polynomials.
These include combinatorial descriptions of the polynomials, the moments, the
orthogonality relation and a combinatorial interpretation of the linearization
coefficients. It is remarkable that the corresponding moment sequence appears
also in the recent work of Postnikov and Williams on enumeration of totally
positive Grassmann cells.
