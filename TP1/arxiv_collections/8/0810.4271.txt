In this paper we examine which Brownian Subordination with drift exhibits the
symmetry property introduced by Fajardo and Mordecki (2006). We obtain that
when the subordination results in a L\'evy process, a necessary and sufficient
condition for the symmetry to hold is that drift must be equal to -1/2.
