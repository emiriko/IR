One important factor which determines efficiency of loading cold atoms into
an optical dipole trap from a magneto-optical trap is the distance between the
trap centers. By studying this efficiency for various optical trap depths
(2--110 mK) we find that for optimum dipole trap loading, longitudinal
displacements up to 15 mm are necessary. An explanation for this observation is
presented and compared with other work and a simple analytical formula is
derived for the optimum distance between the trap centers.
