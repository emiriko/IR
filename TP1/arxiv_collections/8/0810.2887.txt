I set out the 2PI formalism for quantum fields in a
Friedmann-Robertson-Walker Universe. I show how one can solve self-consistently
for the quantum field evolution and the evolution of the cosmological scale
factor, using a renormalised semi-classical Friedmann equation. In a 2PI
coupling expansion truncated at O(lambda^2), I perform sample calculations
demonstrating kinetic and chemical equilibration in this context.
