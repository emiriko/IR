We study single-photon transport in an array of coupled microcavities where
two two-level atomic systems are embedded in two separate cavities of the
array. We find that a single-photon can be totally reflected by a single
two-level system. However, two separate two-level systems can also create,
between them, single-photon quasi-bound states. Therefore, a single two-level
system in the cavity array can act as a mirror while a different type of cavity
can be formed by using two two-level systems, acting as tunable "mirrors",
inside two separate cavities in the array. In analogy with superlattices in
solid state, we call this new "cavity inside a coupled-cavity array" a
super-cavity. This supercavity is the quantum analog of Fabry-Perot
interferometers. Moreover, we show that the physical properties of this quantum
super-cavity can be adjusted by changing the frequencies of these two-level
systems.
