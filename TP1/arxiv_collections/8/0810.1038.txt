An algorithm to systematically and efficiently generate free fermionic
heterotic string models was recently introduced. This algorithm has been
adopted by the Free Fermionic Model Construction (FFMC) program at Baylor
University. As its first application, the algorithm is being applied to
systematically generate the complete set of free fermionic heterotic string
models with untwisted left-moving (worldsheet supersymmetric) sectors, up to
continually advancing Layer and Order. Statistical analysis of this study will
be reported in the near future. However, in a series of separate notes we will
be reporting some of the more interesting models that appear along the way. In
this, our first such note, we reveal a different string embedding of E8 than is
standard. That is, rather than realize E8 via an SO(16) embedding, 248 = 120 +
128, we realize it via an SU(9) embedding, 248 = 80 + 84 + 84-bar. This is
obtained in a Layer 1, Order 6 model for which modular invariance itself
dictates a gravitino sector accompany the gauge sector.
