We review selected recent theoretical activity in perturbative QCD. We focus
on progress in the description of parton densities, including latest
developments in neural network parton densities, on the description of high
multiplicity final states at the LHC at leading and next-to-leading order, on
progress in next-to-next-to-leading order, and on novel developments in jets
physics.
