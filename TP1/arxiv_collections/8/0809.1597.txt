The time-averaged and low--frequency noise transport properties were
investigated in the vicinity of the superconductor--insulator transition for a
Bi$_2$Sr$_{2-x}$La$_{x}$CuO$_{6+\delta}$ ($x=0.3$) thin film. The results are
consistent with a superconductor (metal) embedded in a strong insulator, the
latter showing two-dimensional variable range hopping properties. The weak
insulator behavior -- if any -- is attributed to the metallic inclusions only.
