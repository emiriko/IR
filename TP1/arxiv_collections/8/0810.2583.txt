Motivated by the spin current problem in chiral helimagnet, we rigorously
elucidated the hidden Galilean invariance in the chiral XY model under the
magnetic field. The Lie group analysis is applied to the differential equations
of the continuum theory of the chiral helimagnet with the parity-violating
Dzyaloshinskii-Morya coupling under a transversal magnetic field. Lie point
symmetries and the invariant solutions under these symmetries are found. They
present sliding solutions that come up as a consequence of breaking of both
spin rotational symmetry by the external magnetic field and a parity violation
due to the Dzyaloshinskii-Morya interaction. We found that variational
symmetries are related with translations in space and time, the corresponding
energy and momentum conservation laws are derived. We therefore succeeded in
justifying the existence of the transport spin current in chiral helimagnet.
