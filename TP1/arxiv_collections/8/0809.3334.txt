Elastic electromagnetic form factors of nucleons are investigated both for
the time-like and the space-like momentums under the condition that the QCD
constraints are satisfied asymptotically. The unsubtracted dispersion relation
with the superconvergence conditions are used as a realization of the QCD
conditions. The experimental data are analyzed by using the dispersion formula
and it is shown that the calculated form factors reproduce the experimental
data reasonably well.
