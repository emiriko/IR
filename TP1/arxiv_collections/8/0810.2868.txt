Bright plane soliton solutions of an integrable (2+1) dimensional
($n+1$)-wave system are obtained by applying Hirota's bilinearization method.
First, the soliton solutions of a 3-wave system consisting of two short wave
components and one long wave component are found and then the results are
generalized to the corresponding integrable ($n+1$)-wave system with $n$ short
waves and single long wave. It is shown that the solitons in the short wave
components (say $S^{(1)}$ and $S^{(2)}$) can be amplified by merely reducing
the pulse width of the long wave component (say L). The study on the collision
dynamics reveals the interesting behaviour that the solitons which split up in
the short wave components undergo shape changing collisions with intensity
redistribution and amplitude-dependent phase shifts. Even though similar type
of collision is possible in (1+1) dimensional multicomponent integrable
systems, to our knowledge for the first time we report this kind of collisions
in (2+1) dimensions. However, solitons which appear in the long wave component
exhibit only elastic collision though they undergo amplitude-dependent phase
shifts.
