We show that decoherence is determined by the effective Hilbert space size,
and demonstrate that a few degrees of freedom system can simulate a "N" degrees
of freedom environment if they have the same effective Hilbert space. The
effective Hilbert space size of the environment also determines its long time
efficiency as generator of irreversible coherence loss.
