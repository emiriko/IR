Recently strong evidence has been found in favor of a BCS-like condensation
of excitons in 1\textit{T}-TiSe$_2$. Theoretical photoemission intensity maps
have been generated by the spectral function calculated within the excitonic
condensate phase model and set against experimental angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy data. Here, the calculations in the framework of
this model are presented in detail. They represent an extension of the original
excitonic insulator phase model of J\'erome \textit{et al.} [Phys. Rev. {\bf
158}, 462 (1967)] to three dimensional and anisotropic band dispersions. A
detailed analysis of its properties and further comparison with experiment are
also discussed
