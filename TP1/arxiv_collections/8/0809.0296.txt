We present a search for high-mass resonances decaying into two leptons of
different flavor: $e\mu$, $e\tau$ and $\mu\tau$. These resonances are predicted
by several models for Physics Beyond the Standard Model, such as
R-parity-violating MSSM. The search is based on 1 ${\rm fb^{-1}}$ of Tevatron
Run II data collected with the CDF detector at $\sqrt{s}$ = 1.96 TeV in proton
anti-proton collisions.
