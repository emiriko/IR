An increasing number of approaches for ontology engineering from text are
gearing towards the use of online sources such as company intranet and the
World Wide Web. Despite such rise, not much work can be found in aspects of
preprocessing and cleaning dirty texts from online sources. This paper presents
an enhancement of an Integrated Scoring for Spelling error correction,
Abbreviation expansion and Case restoration (ISSAC). ISSAC is implemented as
part of a text preprocessing phase in an ontology engineering system. New
evaluations performed on the enhanced ISSAC using 700 chat records reveal an
improved accuracy of 98% as compared to 96.5% and 71% based on the use of only
basic ISSAC and of Aspell, respectively.
