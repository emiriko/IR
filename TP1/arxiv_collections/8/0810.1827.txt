We consider a system of the two-parameter deformed boson oscillators whose
spectrum is given by a generalized Fibonacci sequence. In order to obtain the
role of the deformation parameters (q1,q2) on the thermostatistics of the
system, we calculate several thermostatistical functions in the thermodynamical
limit and investigate the low-temperature behavior of the system. In this
framework, we show that the thermostatistics of the (q1,q2)-bosons can be
studied by the formalism of Fibonacci calculus which generalizes the recently
proposed formalism of q-calculus. We also discuss the conditions under which
the Bose-Einstein condensation would occur in the present two-parameter
generalized boson gas. However, the ordinary boson gas results can be obtained
by applying the limit q1=q2=1.
