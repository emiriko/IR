We discuss inherent thermometry in a Superconductor - Normal metal -
Superconductor tunnel junction. In this configuration, the energy selectivity
of single-particle tunneling can provide a significant electron cooling,
depending on the bias voltage. The usual approach for measuring the electron
temperature consists in using an additional pair of superconducting tunnel
junctions as probes. In this paper, we discuss our experiment performed on a
different design with no such thermometer. The quasi-equilibrium in the central
metallic island is discussed in terms of a kinetic equation including injection
and relaxation terms. We determine the electron temperature by comparing the
micro-cooler experimental current-voltage characteristic with isothermal
theoretical predictions. The limits of validity of this approach, due to the
junctions asymmetry, the Andreev reflection or the presence of sub-gap states
are discussed.
