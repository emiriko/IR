The role of SU(2) invariants for the classification of multiparty
entanglement is discussed and exemplified for the Kempe invariant I_5 of pure
three-qubit states. It is found to being an independent invariant only in
presence of both W-type entanglement and threetangle. In this case, constant
I_5 admits for a wide range of both threetangle and concurrences. Furthermore,
the present analysis indicates that an SL^3 orbit of states with equal tangles
but continuously varying I_5 must exist. This means that I_5 provides no
information on the entanglement in the system in addition to that contained in
the tangles (concurrences and threetangle) themselves. Together with the
numerical evidence that I_5 is an entanglement monotone this implies that SU(2)
invariance or the monotone property are too weak requirements for the
characterization and quantification of entanglement for systems of three
qubits, and that SL(2,C) invariance is required. This conclusion can be
extended to general multipartite systems (including higher local dimension)
because the entanglement classes of three-qubit systems appear as subclasses.
