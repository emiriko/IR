The recent measurement of the tau -> Ks pion nu_tau spectrum by the Belle
Collaboration provides the frame to set forth a theoretical description of the
decay, which is based on the contributing vector F_+(s) and scalar F_0(s) form
factors. We show that a good representation of data is obtained through the use
of form factors calculated within resonance chiral theory and constrained by
dispersion relations and short-distance QCD. Hence we obtain a determination of
K*(892) parameters and the low-energy parameterization of F_+(s).
