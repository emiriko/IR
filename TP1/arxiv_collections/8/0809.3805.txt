The reaction $\gamma p\to K^+\Lambda$ has been investigated over the
center-of-momentum energy, $W$, range from threshold up to 2.2 GeV in a
tree-level effective Lagrangian model that incorporates most of the
well-established baryon resonances with spins equal to or below 5/2. Four less
well-established nucleon resonances of higher mass are also included. The
fitted parameters consist, for each resonance included, of the products of the
coupling strengths at the electromagnetic and strong interaction vertices and,
for the less-established nucleon resonances, the total decay width. For the
well-established nucleon resonances, the energy and momentum dependence of the
widths is treated within a dynamical model that is normalized to give the
empirical decay branching ratios on the resonance mass shells. For the
less-established resonances, the total decay width is treated as a single
parameter independent of the reaction kinematics. The model is used to fit
recent data for the unpolarized differential cross section (CLAS), the induced
hyperon polarization asymmetry, $P$ (CLAS, GRAAL, and SAPHIR), the beam spin
asymmetry, $\Sigma$ (LEPS), and the double polarization observables $C_x$ and
$C_z$ (CLAS). Two different fits were obtained: one that incorporates SU(3)
symmetry constraints on the Born contributions to the reaction amplitude and
one in which these constraints are relaxed. Explicit numerical results are
given only for the first fit since the two fits gave nearly identical results
for the observables and the $\chi^2$ per degree of freedom obtained with the
second fit was only marginally better than that of the first fit ($<1%$
better). Results are presented for the fitted observables at several different
energies and center-of-momentum (c.m.) frame kaon angles.
