We report results from searches for supersymmetry with trileptons plus
missing transverse energy and diphotons plus missing transverse energy made
using the D0 detector at the Fermilab Tevatron collider. These searches are
optimized for MSSM SUSY and GMSB, respectively. New limits are set on the
considered SUSY models. This article is the proceedings for a parallel talk
given at ICHEP08.
