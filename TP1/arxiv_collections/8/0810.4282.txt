We study the dynamics of a Fermi gas with a Coulomb interaction potential,
and show that, in a mean-field limiting regime, the dynamics is described by
the Hartree-Fock equation. This extends previous work of Bardos et al. to the
case of unbounded interaction potentials. We also express the mean-field limit
as a "superhamiltonian" system, and state our main result in terms of a
Heisenberg-picture dynamics of observables. This is a Egorov-type theorem.
