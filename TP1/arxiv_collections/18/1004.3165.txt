We show an Omega(sqrt{n}/T) lower bound for the space required by any
unidirectional constant-error randomized T-pass streaming algorithm that
recognizes whether an expression over two types of parenthesis is
well-parenthesized. This proves a conjecture due to Magniez, Mathieu, and Nayak
(2009) and rigorously establishes that bidirectional streams are exponentially
more efficient in space usage as compared with unidirectional ones. We obtain
the lower bound by establishing the minimum amount of information that is
necessarily revealed by the players about their respective inputs in a
two-party communication protocol for a variant of the Index function, namely
Augmented Index. The information cost trade-off is obtained by a novel
application of the conceptually simple and familiar ideas such as average
encoding and the cut-and-paste property of randomized protocols.
  Motivated by recent examples of exponential savings in space by streaming
quantum algorithms, we also study quantum protocols for Augmented Index.
Defining an appropriate notion of information cost for quantum protocols
involves a delicate balancing act between its applicability and the ease with
which we can analyze it. We define a notion of quantum information cost which
reflects some of the non-intuitive properties of quantum information and give a
trade-off for this notion. While this trade-off demonstrates the strength of
our proof techniques, it does not lead to a space lower bound for checking
parentheses. We leave such an implication for quantum streaming algorithms as
an intriguing open question.
