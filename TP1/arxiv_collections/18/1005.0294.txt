In this paper uniformly rotating relativistic rings are investigated
analytically utilizing two different approximations simultaneously: (1) an
expansion about the thin ring limit (the cross-section is small compared with
the size of the whole ring) (2) post-Newtonian expansions. The analytic results
for rings are compared with numerical solutions.
