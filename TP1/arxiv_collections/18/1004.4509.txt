We present a method for simulating fluid vesicles with in-plane orientational
ordering. The method involves computation of local curvature tensor and
parallel transport of the orientational field on a randomly triangulated
surface. It is shown that the model reproduces the known equilibrium
conformation of fluid membranes and work well for a large range of bending
rigidities. Introduction of nematic ordering leads to stiffening of the
membrane. Nematic ordering can also result in anisotropic rigidity on the
surface leading to formation of membrane tubes.
