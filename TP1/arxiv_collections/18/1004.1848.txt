We provide a snapshot of recent progress in hadron physics made using QCD's
Dyson-Schwinger equations, reviewing the generation of a quark anomalous
chromomagnetic moment, which may explain the longstanding puzzle of the
$a_1$-$\rho$ mass splitting, and the form of the pion and kaon valence-quark
parton distribution functions.
