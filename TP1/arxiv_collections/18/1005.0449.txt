Epitaxial growth of topological insulator Bi2Se3 thin films on nominally flat
and vicinal Si(111) substrates is studied. In order to achieve planner growth
front and better quality epifilms, a two-step growth method is adopted for the
van der Waal epitaxy of Bi2Se3 to proceed. By employing vicinal Si(111)
substrate surfaces, the in-pane growth rate anisotropy of Bi2Se3 is explored to
achieve single crystalline Bi2Se3 epifilms, in which threading defects and
twins are effectively suppressed. Optimization of the growth parameters has
resulted in vicinal Bi2Se3 films showing a carrier mobility of ~ 2000 cm2V-1s-1
and the background doping of ~ 3 x 1018 cm-3 of the as-grown layers. Such
samples not only show relatively high magnetoresistance but also a linear
dependence on magnetic field.
