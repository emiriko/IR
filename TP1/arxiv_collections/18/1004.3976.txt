We establish Strichartz estimates for the Schr\"odinger equation on
Riemannian manifolds $(\Omega,\g)$ with boundary, for both the compact case and
the case that $\Omega$ is the exterior of a smooth, non-trapping obstacle in
Euclidean space. The estimates for exterior domains are scale invariant; the
range of Lebesgue exponents $(p,q)$ for which we obtain these estimates is
smaller than the range known for Euclidean space, but includes the key
$L^4_tL^\infty_x$ estimate, which we use to give a simple proof of
well-posedness results for the energy critical Schr\"odinger equation in 3
dimensions. Our estimates on compact manifolds involve a loss of derivatives
with respect to the scale invariant index. We use these to establish
well-posedness for finite energy data of certain semilinear Schr\"odinger
equations on general compact manifolds with boundary.
