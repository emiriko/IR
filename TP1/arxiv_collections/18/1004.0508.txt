We study the interacting agegraphic dark energy (ADE) model in non-flat
universe by means of statefinder diagnostic and $w-w^{\prime}$ analysis. First,
the evolution of EoS parameter ($w_d$) and deceleration parameter ($q$) in
terms of scale factor for interacting ADE model in non-flat universe are
calculated. Dependence of $w_d$ on the ADE model parameters $n$ and $\alpha$ in
different spatial curvatures is investigated. We show that the evolution of $q$
is dependent on the type of spatial curvature, beside of dependence on
parameters $n$ and $\alpha$. The accelerated expansion takes place sooner in
open universe and later in closed universe compare with flat universe. Then, we
plot the evolutionary trajectories of the interacting ADE model for different
values of the parameters $n$ and $\alpha$ as well as for different
contributions of spatial curvature, in the statefinder parameters plane. In
addition to statefinder, we also investigate the ADE model in non-flat universe
with $w-w^{\prime}$ analysis.
