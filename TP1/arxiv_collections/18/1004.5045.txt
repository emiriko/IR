CONTEXT. Massive stars have high-multiplicity fractions, and many of them
have still undetected components, thus hampering the study of their properties.
AIMS. I study a sample of massive stars with high angular resolution to better
characterize their multiplicity. METHODS. I observed 138 fields that include at
least one massive star with AstraLux, a lucky imaging camera at the 2.2 m Calar
Alto telescope. I also used observations of 3 of those fields with ACS/HRC on
HST to obtain complementary information and to calibrate the AstraLux data. The
results were compared with existing information from the Washington Double Star
Catalog, Tycho-2, 2MASS, and other literature results. RESULTS. I discover 16
new optical companions of massive stars, the majority of which are likely to be
physically bound to their primaries. I also improve the accuracy for the
separation and magnitude difference of many previously known systems. In a few
cases the orbital motion is detected when comparing the new data with existing
ones and constraints on the orbits are provided. CONCLUSIONS. The analysis
indicate that the majority of the AstraLux detections are bound pairs. For a
range of separations of 0.1"-14" and magnitude differences lower than 8, I find
that the multiplicity fraction for massive stars is close to 50%. When objects
outside those ranges are included, the multiplicity fraction should be
considerably higher.
