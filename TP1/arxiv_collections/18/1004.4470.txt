We solve the problem of scattering and binding of two spin-1/2 fermions on a
one-dimensional superlattice with a period of twice the lattice spacing
analytically. We find the exact bound states and the scattering states,
consisting of a generalized Bethe ansatz augmented with an extra scattering
product due to "asymptotic" degeneracy. If a Bloch band is doubly occupied, the
extra wave can be a bound state in the continuum corresponding to a
single-particle interband transition. In all other cases, it corresponds to a
quasi-momentum changing, frustrated collision.
