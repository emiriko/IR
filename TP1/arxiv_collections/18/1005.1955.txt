The Megamaser Cosmology Project (MCP) aims to determine H0 by measuring
angular-diameter distances to galaxies in the Hubble flow using observations of
water vapor megamasers in the circumnuclear accretion disks of active galaxies.
The technique is based only on geometry and determines H0 in one step,
independent of standard candles and the extragalactic distance ladder. In Paper
I we presented a VLBI map of the maser emission from the Seyfert 2 galaxy UGC
3789. The map reveals an edge-on, sub-parsec disk in Keplerian rotation,
analogous to the megamaser disk in NGC 4258. Here we present 3.2 years of
monthly GBT observations of the megamaser disk in UGC 3789. We use these
observations to measure the centripetal accelerations of both the systemic and
high-velocity maser components. The measured accelerations suggest that maser
emission lines near the systemic velocity originate on the front side of the
accretion disk, primarily from segments of two narrow rings. Adopting a
two-ring model for the systemic features, we determine the angular-diameter
distance to UGC 3789 to be 49.9 +/- 7.0 Mpc. This is the most accurate
geometric distance yet obtained to a galaxy in the Hubble flow. Based on this
distance, we determine H0 = 69 +/- 11 km/s/Mpc. We also measure the mass of the
central black hole to be 1.09 x 10^7 solar masses +/- 14%. With additional
observations the uncertainty in the distance to this galaxy can be reduced to
under 10%. Observations of megamaser disks in other galaxies will further
reduce the uncertainty in H0 as measured by the MCP.
