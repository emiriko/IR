Shape types are a general concept of process types which work for many
process calculi. We extend the previously published Poly* system of shape types
to support name restriction. We evaluate the expressiveness of the extended
system by showing that shape types are more expressive than an implicitly typed
pi-calculus and an explicitly typed Mobile Ambients. We demonstrate that the
extended system makes it easier to enjoy advantages of shape types which
include polymorphism, principal typings, and a type inference implementation.
