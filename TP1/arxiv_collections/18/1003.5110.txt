We extend the phase field crystal method for nonequilibrium patterning to
stochastic systems with external source where transient dynamics is essential.
It was shown that at short time scales the system manifests pattern selection
processes. These processes are studied by means of the structure function
dynamics analysis. Nonequilibrium pattern-forming transitions are analyzed by
means of numerical simulations.
