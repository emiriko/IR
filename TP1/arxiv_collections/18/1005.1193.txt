Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods are not only a popular tool in the
analysis of state space models, but offer an alternative to MCMC in situations
where Bayesian inference must proceed via simulation. This paper introduces a
new SMC method that uses adaptive MCMC kernels for particle dynamics. The
proposed algorithm features an online stochastic optimization procedure to
select the best MCMC kernel and simultaneously learn optimal tuning parameters.
Theoretical results are presented that justify the approach and give guidance
on how it should be implemented. Empirical results, based on analysing data
from mixture models, show that the new adaptive SMC algorithm (ASMC) can both
choose the best MCMC kernel, and learn an appropriate scaling for it. ASMC with
a choice between kernels outperformed the adaptive MCMC algorithm of Haario et
al. (1998) in 5 out of the 6 cases considered.
