The transition from the ballistic electron transport to the diffuse one is
experimentally observed in the study of the magnetic phase transition in Ni
nanocontacts with different sizes. It is shown that the voltage $U_C$ needed
for Joule heating of the near-contact region to the critical temperature does
not depend on the contact size only in the diffuse mode. For the ballistic
contact it increases with decrease in the nanocontact size. The reduction of
the transport electron mean free path due to heating of NCs may result in
change of the electron transport mode from ballistic to diffusive one.
