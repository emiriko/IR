We show two universal, Boolean, deterministic logic schemes based on binary
noise timefunctions that can be realized without time-averaging units. The
first scheme is based on a new bipolar random telegraph wave scheme and the
second one makes use of the recent noise-based logic which is conjectured to be
the brain's method of logic operations [Physics Letters A 373 (2009)
2338-2342]. Error propagation and error removal issues are also addressed.
