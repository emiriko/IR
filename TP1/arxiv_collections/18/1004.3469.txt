We study how leptogenesis can be implemented in a seesaw model with $S_4$
flavor symmetry, which leads to the neutrino tri-bimaximal mixing matrix and
degenerate right-handed (RH) neutrino spectrum. Introducing a tiny soft $S_4$
symmetry breaking term in the RH neutrino mass matrix, we show that the
flavored resonant leptogenesis can be successfully realized, which can lower
the seesaw scale much so as to make it possible to probe in colliders. Even
though such a tiny soft breaking term is essential for leptogenesis, it does
not significantly affect the low energy observables. We also investigate how
the effective light neutrino mass $|<m_{ee}> |$ associated with neutrinoless
double beta decay can be predicted along with the neutrino mass hierarchies by
imposing experimental data of low-energy observables. We find a direct link
between leptogenesis and neutrinoless double beta decay characterized by
$|<m_{ee}>|$ through a high energy CP phase $\phi$, which is correlated with
low energy Majorana CP phases. It is shown that our predictions of $|<m_{ee}>|$
for some fixed parameters of high energy physics can be constrained by the
current observation of baryon asymmetry.
