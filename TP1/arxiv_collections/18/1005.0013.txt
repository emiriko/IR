We show that the recently developed self-consistent theory of Anderson
localization with a position-dependent diffusion coefficient is in quantitative
agreement with the supersymmetry approach up to terms of the order of $1/g_0^2$
(with $g_0$ the dimensionless conductance in the absence of interference
effects) and with large-scale {\it ab-initio} simulations of the classical wave
transport in disordered waveguides, at least for $g_0 \gtrsim 0.5$. In the
latter case, agreement is found even in the presence of absorption. Our
numerical results confirm that in open disordered media, the onset of Anderson
localization can be viewed as position-dependent diffusion.
