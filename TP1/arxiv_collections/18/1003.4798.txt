We investigate the critical core mass and the envelope growth timescale,
assuming grain-free envelopes, to examine how small cores are allowed to form
gas giants in the framework of the core accretion model. This is motivated by a
theoretical dilemma concerning Jupiter formation: Modelings of Jupiter's
interior suggest that it contains a small core of < 10 Earth mass, while many
core accretion models of Jupiter formation require a large core of > 10 Earth
mass to finish its formation by the time of disk dissipation. Reduction of
opacity in the accreting envelope is known to hasten gas giant formation.
Almost all the previous studies assumed grain-dominated opacity in the
envelope. Instead, we examine cases of grain-free envelopes in this study. Our
numerical simulations show that an isolated core of as small as 1.7 Earth mass
is able to capture disk gas to form a gas giant on a timescale of million
years, if the accreting envelope is grain-free; that value decreases to 0.75
Earth mass, if the envelope is metal-free, namely, composed purely of hydrogen
and helium. It is also shown that alkali atoms, which are known to be one of
the dominant opacity sources near 1500 K in the atmospheres of hot Jupiters,
have little contribution to determine the critical core mass. Our results
confirm that sedimentation and coagulation of grains in the accreting envelope
is a key to resolve the dilemma about Jupiter formation.
