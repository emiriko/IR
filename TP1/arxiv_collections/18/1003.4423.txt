We report room temperature ferromagnetism in boron-doped ZnO both
experimentally and theoretically. The single phase Zn1-xBxO films deposited
under high oxygen pressure by pulsed-laser deposition show ferromagnetic
behavior at room temperature. The saturation magnetization increases
monotonously from 0 to 1.5 emu/cm3 with the increasing of B component x from 0
to 6.8%. The first-principles calculations based on density functional theory
demonstrate that the ferromagnetism in B-doped ZnO originates from the induced
magnetic moments of oxygen atoms in the nearest neighbor sites to the B-Zn
vacancy pair. The calculated total magnetic moment increasing tendency with B
component is well consistent with experiments.
