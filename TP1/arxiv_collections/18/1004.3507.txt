The prediction of non-trivial topological phases in Bloch insulators in three
dimensions has recently been experimentally verified. Here, I provide a picture
for obtaining the $Z_{2}$ invariants for a three dimensional topological
insulator by deforming suitable 2d planes in momentum space and by using a
formula for the 2d $Z_{2}$ invariant based on the Chern number. The physical
interpretation of this formula is also clarified through the connection between
this formulation of the $Z_{2}$ invariant and the quantization of spin Hall
conductance in two dimensions.
