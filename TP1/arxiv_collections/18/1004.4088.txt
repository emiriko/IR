We study the magnetic domain wall structure in magnetic bilayers (two
ultrathin ferromagnetic layers separated by a non magnetic spacer) with
perpendicular magnetization. Combining magnetic force and ballistic electron
emission microscopies, we are able to reveal the details of the magnetic
structure of the wall with a high spatial accuracy. In these layers, we show
that the classical Bloch wall observed in single layers transforms into
superposed N\'eel walls due to the magnetic coupling between the ferromagnetic
layers. Quantitative agreement with micromagnetic calculations is achieved.
