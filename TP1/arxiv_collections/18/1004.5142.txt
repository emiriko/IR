This series of papers is devoted to identifying and explaining the properties
of strongly correlating liquids, i.e., liquids with more than 90% correlation
between their virial W and potential energy U fluctuations in the NVT ensemble.
Paper IV [N. Gnan et al., J. Chem. Phys. v131, 234504 (2009)] showed that
strongly correlating liquids have "isomorphs", which are curves in the phase
diagram along which structure, dynamics, and some thermodynamic properties are
invariant in reduced units. In the present paper, using the fact that
reduced-unit radial distribution functions are isomorph invariant, we derive an
expression for the shapes of isomorphs in the WU phase diagram of generalized
Lennard-Jones systems of one or more types of particles. The isomorph shape
depends only on the Lennard-Jones exponents; thus all isomorphs of standard
Lennard-Jones systems (with exponents 12 and 6) can be scaled onto to a single
curve. Two applications are given. One is testing the prediction that the
solid-liquid coexistence curve follows an isomorph by comparing to recent
simulations by Ahmed and Sadus [J. Chem. Phys. v131, 174504 (2009)]. Excellent
agreement is found on the liquid side of the coexistence, whereas the agreement
is worse on the solid side. A second application is the derivation of an
approximate equation of state for generalized Lennard-Jones systems by
combining the isomorph theory with the Rosenfeld-Tarazona expression for the
temperature dependence of potential energy on isochores. It is shown that the
new equation of state agrees well with simulations.
