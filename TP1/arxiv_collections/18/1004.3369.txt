It has been a long-standing issue to construct the statistics of identical
particles in $\kappa$-deformed spacetime. In this letter, we investigate
different ideas on this problem. Following the ideas of Young and Zegers, we
obtain the covariant and on-shell kappa two-particle state in 1+1 D in a
simpler way. Finally, a procedure to get such state in higher dimension is
proposed.
