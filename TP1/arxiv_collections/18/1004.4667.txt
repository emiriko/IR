We present a second paper of fully characterization of a sample of stars
whose low-depth transits were discovered by the OGLE-III campaign in order to
select the most promising candidates for spectroscopic confirmation, following
the same analysis done in Gallardo et al. (2005). We present new optical and
near-IR photometry, deriving physical parameters like effective temperature
(Teff), distance (d), the stellar radii (R*) and the companion radii (Rc). We
selected eight M (2800 K \le Teff \le 3850 K) or K (3850 K \le Teff \le 5150 K)
spectral type stellar objects as potential candidates to host exoplanets, even
though, considering the radii of their companions, only stars OGLE-TR-61,
OGLE-TR-74, OGLE-TR-123 and OGLE-TR-173 are the most promising M-type transit
candidates to host planets. Confirmation of the planetary nature of any of
these objects will yield another transiting extrasolar planet orbiting a M-type
star, or even more interesting, the first extrasolar planets orbiting a late
M-type dwarf of effective temperature about 2900 K.
