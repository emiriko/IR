Stress vs. strain fluctuations in athermal amorphous solids are an example of
`crackling noise' of the type studied extensively in the context of elastic
membranes moving through random potentials. Contrary to the latter, we do not
have a stochastic equation whose statistics agree with the measured ones. On
the other hand we show in this Letter that the statistics of the former exhibit
'density scaling' when the interparticle potential can be well approximated by
a power law. The distributions of sizes of dissipative events for a wide range
of densities and system sizes follow a single scaling function. We find that
both the system-size scaling of energy drops and the entire strain interval
statistics are invariant to changes in density. We use this to determine
accurately the exponents in the scaling laws, establishing that the present
crackling noise belongs to a different universality class.
