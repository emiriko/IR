We report thermal transport measurements performed on the
quasi-one-dimensional Bechgaard salts (TMTSF)2ClO4 and (TMTSF)2PF6 along the
a-direction. For both salts, magnon-drag effects are found to contribute
considerably to thermopower above 80 K. These results imply spin-charge
separation in the metallic state for both salts. Moreover, a linear
temperature-dependent thermal conductivity is found to be unaffected by anion
disorder below an anion ordering transition temperature TAO~25 K in
(TMTSF)2ClO4.
