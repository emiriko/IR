The results of data handling for E-184 experiment obtained with 70 GeV proton
beam irradiation of active target with carbon, silicon and lead plates are
presented. Two-prongs neutral charmed D0 and \v{D}0 -mesons decays were
selected. Signal / background ratio was (51+/-17) / (38+/-13). Registration
efficiency for mesons was defined and evaluation for charm production cross
section at threshold energy is presented: sigma(c\^c) = 7.1 +/- 2.4(stat.) +/-
1.4(syst.) (\mu/nucleon).
