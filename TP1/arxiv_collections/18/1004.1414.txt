We propose an interface between the spin of a photon and the spin of an
electron confined in a quantum dot embedded in a microcavity operating in the
weak coupling regime. This interface, based on spin selective photon reflection
from the cavity, can be used to construct a CNOT gate, a multi-photon entangler
and a photonic Bell-state analyzer. Finally, we analyze experimental
feasibility, concluding that the schemes can be implemented with current
technology.
