We revisit the current experimental bounds on fourth-generation Majorana
neutrino masses, including the effects of right handed neutrinos. Current
bounds from LEPII are significantly altered by a global analysis. We show that
the current bounds on fourth generation neutrinos decaying to eW and mu W can
be reduced to about 80 GeV (from the current bound of 90 GeV), while a neutrino
decaying to tau W can be as light as 62.1 GeV. The weakened bound opens up a
neutrino decay channel for intermediate mass Higgs, and interesting
multi-particle final states for Higgs and fourth generation lepton decays.
