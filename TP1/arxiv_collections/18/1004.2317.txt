In this paper, the geometric and dynamic phase components of overall phase
induced by 2{\pi} hyperbolic secant pulses in a quantum dot is analyzed. The
dependence of two phase components on the ratio of the Rabi frequency to the
detuning is investigated. Numerical results indicate that only for one resonant
pulse the induced overall phase is purely the geometric phase. With other
values of the ratio the overall phase consists of a nonzero dynamic part. The
effect of spin precession to decrease the dynamic phase is characterized and
discussed by analytical and numerical techniques. Utilizing the symmetry
relations of the phases, a scheme to eliminate the dynamic phase by multipulse
control is proposed. By choosing the proper parameter for each pulse, the
dynamic phases induced by different pulses cancel out. The total pure geometric
phase varies from -{\pi} to {\pi}, which realizes the arbitrary geometric
rotation of spin. Average fidelity is calculated and the effects of magnetic
field and decay of the trion state are compared and discussed. The results show
the crucial role of weak magnetic field for high fidelity (above 99.3%).
