In this paper we consider a simple Markov chain for bipartite graphs with
given degree sequence on $n$ vertices. We show that the mixing time of this
Markov chain is bounded above by a polynomial in $n$ in case of {\em
semi-regular} degree sequence. The novelty of our approach lays in the
construction of the canonical paths in Sinclair's method.
