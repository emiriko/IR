The key observation about the quantum reality is that it looks as if there is
a moment when a probability of a quantum event or events becomes reality for
us. However, after careful analysis, it looks plausible that what we believe is
a definite state in our reality, observed as an outcome of a quantum experiment
or experiments, is actually not a definite state. From there, we conclude that
quantum world is an active world whose influence lies beyond statistical and
permanent determination of reality as we know it.
