We provide theoretical investigations of the response of the Ar and H atoms
to an intense elliptically polarized few-cycle laser pulse, as a function of
light ellipticity. The time-dependent Schr{\"o}dinger equation describing the
least-bound electron is solved numerically, and differential quantities such as
the momentum distribution, the electron density in the continuum, and the
above-threshold ionization spectra are computed. These quantities provide
insight into the ionization dynamics and the electron rescattering process as a
function of light ellipticity, and reveal great similarities between the
response of Ar and H to the applied external field.
