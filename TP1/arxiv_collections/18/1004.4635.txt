Split-UED allows for the possibility that the lowest lying KK excitations of
the Standard Model fermions can be much lighter than the corresponding gauge or
Higgs KK states. This can happen provided the fermion bulk masses are chosen to
be large, in units of the inverse compactification radius, 1/R, and negative.
In this setup, all of the other KK states would be effectively decoupled from
low energy physics. Such a scenario would then lead to an apparent vector-like
fourth generation with an associated discrete symmetry that allows us to
accommodate a dark matter candidate. In this paper the rather unique
phenomenology presented by this picture will be examined.
