We have created heralded coherent state superpositions (CSS), by subtracting
up to three photons from a pulse of squeezed vacuum light. To produce such CSSs
at a sufficient rate, we used our high-efficiency photon-number-resolving
transition edge sensor to detect the subtracted photons. This is the first
experiment enabled by and utilizing the full photon-number-resolving
capabilities of this detector. The CSS produced by three-photon subtraction had
a mean photon number of 2.75 -0.24/+0.06 and a fidelity of 0.59 -0.14/+0.04
with an ideal CSS. This confirms that subtracting more photons results in
higher-amplitude CSSs.
