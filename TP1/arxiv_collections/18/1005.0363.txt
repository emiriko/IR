We investigate the effect of anomalous field enhancement in metamaterials
where the effective refractive index gradually changes from positive to
negative values, i.e. transition metamaterials. We demonstrate that
considerable field enhancement can be achieved in lossy optical transition
metamaterials that have electromagnetic material properties obtained from
experimental data. The field enhancement factor is found to be
polarization-dependent and largely determined by the material parameters and
the width of the transition layer.
