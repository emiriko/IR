The distribution function of the free energy fluctuations in one-dimensional
directed polymers with $\delta$-correlated random potential is studied by
mapping the replicated problem to the $N$-particle quantum boson system with
attractive interactions. We find the full set of eigenfunctions and eigenvalues
of this many-body system and perform the summation over the entire spectrum of
excited states. It is shown that in the thermodynamic limit the problem is
reduced to the Fredholm determinant with the Airy kernel yielding the universal
Tracy-Widom distribution, which is known to describe the statistical properties
of the Gaussian unitary ensemble as well as many other statistical systems.
