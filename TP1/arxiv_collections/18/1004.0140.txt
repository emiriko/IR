With an effective Lagrangian approach, we analyze several NN \to NN\pi\pi
channels by including various resonances with mass up to 1.72 GeV. For the
channels with the pion pair of isospin zero, we confirm the dominance of
N*(1440)\to N\sigma in the near threshold region. At higher energies and for
channels with the final pion pair of isospin one, we find large contributions
from N*(1440)\to \Delta\pi, double-Delta, \Delta(1600) \to N*(1440)\pi,
\Delta(1600) \to \Delta\pi and \Delta(1620) \to \Delta\pi. There are also
sizeable contributions from \Delta \to \Delta\pi, \Delta \to N\pi, N \to
\Delta\pi and nucleon pole at energies close to the threshold. We well
reproduce the total cross sections up to beam energies of 2.2 GeV except for
the pp\to pp\pi^0\pi^0 channel at energies around 1.1 GeV and our results agree
with the existing data of differential cross sections of pp \to pp\pi^+\pi^-,
pp \to nn\pi^+\pi^+ and pp \to pp\pi^0\pi^0 which are measured at CELSIUS and
COSY.
