We study spin-torque induced oscillations of MgO magnetic tunnel junctions in
the time domain. By using the Hilbert transform on the time traces, we obtain
for the first time a direct experimental measure of the coupling between the
power and the phase fluctuations. We deduce the power restoration rate and we
obtain low values for the coupling strength, which is consistent with the weak
frequency dependence on the applied voltage.
