We prove the existence of a spectral resolution of the Wheeler-DeWitt
equation when the underlying spacetime is a Friedman universe with flat spatial
slices and where the matter fields are comprised of the strong interaction,
with $\SU(3)$ replaced by a general $\SU(n)$, $n\ge 2$, and the electro-weak
interaction. The wave functions are maps from $\R[4n+10]$ to a subspace of the
antisymmetric Fock space, and one noteworthy result is that, whenever the
electro-weak interaction is involved, the image of an eigenfunction is in
general not one dimensional, i.e., in general it makes no sense specifying a
fermion and looking for an eigenfunction the range of which is contained in the
one dimensional vector space spanned by the fermion.
