We study the tunneling conductance of a clean normal metal/chiral p-wave
superconductor junction using the extended Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk formalism.
It is shown that the spin-orbit coupling of the Rashba type that is present
near the interface causes the subgap conductance peaks associated with the
Andreev surface bound states to shift to a nonzero bias. We also investigate
the effect of the Fermi wavevector mismatch between the normal metal and the
superconductor.
