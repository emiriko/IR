We introduce a remarkable subset "the stem" of the set of positive roots of a
reduced root system. The stem determines several interesting decompositions of
the corresponding reductive Lie algebra.
  It gives also a nice simple three dimensional subalgebra and a "Cayley
transform". In the present paper we apply the above devices to give a complete
classification of invariant hypercomplex structures on compact Lie groups.
