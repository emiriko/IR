An unbroken discrete symmetry, analogous to G-parity in QCD, exists in
standard model extensions with vector-like coupling of electroweak SU(2) to
"hidden sector" fermions that are confined by a strong gauge force. For an
irreducible SU(2) representation of the hidden sector fermions, the lightest
hidden sector states form an isotriplet of "pions" with calculable mass
splittings and couplings to standard model fields. The parity can be extended
to fermions in real representations of color SU(3), and can provide dark matter
candidates with distinct collider signatures.
