The dominant part of the difference between the observed and model
frequencies of the Sun can be approximated by a power law. We show that when
this empirical law is employed to correct the model frequencies and then the
small frequency separations are used for solar age determination, the results
are consistent with the meteoritic age (4.563 Gyr < t < 4.576 Gyr). We present
the results and compare with those obtained by using the ratios of small to
large frequency separations.
