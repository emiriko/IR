Recent experiments have shown that nature violates noncontextual inequalities
regardless of the state of the physical system. So far, all these inequalities
involve measurements of dichotomic observables. We show that state-independent
quantum contextuality can also be observed in the correlations between
measurements of observables with genuinely continuous spectra, highlighting the
universal character of the effect.
