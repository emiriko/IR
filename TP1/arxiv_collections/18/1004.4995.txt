It is shown that Einstein gravitational equations and canonical equations
following from the Dirac-Schwinger Hamiltonian in the Faddeev variables
coincide. For proving of this at first, the Einstein equations has been
rewritten in canonical variables, and after this, the time derivative of the
generalized momenta of the gravitational field in Faddeev form has been
calculated using canonical Poisson brackets. The results coincide.
