Graph transformation has been used to model concurrent systems in software
engineering, as well as in biochemistry and life sciences. The application of a
transformation rule can be characterised algebraically as construction of a
double-pushout (DPO) diagram in the category of graphs. We show how
intuitionistic linear logic can be extended with resource-bound quantification,
allowing for an implicit handling of the DPO conditions, and how resource logic
can be used to reason about graph transformation systems.
