We report on new measurements of the luminosity function (LF) and mass
function (MF) of field low-mass dwarfs derived from Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS) Data Release 6 (DR6) photometry. The analysis incorporates ~15 million
low-mass stars (0.1 Msun < M < 0.8 Msun), spread over 8,400 square degrees.
Stellar distances are estimated using new photometric parallax relations,
constructed from ugriz photometry of nearby low-mass stars with trigonometric
parallaxes. We use a technique that simultaneously measures Galactic structure
and the stellar LF from 7 < M_r < 16. We compare the LF to previous studies and
convert to a MF using the mass-luminosity relations of Delfosse et al., 2000.
The system MF, measured over -1.0 < log M/Msun < -0.1, is well-described by a
log-normal distribution with Mo = 0.25 Msun. We stress that our results should
not be extrapolated to other mass regimes. Our work generally agrees with prior
low-mass stellar MFs and places strong constraints on future star-formation
studies of the Milky Way.
