A universal theoretical framework has been proposed that the solid-to-liquid
glass transition and macromolecular motion within the entire temperature range
from Tg to Tm and the liquid flow are absolutely determined by the intrinsic 8
orders of transient 2-D mosaic geometric structures formed by exciting
interfaces. Interface excitations are cross-coupled electron pairs, which
attribute to the Van der Waals repulsion electron-electron pairs with 2-D
self-avoiding closed loops existing in any random system at any temperature. An
interface excitation state is a vector with 8 orders of additional restoring
torque, 8 orders of relaxation times, quantized energies and extra volumes.
Dynamics occurred by the slow inverse cascade generates the 8 orders of
potential loop-flows while the fast cascade rearranges the structure. The
delocalization mode is solitary wave along the 8 orders of geodesic. Solitary
wave is derived from the balance between inverse cascade and cascade.
Increasing temperature only increases the number of inverse cascade and
cascade. This model provides a unified mechanism to interpret ripplon,
reptation, Boson peak, Ising model, non-ergodic, free volume, hard-sphere,
tunneling, cage, compacting cluster, jamming behaviors, breaking solid lattice,
geometrical frustration, potential energy landscape, flow-percolation,
thermo-disorder-induced localized energy, average energy of cooperative
migration along one direction, critical entanglement chain length, and Reynolds
number, solitary wave, heteroclinic orbit in hydrodynamics. This model also
directly deduces the Lindemann ratio, the famous 3.4 power law of viscosity of
entangled macromolecules and the well-known WLF equation and shows that the
Clapeyron equation governing all first order phase transitions in
thermodynamics only holds true in each subsystem, instead of the system in
glass transition.
