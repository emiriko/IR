A demonstration of the principles of quantum key distribution is performed
using a single-photon source in a proof of concept test-bed over a distance of
2 km in standard telecommunications optical fiber. The single-photon source was
an optically-pumped quantum dot in a microcavity emitting at a wavelength of
895 nm. Characterization of the quantum key distribution parameters was
performed at a range of different optical excitation powers. An investigation
of the effect of varying the optical excitation power of the quantum dot
microcavity on the quantum bit error rate and cryptographic key exchange rate
of the system are presented.
