Drain away the earth's oceans and a global pattern of great ridges appears.
Adjacent to these continental and undersea mountain ranges are layers of silt
and clay, so thick that they fill the gaps between ridges, creating extensive
plateaus. Ranging across this planet's higher latitudes are thousands of tiny
replicas of these ridge systems. These esker and drumlin swarms run up hills
and across streams in roughly parallel discontinuous strands for hundreds of
kilometers. Preserved by encapsulation in the ice and snow of our last ice age,
eskers, drumlins and their related structures will be the focus of this paper.
We contend that Greater and lesser ridge systems alike, including the water and
sediments that fill them are cometary debris. Each ridge may be traced to a
single stream, or 'jet' of disintegrating materials emanating from shifting
areas on a comet's nucleus. A band of these jets, captured into planetary
orbit, will land its debris in a unique manner. All debris will be laid down in
a sheet perpendicular to the planetary surface, this process which results in
the sharp ridge profile, is consistent with the manner in which comets
discharge debris along the plane of their orbit. The jet particles, massive
enough to resist planetary atmosphere [sands, gravel and boulders] once landed
become robust structures through compacting and immediate concretization. The
water and lighter materials, diverted by winds and post-depositional melting,
flowed and settled into the inter-ridge basins. The establishment of the ridge
complexes found on earth is therefore consistent with its initial encounter
with a great comet. The ancestral body's return in reduced and fragmented form
laid down the lesser esker and drumlin formations.
