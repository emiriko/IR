The aim of this paper is to study the spectral gap and the logarithmic
Sobolev constant for continuous spin systems. A simple but general result for
estimating the spectral gap of finite dimensional systems is given by Theorem
1.1, in terms of the spectral gap for one-dimensional marginals. The study of
the topic provides us a chance, and it is indeed another aim of the paper, to
justify the power of the results obtained previously. The exact order in
dimension one (Proposition 1.4), and then the precise leading order and the
explicit positive regions of the spectral gap and the logarithmic Sobolev
constant for two typical infinite-dimensional models are presented (Theorems
6.2 and 6.3). Since we are interested in explicit estimates, the computations
become quite involved. A long section (Section 4) is devoted to the study of
the spectral gap in dimension one.
