Integration of fiber optics may play a critical role in the development of
quantum information processors based on trapped ions and atoms by enabling
scalable collection and delivery of light and coupling trapped ions to optical
microcavities. We trap 24Mg+ ions in a surface-electrode Paul trap that
includes an integrated optical fiber for detecting 280-nm fluorescence photons.
The collection numerical aperture is 0.37 and total collection efficiency is
2.1 %. The ion can be positioned between 80 \mum and 100 \mum from the tip of
the fiber by use of an adjustable rf-pseudopotential.
