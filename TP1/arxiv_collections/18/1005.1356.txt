Based on a point of view that solvency and security are first, this paper
considers regular-singular stochastic optimal control problem of a large
insurance company facing positive transaction cost asked by reinsurer under
solvency constraint. The company controls proportional reinsurance and dividend
pay-out policy to maximize the expected present value of the dividend pay-outs
until the time of bankruptcy. The paper aims at deriving the optimal retention
ratio, dividend payout level, explicit value function of the insurance company
via stochastic analysis and PDE methods. The results present the best
equilibrium point between maximization of dividend pay-outs and minimization of
risks. The paper also gets a risk-based capital standard to ensure the capital
requirement of can cover the total given risk. We present numerical results to
make analysis how the model parameters, such as, volatility, premium rate, and
risk level, impact on risk-based capital standard, optimal retention ratio,
optimal dividend payout level and the company's profit.
