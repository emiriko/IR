We study the star formation histories (SFH) and stellar populations of 213
red and 226 blue nearly face-on low surface brightness disk galaxies (LSBGs),
which are selected from the main galaxy sample of Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS) Data Release Seven (DR7). We also want to compare the stellar
populations and SFH between the two groups. The sample of both red and blue
LSBGs have sufficient signal-to-noise ratio in the spectral continua. We obtain
their absorption-line indices (e.g. Mg_2, H\delta_A), D_n(4000) and stellar
masses from the MPA/JHU catalogs to study their stellar populations and SFH.
Moreover we fit their optical spectra (stellar absorption lines and continua)
by using the spectral synthesis code STARLIGHT on the basis of the templates of
Simple Stellar Populations (SSPs). We find that red LSBGs tend to be relatively
older, higher metallicity, more massive and have higher surface mass density
than blue LSBGs. The D_n(4000)-H\delta_A plane shows that perhaps red and blue
LSBGs have different SFH: blue LSBGs are more likely to be experiencing a
sporadic star formation events at the present day, whereas red LSBGs are more
likely to form stars continuously over the past 1-2 Gyr. Moreover, the fraction
of galaxies that experienced recent sporadic formation events decreases with
increasing stellar mass. Furthermore, two sub-samples are defined for both red
and blue LSBGs: the sub-sample within the same stellar mass range of 9.5 <=
log(M_\star/M_\odot) <= 10.3, and the surface brightness limiting sub-sample
with \mu_0(R) <= 20.7 mag arcsec^{-2}. They show consistent results with the
total sample in the corresponding relationships, which confirm that our results
to compare the blue and red LSBGs are robust.
