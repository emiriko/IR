We investigate the possibility to monitor the dynamics of autoionizing states
in real time and control the yields of different ionization channels in helium
by simulating XUV-pump IR-probe experiments focused on the N=2 threshold. The
XUV pulse creates a coherent superposition of doubly excited states which is
found to decay by ejecting electrons in bursts. Prominent interference fringes
in the photoelectron angular distribution of the $2s$ and $2p$ ionization
channels are observed, along with sizable out-of-phase quantum beats in the
yields of the corresponding parent ions.
