It is shown that the Verlinde formula for the entropy variation of a
holographic screen is a consequence of the conversion of the particle energy in
horizon energy. The special role played by the particular displacement $\Delta
x = c^{2}/a$ is emphasized, $a$ being the particle acceleration. Using the
Heisenberg Principle we show that the energy on the causal horizon (viewed as a
holographic screen) of an inertial observer is proportional to its radius, as
for a black hole.
