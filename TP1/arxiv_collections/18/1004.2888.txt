In this paper we study the implementation challenge in an abstract
interdependent values model and an arbitrary objective function. We design a
mechanism that allows for approximate optimal implementation of insensitive
objective functions in ex-post Nash equilibrium. If, furthermore, values are
private then the same mechanism is strategy proof. We cast our results onto two
specific models: pricing and facility location. The mechanism we design is
optimal up to an additive factor of the order of magnitude of one over the
square root of the number of agents and involves no utility transfers.
  Underlying our mechanism is a lottery between two auxiliary mechanisms: with
high probability we actuate a mechanism that reduces players' influence on the
choice of the social alternative, while choosing the optimal outcome with high
probability. This is where the recent notion of differential privacy is
employed. With the complementary probability we actuate a mechanism that is
typically far from optimal but is incentive compatible. The joint mechanism
inherits the desired properties from both.
