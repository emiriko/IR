Suppose that $R$ is a ring essentially of finite type over a perfect field of
characteristic $p > 0$ and that $a \subseteq R$ is an ideal. We prove that the
set of $F$-jumping numbers of $\tau_b(R; a^t)$ has no limit points under the
assumption that $R$ is normal and $Q$-Gorenstein -- we do \emph{not} assume
that the $Q$-Gorenstein index is not divisible by $p$. Furthermore, we also
show that the $F$-jumping numbers of $\tau_b(R; \Delta, a^t)$ are discrete
under the more general assumption that $K_R + \Delta$ is $\bR$-Cartier.
