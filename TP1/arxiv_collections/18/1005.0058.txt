This letter shows that linear Cellular Automata based on rules 90/150
generate all the solutions of linear difference equations with binary constant
coefficients. Some of these solutions are pseudo-random noise sequences with
application in cryptography: the sequences generated by the class of shrinking
generators. Consequently, this contribution show that shrinking generators do
not provide enough guarantees to be used for encryption purposes. Furthermore,
the linearization is achieved through a simple algorithm about which a full
description is provided.
