The geometrical coupling between strain and twist in double helices is
investigated. Overwinding, where strain leads to further winding, is shown to
be a universal property for helices, which are stretched along their
longitudinal axis when the initial pitch angle is below the zero-twist angle
(39.4 deg). Unwinding occurs at larger pitch angles. The zero-twist angle is
the unique pitch angle at the point between overwinding and unwinding, and it
is independent of the mechanical properties of the double helix. This suggests
the existence of zero-twist structures, i.e. structures that display neither
overwinding, nor unwinding under strain. Estimates of the overwinding of DNA,
chromatin, and RNA are given.
