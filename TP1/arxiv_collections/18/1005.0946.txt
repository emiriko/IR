Current-driven magnetic domain wall motion is demonstrated in the quaternary
ferromagnetic semiconductor (Ga,Mn)(As,P) at temperatures well below the
ferromagnetic transition temperature, with critical currents of the order
10^5Acm^-2. This is enabled by a much weaker domain wall pinning compared to
(Ga,Mn)As layers grown on a strain-relaxed buffer layer. The critical current
is shown to be comparable with theoretical predictions. The wide temperature
range over which domain wall motion can be achieved indicates that this is a
promising system for developing an improved understanding of spin-transfer
torque in systems with strong spin-orbit interaction.
