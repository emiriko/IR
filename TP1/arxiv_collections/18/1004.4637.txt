If the lightest observable-sector supersymmetric particle (LOSP) is charged
and long-lived, then it may be possible to indirectly measure the Planck mass
at the LHC and provide a spectacular confirmation of supergravity as a symmetry
of nature. Unfortunately, this proposal is only feasible if the gravitino is
heavy enough to be measured at colliders, and this condition is in direct
conflict with constraints from big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN). In this work, we
show that the BBN bound can be naturally evaded in the presence of multiple
sectors which independently break supersymmetry, since there is a new decay
channel of the LOSP to a goldstino. Certain regions of parameter space allow
for a direct measurement of LOSP decays into both the goldstino and the
gravitino at the LHC. If the goldstino/gravitino mass ratio is measured to be
2, as suggested by theory, then this would provide dramatic verification of the
existence of multiple supersymmetry breaking and sequestering. A variety of
consistent cosmological scenarios are obtained within this framework. In
particular, if an R symmetry is imposed, then the gauge-gaugino-goldstino
interaction vertices can be forbidden. In this case, there is no bound on the
reheating temperature from goldstino overproduction, and thermal leptogenesis
can be accommodated consistently with gravitino dark matter.
