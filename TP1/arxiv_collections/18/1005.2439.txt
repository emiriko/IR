We investigate the role of equilibrium and nonequilibrium noise in the
magnetization dynamics on mono-domain ferromagnets. Starting from a microscopic
model we present a detailed derivation of the spin shot noise correlator. We
investigate the ramifications of the nonequilibrium noise on the spin torque
dynamics, both in the steady state precessional regime and the spin switching
regime. In the latter case we apply a generalized Fokker-Planck approach to
spin switching, which models the switching by an Arrhenius law with an
effective elevated temperature. We calculate the renormalization of the
effective temperature due to spin shot noise and show that the nonequilibrium
noise leads to the creation of cold and hot spot with respect to the noise
intensity.
