Grand unified theories where the neutrino mass is given by Type II seesaw
have the potential to provide interesting connections between the neutrino and
charged fermion sectors. We explore the possibility of having a dominant Type
II seesaw contribution in supersymmetric SO(10). We show that this can be
achieved in the model where symmetry breaking is triggered by 54 and
45-dimensional representations, without the need for additional fields other
than those already required to have a realistic charged fermion mass spectrum.
Physical consequences, such as the implementation of the BSV mechanism, the
possibility of the fields responsible for Type II see-saw dominance being
messengers of supersymmetry breaking, and the realization of baryo and
leptogenesis in this theories are discussed.
