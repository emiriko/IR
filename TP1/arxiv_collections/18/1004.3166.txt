We calculate the time-dependent non-linear transport current through an
interacting quantum dot in the single-electron tunneling regime (SET). We show
that an additional dc current is generated by the electron-electron interaction
by adiabatic out-of-phase modulation of the gate and bias voltage. This current
can arise only when two SET resonance conditions are simultaneously satisfied.
We propose an adiabatic transport spectroscopy where lock-in measurement of a
"time-averaged stability diagram" probes interactions, tunnel asymmetries and
changes in the ground state spin-degeneracy.
