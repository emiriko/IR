In this article we consider the affinely-rigid body moving in the
three-dimensional physical space and subject to the Kirchhoff-Love constraints,
i.e., while it deforms homogeneously in the two-dimensional central plane of
the body it simultaneously performs one-dimensional oscillations orthogonal to
this central plane. For the polar decomposition we obtain the stationary
ellipsoids as special solutions of the general, strongly nonlinear equations of
motion. It is also shown that these solutions are conceptually different from
those obtained earlier for the two-polar (singular value) decomposition.
