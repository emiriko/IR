We report experiments on gravity-capillary wave turbulence on the surface of
a fluid. The wave amplitudes are measured simultaneously in time and space
using an optical method. The full space-time power spectrum shows that the wave
energy is localized on several branches in the wave-vector-frequency space. The
number of branches depend on the power injected within the waves. The
measurement of the nonlinear dispersion relation is found to be well described
by a law suggesting that the energy transfer mechanisms involved in wave
turbulence are not only restricted to purely resonant interaction between
nonlinear waves. The power-law scaling of the spatial spectrum and the
probability distribution of the wave amplitudes at a given wave number are also
measured and compared to the theoretical predictions.
