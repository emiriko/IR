A third quantization formalism is applied to a simplified multiverse
scenario. A well defined quantum state of the multiverse is obtained which
agrees with standard boundary condition proposals. These states are found to be
squeezed, and related to accelerating universes: they share similar properties
to those obtained previously by Grishchuk and Siderov. We also comment on
related works that have criticized the third quantization approach.
