In this paper, the branching ratios and the direct CP-violating asymmetries
for decays $\bar B^0\to f_0(980)\bar K^{*0}$ and $B^-\to f_0(980)K^{*-}$ by
employing the perturbative QCD factorization approach are studied. In the
two-quark model supposition, $f_0(980)$ is commonly viewed as a mixture of
$s\bar{s}$ and $n\bar{n}(\equiv(u\bar{u}+d\bar{d})/\sqrt{2})$, that is
$|f_0(980)\ra = |s\bar s\ra\cos\theta+|n\bar n\ra\sin\theta$, where $\theta$ is
the $f_0-\sigma$ mixing angle. We find that the non-factorizable $f_0$ emission
type diagrams can give large contributions to the final results, which are
consistent with the present experimental data and the upper limit in the
allowed mixing angle ranges. We predict that the direct CP asymmetry ${\cal
A}^{dir}_{CP}(f_0(980)\bar K^{*0})$ is small, only a few percent, which can be
tested by future B factory experiments.
