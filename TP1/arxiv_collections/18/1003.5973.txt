The Bowman-Bradley theorem asserts that the multiple zeta values at the
sequences obtained by inserting a fixed number of twos between 3,1,...,3,1 add
up to a rational multiple of a power of pi. We establish its counterpart for
multiple zeta-star values by showing an identity in a non-commutative
polynomial algebra introduced by Hoffman.
