The NA62 experiment at CERN collected a large sample of K+ --> enu decays
during a dedicated run in 2007, aiming at a precise test of lepton universality
by measurement of the helicity suppressed ratio RK = BR(K+ --> enu)/BR(K+ -->
munu). A preliminary result of the analysis of a partial data sample of 51089
K+ --> enu candidates is presented.
