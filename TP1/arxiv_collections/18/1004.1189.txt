Analyses have found a "haze" of anomalous microwave emission surrounding the
Galactic Center in the WMAP sky maps. A recent study using Fermi data detected
a similar haze in the gamma-ray. Several studies have modeled these hazes as
radiation from the leptonic byproducts of dark matter annihilations, and
arguably no convincing astrophysical alternative has been suggested. We discuss
the characteristics of astrophysical cosmic ray sources that could potentially
explain this microwave and gamma-ray emission. The most promising astrophysical
scenarios involve cosmic ray sources that are clustered such that many fall
within ~1 kpc of the Galactic Center. For example, we show that several hundred
Galactic Center supernovae in the last million years plus a diffusion-hardened
electron spectrum may be consistent with present constraints on this emission.
Alternatively, it could be due to a burst of activity probably associated with
Sagittarius A* occurring ~1 Myr ago and producing >10^51 erg in cosmic ray
electrons. Different models predict different trends for the spectral index of
the microwave and gamma-ray spectrum as a function of angle from the Galactic
Center that should be robust to cosmic ray propagation uncertainties. In
particular, if the haze is from dark matter annihilations, it should have a
very hard microwave and gamma-ray spectrum for which the spectral shape does
not change significantly with angle, which we argue would be difficult to
achieve with any astrophysical mechanism. Observations with the Planck and
Fermi satellites can distinguish between viable haze models using these
signatures.
