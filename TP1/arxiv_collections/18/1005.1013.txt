In this work we suggest a simple theoretical solution of the Mpemba effect in
full agreement with known experimental data. This solution follows simply as an
especial approximation (linearization) of the usual heat (transfer) equation,
precisely linearization of the second derivation of the space part of the
temperature function (as it is well-known Newton cooling law can be considered
as the effective approximation of the heat (transfer) equation for constant
space part of the temperature function).
