Knowledge of an exoplanet's oblateness and obliquity would give clues about
its formation and internal structure. In principle, a light curve of a
transiting planet bears information about the planet's shape, but previous work
has shown that the oblateness-induced signal will be extremely difficult to
detect. Here we investigate the potentially larger signals due to planetary
spin precession. The most readily detectable effects are transit depth
variations (T$\delta$V) in a sequence of light curves. For a planet as oblate
as Jupiter or Saturn, the transit depth will undergo fractional variations of
order 1%. The most promising systems are those with orbital periods of
approximately 15--30 days, which is short enough for the precession period to
be less than about 40 years, and long enough to avoid spin-down due to tidal
friction. The detectability of the T$\delta$V signal would be enhanced by moons
(which would decrease the precession period) or planetary rings (which would
increase the amplitude). The Kepler mission should find several planets for
which precession-induced T$\delta$V signals will be detectable. Due to modeling
degeneracies, Kepler photometry would yield only a lower bound on oblateness.
The degeneracy could be lifted by observing the oblateness-induced asymmetry in
at least one transit light curve, or by making assumptions about the planetary
interior.
