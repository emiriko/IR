In this work, a wide family of LFSR-based sequence generators, the so-called
Clock-Controlled Shrinking Generators (CCSGs), has been analyzed and identified
with a subset of linear Cellular Automata (CA). In fact, a pair of linear
models describing the behavior of the CCSGs can be derived. The algorithm that
converts a given CCSG into a CA-based linear model is very simple and can be
applied to CCSGs in a range of practical interest. The linearity of these
cellular models can be advantageously used in two different ways: (a) for the
analysis and/or cryptanalysis of the CCSGs and (b) for the reconstruction of
the output sequence obtained from this kind of generators.
