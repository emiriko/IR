The universality of the Laplace-Runge-Lenz symmetry in all rotationally
symmetric systems is discussed. The independence of the symmetry on the type of
interaction is proven using only the most generic properties of the Poisson
brackets. Generalized Laplace-Runge-Lenz vectors are definable to be constant
(not only piece-wise conserved) for all cases, including systems with open
orbits. Applications are included for relativistic Coulomb systems and
electromagnetic/gravitational systems in the post-Newtonian approximation. The
evidence for the relativistic origin of the symmetry are extended to all
centrally symmetric systems.
