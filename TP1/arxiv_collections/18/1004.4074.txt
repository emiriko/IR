We describe the WA89 Collaboration experimental data on Lambda, Sigma(-),
Sigma(+), Xi(-), and Omega(-) baryons, and bar(Lambda) and bar(Xi(+))
antibaryons production in Sigma(-) collisions with C and Cu targets at 345
GeV/c (sqrt(s_(Sigma N)) ~ 25.5 GeV) in the frame of the Quark-Gluon String
Model. How the theoretical results compare to the experimental data is
discussed. Finally, some relations among the values of the model parameters
obtained with the help of quark combinatorics are presented.
