Kingman's Theorem on skeleton limits---passing from limits as $n\to \infty $
along $nh$ ($n\in \mathbb{N}$) for enough $h>0$ to limits as $t\to \infty $ for
$t\in \mathbb{R}$---is generalized to a Baire/measurable setting via a
topological approach. We explore its affinity with a combinatorial theorem due
to Kestelman and to Borwein and Ditor, and another due to Bergelson, Hindman
and Weiss. As applications, a theory of `rational' skeletons akin to Kingman's
integer skeletons, and more appropriate to a measurable setting, is developed,
and two combinatorial results in the spirit of van der Waerden's celebrated
theorem on arithmetic progressions are given.
