So far, the Standard Model of particle physics (SM) describes the
phenomenology observed in high energy physics. In the Large Hadron Collider
(LHC) is expected to find the Higgs boson, which is an essential part of SM;
also expects to see new particles or deviations from the SM, which would be
evidence of other truly fundamental theory. Consequently, a clear understanding
of the SM and, in general, quantum field theory is of great importance for
particle physics, however, students face a formalism and a set of concepts with
which they are unfamiliar. This paper shows how to make an approach to SM to
introduce students to the formalism and some fundamental concepts.
