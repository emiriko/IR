In these notes, we describe the recent progress in understanding the zero
sets of two remarkable Gaussian random functions: the Gaussian entire function
with invariant distribution of zeroes with respect to isometries of the complex
plane, and Gaussian spherical harmonics on the two-dimensional sphere.
