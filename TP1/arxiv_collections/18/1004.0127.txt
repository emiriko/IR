We investigate temporal behavior of probability density functions (pdfs) of
paradigmatic jump-type and continuous processes that, under confining regimes,
share common heavy-tailed asymptotic (target) pdfs. Namely, we have shown that
under suitable confinement conditions, the ordinary Fokker-Planck equation may
generate non-Gaussian heavy-tailed pdfs (like e.g. Cauchy or more general
L\'evy stable distribution) in its long time asymptotics. For diffusion-type
processes, our main focus is on their transient regimes and specifically the
crossover features, when initially infinite number of the pdf moments drops
down to a few or none at all. The time-dependence of the variance (if in
existence), $\sim t^{\gamma}$ with $0<\gamma <2$, in principle may be
interpreted as a signature of sub-, normal or super-diffusive behavior under
confining conditions; the exponent $\gamma $ is generically well defined in
substantial periods of time. However, there is no indication of any universal
time rate hierarchy, due to a proper choice of the driver and/or external
potential.
