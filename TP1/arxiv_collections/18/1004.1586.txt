Message passing type algorithms such as the so-called Belief Propagation
algorithm have recently gained a lot of attention in the statistics, signal
processing and machine learning communities as attractive algorithms for
solving a variety of optimization and inference problems. As a decentralized,
easy to implement and empirically successful algorithm, BP deserves attention
from the theoretical standpoint, and here not much is known at the present
stage. In order to fill this gap we consider the performance of the BP
algorithm in the context of the capacitated minimum-cost network flow problem -
the classical problem in the operations research field. We prove that BP
converges to the optimal solution in the pseudo-polynomial time, provided that
the optimal solution of the underlying problem is unique and the problem input
is integral. Moreover, we present a simple modification of the BP algorithm
which gives a fully polynomial-time randomized approximation scheme (FPRAS) for
the same problem, which no longer requires the uniqueness of the optimal
solution. This is the first instance where BP is proved to have
fully-polynomial running time. Our results thus provide a theoretical
justification for the viability of BP as an attractive method to solve an
important class of optimization problems.
