The thermal entanglement of the Hubbard dimer (two-site Hubbard model) has
been studied with the nonextensive statistics. We have calculated the
auto-correlation ($O_q$), pair correlation ($L_q$), concurrence ($\Gamma_q$)
and conditional entropy ($R_q$) as functions of entropic index $q$ and the
temperature $T$. The thermal entanglement is shown to considerably depend on
the entropic index. For $q < 1.0$, the threshold temperature where $\Gamma_q$
vanishes or $R_q$ changes its sign is more increased and the entanglement may
survive at higher temperatures than for $q=1.0$. Relations among $L_q$,
$\Gamma_q$ and $R_q$ are investigated. The physical meaning of the entropic
index $q$ is discussed with the microcanonical and superstatistical approaches.
The nonextensive statistics is applied also to Heisenberg dimers.
