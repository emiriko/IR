In the quantum sensing context most of the efforts to design novel quantum
techniques of sensing have been constrained to idealized, noise-free scenarios,
in which effects of environmental disturbances could be neglected. In this
work, we propose to exploit optical parametric amplification to boost
interferometry sensitivity in the presence of losses in a minimally invasive
scenario. By performing the amplification process on the microscopic probe
after the interaction with the sample, we can beat the losses detrimental
effect on the phase measurement which affects the single-photon state after its
interaction with the sample, and thus improve the achievable sensitivity.
