We report a single step synthesis of a polyisobutene with a bis-urea moiety
in the middle of the chain. In low polarity solvents, this polymer
self-assembles by hydrogen bonding to form a combshaped polymer with a central
hydrogen bonded backbone and polyisobutene arms. The comb backbone can be
reversibly broken, and consequently, its length can be tuned by changing the
solvent, the concentration or the temperature. Moreover, we have proved that
the bulkiness of the side-chains have a strong influence on both the
self-assembly pattern and the length of the backbone. Finally, the density of
arms can be reduced, by simply mixing with a low molar mass bis-urea.
