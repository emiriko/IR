We study real (massive) antisymmetric tensors of rank two in holographic
models of QCD based on the gauge/string duality. Our aim is to understand in
detail how the AdS/CFT correspondence describes correlators with tensor
currents in QCD. To this end we study a set of bootstrapped correlators with
spin-1 vector and tensor currents, imposing matching to QCD at the partonic
level. We show that a consistent description of this set of correlators yields
a very predictive picture. For instance, it imposes strong constraints on
infrared boundary conditions and precludes the introduction of dilatonic
backgrounds as a mechanism to achieve linear confinement. Additionally,
correlators with tensor currents turn out to be especially sensitive to chiral
symmetry breaking, thus offering an ideal testing ground for genuine QCD
effects. Several phenomenological consequences are explored, such as the
nontrivial interplay between $1^{+-}$ states and conventional $1^{--}$ vector
mesons.
