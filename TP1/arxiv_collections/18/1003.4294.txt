Accurate weak-lensing analysis requires not only accurate measurement of
galaxy shapes but also precise and unbiased measurement of galaxy redshifts.
The photometric redshift technique appears as the only possibility to determine
the redshift of the background galaxies used in the weak-lensing analysis.
Using the photometric redshift quality, simple shape measurement requirements,
and a proper sky model, we explore what could be an optimal weak-lensing dark
energy mission based on FoM calculation. We found that photometric redshifts
reach their best accuracy for the bulk of the faint galaxy population when
filters have a resolution R~3.2. We show that an optimal mission would survey
the sky through 8 filters using 2 cameras (visible and near infrared). Assuming
a 5-year mission duration, a mirror size of 1.5m, a 0.5deg2 FOV with a visible
pixel scale of 0.15", we found that a homogeneous survey reaching IAB=25.6
(10sigma) with a sky coverage of ~11000deg2 maximizes the Weak Lensing FoM. The
effective number density of galaxies then used for WL is ~45gal/arcmin2, at
least a factor of two better than ground based survey. This work demonstrates
that a full account of the observational strategy is required to properly
optimize the instrument parameters to maximize the FoM of the future
weak-lensing space dark energy mission.
