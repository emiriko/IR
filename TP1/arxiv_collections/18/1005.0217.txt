Decisional systems are based on multidimensional databases improving OLAP
analyses. The paper describes a new OLAP operator named "BLEND" to perform
multigradual analyses. The operation transforms multidimensional structures
during querying in order to analyse measures according to various granularity
levels, which are reorganised into a single parameter. We study valid
combinations of the operation in the context of strict hierarchies. First
experimentations implement the operation in an R-OLAP framework showing the
slight cost of this operation.
