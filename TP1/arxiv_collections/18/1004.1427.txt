A fundamental issue in nonlinear dynamics and statistical physics is how to
distinguish chaotic from stochastic fluctuations in short experimental
recordings. This dilemma underlies many complex systems models from stochastic
gene expression or stock exchange to quantum chaos. Traditionally,
deterministic chaos is characterized by "sensitive dependence on initial
conditions" as indicated by a positive Lyapunov exponent. However, ambiguity
arises when applying this criterion to real-world data that are corrupted by
measurement noise or perturbed nonautonomously by exogenous deterministic or
stochastic inputs. Here, we show that a positive Lyapunov exponent is
surprisingly neither necessary nor sufficient proof of deterministic chaos, and
that a nonlinear dynamical system under deterministic or stochastic forcing may
exhibit multiple forms of nonautonomous chaos assessable by a noise titration
assay. These findings lay the foundation for reliable analysis of
low-dimensional chaos for complex systems modeling and prediction of a wide
variety of physical, biological, and socioeconomic data.
