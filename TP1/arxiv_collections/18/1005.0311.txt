For more than ten years now, many efforts have been done to identify and
characterize nature of obstructed diffusion in model and cellular lipid
membranes. Amongst all the techniques developed for this purpose, FCS, by means
of determination of FCS diffusion laws, has been shown to be a very efficient
approach. In this paper, FCS diffusion laws are used to probe the behavior of a
pure lipid and a lipid mixture at temperatures below and above phase
transitions, both numerically, using a full thermodynamic model, and
experimentally. In both cases FCS diffusion laws exhibit deviation from free
diffusion and reveal the existence of domains. The variation of these domains
mean size with temperature is in perfect correlation with the enthalpy
fluctuation.
