Recently simpler criteria for the Hong-Mandel higher order squeezing (HOS)
and higher order subpossonian photon statistics (HOSPS) are provided by us
[Phys. Lett. A 374 (2010) 1009]. Here we have used these simplified criteria to
study the possibilities of observing HOSPS and HOS in different intermediate
states, such as generalized binomial state, hypergeometric state, negative
binomial state and photon added coherent state. It is shown that these states
may satisfy the condition of HOS and HOSPS. It is also shown that the depth and
region of nonclassicality can be controlled by controlling various parameters
related to intermediate states. Further, we have analyzed the mutual
relationship between different signatures of higher order nonclassicality with
reference to these intermediate states. We have observed that the generalized
binomial state may show signature of HOSPS in absence of HOS. Earlier we have
shown that NLVSS shows HOS in absence of HOSPS. Consequently it is established
that the HOSPS and HOS of same order are independent phenomenon.
