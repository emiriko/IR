We discuss the error reconciliation phase in quantum key distribution (QKD)
and analyse a simple scheme in which blocks with bad parity (that is, blocks
containing an odd number of errors) are discarded. We predict the performance
of this scheme and show, using a simulation, that the prediction is accurate.
