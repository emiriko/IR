Key management in wireless sensor networks faces several new challenges. The
scale, resource limitations, and new threats such as node capture necessitate
the use of an on-line key generation by the nodes themselves. However, the cost
of such schemes is high since their secrecy is based on computational
complexity. Recently, several research contributions justified that the
wireless channel itself can be used to generate information-theoretic secure
keys. By exchanging sampling messages during movement, a bit string can be
derived that is only known to the involved entities. Yet, movement is not the
only possibility to generate randomness. The channel response is also strongly
dependent on the frequency of the transmitted signal. In our work, we introduce
a protocol for key generation based on the frequency-selectivity of channel
fading. The practical advantage of this approach is that we do not require node
movement. Thus, the frequent case of a sensor network with static motes is
supported. Furthermore, the error correction property of the protocol mitigates
the effects of measurement errors and other temporal effects, giving rise to an
agreement rate of over 97%. We show the applicability of our protocol by
implementing it on MICAz motes, and evaluate its robustness and secrecy through
experiments and analysis.
