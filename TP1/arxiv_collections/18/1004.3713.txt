We establish large deviations properties valid for almost every sample path
of a class of stationary mixing processes $(X_1,..., X_n,...)$. These
properties are inherited from those of $S_n=\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$ and describe how
the local fluctuations of almost every realization of $S_n$ deviate from the
almost sure behavior. These results apply to the fluctuations of Brownian
motion, Birkhoff averages on hyperbolic dynamics, as well as branching random
walks. Also, they lead to new insights into the "randomness" of the digits of
expansions in integer bases of Pi. We formulate a new conjecture, supported by
numerical experiments, implying the normality of Pi.
