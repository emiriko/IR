A striking feature of the marine ecosystem is the regularity in its size
spectrum: the abundance of organisms as a function of their weight
approximately follows a power law over almost ten orders of magnitude. We
interpret this as evidence that the population dynamics in the ocean is
approximately scale-invariant. We use this invariance in the construction and
solution of a size-structured dynamical population model. Starting from a
Markov model encoding the basic processes of predation, reproduction,
maintenance respiration and intrinsic mortality, we derive a partial
integro-differential equation describing the dependence of abundance on weight
and time. Our model represents an extension of the jump-growth model and hence
also of earlier models based on the McKendrick--von Foerster equation. The
model is scale-invariant provided the rate functions of the stochastic
processes have certain scaling properties. We determine the steady-state power
law solution, whose exponent is determined by the relative scaling between the
rates of the density-dependent processes (predation) and the rates of the
density-independent processes (reproduction, maintenance, mortality). We study
the stability of the steady-state against small perturbations and find that
inclusion of maintenance respiration and reproduction in the model has astrong
stabilising effect. Furthermore, the steady state is unstable against a change
in the overall population density unless the reproduction rate exceeds a
certain threshold.
