We summarize observations with the Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) of 571
starbursts (strong PAH emission features), 128 obscured AGN (strong silicate
absorption), and 39 unobscured AGN (silicate emission). Sources range in
luminosity from 10^{8} to 10^{14} solar luminosities and continuously in
redshift for 0 < z < 3. The most luminous starbursts and AGN evolve as
(1+z)^{2.5} to z ~ 2.5; no clear evidence is found that this evolution ceases
beyond z = 2.5. Dust obscuration in starbursts is determined by comparing PAH
luminosity with ultraviolet luminosity and indicates severe obscuration in most
starbursts, even those selected in the ultraviolet; the median ratio (intrinsic
ultraviolet/observed ultraviolet) is ~ 50 for infrared selected starbursts and
~ 8 for ultraviolet selected starbursts. Obscuration increases with bolometric
luminosity, but starbursts which appear most luminous in the ultraviolet are
those with the least obscuration. This result indicates that extinction
corrections are significantly underestimated for ultraviolet selected sources,
suggesting that galaxies at z ~> 2 are more luminous than deduced only from
rest frame ultraviolet observations.
