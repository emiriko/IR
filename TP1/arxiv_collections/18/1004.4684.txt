Since the 1970's, theories of deformation and failure of amorphous, solidlike
materials have started with models in which stress-driven, molecular
rearrangements occur at localized flow defects via "shear transformations".
This picture is the basis for the modern theory of "shear transformation zones"
(STZ's), which is the focus of this review. We begin by describing the
structure of the theory in general terms and by showing several applications,
specifically: interpretation of stress-strain measurements for a bulk metallic
glass, analysis of numerical simulations of shear banding, and the use of the
STZ equations of motion in free-boundary calculations. In the second half of
this article, we focus for simplicity on what we call an "athermal" model of
amorphous plasticity, and use that model to illustrate how the STZ theory
emerges within a systematic formulation of nonequilibrium thermodynamics.
