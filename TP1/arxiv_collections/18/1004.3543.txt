An analysis of data from the Spitzer Space Telescope, Hubble Space Telescope,
Chandra X-ray Observatory, and AKARI Infrared Astronomy Satellite is presented
for the z=0.036 merging galaxy system II Zw 096 (CGCG 448-020). Because II Zw
096 has an infrared luminosity of log(L_IR/L_sun) = 11.94, it is classified as
a Luminous Infrared Galaxy (LIRG), and was observed as part of the Great
Observatories All-sky LIRG Survey (GOALS). The Spitzer data suggest that 80% of
the total infrared luminosity comes from an extremely compact, red source not
associated with the nuclei of the merging galaxies. The Spitzer mid-infrared
spectra indicate no high-ionization lines from a buried active galactic nucleus
in this source. The strong detection of the 3.3 micron and 6.2 micron PAH
emission features in the AKARI and Spitzer spectra also implies that the energy
source of II Zw 096 is a starburst. Based on Spitzer infrared imaging and AKARI
near-infrared spectroscopy, the star formation rate is estimated to be 120
M_sun/yr and > 45 M_sun/yr, respectively. Finally, the high-resolution B, I,
and H-band images show many star clusters in the interacting system. The colors
of these clusters suggest at least two populations - one with an age of 1-5 Myr
and one with an age of 20-500 Myr, reddened by 0-2 magnitudes of visual
extinction. The masses of these clusters span a range between 10^6-10^8 M_sun.
This starburst source is reminiscent of the extra-nuclear starburst seen in NGC
4038/9 (the Antennae Galaxies) and Arp 299 but approximately an order of
magnitude more luminous than the Antennae. The source is remarkable in that the
off-nuclear infrared luminosity dominates the enitre system.
