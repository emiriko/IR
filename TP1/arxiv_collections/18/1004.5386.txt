We study the properties of simulated high-redshift galaxies using
cosmological N-body/gasdynamical runs from the OverWhelmingly Large Simulations
(OWLS) project. The runs contrast several feedback implementations of varying
effectiveness: from no-feedback, to supernova-driven winds to powerful
AGN-driven outflows. These different feedback models result in large variations
in the abundance and structural properties of bright galaxies at z=2. We find
that feedback affects the baryonic mass of a galaxy much more severely than its
spin, which is on average roughly half that of its surrounding dark matter halo
in our runs. Feedback induces strong correlations between angular momentum
content and galaxy mass that leave their imprint on galaxy scaling relations
and morphologies. Encouragingly, we find that galaxy disks are common in
moderate-feedback runs, making up typically ~50% of all galaxies at the centers
of haloes with virial mass exceeding 1e11 M_sun. The size, stellar masses, and
circular speeds of simulated galaxies formed in such runs have properties that
straddle those of large star-forming disks and of compact early-type galaxies
at z=2. Once the detailed abundance and structural properties of these rare
objects are well established it may be possible to use them to gauge the
overall efficacy of feedback in the formation of high redshift galaxies.
