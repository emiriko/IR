Supermassive black holes are found at the centers of most galaxies and their
inspiral is a natural outcome when galaxies merge. The inspiral of these
systems is of utmost astrophysical importance as prodigious producers of
gravitational waves and in their possible role in energetic electromagnetic
events. We study such binary black hole coalescence under the influence of an
external magnetic field produced by the expected circumbinary disk surrounding
them. Solving the Einstein equations to describe the spacetime and using the
force-free approach for the electromagnetic fields and the tenuous plasma, we
present numerical evidence for possible jets driven by these systems. Extending
the process described by Blandford and Znajek for a single spinning black hole,
the picture that emerges suggests the electromagnetic field extracts energy
from the orbiting black holes, which ultimately merge and settle into the
standard Blandford-Znajek scenario. Emissions along dual and single jets would
be expected that could be observable to large distances.
