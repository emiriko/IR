As it is long known, the presence of a convective region creates a
discontinuity in the chemical profile of a star, which in turn translates into
a sharp variation of the adiabatic sound speed. This variation produces an
oscillatory behavior of the pulsation frequencies, to which low degree p-modes
are sensitive. We investigate the possibility of detecting the signature
related to the presence of a convective core in the frequency spectrum of
low-mass stars by means of suitable frequency combinations (such as separations
and ratios)
