We present a theory of vibrational modulation of two-dimensional coherent
Fourier transformed electronic spectra. Based on an expansion of the system's
energy gap correlation function in terms of Huang-Rhys factors, we explain the
time-dependent oscillatory behavior of the absorptive and dispersive parts of
two-dimensional spectra of a two-level electronic system, weakly coupled to
intramolecular vibrational modes. The theory predicts oscillations in the
relative amplitudes of the rephasing and non-rephasing parts of the
two-dimensional spectra, and enables to analyze time dependent two-dimensional
spectra in terms of simple elementary components whose line-shapes are dictated
by the interaction of the system with the solvent only. The theory is
applicable to both low and high energy (with respect to solvent induced line
broadening) vibrations. The results of this paper enable to qualitatively
explain experimental observations on low energy vibrations presented in the
preceding paper [A. Nemeth et al, arXiv:1003.4174v1] and to predict the time
evolution of two-dimensional spectra in ultrafast ultrabroad band experiments
on systems with high energy vibrations.
