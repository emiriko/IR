In this work, we study the large scale structure formation in the modified
gravity in the framework of Palatini formalism and compare the results with the
equivalent smooth dark energy models as a tool to distinguish between these
models. Through the inverse method, we reconstruct the dynamics of universe,
modified gravity action and the structure formation indicators like the
screened mass function and gravitational slip parameter. Consequently, we
extract the matter density power spectrum for these two models in the linear
regime and show that the modified gravity and dark energy models predictions
are slightly different from each other at large scales. It is also shown that
the growth index in the modified gravity unlike to the dark energy models is a
scale dependent parameter. We also compare the results with those from the
modified gravity in the metric formalism. The modification on the structure
formation can also change the CMB spectrum at large scales however due to the
cosmic variance it is hard to detect this signature. We show that a large
number of SNIa data in the order of 2000 will enable us to reconstruct the
modified gravity action with a suitable confidence level and test the cosmic
acceleration models by the structure formation.
