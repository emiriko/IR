Heavy electronic states originating from the f atomic orbitals underlie a
rich variety of quantum phases of matter. We use atomic scale imaging and
spectroscopy with the scanning tunneling microscope (STM) to examine the novel
electronic states that emerge from the uranium f states in URu2Si2. We find
that as the temperature is lowered, partial screening of the f electrons' spins
gives rise to a spatially modulated Kondo-Fano resonance that is maximal
between the surface U atoms. At T=17.5 K, URu2Si2 is known to undergo a 2nd
order phase transition from the Kondo lattice state into a phase with a hidden
order parameter. From tunneling spectroscopy, we identify a spatially
modulated, bias-asymmetric energy gap with a mean-field temperature dependence
that develops in the hidden order state. Spectroscopic imaging further reveals
a spatial correlation between the hidden order gap and the Kondo resonance,
suggesting that the two phenomena involve the same electronic states.
