We have introduced a spin-isospin dependent three-dimensional approach for
formulation of the three-nucleon scattering. Faddeev equation is expressed in
terms of vector Jacobi momenta and spin-isospin quantum numbers of each
nucleon. Our formalism is based on connecting the transition amplitude $T$ to
momentum-helicity representations of the two-body $t$-matrix and the deuteron
wave function. Finally the expressions for nucleon-deuteron elastic scattering
and full breakup process amplitudes are presented.
