We introduce the Deletable Bloom filter (DlBF) as a new spin on the popular
data structure based on compactly encoding the information of where collisions
happen when inserting elements. The DlBF design enables false-negative-free
deletions at a fraction of the cost in memory consumption, which turns to be
appealing for certain probabilistic filter applications.
