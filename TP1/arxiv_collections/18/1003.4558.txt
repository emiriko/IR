We examine the unique spectroscopic features which give rise to quantum
information processing attributes of one-dimensional
  J-aggregate systems, and as revealed by entanglement measures such as the von
Neumann entropy, Wootters concurrence and Wei-Goldbart geometric measure of
entanglement. The effect of dispersion and resonance terms in the
exciton-phonon interaction are analyzed using Green function formalism and
present J-aggregate systems as robust channels for large scale energy
propagation for a select range of parameters. We show that scaling of the third
order optical response $\chi^{(3)}$ with exciton delocalization size provides
an experimentally demonstrable measure of quantifying multipartite entanglement
in J-aggregates.
