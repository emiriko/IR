The recent experimental realization of cold polar molecules in the rotational
and vibrational ground state opens the door to the study of a wealth of
phenomena involving long-range interactions. By applying an optical lattice to
a gas of cold polar molecules one can create a layered system of planar traps.
Due to the long-range dipole-dipole interaction one expects a rich structure of
bound complexes in this geometry. We study the bilayer case and determine the
two-body bound state properties as a function of the interaction strength. The
results clearly show that a least one bound state will always be present in the
system. In addition, bound states at zero energy show universal behavior and
extend to very large radii. These results suggest that non-trivial bound
complexes of more than two particles are likely in the bilayer and in more
complicated chain structures in multi-layer systems.
