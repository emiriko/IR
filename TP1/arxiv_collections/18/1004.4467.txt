Capacity, Robustness, & Perceptual quality of watermark data are very
important issues to be considered. A lot of research is going on to increase
these parameters for watermarking of the digital images, as there is always a
tradeoff among them. . In this paper an efficient watermarking algorithm to
improve payload and robustness without affecting perceptual quality of image
data based on DWT is discussed. The aim of the paper is to employ the nested
watermarks in wavelet domain which increases the capacity and ultimately the
robustness against attacks and selection of different scaling factor values for
LL & HH bands and during embedding not to create the visible artifacts in the
original image and therefore the original and watermarked image is similar.
