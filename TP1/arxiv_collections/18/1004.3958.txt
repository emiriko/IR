An analytic parametrization of the hyperonic matter equation of state based
on microscopic Brueckner-Hartree-Fock calculations has been constructed using
the realistic Argonne V18 nucleon-nucleon potential plus a three-body force of
Urbana type, and three models of the hyperon-nucleon interaction: the Nijmegen
soft-core models NSC89 and NSC97e, and the most recent meson-exchange potential
of the Juelich group. The construction of this parametrization is based on a
simple phase-space analysis and reproduces with good accuracy the results of
the microscopic calculations with a small number of parameters. This
parametrization allows for rapid calculations that accurately mimic the
microscopic results, being therefore, very useful from a practical point of
view.
