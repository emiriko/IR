We consider a heterostructure of a metal and a barrier with onsite
correlation at half filling using unrestricted Hartree Fock. We find that above
a certain value of correlation strength in the barrier planes, the system is a
Mott insulator, while below this value the system still behaves like a gapless
insulator. The energy spectrum is found to be very novel with the presence of
multiple gaps. Thus the system remains non metallic for any finite value of
correlation.
