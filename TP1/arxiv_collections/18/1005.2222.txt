We report the results of a search for pair production of scalar bottom quarks
(sbottom) and scalar third-generation leptoquarks in 5.2 fb-1 of ppbar
collisions at the D0 experiment of the Fermilab Tevatron Collider. Scalar
bottom quarks are assumed to decay to a neutralino and a $b$ quark, and we set
95% C.L. lower limits on their production in the (m_sbottom, m_neutralino) mass
plane such as m_sbottom>247 GeV for m_neutralino=0 and m_neutralino>110 GeV for
160<m_sbottom<200 GeV. The leptoquarks are assumed to decay to a tau neutrino
and a $b$ quark, and we set a 95% C.L. lower limit of 247 GeV on the mass of a
charge-1/3 third-generation scalar leptoquark.
