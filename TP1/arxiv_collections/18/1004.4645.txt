A manifold $M$ is locally conformally Kahler (LCK) if it admits a Kahler
covering with monodromy acting by holomorphic homotheties. Let $M$ be an LCK
manifold admitting a holomorphic conformal flow of diffeomorphisms, lifted to a
non-isometric homothetic flow on its covering. We show that $M$ admits an
automorphic potential. This version was added 10 years after publication to
correct some errors in the original.
