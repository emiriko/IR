We study products of the affine geometric crystal of type A corresponding to
symmetric powers of the standard representation. The quotient of this product
by the R-matrix action is constructed inside the unipotent loop group. This
quotient crystal has a semi-infinite limit, where the crystal structure is
described in terms of limit ratios previously appearing in the study of total
positivity of loop groups.
