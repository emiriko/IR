We analyze the chiral phase transition with the help of the QCD gap equation.
Various models for the effective interaction in rainbow truncation are
contrasted with regard to the resulting chiral transition temperatures. In
particular, we investigate possible systematic relations of the details of the
effective interaction and the value of T_c. In addition, we quantify changes to
the transition temperature beyond the rainbow truncation.
