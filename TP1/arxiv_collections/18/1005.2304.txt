We have investigated the influence of Ca ions substitution on the structural
and superconducting properties of (Nd1-xCax)(Ba1.6La0.4)Cu3Oz system.
Magnetization, X-ray diffraction and neutron diffraction studies have been
carried out on a series of compounds with x = 0.0 to 0.6. The superconducting
transition temperature Tc, determined from magnetization measurements increases
with increasing Ca2+ substitution. Neutron diffraction studies reveal that
these compounds crystallize in a tetragonal structure (space group P4/mmm). A
detailed analysis of the neutron diffraction data reveals that Ca and La ions
are intermixed at the nominal Ba and Nd sites. While a major fraction of Ca
ions occupy the usual Nd site, a small fraction occupies the Ba site.
Consequently, the corresponding amount of La substitutes at the nominal Nd
site. The intermixing of Ca and La sites randomizes the chain site oxygens
leading to a tetragonal structure despite an oxygen content close to 7.0 for
all the Ca doped samples. Further increase of Ca content lead to change in its
co-ordination from six-fold to eight-fold at x >= 0.4.
