Differential Stark shift compensation for ground state $^{87}$Rb atoms
trapped in an elliptically polarized optical lattice and "magic" magnetic
field, was recently proposed and demonstrated experimentally by N. Lundblad
{\it et al.}, arXiv:0912.1528 and analyzed theoretically by A. Derevianko,
arXiv:0912.3233. Here we demonstrate for the first time enhanced hyperfine
coherence times using the magic field technique. We observe coherent light
storage with a 0.32 s lifetime in an atomic Rb gas confined in a one
dimensional optical lattice and magnetic field.
