This appendix shows that the Fundamental lemma of Jacquet-Rallis, proved by
Zhiwei Yun in the positive charactersitic case, is also true in characteristic
zero, when residue characteristic is sufficiently large. In fact, this follows
immediately from the article "Transfer Principle for the Fundamental Lemma" by
R. Cluckers, T.C. Hales and F.Loeser.
