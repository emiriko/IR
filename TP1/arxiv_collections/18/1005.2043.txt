We investigate the interacting Dirac fermions on honeycomb lattice by cluster
dynamical mean-field theory (CDMFT) combined with continuous time quantum Monte
Carlo simulation (CTQMC). A novel scenario for the semimetal-Mott insulator
transition of the interacting Dirac fermions is found beyond the previous DMFT
studies. We demonstrate that the non-local spatial correlations play a vital
role in the Mott transition on the honeycomb lattice. We also elaborate the
experimental protocol to observe this phase transition by the ultracold atoms
on optical honeycomb lattice.
