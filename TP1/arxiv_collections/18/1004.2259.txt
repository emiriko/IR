Three novel multilinear embedding estimates for the fractional Laplacian are
obtained in terms of trace integrals restricted to the diagonal. The resulting
sharp inequalities may be viewed as extensions of the Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev
inequality, the Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality and Pitt's inequality.
