It is a fact that the minimal conductivity $\sigma_0$ of most graphene
samples is larger than the well-established universal value for ideal graphene
$4e^2/\pi h$; in particular, larger by a factor $\gtrsim\pi$. Despite intense
theoretical activity, this fundamental issue has eluded an explanation so far.
Here we present fully atomistic quantum mechanical estimates of the graphene
minimal conductivity where electron-electron interactions are considered in the
framework of density functional theory. We show the first conclusive evidence
of the dominant role on the minimal conductivity of charged impurities over
ripples, which have no visible effect. Furthermore, in combination with the
logarithmic scaling law for diffusive metallic graphene, we ellucidate the
origin of the ubiquitously observed minimal conductivity in the range $8e^2/h >
\sigma_0 \gtrsim 4e^2/h$.
