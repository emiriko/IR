A correlation measure relating to measured and unmeasured local quantities in
quantum mechanics is introduced, and is then applied to assess the locality
implications for Bell/CHSH and similar set-ups. This leads to some interesting
results, and the scheme is extended to the generalized no-signalling boxes
framework. Some questions are raised about the use of counterfactual reasoning
in quantum mechanics.
