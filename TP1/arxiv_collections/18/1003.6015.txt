By means of computer simulations and solution of the equations of the Mode
Coupling Theory (MCT), we investigate the role of the intramolecular barriers
on several dynamic aspects of non-entangled polymers. The investigated dynamic
range extends from the caging regime characteristic of glass-formers to the
relaxation of the chain Rouse modes. We review our recent work on this
question, provide new results and critically discuss the limitations of the
theory. Solutions of the MCT for the structural relaxation reproduce
qualitative trends of simulations for weak and moderate barriers. However a
progressive discrepancy is revealed as the limit of stiff chains is approached.
This disagreement does not seem related with dynamic heterogeneities, which
indeed are not enhanced by increasing barrier strength. It is not connected
either with the breakdown of the convolution approximation for three-point
static correlations, which retains its validity for stiff chains. These
findings suggest the need of an improvement of the MCT equations for polymer
melts. Concerning the relaxation of the chain degrees of freedom, MCT provides
a microscopic basis for time scales from chain reorientation down to the caging
regime. It rationalizes, from first principles, the observed devations from the
Rouse model on increasing the barrier strength. These include anomalous scaling
of relaxation times, long-time plateaux, and non-monotonous wavelength
dependence of the mode correlators.
