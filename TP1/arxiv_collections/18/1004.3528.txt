In this paper we discuss hypotheses on formation of ocean skeletal
structures. These structures entered the ocean together with atmospheric
precipitation and were assembled from fragments of skeletal structures present
in clouds. We base interpretation of this phenomenon on surface tension forces
between fundamental tubular blocks of the investigated structures that may also
occur beneath the ocean surface. A capillary model is presented to explain
formation of a network of interacting tubes. Data about the nature of ocean
skeletal structures can be instrumental in modeling many processes associated
with physics of the ocean.
