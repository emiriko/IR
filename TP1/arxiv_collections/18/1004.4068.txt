The partonic transport model BAMPS (a Boltzmann approach to multiparton
scatterings) is employed to investigate different aspects of heavy ion
collisions within a common framework based on perturbative QCD. This report
focuses on the joint investigation of the collective behavior of the created
medium and the energy loss of high-pT gluons traversing this medium. To this
end the elliptic flow and the nuclear modification factor of gluons in heavy
ion collisions at 200 AGeV are simulated with BAMPS. The mechanism for the
energy loss of high energy gluons within BAMPS is studied in detail. For this,
purely elastic interactions are compared to radiative processes, gg -> ggg,
that are implemented based on the matrix element by Gunion and Bertsch. The
latter are found to be the dominant source of energy loss within the framework
employed in this work.
