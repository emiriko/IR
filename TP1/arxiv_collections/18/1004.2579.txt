We discuss methods, based on the theory of vector-valued modular forms, to
determine all modular differential equations satisfied by the conformal
characters of RCFT; these modular equations are related to the null vector
relations of the operator algebra. Besides describing effective algorithmic
procedures, we illustrate our methods on an explicit example.
