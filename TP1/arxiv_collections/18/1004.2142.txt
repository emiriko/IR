Libgober and Wood proved that the Chern number $c_{1}c_{n-1}$ of a
$n$-dimensional compact complex manifold can be determined by its Hirzebruch
$\chi_{y}$-genus. Inspired by the idea of their proof, we show that, for
compact, spin, almost-complex manifolds, more Chern numbers can be determined
by the indices of some twisted Dirac and signature operators. As a byproduct,
we get a divisibility result of certain characteristic number for such
manifolds. Using our method, we give a direct proof of Libgober-Wood's result,
which was originally proved by induction.
