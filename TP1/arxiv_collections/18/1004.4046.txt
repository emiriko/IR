One pot synthetic technique was used to synthesize mesoporous fullerene using
highly ordered mesoporous template such as KIT6-150 and SBA-15-150. Highly
ordered porous fullerene with cross linkage between the fullerene molecules was
obtained at high temperature 900 0C. This type of highly ordered and high
surface area mesoporous fullerence was used as catalyst to study anodic
performance in sulphuric acid medium. Finally, it was used to test its
catalytic activity for electrochemical methanol oxidation. For anodic
performance and methanol oxidation experiment, mesofullerene was impregnated
with pt-nano particles. Mesoporous Fullerene-Pt nano-composite showed quite an
unusual electrochemical property for electro oxidation of methanol and good
anodic performance in acidic electrolyte. The anodic performance was much
better than the commercially available carbon black. This short communiation is
a report mentioning the synthetic strategy to prepare mesofullerene and
electrode preparation to study its electrochemical performance. This
mesofullerene is potential catalyst for fuel cell application.
