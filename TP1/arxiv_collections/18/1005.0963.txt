The paper presents a current tunable multifunction filter using current
conveyor. The proposed circuit can be realized as on chip tunable low pass,
high pass, band pass and elliptical notch filter. The circuit employs two
current conveyors, one OTA, four resistors and two grounded capacitors, ideal
for integration. It has only one output terminal and the number of input
terminals may be used. Further, there is no requirement for component matching
in the circuit. The resonance frequency ({\omega}0) and bandwidth ({\omega}0
/Q) enjoy orthogonal tuning. The cutoff frequency of the filter is tunable by
changing the bias current, which makes it on chip tunable filter. The circuit
is realized by using commercially available current conveyor AD844 and OTA
LM13700. A HSPICE simulation of circuit is also studied for the verification of
theoretical results.
