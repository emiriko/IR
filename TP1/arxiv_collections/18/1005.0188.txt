We introduce two kernels that extend the mean map, which embeds probability
measures in Hilbert spaces. The generative mean map kernel (GMMK) is a smooth
similarity measure between probabilistic models. The latent mean map kernel
(LMMK) generalizes the non-iid formulation of Hilbert space embeddings of
empirical distributions in order to incorporate latent variable models. When
comparing certain classes of distributions, the GMMK exhibits beneficial
regularization and generalization properties not shown for previous generative
kernels. We present experiments comparing support vector machine performance
using the GMMK and LMMK between hidden Markov models to the performance of
other methods on discrete and continuous observation sequence data. The results
suggest that, in many cases, the GMMK has generalization error competitive with
or better than other methods.
