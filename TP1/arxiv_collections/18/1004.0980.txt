Atomic population transfer in an inhomogeneously broadened optical medium is
analyzed for on-demand photon storage-time control in both atomic frequency
comb (AFC) and phase locked echoes. In AFC the photon storage mechanism belongs
to the conventional three-pulse photon echoes, while the storage time control
is limited by conventional two-pulse photon echoes.
