The problem of resolution of singularities in positive characteristic can be
reformulated as follows: Fix a hypersurface $X$, embedded in a smooth scheme,
with points of multiplicity at most $n$. Let an $n$-sequence of transformations
of $X$ be a finite composition of monoidal transformations with centers
included in the $n$-fold points of $X$, and of its successive strict
transforms. The open problem (in positive characteristic) is to prove that
there is an $n$-sequence such that the final strict transform of $X$ has no
points of multiplicity $n$ (no $n$-fold points).
  In characteristic zero, such an $n$-sequence is defined in two steps: the
first consisting in the transformation of $X$ to a hypersurface with $n$-fold
points in the so called monomial case. The second step consists in the
elimination of these $n$-fold points (in the monomial case), which is achieved
by a simple combinatorial procedure for choices of centers.
  The invariants treated in this work allow us to define a notion of strong
monomial case which parallels that of monomial case in characteristic zero: If
a hypersurface is within the strong monomial case we prove that a resolution
can be achieved in a combinatorial manner.
