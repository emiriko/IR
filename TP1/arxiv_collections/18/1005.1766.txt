We theoretically study the effect of pulse trapping inside one-dimensional
photonic crystal with relaxing cubic nonlinearity. We analyze dependence of
light localization on pulse intensity and explain its physical mechanism as
connected with formation of dynamical nonlinear cavity inside the structure. We
search for the range of optimal values of parameters (relaxation time and pulse
duration) and show that pulse trapping can be observed only for positive
nonlinearity coefficients. We suppose that this effect can be useful for
realization of optical memory and limiting.
