Fuzzy c-means clustering is widely used to identify cluster structures in
high-dimensional data sets, such as those obtained in DNA microarray and
quantitative proteomics experiments. One of its main limitations is the lack of
a computationally fast method to determine the two parameters fuzzifier and
cluster number. Wrong parameter values may either lead to the inclusion of
purely random fluctuations in the results or ignore potentially important data.
The optimal solution has parameter values for which the clustering does not
yield any results for a purely random data set but which detects cluster
formation with maximum resolution on the edge of randomness. Estimation of the
optimal parameter values is achieved by evaluation of the results of the
clustering procedure applied to randomized data sets. In this case, the optimal
value of the fuzzifier follows common rules that depend only on the main
properties of the data set. Taking the dimension of the set and the number of
objects as input values instead of evaluating the entire data set allows us to
propose a functional relationship determining its value directly. This result
speaks strongly against setting the fuzzifier equal to 2 as typically done in
many previous studies. Validation indices are generally used for the estimation
of the optimal number of clusters. A comparison shows that the minimum distance
between the centroids provides results that are at least equivalent or better
than those obtained by other computationally more expensive indices.
