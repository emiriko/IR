Eclipsing binary systems form the fundamental basis of Astronomy in the sense
that they are the primary means to determine fundamental stellar astrophysical
quantities such as mass, radius, and temperature. Furthermore, they allow us to
study the internal dynamos and resulting magnetic cycles of stars that we would
normally only be able to study for one star, our Sun. The systems themselves
are extremely interesting objects, consisting of a multitude of configurations
that are tied together by a complex evolutionary history. Finally, they allow
us to test theories of stellar structure and even General Relativity. Thus the
accurate observation and modeling of these systems is of great importance to
the field. The first three chapters of this thesis are devoted to acquainting a
reader with a general science background, but no knowledge of Astronomy, to
eclipsing binaries and the field in general, and should provide the reader with
an adequate background to understand the rest of the thesis. The subsequent
eight chapters are each devoted to the analysis of eight separate systems, (RT
And, TU Boo, KV Gem, UU Lyn, MY Cyg, KR Per, RU Eri, and YY Cet), with each
chapter arranged as would be generally found in a journal article. The
collected data, models, and derived parameters for each system are analyzed in
context to previous findings and general trends seen throughout the thesis. An
evolutionary scenario for the formation of A and W type W Uma systems, with two
types of near-contact systems as precursors and intermediates, is proposed.
