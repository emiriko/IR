Atoms can be trapped using a combination of static and rotating magnetic
fields. A theoretical analysis is performed of a rotating polarisation axis
which is used to eliminate regions of zero coupling. A similar result is found
using linear polarisation, but in the case of circular polarisation no
orientational dependence in the coupling remains when on resonance.
