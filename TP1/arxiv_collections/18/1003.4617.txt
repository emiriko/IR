We discuss the dynamics of interacting atomic bright solitons and dark
bubbles in bulk immiscible Bose-Einstein condensates. Coherent matter-wave
clusters can be constructed using dark-bright pairs with appropriate phases. In
two dimensions we describe novel types of matter-wave molecules without a
scalar counterpart that can be seen as bound states of vector objects.
