In order to understand thermodynamical properties of N D-branes with chemical
potentials associated with R-symmetry charges, we study a one dimensional large
N gauge theory (bosonic BFSS type model) as a first step. This model is
obtained through a dimensional reduction of a 1+D dimensional SU(N) Yang-Mills
theory and we use a 1/D expansion to investigate the phase structure. We find
three phases in the \mu-T plane. We also show that all the adjoint scalars
condense at large D and obtain a mass dynamically. This dynamical mass protects
our model from the usual perturbative instability of massless scalars in a
non-zero chemical potential. We find that the system is at least meta-stable
for arbitrary large values of the chemical potentials in D \to \infty limit. We
also explore the existence of similar condensation in higher dimensional gauge
theories in a high temperature limit. In 2 and 3 dimensions, the condensation
always happens as in one dimensional case. On the other hand, if the dimension
is higher than 4, there is a critical chemical potential and the condensation
happens only if the chemical potentials are below it.
