We represent the coordinate ring of algebraic hulls (which are
generalizations of the Malcev completions of nilpotent groups for solvable
groups) of solvmanifolds $G/\Gamma$ by using Miller's exponential iterated
integrals (which are extensions of Chen's iterated integrals) of invariant
differential forms.
