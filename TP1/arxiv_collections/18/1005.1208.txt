We calculate nuclear suppression $R_{AA}$ of heavy quarks produced from the
initial fusion of partons in nucleus-nucleus collisions at RHIC and LHC
energies. We take the shadowing as well as the energy loss suffered by them
while passing through Quark Gluon Plasma into account. We obtain results for
charm and bottom quarks at several rapidities using different mechanisms for
energy loss, to see if we can distinguish between them.
