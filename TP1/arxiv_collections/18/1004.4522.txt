Non-symmetric rectangular correlation matrices occur in many problems in
economics. We test the method of extracting statistically meaningful
correlations between input and output variables of large dimensionality and
build a toy model for artificially included correlations in large random time
series.The results are then applied to analysis of polish macroeconomic data
and can be used as an alternative to classical cointegration approach.
