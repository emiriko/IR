The occurrence of a neutron resonance energy is a common feature of
unconventional superconductors. In turn, the low-temperature incommensurate
sharp peaks observed in the inelastic neutron scattering of
La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ (LSCO) correspond to four rods symmetrically
distributed around $[\pi,\pi]$. Here it is shown that within the
virtual-electron pair quantum liquid recently introduced the neutron resonance
energy and the LSCO low-temperature incommensurate sharp peaks are generated by
simple and closely related spinon processes. Our results indicate that in LSCO
the neutron resonance energy either does not occur or corresponds to a lower
energy $\approx 17$ meV.
