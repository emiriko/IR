A narrow peak in the pi+ pi- mass distribution was seen by the Rome-Syracuse
Collaboration in pbar n --> 2 pi+ 3 pi- annihilation at rest in 1970. It was
ignored for 40 years. The reanalysis of this peak finds that it has the mass
757.4 +- 2.8_stat +- 1.1_sys MeV/c**2 and a width consistent with the
experimental resolution. The evidence of the peak is 5.2 standard deviations.
The peak is generated in (1.03 +- 0.21_stat +- 0.21_sys)% of the pbar n
annihilations at rest. No spin analysis is possible with the statistics of the
experiment but there are arguments suggesting that it has JP = 0+.
