The high-precision interferometric measurement of an unknown phase is the
basis for metrology in many areas of science and technology. Quantum
entanglement provides an increase in sensitivity, but present techniques have
only surpassed the limits of classical interferometry for the measurement of
small variations about a known phase. Here we introduce a technique that
combines entangled states with an adaptive algorithm to precisely estimate a
completely unspecified phase, obtaining more information per photon that is
possible classically. We use the technique to make the first ab initio
entanglement-enhanced optical phase measurement. This approach will enable
rapid, precise determination of unknown phase shifts using interferometry.
