We study the conditions for the consistency of the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker
(FRW) metric with the dynamical Chern-Simons modified gravity. It turns out to
be that in this situation the accelerated expansion of the Universe takes
place, with the time dependence of the scale factor turns out to be similar to
the case of presence of the Chaplygin gas. Also we found that this modification
changes the total density of the Universe and therefore gives a nontrivial
impact to a cosmological scenario.
