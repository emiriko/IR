We use numerical simulations to show how a fully flexible filament binding to
a deformable cylindrical surface may acquire a macroscopic persistence length
and a helical conformation. This is a result of the nontrivial elastic response
to deformations of elastic sheets. We find that the filament's helical pitch is
completely determined by the mechanical properties of the surface, and can be
tuned by varying the filament binding energy. We propose simple scaling
arguments to understand the physical mechanism behind this phenomenon and
present a phase diagram indicating under what conditions one should expect a
fully flexible chain to behave as a helical semi-flexible filament. Finally, we
discuss the implications of our results.
