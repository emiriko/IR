We investigate the secure communications over correlated wiretap Rayleigh
fading channels assuming the full channel state information (CSI) available.
Based on the information theoretic formulation, we derive closed-form
expressions for the average secrecy capacity and the outage probability.
Simulation results confirm our analytical expressions.
