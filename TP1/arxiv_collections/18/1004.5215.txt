The study of immune system aging, i.e. immunosenescence, is a relatively new
research topic. It deals with understanding the processes of immunodegradation
that indicate signs of functionality loss possibly leading to death. Even
though it is not possible to prevent immunosenescence, there is great benefit
in comprehending its causes, which may help to reverse some of the damage done
and thus improve life expectancy. One of the main factors influencing the
process of immunosenescence is the number and phenotypical variety of naive T
cells in an individual. This work presents a review of immunosenescence,
proposes system dynamics modelling of the processes involving the maintenance
of the naive T cell repertoire and presents some preliminary results.
