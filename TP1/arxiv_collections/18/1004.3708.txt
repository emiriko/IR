Inter-subject parcellation of functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)
data based on a standard General Linear Model (GLM)and spectral clustering was
recently proposed as a means to alleviate the issues associated with spatial
normalization in fMRI. However, for all its appeal, a GLM-based parcellation
approach introduces its own biases, in the form of a priori knowledge about the
shape of Hemodynamic Response Function (HRF) and task-related signal changes,
or about the subject behaviour during the task. In this paper, we introduce a
data-driven version of the spectral clustering parcellation, based on
Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and Partial Least Squares (PLS) instead of
the GLM. First, a number of independent components are automatically selected.
Seed voxels are then obtained from the associated ICA maps and we compute the
PLS latent variables between the fMRI signal of the seed voxels (which covers
regional variations of the HRF) and the principal components of the signal
across all voxels. Finally, we parcellate all subjects data with a spectral
clustering of the PLS latent variables. We present results of the application
of the proposed method on both single-subject and multi-subject fMRI datasets.
Preliminary experimental results, evaluated with intra-parcel variance of GLM
t-values and PLS derived t-values, indicate that this data-driven approach
offers improvement in terms of parcellation accuracy over GLM based techniques.
