Functionals of Brownian motion have diverse applications in physics,
mathematics, and other fields. The probability density function (PDF) of
Brownian functionals satisfies the Feynman-Kac formula, which is a Schrodinger
equation in imaginary time. In recent years there is a growing interest in
particular functionals of non-Brownian motion, or anomalous diffusion, but no
equation existed for their PDF. Here, we derive a fractional generalization of
the Feynman-Kac equation for functionals of anomalous paths based on
sub-diffusive continuous-time random walk. We also derive a backward equation
and a generalization to Levy flights. Solutions are presented for a wide number
of applications including the occupation time in half space and in an interval,
the first passage time, the maximal displacement, and the hitting probability.
We briefly discuss other fractional Schrodinger equations that recently
appeared in the literature.
