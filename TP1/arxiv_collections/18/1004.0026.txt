The creation and manipulation of multipartite entangled states is important
for advancements in quantum computation and communication, and for testing our
fundamental understanding of quantum mechanics and precision measurements.
Multipartite entanglement has been achieved by use of various forms of quantum
bits (qubits), such as trapped ions, photons, and atoms passing through
microwave cavities. Quantum systems based on superconducting circuits have been
used to control pair-wise interactions of qubits, either directly, through a
quantum bus, or via controllable coupling. Here, we describe the first
demonstration of coherent interactions of three directly coupled
superconducting quantum systems, two phase qubits and a resonant cavity. We
introduce a simple Bloch-sphere-like representation to help one visualize the
unitary evolution of this tripartite system as it shares a single microwave
photon. With careful control and timing of the initial conditions, this leads
to a protocol for creating a rich variety of entangled states. Experimentally,
we provide evidence for the deterministic evolution from a simple product
state, through a tripartite W-state, into a bipartite Bell-state. These
experiments are another step towards deterministically generating multipartite
entanglement in superconducting systems with more than two qubits.
