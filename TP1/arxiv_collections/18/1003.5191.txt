We present a theory of the critical interlayer tunneling current in a
disordered quantum Hall bilayer at total filling factor one, allowing for the
effect of static vortices. In agreement with recent experiments [Phys. Rev. B
80, 165120 (2009); ibid. 78, 075302 (2008)], we find that this critical current
is proportional to the area of the sample and is comparable in magnitude to
observed values. This reflects the formation of a Bean critical state as a
result of current injection at the boundary. We predict a crossover to a
critical current proportional to the square-root of area as either sample size
or electron density decreases. We also predict a peak in the critical current
as the electron density varies at fixed layer separation.
