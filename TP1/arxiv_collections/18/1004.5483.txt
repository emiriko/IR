Glass states of superfluid A-like phase of 3He in aerogel induced by random
orientations of aerogel strands are investigated theoretically and
experimentally. In anisotropic aerogel with stretching deformation two glass
phases are observed. Both phases represent the anisotropic glass of the orbital
ferromagnetic vector l -- the orbital glass (OG). The phases differ by the spin
structure: the spin nematic vector d can be either in the ordered spin nematic
(SN) state or in the disordered spin-glass (SG) state. The first phase (OG-SN)
is formed under conventional cooling from normal 3He. The second phase (OG-SG)
is metastable, being obtained by cooling through the superfluid transition
temperature, when large enough resonant continuous radio-frequency excitation
are applied. NMR signature of different phases allows us to measure the
parameter of the global anisotropy of the orbital glass induced by deformation.
