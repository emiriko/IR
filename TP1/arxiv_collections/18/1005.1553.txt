High-Impedance Surfaces (HIS) comprising lossy Frequency Selective Surfaces
(FSS) are employed to design thin electromagnetic absorbers. The structure,
despite its typical resonant behavior, is able to perform a very wideband
absorption in a reduced thickness. Losses in the frequency selective surface
are introduced by printing the periodic pattern through resistive inks and
hence avoiding the typical soldering of a large number of lumped resistors. The
effect of the surface resistance of the FSS and dielectric substrate
characteristics on the input impedance of the absorber is discussed by means of
a circuital model. It is shown that the optimum value of surface resistance is
affected both by substrate parameters (thickness and permittivity) and by FSS
element shape. The equivalent circuit model is then used to introduce the
working principles of the narrowband and the wideband absorbing structure and
to derive the best-suited element for wideband absorption. Finally, the
experimental validation of the presented structures is presented.
