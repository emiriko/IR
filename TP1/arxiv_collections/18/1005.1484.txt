We study the dispersive properties of the linear vibrating plate (LVP)
equation. Splitting it into two Schr\"odinger-type equations we show its close
relation with the Schr\"odinger equation. Then, the homogeneous Sobolev spaces
appear to be the natural setting to show Strichartz-type estimates for the LVP
equation. By showing a Kato-Ponce inequality for homogeneous Sobolev spaces we
prove the well-posedness of the Cauchy problem for the LVP equation with
time-dependent potentials. Finally, we exhibit the sharpness of our results.
This is achieved by finding a suitable solution for the stationary homogeneous
vibrating plate equation.
