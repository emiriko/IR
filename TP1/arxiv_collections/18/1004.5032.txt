Let F be a locally compact nonarchimedean local field. In this article, we
extend to any inner form of GL(n) over F the notion of endo-class introduced by
Bushnell and Henniart for GL(n,F). We investigate the intertwining relations of
simple characters of these groups, in particular their preservation properties
under transfer. This allows us to associate to any discrete series
representation of an inner form of GL(n,F) an endo-class over F. We conjecture
that this endo-class is invariant under the local Jacquet-Langlands
correspondence.
