Random multifractals occur in particular at critical points of disordered
systems. For Anderson localization transitions, Mirlin and Evers [PRB 62,7920
(2000)] have proposed the following scenario (a) the Inverse Participation
Ratios (I.P.R.) $Y_q(L)$ display the following fluctuations between the
disordered samples of linear size $L$ : with respect to the typical value
$Y^{typ}_q(L) = e^{\bar{\ln Y_q(L)}} \sim L^{- \tau_{typ}(q)} $ that involve
the typical multifractal spectrum $\tau_{typ}(q)$, the rescaled variable
$y=Y_q(L)/Y^{typ}_q(L) $ is distributed with a scale-invariant distribution
presenting the power-law tail $1/y^{1+\beta_q}$, so that the disorder-averaged
I.P.R. $\bar{Y_q(L)} \sim L^{- \tau_{av}(q)} $ have multifractal exponents
$\tau_{av}(q) $ that differ from the typical ones $\tau_{typ}(q)$ whenever
$\beta_q<1$; (b) the tail exponents $\beta_q$ and the multifractal exponents
are related by the relation $\beta_q \tau_{typ}(q)=\tau_{av}(q \beta_q)$. Here
we show that this scenario can be understood by considering the real-space
renormalization equations satisfied by the I.P.R. For the simplest
multifractals described by random cascades, these renormalization equations are
formally similar to the recursion relations for disordered models defined on
Cayley trees and they admit travelling-wave solutions for the variable $(\ln
Y_q)$ in the effective time $t_{eff}=\ln L$ : the exponent $\tau_{typ}(q)$
represents the velocity, whereas the tail exponent $\beta_q$ represents the
usual exponential decay of the travelling-wave tail. In addition, we obtain
that the relation (b) above can be obtained as a self-consistency condition
from the self-similarity of the multifractal spectrum at all scales. Our
conclusion is thus that the Mirlin-Evers scenario should apply to other types
of random critical points, and even to random multifractals occurring in other
fields.
