Most of our knowledge of extrasolar planets rests on precise radial-velocity
measurements, either for direct detection or for confirmation of the planetary
origin of photometric transit signals. This has limited our exploration of the
parameter space of exoplanet hosts to solar- and later-type, sharp-lined stars.
Here we extend the realm of stars with known planetary companions to include
hot, fast-rotating stars. Planet-like transits have previously been reported in
the lightcurve obtained by the SuperWASP survey of the A5 star HD15082
(WASP-33; V=8.3, v sin i = 86 km/sec). Here we report further photometry and
time-series spectroscopy through three separate transits, which we use to
confirm the existence of a gas giant planet with an orbital period of 1.22d in
orbit around HD15082. From the photometry and the properties of the planet
signal travelling through the spectral line profiles during the transit we
directly derive the size of the planet, the inclination and obliquity of its
orbital plane, and its retrograde orbital motion relative to the spin of the
star. This kind of analysis opens the way to studying the formation of planets
around a whole new class of young, early-type stars, hence under different
physical conditions and generally in an earlier stage of formation than in
sharp-lined late-type stars. The reflex orbital motion of the star caused by
the transiting planet is small, yielding an upper mass limit of 4.1 Jupiter
masses on the planet. We also find evidence of a third body of sub-stellar mass
in the system, which may explain the unusual orbit of the transiting planet. In
HD 15082, the stellar line profiles also show evidence of non-radial
pulsations, clearly distinct from the planetary transit signal. This raises the
intriguing possibility that tides raised by the close-in planet may excite or
amplify the pulsations in such stars.
