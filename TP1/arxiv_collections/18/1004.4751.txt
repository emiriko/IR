We report the growth of potassium-doped BaFe2As2 thin films, where the major
charge carriers are holes, on Al2O3 (0001) and LaAlO3 (001) substrates by using
an ex-situ pulsed laser deposition technique. The measured Tc's are 40 and 39 K
for the films grown on Al2O3 and LaAlO3, respectively and diamagnetism
indicates that the films have good bulk superconducting properties below 36 and
30 K, respectively. The X-ray diffraction patterns for both films indicated a
preferred c-axis orientation, regardless of the substrate structures of LaAlO3
and Al2O3. The upper critical field at zero temperature was estimated to be
about 155 T.
