Nowadays, the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) is a promising research field.
Many ongoing works related to the security and the performances of its
employment are presented to the research community. Although, the security and
data privacy aspects are very important in the IMS global objectives, they
observe little attention so far. Secure access to multimedia services is based
on SIP and HTTP digest on top of IMS architecture. The standard deploys AKA-MD5
for the terminal authentication. The third Generation Partnership Project
(3GPP) provided Generic Bootstrapping Architecture (GBA) to authenticate the
subscriber before accessing multimedia services over HTTP. In this paper, we
propose a new IMS Service Authentication scheme using Identity Based
cryptography (IBC). This new scheme will lead to better performances when there
are simultaneous authentication requests using Identity-based Batch
Verification. We analyzed the security of our new protocol and we presented a
performance evaluation of its cryptographic operations
