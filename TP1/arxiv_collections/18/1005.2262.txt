S and P wave $D\bar{D}$ scatterings are studied in a meson exchange model
with the coupling constants obtained in the heavy quark effective theory. With
the extracted P wave phase shifts and the separable potential approximation, we
include the $D\bar{D}$ rescattering effect and investigate the production
process $e^+e^-\to D\bar{D}$. We find that it is difficult to explain the
anomalous line shape observed by the BES collaboration with this mechanism.
Combining our model calculation and the experimental measurement, we estimate
the upper limit of the nearly universal cutoff parameter to be 1.7 GeV. With
this number, the upper limits of the binding energies of the S wave $D\bar{D}$
and $B\bar{B}$ bound states are obtained. Assuming that the S wave and P wave
interactions rely on the same cutoff, our study provides a way of extracting
the information about S wave molecular bound states from the P wave meson pair
production.
