We examine the thermodynamical properties of a number of asymptotically flat,
stationary (but not static) solutions having conical singularities, with both
connected and non-connected event horizons, using the thermodynamical
description recently proposed in arXiv:0912.3386 [gr-qc]. The examples
considered are the double-Kerr solution, the black ring rotating in either S^2
or S^1 and the black Saturn, where the balance condition is not imposed for the
latter two solutions. We show that not only the Bekenstein-Hawking area law is
recovered from the thermodynamical description but also the thermodynamical
angular momentum is the ADM angular momentum. We also analyse the
thermodynamical stability and show that, for all these solutions, either the
isothermal moment of inertia or the specific heat at constant angular momentum
is negative, at any point in parameter space. Therefore, all these solutions
are thermodynamically unstable in the grand canonical ensemble.
