Here we consider micron-sized samples with any axisymmetric body shape and
made with a canted antiferromagnet, like hematite or iron borate. We find that
its ground state can be a magnetic vortex with a topologically non-trivial
distribution of the sublattice magnetization $\vec{l}$ and planar coreless
vortex-like structure for the net magnetization $\vec{M}$. For
antiferromagnetic samples in the vortex state, in addition to low-frequency
modes, we find high-frequency modes with frequencies over the range of hundreds
of gigahertz, including a mode localized in a region of radius $\sim$ 30--40 nm
near the vortex core.
