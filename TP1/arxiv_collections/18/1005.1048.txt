The disc around the Herbig Ae/Be star HD 100546 is one of the most
extensively studied discs in the southern sky. Although there is a wealth of
information about its dust content and composition, not much is known about its
gas and large scale kinematics. We detect and study the molecular gas in the
disc at spatial resolution from 7.7" to 18.9" using the APEX telescope. The
lines 12CO J=7-6, J=6-5, J=3-2, 13CO J=3-2 and [C I] 3P2-3P1 are observed,
diagnostic of disc temperature, size, chemistry, and kinematics. We use
parametric disc models that reproduce the low-J 12CO emission from Herbig~Ae
stars and vary the basic disc parameters - temperature, mass and size. Using
the molecular excitation and radiative transfer code RATRAN we fit the observed
spectral line profiles. Our observations are consistent with more than 0.001
Msun of molecular gas in a disc of approximately 400 AU radius in Keplerian
rotation around a 2.5 Msun star, seen at an inclination of 50 degrees. The
detected 12CO lines are dominated by gas at 30-70~K. The non-detection of the
[C I] line indicates excess ultraviolet emission above that of a B9 type model
stellar atmosphere. Asymmetry in the 12CO line emission suggests that one side
of the outer disc is colder by 10-20~K than the other, possibly due to a shadow
by a warped geometry of the inner disc. Pointing offsets, foreground cloud
absorption and asymmetry in the disc extent are excluded scenarios. Efficient
heating of the outer disc ensures that low- and high-J 12CO lines are dominated
by the outermost disc regions, indicating a 400 AU radius. The 12CO J=6--5 line
arises from a disc layer higher above disc midplane, and warmer by 15-20~K than
the layer emitting the J=3--2 line. The existing models of discs around Herbig
Ae stars, assuming a B9.5 type model stellar atmosphere overproduce the [CI]
3P2--3P1 line intensity from HD 100546 by an order of magnitude.
