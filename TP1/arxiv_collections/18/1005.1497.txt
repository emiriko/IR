An exact, one-to-one transform is presented that not only allows digital
circular convolutions, but is free from multiplications and quantisation errors
for transform lengths of arbitrary powers of two. The transform is analogous to
the Discrete Fourier Transform, with the canonical harmonics replaced by a set
of cyclic integers computed using only bit-shifts and additions modulo a prime
number. The prime number may be selected to occupy contemporary word sizes or
to be very large for cryptographic or data hiding applications. The transform
is an extension of the Rader Transforms via Carmichael's Theorem. These
properties allow for exact convolutions that are impervious to numerical
overflow and to utilise Fast Fourier Transform algorithms.
