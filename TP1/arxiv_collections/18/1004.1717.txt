The validity of Einstein's fluctuation-dissipation relation is discussed in
respect to the type of relaxation in an isothermal system. The first model,
presuming isothermic fluctuations, leads to the Einstein formula. The second
model supposes adiabatic fluctuations and yields another relation between the
diffusion coefficient and mobility of a Brownian particle. A new approach to
relaxations in quantum systems is also proposed that demonstrates applicability
only of the adiabatic model for description of the quantum Brownian dynamics.
