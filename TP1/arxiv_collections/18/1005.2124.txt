Chiral SU(3) Perturbation Theory (SU3XPT) identifies hadrons as the building
blocks of strongly interacting matter at low densities and temperatures. We
show that it admits two co-existing chiral nucleon liquid phases at zero
external pressure with well-defined surfaces: 1) ordinary microscopic chiral
heavy nuclear liquid drops (XNL) and 2) a new Strange Chiral Nucleon Liquid
(SXNL) phase with both microscopic and macroscopic drop sizes. Liquid drops of
both XNL and SXNL are simultaneously solutions to the SU3XPT semi-classical
equations of motion and obey all relevant CVC and PCAC equations. Axial-vector
currents are conserved inside macroscopic drops of SXNL, a new form of baryonic
matter with zero electric charge density, which is by nature "dark". The
numerical values of all SU3XPT coefficients are used to fit current scattering
experiments and ordinary XNL drops (identified with the ground state of
ordinary even-even spin-zero spherical closed-shell nuclei). SXNL then also
emerges (i.e. without new adjustable parameters). For certain SU3XPT
coefficients, finite microscopic and macroscopic drops of SXNL may be the
ground state of a collection of nucleons: ordinary heavy nuclei may be
meta-stable, while oceans of SXNL may force qualitative and experimentally
observable changes to the neutron star equation of state.
