The Pulsar Search Collaboratory [PSC, NSF #0737641] is a joint project
between the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) and West Virginia
University (WVU) designed to interest high school students in science,
technology, engineering, and mathematics [STEM] related career paths by helping
them to conduct authentic scientific research. The 3- year PSC program, which
began in summer 2008, teaches students to analyze astronomical radio data
acquired with the 100-m Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope for the purpose of
discovering new pulsars. We present the results of the first complete year of
the PSC, which includes two astronomical discoveries.
