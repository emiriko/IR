We show that in a neutral magnetized plasma there exist microscopic
oscillatory modes, with wavelengths of the order of magnitude of the mean
interparticle distance, which become unstable when the electron density exceeds
a limit proportional to the square of the magnetic field. The model we consider
is just a linearization of the classical one for neutral plasmas, namely a
system of electrons subjected to Coulomb interactions among themselves and with
a uniform positive neutralizing background. This model is here dealt with as an
actual many-body problem, without introducing any averaging over the individual
particles. The expression of the density limit coincides, apart possibly from a
numerical factor of order one, with the well-known Brillouin density limit for
a nonneutral plasma, which has however a macroscopic origin. The density limit
here found has the same order of magnitude as the operational density limit
observed in several conventional tokamak devices. We finally show that, when
the full electromagnetic interactions are taken into account, dispersion
relations are obtained which for short wavelengths reduce to those obtained
here in the purely Coulomb case, and for long wavelengths reproduce the
familiar ones of MHD.
