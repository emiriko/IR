We consider the steady state of a one dimensional diffusive system, such as
the symmetric simple exclusion process (SSEP) on a ring, driven by a battery at
the origin or by a smoothly varying field along the ring. The battery appears
as the limiting case of a smoothly varying field, when the field becomes a
delta function at the origin. We find that in the scaling limit, the long range
pair correlation functions of the system driven by a battery turn out to be
very different from the ones known in the steady state of the SSEP maintained
out of equilibrium by contact with two reservoirs, even when the steady state
density profiles are identical in both models.
