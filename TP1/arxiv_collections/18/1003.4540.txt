This work investigates the possibility of a long-lived stop squark in
supersymmetric models with the neutralino as the lightest supersymmetric
particle (LSP). We study the implications of meta-stable stops on the sparticle
mass spectra and the dark matter density. We find that in order to obtain a
sufficiently long stop lifetime so as to be observable as a stable R-hadron at
an LHC experiment, we need to fine tune the mass degeneracy between the stop
and the LSP considerably. This increases the stop-neutralino coanihilation
cross section, leaving the neutralino relic density lower than what is expected
from the WMAP results for stop masses ~1.5 TeV/c^2. However, if such scenarios
are realised in nature we demonstrate that the long-lived stops will be
produced at the LHC and that stop-based R-hadrons with masses up to 1 TeV/c^2
can be detected after one year of running at design luminosity.
