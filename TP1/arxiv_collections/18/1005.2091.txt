We present Herschel SPIRE and PACS photometeric observations of the low
metallicity (Z ~ 0.35 solar) nearby dwarf galaxy, NGC 1705, in six wavelength
bands as part of the Dwarf Galaxy Survey guaranteed time Herschel Key Program.
We confirm the presence of two dominant circumnuclear IR-bright regions
surrounding the central super star cluster that had been previously noted at
mid-IR wavelengths and in the sub-mm by LABOCA. On constructing a global
spectral energy distribution using the SPIRE and PACS photometry, in
conjunction with archival IR measurements, we note the presence of an excess at
sub-mm wavelengths. This excess suggests the presence of a significant cold
dust component within NGC 1705 and was modeled as an additional cold component
in the SED. Although alternative explanations for the sub-mm excess beyond 350
microns, such as changes to the dust emissivity cannot be ruled out, the most
likely explanation for the observed submillimetre excess is that of an
additional cold dust component.
