Although the sneutrino is a viable NLSP candidate with gravitino LSP, spectra
of this type occupy a part of SUSY parameter space in which collider signatures
are poorly studied. In this paper we will extend previous work on this topic to
include sneutrino NLSP spectra with non-minimal phenomenology. Generally, these
spectra exhibit very leptophilic behavior, which can be easily observed at the
LHC. We show that a variety of such spectra can be analysed with similar
techniques, leading in each case to very suggestive evidence for complicated
decay chains that end in sneutrinos. Amongst the variations considered, we find
a simple class of spectra that produce signals with strong electron-muon
asymmetries. These signals could naively be interpreted as evidence for lepton
flavor violation, but can occur even with flavor-blind SUSY.
