This paper investigates the effectiveness of creative versus uncreative
leadership using EVOC, an agent-based model of cultural evolution. Each
iteration, each agent in the artificial society invents a new action, or
imitates a neighbor's action. Only the leader's actions can be imitated by all
other agents, referred to as followers. Two measures of creativity were used:
(1) invention-to-imitation ratio, iLeader, which measures how often an agent
invents, and (2) rate of conceptual change, cLeader, which measures how
creative an invention is. High iLeader increased mean fitness of ideas, but
only when creativity of followers was low. High iLeader was associated with
greater diversity of ideas in the early stage of idea generation only. High
cLeader increased mean fitness of ideas in the early stage of idea generation;
in the later stage it decreased idea fitness. Reasons for these findings and
tentative implications for creative leadership in human society are discussed.
