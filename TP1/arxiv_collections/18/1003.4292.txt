We present measurements, using two complementary methods, of the breakdown of
atomic angular momentum selection rules in He-broadened Rb vapor. Atomic dark
states are rendered weakly absorbing due to fine-structure mixing during Rb-He
collisions. The effect substantially increases the photon demand for optical
pumping of dense vapors.
