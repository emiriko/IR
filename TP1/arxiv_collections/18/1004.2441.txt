Using high-resolution resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS), we
performed a momentum-resolved study of magnetic excitations in the model
spin-1/2 2D antiferromagnetic insulator Sr_2CuCl_2O_2. We identify both a
single-spin-wave feature and a multi-magnon continuum, and show that the X-ray
polarization can be used to distinguish these two contributions in the
cross-section. The spin-waves display a large (70 meV) dispersion between the
zone-boundary points ($\pi$,0) and ($\pi$/2,$\pi$/2). Employing an extended
$t$-$t'$-$t"$-$U$ one-band Hubbard model, we find significant electronic
hopping beyond nearest-neighbor Cu ions. We conclude that sizeable extended
magnetic interactions are present in \scoc{} and probably important in all
undoped cuprates.
