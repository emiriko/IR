We study the drag force on uniformly moving inclusions which interact
linearly with dynamical free field theories commonly used to study soft
condensed matter systems. Drag forces are shown to be nonlinear functions of
the inclusion velocity and depend strongly on the field dynamics. The general
results obtained can be used to explain drag forces in Ising systems and also
predict the existence of drag forces on proteins in membranes due to couplings
to various physical parameters of the membrane such as composition, phase and
height fluctuations.
