We present a model for the present accelerating Universe and focus on the
different important physical variables involved in the model under the
phenomenological assumption $\Lambda \propto H^2$ with a prescription for
equation of state parameter in the form
$\omega(t)=\omega_0+\frac{\omega_1\tau}{t^2}$, where $\omega_0$ and $\omega_1$
are two constants and $\tau$ is a parameter having dimension of time $t^2$.
General expressions for the density parameter $\Omega$ and deceleration
parameter $q$ are obtained which under specific bound reproduce some of the
previous results. We explore physical features of these parameters which (i)
provide the scenario of complete evolution of the cosmos with $\omega(t)$ and
(ii) agree mostly with the observational status of the present phase of the
accelerating Universe.
