The strong coupling constants of light pseudoscalar $\pi$, $K$ and $\eta$
mesons with decuplet--octet baryons are studied within light cone QCD sum
rules, where $SU(3)_f$ symmetry breaking effects are taken into account. It is
obtained that all coupling constants under the consideration are described by
only one universal function even if $SU(3)_f$ symmetry breaking effects are
switched into the game.
