We study the influence of the thickness Df of the plain ferromagnetic (F)
film on the electrical resistance of the flux-coupled hybrids, consisting of
superconducting (S) Al film and multilayer [Co/Pt] F film with out-of-plain
magnetization. The behavior of such hybrids at high and low temperatures is
found to be different: the nucleation of superconductivity at high temperatures
is governed mainly by the typical lateral dimensions of the magnetic domains,
while low temperature properties are determined by topology of the magnetic
template. We show that an increase in the Df value leads to a broadening of the
field- and temperature intervals where non-monotonous dependence of the
superconducting critical temperature Tc on the applied magnetic field H is
observed (for demagnetized F films). Further increase in the Df value results
in a global suppression of superconductivity. Thus, we determined an optimal
thickness, when the non-monotonous dependence Tc(H) can be observed in rather
broad T and H range, what can be interesting for further studies of the
localized superconductivity in planar Al-based S/F hybrids and for development
of the devices which can exploit the localized superconductivity.
