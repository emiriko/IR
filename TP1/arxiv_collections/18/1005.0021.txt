We report on the study of an intriguing active galaxy that was selected as a
potential multiple supermassive black hole merger in the early-type host SDSS
J151709.20+335324.7 (z=0.135). Ground-based SDSS imaging reveals two blue
structures on either side of the photometric center of the host galaxy,
separated from each other by about 5.7 kpc. The analysis of spatially resolved
emission line profiles from a Keck/HIRES spectrum reveal three distinct
kinematic subcomponents, one at rest and the other two moving at -350 km/s and
500 km/s with respect to the systemic velocity of the host galaxy. A comparison
of imaging and spectral data confirm a strong association between the kinematic
components and the spatial knots, which implies a highly disturbed and complex
active region in this object. Subsequent VLA radio imaging reveals a clear jet
aligned with the emission line gas, confirming that a jet-gas interaction is
the best explanation for emission line region. We use the broadband radio
measurements to examine the impact of the jet on the ISM of the host galaxy,
and find that the energy in the radio lobes can heat a significant fraction of
the gas to the virial temperature. Finally, we discuss tests that may help
future surveys distinguish between jet-driven kinematics and true black-hole
binaries. SDSS J151709.20+335324.7 is a remarkable laboratory for AGN feedback
and warrants deeper follow-up study. In the Appendix, we present
high-resolution radio imaging of a second AGN with double-peaked [O III] lines,
SDSS J112939.78+605742.6, which shows a sub-arcsecond radio jet. If the
double-peaked nature of the narrow lines in radio-loud AGN are generally due to
radio jet interactions, we suggest that extended radio structure should be
expected in most of such systems.
