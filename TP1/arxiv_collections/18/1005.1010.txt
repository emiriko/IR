We argue that the X(4260) enhancement contains a wealth of information on
vector c-cbar spectroscopy. We discuss the shape of the X(4260) observed in the
OZI-forbidden process "electron-positron into J/psi and a pair of charged
pions", in particular at and near vector charmonium resonances as well as
open-charm threshold enhancements. The resulting very broad X(4260) structure
does not seem to classify itself as a vector charmonium resonance, but its
detailed shape allows to identify new vector c-cbar states. Here, we estimate
the resonance parameters of the psi(3D) state.
