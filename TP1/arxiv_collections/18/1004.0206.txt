In this paper, we define k-equivalence, a relation on graphs that relies on
their associated cellular algebras. We show that a k-Boson quantum walk cannot
distinguish pairs of graphs that are k- equivalent. The existence of pairs of
k-equivalent graphs has been shown by Ponomarenko et al. [2, 6]. This gives a
negative answer to a question posed by Gamble et al. [7].
