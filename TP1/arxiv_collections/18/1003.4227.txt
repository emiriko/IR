A simultaneous description of non-strange nuclei, hypernuclei and
multiply-strange nuclear systems is provided by a single mass formula which is
shown to be useful for estimating binding energies of nuclear systems over a
wide mass range, including the light mass nuclei. It not only provides a good
fit to the existing experimental data on hyperon-separation energies but also
reproduces results of the relativistic mean field (RMF) calculations. In
addition, it can provide the Lambda($\Lambda$), Cascade-0($\Xi^0$) and
Cascade-minus ($\Xi^-$) drip lines. The existence of a range of bound
pure-hyperonic systems without any neutron and proton is suggested among which
$6\Lambda$, $9\Xi^0\Xi^0$, $10\Xi^-\Xi^-$, $1\Lambda7\Xi^0$, $1\Lambda 8\Xi^-$,
$1\Xi^09 \Xi^-$, $1\Xi^- 8\Xi^0$ and $2\Lambda+3\Xi^0+3\Xi^-$ represent the
lightest species. In agreement with the RMF predictions, this generalized mass
formula also predicts the nucleus $_{2\Xi^0 2\Lambda}{^8He}$ to be bound. An
exotic $_{2\Xi^0 2\Xi^- 2\Lambda}{^{10}n}$ nucleus is also found to be bound.
This new mass formula can be used in astrophysics for strange stellar objects,
as well as in high energy physics for estimating the strangeness production
yield in nucleus-nucleus or, nucleon-nucleon collisions.
