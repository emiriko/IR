Due to its high mass and short lifetime, the top quark plays an important
role in checking the Standard Model of particle physics. In this report, we pr\
esent a variety of searches for physics beyond the Standard Model, involving
top quarks, at the D0 detector at the Fermilab Tevatron collider. Specifically,
we present searches in top quark pair production, single top quark production
and top quark decays. The search spectra discussed here involve a search for
$t\bar{t}$ resonances, associated production of Higgs bosons and $t\bar{t}$,
charged Higgs bosons and heavy gauge $W^{'}$ bosons. Furthermore, we measure
the forward-backward charge asymmetry and a ratio of branching fractions.
