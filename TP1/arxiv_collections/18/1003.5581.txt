It is shown that the Hamiltonian for a quantum magnetic impurity on the
surface of a topological insulator can be mapped to the conventional pseudo-gap
Anderson impurity model, albeit with the combinations of continuum states which
hybridize with the impurity having more complex structure in the reciprocal and
spin space. If the Fermi level is away from the Dirac point, the impurity is
predicted to be fully screened at low enough temperatures, i.e., there are no
residual degrees of freedom.
