We assume that an individual invests in a financial market with one riskless
and one risky asset, with the latter's price following a diffusion with
stochastic volatility. In the current financial market especially, it is
important to include stochastic volatility in the risky asset's price process.
Given the rate of consumption, we find the optimal investment strategy for the
individual who wishes to minimize the probability of going bankrupt. To solve
this minimization problem, we use techniques from stochastic optimal control.
