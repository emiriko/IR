We seek to utilize the nonextensive statistics to the microscopic modeling of
the interacting many-investor dynamics that drive the price changes in a
market. The statistics of price changes are known to be fit well by the
Students-T and power-law distributions of the nonextensive statistics. We
therefore derive models of interacting investors that are based on the
nonextensive statistics and which describe the excess demand and formation of
price.
