The nonequilibrium dynamic phase transition, in the two dimensional site
diluted kinetic Ising model in presence of an oscillating magnetic field, has
been studied by Monte Carlo simulation. The projections of dynamical phase
surface are drawn in the planes formed by the dilution and field amplitude and
the plane formed by temperature and field amplitude. The tricritical behaviour
is found to be absent in this case which was observed in the pure system.
