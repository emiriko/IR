We theoretically investigate the non-radiative heat transfer between two
photonic crystals separated by a small gap in non-equilibrium thermal
situation. We predict that the surface Bloch states coupling supported by these
media can make heat exchanges larger than those measured at the same separation
distance between two massive homogeneous materials made with the elementary
components of photonic crystals. These results could find broad applications in
near-field technologies.
