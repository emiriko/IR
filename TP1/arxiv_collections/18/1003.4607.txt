We describe the first experimental realization of the Deutsch-Jozsa quantum
algorithm to evaluate the properties of a 2-bit boolean function in the
framework of one-way quantum computation. For this purpose a novel two-photon
six-qubit cluster state was engineered. Its peculiar topological structure is
the basis of the original measurement pattern allowing the algorithm
realization. The good agreement of the experimental results with the
theoretical predictions, obtained at $\sim$1kHz success rate, demonstrate the
correct implementation of the algorithm.
