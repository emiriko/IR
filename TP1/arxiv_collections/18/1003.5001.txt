We present the results of a deep spectral analysis of all Swift observations
of Mrk 421 between April 2006 and July 2006, when it reached its highest X-ray
flux recorded until the end of 2006. We completed this data set with other
historical X-ray observations. We used the full data set to investigate the
correlation between the spectral parameters. We found a signature of stochastic
acceleration in the anticorrelation between the peak energy (Ep) of the
spectral energy distribution (SED) and the spectral curvature parameter (b). We
found signature of energetic budget of the jet in the correlation between the
peak flux of the SED (S p) and Ep. Moreover, using simultaneous Swift
UVOT/XRT/BAT data, we demonstrated, that during the strongest flares, the
UV-to-X-ray emission from Mrk 421 requires that the curved electron
distribution develops a low energy power-law tail. The observed spectral
curvature and its anticorrelation with Ep is consistent with both stochastic
acceleration or energy-dependent acceleration probability mechanisms, whereas
the power-law slope of XRT-UVOT data is close to that inferred from the GRBs
X-ray afterglow and in agreement with the universal first-order relativistic
shock acceleration models. This scenario implies that magnetic turbulence may
play a twofold role: spatial diffusion relevant to the first order process and
momentum diffusion relevant to the second order process.
