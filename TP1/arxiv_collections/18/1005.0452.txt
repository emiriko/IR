Tangentially magnetized trigonal arrays of sub-micron Permalloy discs are
characterized with ferromagnetic resonance to determine the possible
contributions to frequency and linewidth from array disorder. Each array is
fabricated by a water-surface self-assembly lithographic technique, and
consists of a large trigonal array of 700 nm diameter magnetic discs. Each
array is characterized by a different degree of ordering. Two modes are present
in the ferromagnetic resonance spectra: a large amplitude, `fundamental' mode
and a lower amplitude mode at higher field. Angular dependence of the resonance
field in a very well ordered array is found to be negligible for both modes.
The relationship between resonance frequency and applied magnetic field is
found to be uncorrelated with array disorder. Linewidth is found to increase
with increasing array disorder.
