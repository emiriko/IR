We explore the self-organization dynamics of a set of entities by considering
the interactions that affect the different subgroups conforming the whole. To
this end, we employ the widespread example of coagulation kinetics, and
characterize which interaction types lead to consensus formation and which do
not, as well as the corresponding different macroscopic patterns. The crucial
technical point is extending the usual one species coagulation dynamics to the
two species one. This is achieved by means of introducing explicitly solvable
kernels which have a clear physical meaning. The corresponding solutions are
calculated in the long time limit, in which consensus may or may not be
reached. The lack of consensus is characterized by means of scaling limits of
the solutions. The possible applications of our results to some topics in which
consensus reaching is fundamental, like collective animal motion and opinion
spreading dynamics, are also outlined.
