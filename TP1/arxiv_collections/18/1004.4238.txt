This is an expansion of a talk for mathematics and physics students of the
Manchester Grammar and Manchester High Schools. It deals with numbers such as
the Riemann zeta value zeta(3)=sum_{n>0}1/n^3. Zeta values appear in the
description of sunshine and of relics from the Big Bang. They also result from
Feynman diagrams, which occur in the quantum field theory of fundamental
particles such as photons, electrons and positrons. My talk included 7
reasonably simple problems, for which I here add solutions, with further
details of their context.
