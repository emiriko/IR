We discuss the existence of stationary states for subharmonic potentials
$V(x) \propto |x|^c$, $c<2$, under action of symmetric $\alpha$-stable noises.
We show analytically that the necessary condition for the existence of the
steady state is $c>2-\alpha$. These states are characterized by heavy-tailed
probability density functions which decay as $P(x) \propto x^{-(c+\alpha -1)}$
for $|x| \to \infty$, i.e. stationary states posses a heavier tail than the
corresponding $\alpha$-stable law. Monte Carlo simulations confirm the
existence of such stationary states and the form of the tails of corresponding
probability densities.
