Mathematical notations around the world are diverse. Not as much as requiring
computing machines' makers to adapt to each culture, but as much as to
disorient a person landing on a web-page with a text in mathematics. In order
to understand better this diversity, we are building a census of notations: it
should allow any content creator or mathematician to grasp which mathematical
notation is used in which language and culture. The census is built
collaboratively, collected in pages with a given semantic and presenting
observations of the widespread notations being used in existing materials by a
graphical extract. We contend that our approach should dissipate the fallacies
found here and there about the notations in "other cultures" so that a better
understanding of the cultures can be realized. The exploitation of the census
in the math-bridge project is also presented: this project aims at taking
learners "where they are in their math-knowledge" and bring them to a level
ready to start engineering studies. The census serves as definitive reference
for the transformation elements that generate the rendering of formul{\ae} in
web-browsers.
