We study the dynamics of neutral cold atoms in an $L$-shaped crossed-beam
optical waveguide formed by two perpendicular red-detuned lasers of different
intensities and a blue-detuned laser at the corner. Complemented with a
vibrational cooling process this setting works as a one-way device or "atom
diode".
