The Derjaguin - Broekhoff - de Boer theory of capillary condensation is
employed to describe deformation of mesoporous solids in the course of
adsorption-desorption hysteretic cycles. We suggest a thermodynamic model,
which relates the mechanical stress induced by adsorbed phase to the adsorption
isotherm. Analytical expressions are derived for the dependence of the
solvation pressure on the vapor pressure. The proposed method provides a
description of non-monotonic hysteretic deformation during capillary
condensation without invoking any adjustable parameters. The method is
showcased drawing on the examples of literature experimental data on adsorption
deformation of porous glass and SBA-15 silica.
