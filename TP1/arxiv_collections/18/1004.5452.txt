We have attempted to extend the parameter space of the elements of the
texture 4 zero Hermitian quark mass matrices, to include the case of `weak
hierarchy' amongst them along with the usually considered `strong hierarchy'
case. This has been carried out by giving wide variation to the hierarchy
defining parameters D_U and D_D, having implications for the structural
features of the mass matrices. We find that not only the weakly hierarchical
mass matrices are able to reproduce the strongly hierarchical mixing angles but
also both the phases having their origin in the mass matrices have to be non
zero to achieve compatibility of these matrices with recent quark mixing data.
Further noting the difference between the exclusive and inclusive values of
V_ub, we have carried out separate analyses corresponding to these.
