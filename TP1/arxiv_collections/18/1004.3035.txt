A distinguishable and observable physical property of Naked Singular Regions
of the spacetime formed during a gravitational collapse has important
implications for both experimental and theoretical relativity. We examine here
whether energy can escape physically from naked singular regions to reach
either a local or a distant observer within the framework of general
relativity. We find that in case of imploding null dust collapse scenarios
field outgoing singular null geodesics including the cauchy horizon can be
immersed between two Vaidya spacetimes as null boundary layers with non
vanishing positive energy density. Thus energy can transported from the naked
singularity to either a local or a distant observer. And example illustrating
that similar considerations can be applied to dust models is given.
