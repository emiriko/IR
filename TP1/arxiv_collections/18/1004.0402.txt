It is well known that $\ell_1$ minimization can be used to recover
sufficiently sparse unknown signals from compressed linear measurements. In
fact, exact thresholds on the sparsity, as a function of the ratio between the
system dimensions, so that with high probability almost all sparse signals can
be recovered from iid Gaussian measurements, have been computed and are
referred to as "weak thresholds" \cite{D}. In this paper, we introduce a
reweighted $\ell_1$ recovery algorithm composed of two steps: a standard
$\ell_1$ minimization step to identify a set of entries where the signal is
likely to reside, and a weighted $\ell_1$ minimization step where entries
outside this set are penalized. For signals where the non-sparse component has
iid Gaussian entries, we prove a "strict" improvement in the weak recovery
threshold. Simulations suggest that the improvement can be quite
impressive-over 20% in the example we consider.
