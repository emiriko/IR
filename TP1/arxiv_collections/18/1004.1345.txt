The celebrated Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle \Delta x \Delta p\ge \hbar/2
can allow measurement accuracies less than \Delta x or \Delta p. Classical
analog of this is known as sub-Fourier sensitivity. We illustrate this
phenomenon in a step by step process using the example of compass state, as
suggested by Zurek.
