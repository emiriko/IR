We re-derive the equations of motion of dissipative relativistic fluid
dynamics from kinetic theory. In contrast to the derivation of Israel and
Stewart, which considered the second moment of the Boltzmann equation to obtain
equations of motion for the dissipative currents, we directly use the latter's
definition. Although the equations of motion obtained via the two approaches
are formally identical, the coefficients are different. We show that, for the
one-dimensional scaling expansion, our method is in better agreement with the
solution obtained from the Boltzmann equation.
