Both magnetic-resonance damping and the giant magnetoresistance effect have
been predicted to be strongly affected by the local density of states in thin
ferromagnetic films. We employ the antiferromagnetic coupling between Co and Gd
to provide a spontaneous change from parallel to antiparallel alignment of two
Co films. A sharp increase in magnetic damping accompanies the change from
parallel to antiparallel alignment, analogous to resistivity changes in giant
magnetoresistance.
