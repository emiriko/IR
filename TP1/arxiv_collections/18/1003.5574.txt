Data from the KTeV experiment have provided many opportunities for studies of
fundamental symmetries in nature, not just CP. We present new limits on the
lepton flavor violating decays K_L -> pi0 mu e, K_L -> pi0 pi0 mu e and pi0 ->
mu e. We also present measurements of K_L -> pi0 gamma gamma and K_L -> pi0 e+
e- gamma which are relevant to the determination of the various contributions
to K_L-> pi0 lepton anti-lepton. Finally, we present an analysis of the decay
pi0 -> e+e-e+e-.
