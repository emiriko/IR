We study the asymptotic properties of distributed consensus algorithms over
switching directed random networks. More specifically, we focus on consensus
algorithms over independent and identically distributed, directed random
graphs, where each agent can communicate with any other agent with some
exogenously specified probability. While different aspects of consensus
algorithms over random switching networks have been widely studied, a complete
characterization of the distribution of the asymptotic value for general
\textit{asymmetric} random consensus algorithms remains an open problem. In
this paper, we derive closed-form expressions for the mean and an upper bound
for the variance of the asymptotic consensus value, when the underlying network
evolves according to an i.i.d. \textit{directed} random graph process. We also
provide numerical simulations that illustrate our results.
