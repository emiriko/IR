This paper describes an algorithm for selecting parameter values (e.g.
temperature values) at which to measure equilibrium properties with Parallel
Tempering Monte Carlo simulation. Simple approaches to choosing parameter
values can lead to poor equilibration of the simulation, especially for Ising
spin systems that undergo $1^st$-order phase transitions. However, starting
from an initial set of parameter values, the careful, iterative respacing of
these values based on results with the previous set of values greatly improves
equilibration. Example spin systems presented here appear in the context of
Quantum Monte Carlo.
