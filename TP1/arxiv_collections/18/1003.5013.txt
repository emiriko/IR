We apply ring-diagram analysis and spherical harmonic decomposition methods
to compute 3-dimensional power spectra of magnetograms obtained by the Global
Oscillation Network Group (GONG) during quiet periods of solar activity. This
allows us to investigate the power distribution in acoustic waves propagating
in localized directions on the solar disk. We find evidence of the presence of
five-minute oscillations in magnetic signals that suggests a non-homogeneous
distribution of acoustic power. In this paper, we present our results on the
asymmetry in oscillatory power and its behaviour as a function of frequency,
time and magnetic field strength. These characteristics are compared with
simultaneous velocity measurements.
