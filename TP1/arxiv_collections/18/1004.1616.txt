Temperature-dependent Raman spectra of TbMnO$_3$ from 5 K to 300 K in the
spectral range of 200 to 1525 cm$^{-1}$ show five first-order Raman allowed
modes and two high frequency modes. The intensity ratio of the high frequency
Raman band to the corresponding first order Raman mode is nearly constant and
high ($\sim$ 0.6) at all temperatures, suggesting a orbiton-phonon mixed nature
of the high frequency mode. One of the first order phonon modes shows anomalous
softening below T$_N$ ($\sim$ 46 K), suggesting a strong spin-phonon coupling.
