The nuclear breathing-mode giant monopole resonance is studied within an
improved relativistic Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck (BUU) transport approach. As
a new feature, the numerical treatment of ground state nuclei and their
phase-space evolution is realized with the same semiclassical energy density
functional. With this new method a very good stability of ground state nuclei
in BUU simulations is achieved. This is important in extracting clear
breathing-mode signals for the excitation energy and, in particular, for the
lifetime from transport theoretical studies including mean-field and
collisional effects.
