The main goal of our work is to formally prove the correctness of the key
commands of the SCHUR software, an interactive program for calculating with
characters of Lie groups and symmetric functions. The core of the computations
relies on enumeration and manipulation of combinatorial structures. As a first
"proof of concept", we present a formal proof of the conjugate function,
written in C. This function computes the conjugate of an integer partition. To
formally prove this program, we use the Frama-C software. It allows us to
annotate C functions and to generate proof obligations, which are proved using
several automated theorem provers. In this paper, we also draw on methodology,
discussing on how to formally prove this kind of program.
