Formulas for calculation of transverse dielectric function and transverse
electric conductivity in quantum collisional Maxwellian plasma are obtained.
The Wigner -- Vlasov -- Boltzmann kinetic equation with collision integral in
BGK (Bhatnagar, Gross and Krook) form in coordinate space is used. Various
special cases are in\-ves\-ti\-gated. Comparison with Lindhard's formula has
been carried out.
