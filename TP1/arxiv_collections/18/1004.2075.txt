In models with dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking, this breaking is
normally communicated to quarks and leptons by a set of vector bosons with
masses generated via sequential breaking of a larger gauge symmetry. In
reasonably ultraviolet-complete theories of this type, the number of stages of
breaking of the larger gauge symmetry is usually equal to the observed number
of quark and lepton generations, $N_{gen.}=3$. Here we investigate the general
question of how the construction and properties of these models depend on
$N_{gen.}$, regarded as a variable. We build and analyze models with
illustrative values of $N_{gen.}$ different from 3 (namely, $N_{gen.}=1,2,4$)
that exhibit the necessary sequential symmetry breaking down to a strongly
coupled sector that dynamically breaks electroweak symmetry. Our results for
variable $N_{gen.}$ show that one can robustly obtain, for this latter sector,
a theory with a gauge coupling that is large but slowly running, controlled by
an approximate infrared fixed point of the renormalization group. Owing to
this, we find that for all of the values of $N_{gen.}$ considered,
standard-model fermions of the highest generation have masses that can be
comparable to the electroweak-symmetry breaking scale. We also study the
interplay of multiple strongly coupled gauge symmetries in these models.
