We study the structural and thermodynamic properties of bilayer graphene, a
prototype two-layer membrane, by means of Monte Carlo simulations based on the
empirical bond order potential LCBOPII. We present the temperature dependence
of lattice parameter, bending rigidity and high temperature heat capacity as
well as the correlation function of out-of-plane atomic displacements. The
thermal expansion coefficient changes sign from negative to positive above
$\approx 400$ K, which is lower than previously found for single layer graphene
and close to the experimental value of bulk graphite. The bending rigidity is
twice as large than for single layer graphene, making the out-of-plane
fluctuations smaller. The crossover from correlated to uncorrelated
out-of-plane fluctuations of the two carbon planes occurs for wavevectors
shorter than $\approx 3$ nm$^{-1}$
