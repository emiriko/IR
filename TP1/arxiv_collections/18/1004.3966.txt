A message-passing algorithm for counting short cycles in a graph is
presented. For bipartite graphs, which are of particular interest in coding,
the algorithm is capable of counting cycles of length g, g +2,..., 2g - 2,
where g is the girth of the graph. For a general (non-bipartite) graph, cycles
of length g; g + 1, ..., 2g - 1 can be counted. The algorithm is based on
performing integer additions and subtractions in the nodes of the graph and
passing extrinsic messages to adjacent nodes. The complexity of the proposed
algorithm grows as $O(g|E|^2)$, where $|E|$ is the number of edges in the
graph. For sparse graphs, the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the
existing algorithms in terms of computational complexity and memory
requirements.
