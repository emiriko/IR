For q > 2, Carlitz proved that the group of permutation polynomials (PPs)
over F_q is generated by linear polynomials and x^{q-2}. Based on this result,
this note points out a simple method for representing all PPs with full cycle
over the prime field F_p, where p is an odd prime. We use the isomorphism
between the symmetric group S_p of p elements and the group of PPs over F_p,
and the well-known fact that permutations in S_p have the same cycle structure
if and only if they are conjugate.
