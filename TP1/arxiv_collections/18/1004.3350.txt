The bosonic single-impurity Anderson model (B-SIAM) is studied to understand
the local dynamics of an atomic quantum dot (AQD) coupled to a Bose-Einstein
condensation (BEC) state, which can be implemented to probe the entanglement
and the decoherence of a macroscopic condensate. Our recent approach of the
numerical renormalization group (NRG) calculation for the B-SIAM revealed a
zero-temperature phase diagram, where a Mott phase with local depletion of
normal particles is separated from a BEC phase with enhanced density of the
condensate. As an extension of the previous work, we present the calculations
of the local dynamical quantities of the B-SIAM which reinforce our
understanding of the physics in the Mott and the BEC phases.
