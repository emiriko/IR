The dynamics of a tracer particle in a glassy matrix of obstacles displays
slow complex transport as the free volume approaches a critical value and the
void space falls apart. We investigate the emerging subdiffusive motion of the
test particle by extensive molecular dynamics simulations and characterize the
spatio-temporal transport in terms of two-time correlation functions, including
the time-dependent diffusion coefficient as well as the wavenumber-dependent
intermediate scattering function. We rationalize our findings within the
framework of critical phenomena and compare our data to a dynamic scaling
theory.
