Given a discrete stochastic process, for example a chemical reaction system
or a birth and death process, we often want to find a continuous stochastic
approximation so that the techniques of stochastic differential equations may
be brought to bear. One powerful and useful way to do this is the system size
expansion of van Kampen to express a trajectory as a small stochastic
perturbation to a deterministic trajectory, using a small parameter related to
the volume of the system in question. This is usually pursued only up to first
order, called the Linear Noise Approximation. The usual derivation of this
proceeds via the master equation of the discrete process and derives a
Fokker-Planck equation for the stochastic perturbation, both of which are
equations for the evolution of probability distributions. Here we present a
derivation using stochastic difference equations for the discrete process and
leading, via the chemical Langevin equation of Gillespie, directly to a
stochastic differential equation for the stochastic perturbation. The new
derivation, which does not yield the full system size expansion, draws more
explicitly on the intuition of ordinary differential equations so may be more
easily digestible for some audiences.
