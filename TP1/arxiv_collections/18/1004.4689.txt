Recently it has been shown how the use of quantum entanglement can lead to
the creation of real-time communication channels whose viability can be made
location dependent. Such functionality leads to new security paradigms that are
not possible in classical communication networks. Key to these new security
paradigms are quantum protocols that can unconditionally determine that a
receiver is in fact at an a priori assigned location. A limiting factor of such
quantum protocols will be the decoherence of states held in quantum memory.
Here we investigate the performance of quantum location verification protocols
under decoherence effects. More specifically, we address the issue of how
decoherence impacts the verification using N = 2 qubits entangled as Bell
states, as compared to N > 2 qubits entangled as GHZ states. We study the
original quantum location verification protocol, as well as a variant protocol,
introduced here, which utilizes teleportation. We find that the performance of
quantum location verification is in fact similar for Bell states and some N > 2
GHZ states, even though quantum decoherence degrades larger-qubit entanglements
faster. Our results are important for the design and implementation of
location-dependent communications in emerging quantum networks.
