Magnetoelectric susceptibility of a metamaterial built from split ring
resonators have been investigated both experimentally and within an equivalent
circuit model. The absolute values have been shown to exceed by two orders of
magnitude that of classical magnetoelectric materials. The metamaterial
investigated reaches the theoretically predicted value of the magnetoelectric
susceptibility which is equal to the geometric average of the electric and
magnetic susceptibilities.
