We study continuous time Bertrand oligopolies in which a small number of
firms producing similar goods compete with one another by setting prices. We
first analyze a static version of this game in order to better understand the
strategies played in the dynamic setting. Within the static game, we
characterize the Nash equilibrium when there are $N$ players with heterogeneous
costs. In the dynamic game with uncertain market demand, firms of different
sizes have different lifetime capacities which deplete over time according to
the market demand for their good. We setup the nonzero-sum stochastic
differential game and its associated system of HJB partial differential
equations in the case of linear demand functions. We characterize certain
qualitative features of the game using an asymptotic approximation in the limit
of small competition. The equilibrium of the game is further studied using
numerical solutions. We find that consumers benefit the most when a market is
structured with many firms of the same relative size producing highly
substitutable goods. However, a large degree of substitutability does not
always lead to large drops in price, for example when two firms have a large
difference in their size.
