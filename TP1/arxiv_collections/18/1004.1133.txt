A simple version of exact finite dimensional reduction for the variational
setting of mechanical systems is presented. It is worked out by means of a
thorough global version of the implicit function theorem for monotone
operators. Moreover, the Hessian of the reduced function preserves all the
relevant information of the original one, by Schur's complement, which
spontaneously appears in this context. Finally, the results are
straightforwardly extended to the case of a Dirichlet problem on a bounded
domain.
