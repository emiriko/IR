We study effects of cosmic fluids on finite-time future singularities in
modified $f(R,G)$-gravity, where $R$ and $G$ are the Ricci scalar and the
Gauss-Bonnet invariant, respectively. We consider the fluid equation of state
in the general form, $\omega=\omega(\rho)$, and we suppose the existence of a
bulk viscosity. We investigate quintessence region ($\omega>-1$) and phantom
region ($\omega<-1$) and the possibility to change or avoid the singularities
in $f(R,G)$-gravity. Finally, we study the inclusion of quantum effects in
large curvatures regime.
