We propose a new code design that aims to distribute an LDPC code over a
relay channel. It is based on a split-and-extend approach, which allows the
relay to split the set of bits connected to some parity-check of the LDPC code
into two or several subsets. Subsequently, the sums of bits within each subset
are used in a repeat-accumulate manner in order to generate extra bits sent
from the relay toward the destination. We show that the proposed design yields
LDPC codes with enhanced correction capacity and can be advantageously applied
to existing codes, which allows for addressing cooperation issues for evolving
standards. Finally, we derive density evolution equations for the proposed
design, and we show that Split-Extended LDPC codes can approach very closely
the capacity of the Gaussian relay channel.
