General-purpose computing on graphics processing units (GPGPU) has recently
gained considerable attention in various domains such as bioinformatics,
databases and distributed computing. GPGPU is based on using the GPU as a
co-processor accelerator to offload computationally-intensive tasks from the
CPU. This study starts from the observation that a number of GPU features (such
as overlapping communication and computation, short lived buffer reuse, and
harnessing multi-GPU systems) can be abstracted and reused across different
GPGPU applications. This paper describes CrystalGPU, a modular framework that
transparently enables applications to exploit a number of GPU optimizations.
Our evaluation shows that CrystalGPU enables up to 16x speedup gains on
synthetic benchmarks, while introducing negligible latency overhead.
