The stability of atomic intercalated boron nitride K4 crystal structures, XBN
(X=H, Li, Be, B, C, N, O, F, Na, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, Cl, K, Ca, Ga, Ge, As, Se,
Br, Rb or Sr) is evaluated by the geometric optimization and frozen phonon
calculations based on the first principles calculations. NaBN, MgBN, GaBN, FBN
and ClBN are found to be stable. NaBN, GaBN, FBN and ClBN are metallic, whereas
MgBN is semiconducting.
