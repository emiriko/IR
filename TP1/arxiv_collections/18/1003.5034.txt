We suggest a possible explanation for the high frequency quasi-periodic
oscillations (QPOs) in black hole low mass X-ray binaries. By solving the
perturbation general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic equations, we find two
stable modes of the Alf\'ven wave in the the accretion disks with toroidal
magnetic fields. We suggest that these two modes may lead to the double high
frequency QPOs if they are produced in the transition region between the inner
advection dominated accretion flow and the outer thin disk. This model
naturally accounts for the 3 : 2 relation for the upper and lower frequencies
of the QPOs, and the relation between the black hole mass and QPO frequency.
