The eigen energy and the conductivity of a graphene sheet subject to a
one-dimensional cosinusoidal potential and in the presence of a magnetic field
are calculated. Such a graphene superlattice presents three distinct magnetic
miniband structures as the magnetic field increases. They are, respectively,
the triply degenerate Landau level spectrum, the nondegenerate minibands with
finite dispersion and the same Landau level spectrum with the pristine
graphene. The ratio of the magnetic length to the period of the potential
function is the characteristic quantity to determine the electronic structure
of the superlattice. Corresponding to these distinct electronic structures, the
diagonal conductivity presents very strong anisotropy in the weak and moderate
magnetic field cases. But the predominant magnetotransport orientation changes
from the transverse to the longitudinal direction of the superlattice. More
interestingly, in the weak magnetic field case, the superlattice exhibits
half-integer quantum Hall effect, but with large jump between the Hall
plateaux. Thus it is different from the one of the pristine graphene.
