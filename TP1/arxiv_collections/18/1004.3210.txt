We study the coherent quantum evolution of a closed and driven mesoscopic
chain of two-level systems that interact via the van-der-Waals interaction in
their excited state. The Hamiltonian consists of a part corresponding to a
classical lattice gas and an off-diagonal driving term without classical
counterpart. We show that in a certain parameter range the latter leads to a
thermalization of the system with respect to observables of the classical
lattice gas such as the interaction energy and particle number distribution. We
investigate the evolution of the system into this thermal state and discuss how
to determine the corresponding temperature. Our findings can be applied to
understand thermalization in strongly interacting systems of laser-driven
Rydberg atoms, ions or polar molecules.
