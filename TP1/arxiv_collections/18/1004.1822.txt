We begin with the premise that the law of entropy could prove to be
fundamental for the evolution of intelligent life and the advent of
technological civilization. Building on recent theoretical results, we combine
a modern approach to evolutionary theory with Monte Carlo Realization
Techniques. A numerical test for a proposed significance of the law of entropy
within the evolution of intelligent species is performed and results are
compared with a neutral test hypothesis. Some clarifying aspects on the
emergence of intelligent species arise and are discussed in the framework of
contemporary astrobiology.
