Photoproduction of pi0-eta on protons in the energy range from threshold to
1.4 GeV is discussed. The data for representative angular distributions
recently obtained at MAMI C are analyzed using an isobar model. The isobars
considered are Delta(1232) and S11(1535) for pi0-p and eta-p states,
respectively. In accordance with the results of earlier works the main features
of the reaction are explained through the dominance of the D33 wave with a
relatively small admixture of positive parity resonances. Comparison with
recent experimental results for the photon beam asymmetry is carried out.
