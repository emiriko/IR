We present a flavor model of quarks and leptons with the non-Abelian discrete
symmetry $S_4$ in the framework of the SU(5) SUSY GUT. Three generations of
$\bar 5$-plets in SU(5) are assigned to ${\bf 3}$ of $S_4$ while the first and
second generations of 10-plets in SU(5) are assigned to ${\bf 2}$ of $S_4$, and
the third generation of 10-plet is assigned to ${\bf 1}$ of $S_4$. Right-handed
neutrinos are also assigned to ${\bf 2}$ for the first and second generations
and ${\bf 1}'$ for the third generation. We predict the Cabibbo angle as well
as the tri-bimaximal mixing of neutrino flavors. We also predict the
non-vanishing $U_{e3}$ of the neutrino flavor mixing due to higher dimensional
mass operators. Our predicted CKM mixing angles and the CP violation are
consistent with experimental values. We also study SUSY breaking terms in the
slepton sector. Our model leads to smaller values of flavor changing neutral
currents than the present experimental bounds.
