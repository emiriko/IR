We compute correlators and spectral functions for J/psi and eta_c mesons at
nonzero momentum on anisotropic lattices with Nf=2. We find no evidence of
significant momentum dependence at the current level of precision. In the
pseudoscalar channel, the ground state appears to survive up to T~450MeV or
2.1T_c. In the vector channel, medium modifications may occur at lower
temperatures.
