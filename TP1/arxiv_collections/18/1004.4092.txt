We discuss electric transport through a point contact which bridges Majorana
fermion modes appearing at edges of two helical superconductors. The contents
focus on effects of interference and interaction unique to the Majorana
fermions and role of spin-orbit interaction (SOI). Besides the Josephson
current, the quasi-particle conductance depends sensitively on phase difference
and relative helicity between the two superconductors. The interaction among
the Majorana fermions causes the power-law temperature dependences of
conductance for various tunneling channels. Especially, in the presence of SOI,
the conductance always increases as the temperature is lowered.
