In the last years we have proposed the use of the mechanism of spontaneous
symmetry breaking with the purpose of generating perfect quadrature squeezing.
Here we review previous work dealing with spatial (translational and
rotational) symmetries, both on optical parametric oscillators and four-wave
mixing cavities, as well as present new results. We then extend the phenomenon
to the polarization state of the signal field, hence introducing spontaneous
polarization symmetry breaking. Finally we propose a Jaynes-Cummings model in
which the phenomenon can be investigated at the single-photon-pair level in a
non-dissipative case, with the purpose of understanding it from a most
fundamental point of view.
