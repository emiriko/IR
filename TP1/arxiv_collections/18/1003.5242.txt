It is shown that temperature acts to disrupt the magnetization of Peierls
distorted quasi-one-dimensional materials (Q1DM). The mean-field finite
temperature phase diagram for the field theory model employed is obtained by
considering both homogeneous and inhomogeneous condensates. The tricritical
points of the second order transition lines of the gap parameter and
magnetization are explicitly calculated. It is also shown that in the absence
of an external static magnetic field the magnetization is always zero, at any
temperature. As expected, temperature does not induce any magnetization effect
on Peierls distorted Q1DM.
