We study the response of a rotating monopole detector that is coupled to a
massless scalar field which is described by a non-linear dispersion relation in
flat spacetime. Since it does not seem to be possible to evaluate the response
of the rotating detector analytically, we resort to numerical computations.
Interestingly, unlike the case of the uniformly accelerated detector that has
been considered recently, we find that defining the transition probability rate
of the rotating detector poses no difficulties. Further, we show that the
response of the rotating detector can be computed {\it exactly}\vee (albeit,
numerically) even when it is coupled to a field that is governed by a
non-linear dispersion relation. We also discuss the response of the rotating
detector in the presence of a cylindrical boundary on which the scalar field is
constrained to vanish. While super-luminal dispersion relations hardly affect
the standard results, we find that sub-luminal dispersion relations can lead to
relatively large modifications.
