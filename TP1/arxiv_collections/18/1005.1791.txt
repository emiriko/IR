We present a new set of cooling models and isochrones for both H- and
He-atmosphere white dwarfs, incorporating accurate boundary conditions from
detailed model atmosphere calculations, and carbon-oxygen chemical abundance
profiles based on updated stellar evolution calculations from the BaSTI stellar
evolution archive - a theoretical data center for the Virtual Observatory. We
discuss and quantify the uncertainties in the cooling times predicted by the
models, arising from the treatment of mixing during the central H- and
He-burning phases, number of thermal pulses experienced by the progenitors,
progenitor metallicity and the $^{12}C(\alpha,\gamma)^{16}O$ reaction rate. The
largest sources of uncertainty turn out to be related to the treatment of
convection during the last stages of the progenitor central He-burning phase,
and the $^{12}C(\alpha,\gamma)^{16}O$ reaction rate. We compare our new models
to previous calculations performed with the same stellar evolution code, and
discuss their application to the estimate of the age of the solar neighborhood,
and the interpretation of the observed number ratios between H- and
He-atmosphere white dwarfs. The new white dwarf sequences and an extensive set
of white dwarf isochrones that cover a large range of ages and progenitor
metallicities are made publicly available at the official BaSTI website.
