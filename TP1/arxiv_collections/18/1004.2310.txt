The 4-alpha condensate state for ^{16}O is discussed with the THSR
(Tohsaki-Horiuchi-Schuck-Roepke) wave function which has alpha-particle
condensate character. Taking into account a proper treatment of resonances, it
is found that the 4-alpha THSR wave function yields a fourth 0^+ state in the
continuum above the 4-alpha-breakup threshold in addition to the three 0^+
states obtained in a previous analysis. It is shown that this fourth 0^+
((0_4^+)_{THSR}) state has an analogous structure to the Hoyle state, since it
has a very dilute density and a large component of alpha+^{12}C(0_2^+)
configuration. Furthermore, single-alpha motions are extracted from the
microscopic 16-nucleon wave function, and the condensate fraction and momentum
distribution of alpha particles are quantitatively discussed. It is found that
for the (0_4^+)_{THSR} state a large alpha-particle occupation probability
concentrates on a single-alpha 0S orbit and the alpha-particle momentum
distribution has a delta-function-like peak at zero momentum, both indicating
that the state has a strong 4-alpha condensate character. It is argued that the
(0_4^+)_{THSR} state is the counterpart of the 0_6^+ state which was obtained
as the 4-alpha condensate state in the previous 4-alpha OCM (Orthogonality
Condition Model) calculation, and therefore is likely to correspond to the
0_6^+ state observed at 15.1 MeV.
