Starting from the simplified analytic model of electronic spectrum of iron -
pnictogen (chalcogen) high - temperature superconductors close to the Fermi
level, we discuss the influence of antiferromagneting (AFM)scattering both for
stoichiometric case and the region of possible short - range order AFM
fluctuations in doped compounds. Qualitative picture of the evolution of
electronic spectrum and Fermi surfaces (FS) for different dopings is presented,
with the aim of comparison with existing and future ARPES experiments. Both
electron and hole dopings are considered and possible pseudogap behavior
connected with partial FS "destruction" is demonstrated, explaining some recent
experiments.
