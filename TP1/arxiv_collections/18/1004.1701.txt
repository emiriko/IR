Raan at all claims that the order of operations (first dividing then adding)
does not apply to citation analysis. In my contribution I discuss a few
analogues in Physics and Medicine and argue that in no other field of science
where quantities have physical or financial meaning, implying that that numbers
have a real unit of measure, it would be allowed to ignore the rule of
operations. Hence, the claim of CWTS that the order of operations is not
relevant brings studies ignoring this rule as done by CWTS in the category
'Pseudo Science'.
