A Cerium Fluoride crystal produced during early R&D studies for calorimetry
at the CERN Large Hadron Collider was exposed to a 24 GeV/c proton fluence
Phi_p=(2.78 +- 0.20) x 10EE13 cm-2 and, after one year of measurements tracking
its recovery, to a fluence Phi_p=(2.12 +- 0.15) x 10EE14 cm-2. Results on
proton-induced damage to the crystal and its spontaneous recovery after both
irradiations are presented here, along with some new, complementary data on
proton-damage in Lead Tungstate. A comparison with FLUKA Monte Carlo simulation
results is performed and a qualitative understanding of high-energy damage
mechanism is attempted.
