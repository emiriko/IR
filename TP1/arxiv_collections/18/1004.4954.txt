Structures of excited states in $^{14}$C are investigated with a method of
$\beta$-$\gamma$ constraint antisymmetrized molecular dynamics in combination
with the generator coordinate method. Various excited states with the developed
$3\alpha$-cluster core structures are suggested in positive- and
negative-parity states. In the positive-parity states, triaxial deformed and
linear-chain structures are found to construct excited bands. Interestingly,
$^{10}$Be+$\alpha$ correlation is found in the cluster states above the
$^{10}$Be+$\alpha$ threshold energy.
