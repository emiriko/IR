A version of group cohomology for locally compact groups and Polish modules
has previously been developed using a bar resolution restricted to measurable
cochains. That theory was shown to enjoy analogs of most of the standard
algebraic properties of group cohomology, but various analytic features of
those cohomology groups were only partially understood.
  This paper re-examines some of those issues. At its heart is a simple
dimension-shifting argument which enables one to `regularize' measurable
cocycles, leading to some simplifications in the description of the cohomology
groups. A range of consequences are then derived from this argument.
  First, we prove that for target modules that are Fr\'echet spaces, the
cohomology groups agree with those defined using continuous cocycles, and hence
they vanish in positive degrees when the acting group is compact. Using this,
we then show that for Fr\'echet, discrete or toral modules the cohomology
groups are continuous under forming inverse limits of compact base groups, and
also under forming direct limits of discrete target modules.
  Lastly, these results together enable us to establish various circumstances
under which the measurable-cochains cohomology groups coincide with others
defined using sheaves on a semi-simplicial space associated to the underlying
group, or sheaves on a classifying space for that group. We also prove in some
cases that the natural quotient topologies on the measurable-cochains
cohomology groups are Hausdorff.
