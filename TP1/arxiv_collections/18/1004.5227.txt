We construct small-amplitude periodic water waves with multiple critical
layers. In addition to waves with arbitrarily many critical layers and a single
crest in each period, two-dimensional sets of waves with several crests and
troughs in each period are found. The setting is that of steady two-dimensional
finite-depth gravity water waves with vorticity.
