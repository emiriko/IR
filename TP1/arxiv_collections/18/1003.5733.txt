In this review, we summarize tests of standard electroweak (EW) theory at the
highest available energies as a precursor to the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)
era. Our primary focus is on the published results (as of March 2010) from
proton- antiproton collisions at $\sqrt{s}=1.96$ TeV at the Fermilab Tevatron
collected using the CDF and D0 detectors. This review is very timely since the
LHC scientific program is nearly underway with the first high-energy
($\sqrt{s}=7$ TeV) collisions about to begin. After presenting an overview of
the EW sector of the standard model, we provide a summary of current
experimental tests of EW theory. These include gauge boson properties and
self-couplings, tests of EW physics from top quark sector, and searches for the
Higgs boson.
