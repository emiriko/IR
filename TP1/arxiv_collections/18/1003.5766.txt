We improve the non-asymptotic key rate shown by Scarani and Renner by
proposing several methods to construct tighter conservative confidence
intervals of the phase error rate than one shown by them. In addition, we show
that the accurate channel estimation method non-asymptotically increases the
key rate over the amplitude damping channel as well as the asymptotic case in
the BB84 protocol.
