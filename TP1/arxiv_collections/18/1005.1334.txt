The theory of generalized local scale invariance of strongly anisotropic
scale invariant systems proposed some time ago by Henkel [Nucl. Phys. B
\textbf{641}, 405 (2002)] is examined. The case of so-called type-I systems is
considered. This was conjectured to be realized by systems at m-axial Lifshitz
points; in support of this claim, scaling functions of two-point cumulants at
the uniaxial Lifshitz point of the three-dimensional ANNNI model were predicted
on the basis of this theory and found to be in excellent agreement with Monte
Carlo results [Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{87}, 125702 (2001)]. The consequences
of the conjectured invariance equations are investigated. It is shown that
fewer solutions than anticipated by Henkel generally exist and contribute to
the scaling functions if these equations are assumed to hold for all (positive
and negative) values of the d-dimensional space (or space time) coordinates
$(t,\bm{r})\in \mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}^{d-1}$. Specifically, a single rather
than two independent solutions exists in the case relevant for the mentioned
fit of Monte Carlo data for the ANNNI model. Renormalization-group improved
perturbation theory in $4+m/2-\epsilon$ dimensions is used to determine the
scaling functions of the order-parameter and energy-density two-point cumulants
in momentum space to two-loop order. The results are mathematically
incompatible with Henkel's predictions except in free-field-theory cases.
However, the scaling function of the energy-density cumulant we obtain for m=1
upon extrapolation of our two-loop RG results to d=3 differs numerically little
from that of an effective free field theory.
