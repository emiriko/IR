The engineered spin structures recently built and measured in scanning
tunneling microscope experiments are calculated using density functional
theory. By determining the precise local structure around the surface
impurities, we find the Mn atoms can form molecular structures with the binding
surface, behaving like surface molecular magnets. The spin structures are
confirmed to be antiferromagnetic, and the exchange couplings are calculated
within 8% of the experimental values simply by collinear-spin GGA+U
calculations. We can also explain why the exchange couplings significantly
change with different impurity binding sites from the determined local
structure. The bond polarity is studied by calculating the atomic charges with
and without the Mn adatoms.
