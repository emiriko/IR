Current-voltage characteristics of planar junctions formed by an epitaxial
c-axis oriented YBa2Cu3O7-x thin film micro-bridge and Ag counter-electrode
were measured in the temperature range from 4.2 K to 300 K. A hysteretic
behavior related to switching of the junction resistance from a high-resistive
to a low-resistive state and vice-versa was observed and analyzed in terms of
the maximal current bias and temperature dependence. The same effects were
observed on a sub-micrometer scale YBa2Cu3O7-x thin film - PtIr point contact
junctions using Scanning Tunneling Microscope. These phenomena are discussed
within a diffusion model, describing an oxygen vacancy drift in YBa2Cu3O7-x
films in the nano-scale vicinity of the junction interface under applied
electrical fields.
