We discuss the limits g tending to large, M tending to large with g^3/M =
const. of the 1 + 1 dimensional Yukawa model. We take into account conclusion
of the results on bound states of the Yukawa Model in this limit (obtained in
[7]). We find that model reduces to an effective nonlocal phi 3 theory in this
limit. We observe causality violation in this limit. We discuss the result.
