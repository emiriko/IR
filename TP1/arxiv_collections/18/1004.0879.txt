When a high voltage is applied to pure water filling two beakers kept close
to each other, a connection forms spontaneously, giving the impression of a
floating water bridge. This phenomenon is of special interest, since it
comprises a number of phenomena currently tackled in modern water science. The
formation and the main properties of this floating water bridge are analyzed in
the conceptual framework of quantum electrodynamics. The necessary conditions
for the formation are investigated as well as the time evolution of the
dynamics. The predictions are found in agreement with the observations.
