Inspired by recent experimental realizations and theoretical simulations of
thin silicon nanowire-based devices, we perform predictive first-principles
simulations of junctionless gated Si nanowire transistors. Our primary
predictions are that Si-based transistors are physically possible without major
changes in design philosophy at scales of ~1 nm wire diameter and ~3 nm gate
length, and that the junctionless transistor may be the only physically
sensible design at these length scales. We also present investigations into
atomic-level design factors such as dopant positioning and concentration.
