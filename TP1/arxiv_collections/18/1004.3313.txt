We report the results of abundance analyses of new samples of stars with
planets and stars without detected planets. We employ these data to compare
abundance-condensation temperature trends in both samples. We find that stars
with planets have more negative trends. In addition, the more metal-rich stars
with planets display the most negative trends. These results confirm and extend
the findings of Ramirez et al. (2009) and Melendez et al. (2009), who
restricted their studies to solar analogs. We also show that the differences
between the solar photospheric and CI meteoritic abundances correlate with
condensation temperature.
