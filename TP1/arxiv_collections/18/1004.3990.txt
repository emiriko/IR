We have studied a series of InAs/GaSb coupled quantum wells using
magneto-infrared spectroscopy for high magnetic fields up to 33T within
temperatures ranging from 4K to 45K in both Faraday and tilted field
geometries. This type of coupled quantum wells consists of an electron layer in
the InAs quantum well and a hole layer in the GaSb quantum well, forming the
so-called two dimensional electron-hole bilayer system. Unlike the samples
studied in the past, the hybridization of the electron and hole subbands in our
samples is largely reduced by having narrower wells and an AlSb barrier layer
interposed between the InAs and the GaSb quantum wells, rendering them weakly
hybridized. Previous studies have revealed multiple absorption modes near the
electron cyclotron resonance of the InAs layer in moderately and strongly
hybridized samples, while only a single absorption mode was observed in the
weakly hybridized samples. We have observed a pair of absorption modes
occurring only at magnetic fields higher than 14T, which exhibited several
interesting phenomena. Among which we found two unique types of behavior that
distinguishes this work from the ones reported in the literature. This pair of
modes is very robust against rising thermal excitations and increasing magnetic
fields alligned parallel to the heterostructures. While the previous results
were aptly explained by the antilevel crossing gap due to the hybridization of
the electron and hole wavefunctions, i.e. conduction-valence Landau level
mixing, the unique features reported in this paper cannot be explained within
the same concept. The unusual properties found in this study and their
connection to the known models for InAs/GaSb heterostructures will be
disccused; in addition, several alternative ideas will be proposed in this
paper and it appears that a spontaneous phase separation can account for most
of the observed features.
