We establish a lower bound on the noncoherent capacity pre-log of a
temporally correlated Rayleigh block-fading single-input multiple-output (SIMO)
channel. Surprisingly, when the covariance matrix of the channel satisfies a
certain technical condition related to the cardinality of its smallest set of
linearly dependent rows, this lower bound reveals that the capacity pre-log in
the SIMO case is larger than that in the single-input single-output (SISO)
case.
