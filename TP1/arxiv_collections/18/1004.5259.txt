General formulas of the two-electron operator representing either atomic or
effective interactions are given in a coupled tensorial form in relativistic
approximation. The alternatives of using uncoupled, coupled and antisymmetric
two-electron wave functions in constructing coupled tensorial form of the
operator are studied. The second quantization technique is used. The considered
operator acts in the space of states of open-subshell atoms.
