The observation of dissipationless anomalous Hall current is one of the
experimental evidences to confirm the intrinsic origin of anomalous Hall
effect. To study the origin of anomalous Hall effect in iron,
Fe$_{100-x}$(SiO$_{2}$)$_{x}$ granular films with volume fraction of SiO$_{2}$
0\le x \le 40.51 were fabricated using co-sputtering. Hall and longitudinal
resistivities were measured in the temperature range 5 to 350 K with magnetic
fields up to 5 Tesla. As x increased from 0 to 40.51, the anomalous Hall
resistivity and longitudinal resistivity increased about 4 and 3 orders in
magnitude, respectively. Analysis of the results revealed that the normalized
anomalous Hall conductivity is a constant for all the samples, the evidence of
dissipationless anomalous Hall current in Fe.
