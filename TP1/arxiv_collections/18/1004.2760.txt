In this note, we first show that the solutions to Cauchy problems for two
versions of relativistic string and membrane equations are diffeomorphic. Then
we investigate the coordinates transformation presented in Ref. [9] (see (2.20)
in Ref. [9]) which plays an important role in the study on the dynamics of the
motion of string in Minkowski space. This kind of transformed coordinates are
harmonic coordinates, and the nonlinear relativistic string equations can be
straightforwardly simplified into linear wave equations under this
transformation.
