We investigate theoretically charge transport in hybrid multiterminal
junctions with superconducting leads kept at different voltages. It is found
that multiple Andreev reflections involving several superconducting leads give
rise to rich subharmonic gap structures in the current-voltage characteristics.
The structures are evidenced numerically in junctions in the incoherent regime.
