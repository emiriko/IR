Synthetic spectra are needed to determine fundamental stellar and wind
parameters of all types of stars. They are also used for the construction of
theoretical spectral libraries helpful for stellar population synthesis.
Therefore, a database of theoretical spectra is required to allow rapid and
quantitative comparisons to spectroscopic data. We provide such a database
offering an unprecedented coverage of the entire Hertzsprung-Russell diagram.
We present the POLLUX database of synthetic stellar spectra. For objects with
Teff < 6 000 K, MARCS atmosphere models are computed and the program
TURBOSPECTRUM provides the synthetic spectra. ATLAS12 models are computed for
stars with 7 000 K <Teff <15 000 K. SYNSPEC gives the corresponding spectra.
Finally, the code CMFGEN provides atmosphere models for the hottest stars (Teff
> 25 000 K). Their spectra are computed with CMF_FLUX. Both high resolution
(R>150 000) optical spectra in the range 3 000 to 12 000 A and spectral energy
distributions extending from the UV to near--IR ranges are presented. These
spectra cover the HR diagram at solar metallicity. We propose a wide variety of
synthetic spectra for various types of stars in a format that is compliant with
the Virtual Observatory standards. A user--friendly web interface allows an
easy selection of spectra and data retrieval. Upcoming developments will
include an extension to a large range of metallicities and to the near--IR high
resolution spectra, as well as a better coverage of the HR diagram, with the
inclusion of models for Wolf-Rayet stars and large datasets for cool stars. The
POLLUX database is accessible at http://pollux.graal.univ-montp2.fr/ and
through the Virtual Observatory.
