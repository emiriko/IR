Preliminary results for the Dalitz plot distribution of
$\eta^\prime\to\eta\pi\pi$ decays in the frameworks of Large-$N_c$ Chiral
Perturbation Theory and Resonance Chiral Theory are given. We hope our results
to be of some relevance for the present and forthcoming analysis of these
decays at GAMS, CLEO, VES, KLOE-2, Crystal Ball, Crystal Barrel, WASA, and
BES-III.
