A Neutrino Factory producing an intense beam composed of nu_e(nubar_e) and
nubar_mu(nu_mu) from muon decays has been shown to have the greatest
sensitivity to the two currently unmeasured neutrino mixing parameters,
theta_13 and delta_CP . Using the `wrong-sign muon' signal to measure nu_e to
nu_mu(nubar_e to nubar_mu) oscillations in a 50 ktonne Magnetised Iron Neutrino
Detector (MIND) sensitivity to delta_CP could be maintained down to small
values of theta_13. However, the detector efficiencies used in previous studies
were calculated assuming perfect pattern recognition. In this paper, MIND is
re-assessed taking into account, for the first time, a realistic pattern
recognition for the muon candidate. Reoptimisation of the analysis utilises a
combination of methods, including a multivariate analysis similar to the one
used in MINOS, to maintain high efficiency while suppressing backgrounds,
ensuring that the signal selection efficiency and the background levels are
comparable or better than the ones in previous analyses.
