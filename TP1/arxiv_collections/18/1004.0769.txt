Wireless networks are a common place nowadays and almost all of the modern
devices support wireless communication in some form. These networks differ from
more traditional computing systems due to the ad-hoc and spontaneous nature of
interactions among devices. These systems are prone to security risks, such as
eavesdropping and require different techniques as compared to traditional
security mechanisms. Recently, secure device pairing in wireless environments
has got substantial attention from many researchers. As a result, a significant
set of techniques and protocols have been proposed to deal with this issue.
Some of these techniques consider devices equipped with infrared, laser,
ultrasound transceivers or 802.11 network interface cards; while others require
embedded accelerometers, cameras and/or LEDs, displays, microphones and/or
speakers. However, many of the proposed techniques or protocols have not been
implemented at all; while others are implemented and evaluated in a stand-alone
manner without being compared with other related work [1]. We believe that it
is because of the lack of specialized tools that provide a common platform to
test the pairing methods. As a consequence, we designed such a tool. In this
paper, we are presenting design and development of the Pairing Simulator (PSim)
that can be used to perform the analysis of device pairing methods.
