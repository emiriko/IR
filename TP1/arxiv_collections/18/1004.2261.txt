We discuss some problems with the large Nc approximation for nucleons which
arise if the axial coupling of the nucleon to pions is large, g_A \sim Nc.
While g_A \sim Nc in non-relativistic quark and Skyrme models, it has been
suggested that Skyrmions may collapse to a small size, r \sim 1/f_pi \sim
Lambda_QCD^{-1}/sqrt(Nc). (This is also the typical scale over which the string
vertex moves in a string vertex model of the baryon.) We concentrate on the
case of two flavors, where we suggest that to construct a nucleon with a small
axial coupling, that most quarks are bound into colored diquark pairs, which
have zero spin and isospin. For odd Nc, this leaves one unpaired quark, which
carries the spin and isospin of the nucleon. If the unpaired quark is in a
spatial wavefunction orthogonal to the wavefunctions of the scalar diquarks,
then up to logarithms of Nc, the unpaired quark only costs an energy \sim
Lambda_QCD. This naturally gives g_A \sim 1 and has other attractive features.
In nature, the wavefunctions of the paired and unpaired quarks might only be
approximately orthogonal; then g_A depends weakly upon Nc. This dichotomy in
wave functions could arise if the unpaired quark orbits at a size which is
parametrically large in comparison to that of the diquarks. We discuss possible
tests of these ideas from numerical simulations on the lattice, for two flavors
and three and five colors; the extension of our ideas to more than three or
more flavors is not obvious, though.
