It is shown how high energy neutrino beams from very distant sources can be
utilised to learn about many neutrino properties such as lifetimes, mass
hierarchy, mixing, minuscule pseudo-Dirac mass splittings and other exotic
properties. In addition, the production mechanism of neutrinos in the
astrophysical sources can also be elucidated.
