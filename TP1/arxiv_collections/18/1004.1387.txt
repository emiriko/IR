The magnetic properties of LiFeAs, as single crystalline and polycrystalline
samples, were investigated. The lower critical field deduced from the vortex
penetration of two single crystals appears to be almost isotropic with a
temperature dependence closer to that of two-gap superconductors. The
parameters extracted from the reversible magnetizations of sintered
polycrystalline samples are in good agreement with those from the single
crystal data.
