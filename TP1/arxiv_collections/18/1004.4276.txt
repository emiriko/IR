The interplay of magnetic energies in a Kondo lattice is the underlying
physics of a heavy fermion system. Creating an artificial Kondo lattice system
by localizing the moments in an ordered metallic array provides a prototype
system to tune and study the energetic interplay while avoiding the
complications introduced by random alloying of the material. In this article,
we create a Kondo lattice system by fabricating a hexagonally ordered
nanostructured array using niobium as the host metal and cobalt as the magnetic
constituent. Electrical transport measurements and magnetoresistivity
measurements of these artificial lattices show that the competing exchange
coupling properties can be easily tuned by controlling the impurity percentage.
These artificial Kondo lattice systems enable the exploration of an artificial
superconductor which should lead to a deep understanding of the role of
magnetism in unconventional superconductors.
