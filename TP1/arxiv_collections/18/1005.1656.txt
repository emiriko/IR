One way to deal with the fact that many versions of reality simultanenously
exist in the wave function is to suppose there are hidden variables that single
out one version for perception. Bell showed theoretically and the Aspect
experiment confirmed that there could be no hidden variable theory which
satisfied a locality condition. We show here that the locality condition can be
derived from the well-established principle of the relativity of simultaneity.
Thus virtually all hidden variable theories, not just obviously local ones, are
in conflict with the results of the Aspect experiment and are therefore
forbidden.
