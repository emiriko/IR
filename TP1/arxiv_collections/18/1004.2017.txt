This paper sumarizes research on abundances in RR Lyrae stars that one of us
(GW) has been engaged in with various astronomers. In addition we report on
preliminary analysis of the abundances of C, Si, S and Fe in 24 RR Lyrae stars.
Our model atmosphere analysis, including NLTE effects, are based on the spectra
of resolving power 30,000 obtained at the Apache Poing Observatory.
