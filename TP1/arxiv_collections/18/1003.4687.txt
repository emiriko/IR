We have developed a method to compute the possible distribution of radio
emission regions in a typical pulsar magnetosphere, taking into account the
viewing geometry and rotational effects of the neutron star. Our method can
estimate the emission altitude and the radius of curvature of particle
trajectory as a function of rotation phase for a given inclination angle,
impact angle, spin-period, Lorentz factor, field line constant and the
observation frequency. Further, using curvature radiation as the basic emission
mechanism, we simulate the radio intensity profiles that would be observed from
a given distribution of emission regions, for different values of radio
frequency and Lorentz factor. We show clearly that rotation effects can
introduce significant asymmetries into the observed radio profiles. We
investigate the dependency of profile features on various pulsar parameters. We
find that the radiation from a given ring of field lines can be seen over a
large range of pulse longitudes, originating at different altitudes, with
varying spectral intensity. Preferred heights of emission along discrete sets
of field lines are required to reproduce realistic pulsar profiles, and we
illustrate this for a known pulsar. Finally, we show how our model provides
feasible explanations for the origin of core emission, and also for one-sided
cones which have been observed in some pulsars.
