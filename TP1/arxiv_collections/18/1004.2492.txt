Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) show evidence of different light curves, duration,
afterglows, host galaxies and they explode within a wide redshift range.
However, their spectral energy distributions (SEDs) appear to be very similar
showing a curved shape. Band et al. (1993) proposed a phenomenological
description of the integrated spectral shape for the GRB prompt emission, the
so called Band function. In this letter we suggest an alternative scenario to
explain the curved shape of GRB SEDs: the log-parabolic model. In comparison
with the Band spectral shape our model is statistically favored because it fits
the GRB spectra with one parameter less than the Band function and it is
motivated by a theoretical acceleration scenario. The new Fermi observations of
GRBs will be crucial to disentangle between these two models.
