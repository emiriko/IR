We propose a topological order parameter for interacting topological
insulators, expressed in terms of the full Green's functions of the interacting
system. We show that it is exactly quantized for a time reversal invariant
topological insulator, and it can be experimentally measured through the
topological magneto-electric effect. This topological order parameter can be
applied to both interacting and disordered systems, and used for determining
their phase diagrams.
