We present results of hypernuclei calculated in the latest quark-meson
coupling (QMC) model, where the effect of the mean scalar field in-medium on
the one-gluon exchange hyperfine interaction, is also included
self-consistently. The extra repulsion associated with this increased hyperfine
interaction in-medium completely changes the predictions for {\Sigma}
hypernuclei. Whereas in the earlier version of QMC they were bound by an amount
similar to {\Lambda} hypernuclei, they are unbound in the latest version of
QMC, in qualitative agreement with the experimental absence of such states.
