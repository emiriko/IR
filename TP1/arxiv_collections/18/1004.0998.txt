The LIGO detectors are sensitive to a variety of noise transients of
non-astrophysical origin. Instrumental glitches and environmental disturbances
increase the false alarm rate in the searches for gravitational waves. Using
times already identified when the interferometers produced data of questionable
quality, or when the channels that monitor the interferometer indicated
non-stationarity, we have developed techniques to safely and effectively veto
false triggers from the compact binary coalescences (CBCs) search pipeline.
