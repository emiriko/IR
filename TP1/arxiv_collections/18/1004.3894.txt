We explore the dynamics of non-interacting particles loaded into a
phase-modulated one-dimensional lattice formed by laterally oscillating square
barriers. Tuning the parameters of the driven unit cell of the lattice selected
parts of the classical phase space can be manipulated in a controllable manner.
We find superdiffusion in position space for all parameters regimes. A directed
current of an ensemble of particles can be created through locally breaking the
spatiotemporal symmetries of the time-driven potential. Magnitude and direction
of the current are tunable. Several mechanisms for transient localization and
trapping of particles in different wells of the driven unit cell are presented
and analyzed.
