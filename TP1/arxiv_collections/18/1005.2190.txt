We present spectral and kinematic evidence that 2MASS J06085283-2753583
(M8.5gamma) is a member of the beta Pictoris Moving Group (BPMG, age ~12 Myr),
making it the latest-type known member of this young, nearby association. We
confirm low-gravity spectral morphology at both medium and high resolutions in
the near-infrared. We present new radial velocity and proper motion
measurements and use these to calculate galactic location and space motion
consistent with other high-probability members of the BPMG. The predicted mass
range consistent with the object's effective temperature, surface gravity,
spectral type, and age is 15-35 M_Jup, placing 2MASS 0608-27 well within the
brown dwarf mass regime. 2MASS J06085283-2753583 is thus confidently added to
the short list of very low mass, intermediate age benchmark objects that inform
ongoing searches for the lowest-mass members of nearby young associations.
