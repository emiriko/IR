It is known that most of the craters on the surface of the Moon were created
by the collision of minor bodies of the Solar System. Main Belt Asteroids,
which can approach the terrestrial planets as a consequence of different types
of resonance, are actually the main responsible for this phenomenon. Our aim is
to investigate the impact distributions on the lunar surface that low-energy
dynamics can provide. As a first approximation, we exploit the hyberbolic
invariant manifolds associated with the central invariant manifold around the
equilibrium point L_2 of the Earth - Moon system within the framework of the
Circular Restricted Three - Body Problem. Taking transit trajectories at
several energy levels, we look for orbits intersecting the surface of the Moon
and we attempt to define a relationship between longitude and latitude of
arrival and lunar craters density. Then, we add the gravitational effect of the
Sun by considering the Bicircular Restricted Four - Body Problem. As further
exploration, we assume an uniform density of impact on the lunar surface,
looking for the regions in the Earth - Moon neighbourhood these colliding
trajectories have to come from. It turns out that low-energy ejecta originated
from high-energy impacts are also responsible of the phenomenon we are
considering.
