This paper considers the capacity gains due to unidirectional destination
cooperation in cognitive radio channels. We propose a novel channel,
interference channel with degraded message sets with unidirectional destination
cooperation (IC-DMS-UDC), to allow the receiver of cognitive radio (secondary
user) to participate in relaying the information for primary system (legitimate
user). Our main result is the development of an achievable rate region which
combines Gel'fand-Pinkser coding with partial-decode-and-forward strategy
employed in the relay channel. A numerical evaluation of the region in the
Gaussian case is also provided to demonstrate the improvements.
