In this paper, we investigate a novel $(2,2)$-threshold scheme and then
generalize this to a $(n,n)$-threshold scheme for quantum secret sharing (QSS)
which makes use of the fundamentals of Analytic Geometry. The dealer aptly
selects GHZ states related to the coefficients which determine straight lines
on a two-dimension plane. Then by computing each two of the lines intercept or
not, we obtain a judging matrix whose rank can be used to determine the secret
stored in entangled bits. Based on the database technology, authorized
participants access to the database to obtain the secret information and hence
the secret never appears in the channel. In this way, the eavesdroppers fail to
obtain any secret by applying various attack strategies.
