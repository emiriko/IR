In the Bi cuprates, the presence of a near 1$\times$5 superstructure is well
known. Usually, this superstructure is suppressed by the substitution of lead,
but there have been reports of a phase separation in so called {\alpha} and
{\beta} phases. This paper shows in high detail time how and why the phase
separation develops and what happens to the quasi-1$\times$5 superstructure
upon lead substitution. For this purpose, the lanthanum- and lead-substituted
single-layered superconductor Bi$_{2+z}$Sr$_{2-z}$CuO$_{6+\delta}$ has been
investigated by scanning tunneling microscopy and low-energy electron
diffraction. The La content was kept constant at slightly under-doped
concentration while the Pb content was changed systematically. Thermodynamic
considerations show that a phase mixture of {\alpha} and {\beta} phases is
inevitable.
