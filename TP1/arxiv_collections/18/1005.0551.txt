The quest for gravitational waves from coalescing binaries is customarily
performed by the LIGO-Virgo collaboration via matched filtering, which requires
a detailed knowledge of the signal. Complete analytical coalescence waveforms
are currently available only for the non-precessing binary systems. In this
paper we introduce complete phenomenological waveforms for the dominant
quadrupolar mode of generically spinning systems. These waveforms are
constructed by bridging the gap between the analytically known inspiral phase,
described by spin Taylor (T4) approximants in the restricted waveform
approximation, and the ring-down phase through a phenomenological intermediate
phase, calibrated by comparison with specific, numerically generated waveforms,
describing equal mass systems with dimension-less spin magnitudes equal to 0.6.
The overlap integral between numerical and phenomenological waveforms ranges
between 0.95 and 0.99.
