Fifty-nine quasars in the background of the Magellanic Clouds had brightness
records monitored by the MACHO project during the years 1992 - 99. Because the
circumpolar fields of these quasars had no seasonal sampling defects, their
observation produced data sets well suited to further careful analysis.
Following a preliminary report wherein we showed the existence of reverberation
in the data for one of the radio-quiet quasars in this group, we now show that
similar reverberations have been seen in all of the 55 radio-quiet quasars with
adequate data, making possible the determination of the quasar inclination to
the observer's line of sight. The reverberation signatures indicate the
presence of large-scale elliptical outflow structures similar to that predicted
by the Elvis (2000) and "dusty torus" models of quasars, whose characteristic
sizes vary within a surprisingly narrow range of scales. More importantly the
observed opening angle relative to the polar axis of the universal elliptical
outflow structure present was consistently found to be on the order of 78
degrees.
