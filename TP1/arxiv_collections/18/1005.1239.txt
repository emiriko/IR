We report the performances of a 0.51 kg CdWO4 scintillating bolometer to be
used for future Double Beta Decay Experiments. The simultaneous read-out of the
heat and the scintillation light allows to discriminate between different
interacting particles aiming at the disentanglement and the reduction of
background contribution, key issue for next generation experiments. We will
describe the observed anticorrelation between the heat and the light signal and
we will show how this feature can be used in order to increase the energy
resolution of the bolometer over the entire energy spectrum, improving up to a
factor 2.6 on the 2615 keV line of 208Tl. The detector was tested in a 433 h
background measurement that permitted to estimate extremely low internal trace
contaminations of 232Th and 238U. The light yield of gamma/beta, alpha and
neutrons is presented. Furthermore we developed a method in order to correctly
evaluate the absolute thermal quenching factor of alpha particles in
scintillating bolometers.
