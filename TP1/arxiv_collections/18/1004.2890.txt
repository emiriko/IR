Electric flux tubes are a well known attribute of the QCD vacuum in which
they manifest confinement of electric color charges. Recently, experimental
results have appeared suggesting that not only those objects persist at
temperatures $T\approx T_c$ near the QCD phase transitions, but their decay is
suppressed and the resulting clusters in AuAu collisions are larger than in pp
(i.e. in vacuum). This correlates well with recent theoretical scenarios that
view the QCD matter in the $T\approx T_{c}$ region as a dual-magnetic plasma
dominated by color-magnetic monopoles. In this view the flux tubes are
stabilized by dual-magnetic currents and are described by
dual-magnetohydrodynamics (DMHD). In this paper we calculate classically the
dissipative effects in the flux tube. Such effects are associated with
rescattering and finite conductivity of the matter. We derive the DMHD solution
in the presence of dissipation and then estimate the lifetime of the electric
flux tubes. The conclusion of this study is that a classical treatment leads to
too short of a lifetime for the flux tubes.
