In this note, we revisit the thermal fluctuations generated during bouncing
cosmology, taking Unruh effect into account. We find that due to the additional
effect on temperature, the dependence of power spectrum on $k$ will get
corrected with an indication of blue tilt at large $k$ region, which is in
consistent with the case of vacuum initial conditions.
