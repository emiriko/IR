We show that given $n$ normalized intervals on the unit circle, the numbers
of visits of $d$ random rotations to these intervals have a joint limiting
distribution as lengths of trajectories tend to infinity. If $d$ then tends to
infinity, then the numbers of points in different intervals become
asymptotically independent unless an arithmetic obstruction arises. This is a
generalization of earlier results of J. Marklof.
