We illustrate a procedure to generate a bipartite, entangled compass state,
which shows sub-Planck structure. The proposed method uses the interaction of a
standing wave laser field, with two, two-level atoms and relies on the ability
of this system to choose certain mesoscopic bipartite states to couple with the
internal degrees of freedom. An appropriate measurement on the internal degrees
of freedom then leads to the entangled state, which shows sub-Planck
structures, desired for quantum metrology.
