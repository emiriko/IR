The high energy spectrum of cosmic rays presents three distinct traits, the
second knee, the ankle, and the GZK cutoff and as such, a thorough
understanding of cosmic rays encompasses the study of these three features. It
is in the second knee - ankle region where cosmic ray sources change from a
galactic origin to an extragalactic one. At the higher cutoff energies, the
arrival directions show an anisotropy related to the near extragalactic sky.
The Pierre Auger Observatory is currently designed to help to unravel these
features by performing both spectrum and composition measurements with
unprecedented accuracy. The primary particle type in the second knee - ankle
region will be studied both with fluorescence telescopes and muon counters
giving the air shower longitudinal profiles and muon contents, respectively.
