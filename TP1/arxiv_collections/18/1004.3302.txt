Single field inflationary models predict nearly Gaussian initial conditions
and hence a detection of non-Gaussianity would be a signature of the more
complex inflationary scenarios. In this paper we study the effect on the cosmic
microwave background and on large scale structure from primordial
non-Gaussianity in a two-field inflationary model in which both the inflaton
and curvaton contribute to the density perturbations. We show that in addition
to the previously described enhancement of the galaxy bias on large scales,
this setup results in large-scale stochasticity. We provide joint constraints
on the local non-Gaussianity parameter $\tilde f_{\rm NL}$ and the ratio $\xi$
of the amplitude of primordial perturbations due to the inflaton and curvaton
using WMAP and SDSS data.
