Protostellar jets are known to emit in a wide range of bands, from radio to
IR to optical bands, and to date also about ten X-ray emitting jets have been
detected, with a rate of discovery of about one per year. We aim at
investigating the mechanism leading to the X-ray emission detected in
protostellar jets and at constraining the physical parameters that describe the
jet/ambient interaction by comparing our model predictions with observations.
We perform 2D axisymmetric hydrodynamic simulations of the interaction between
a supersonic jet and the ambient. The jet is described as a train of plasma
blobs randomly ejected by the stellar source along the jet axis. We explore the
parameter space by varying the ejection rate, the initial jet Mach number, and
the initial density contrast between the ambient and the jet. We synthesized
from the model the X-ray emission as it would be observed with the current
X-ray telescopes. The mutual interactions among the ejected blobs and of the
blobs with the ambient medium lead to complex X-ray emitting structures within
the jet: irregular chains of knots; isolated knots with measurable proper
motion; apparently stationary knots; reverse shocks. The predicted X-ray
luminosity strongly depends on the ejection rate and on the initial density
contrast between the ambient and the jet, with a weaker dependence on the jet
Mach number. Our model represents the first attempt to describe the X-ray
properties of all the X-ray emitting protostellar jets. The comparison between
our model predictions and the observations can provide a useful diagnostic tool
necessary for a proper interpretation of the observations. In particular, we
suggest that the observable quantities derived from the spectral analysis of
X-ray observations can be used to constrain the ejection rate, a parameter
explored in our model that is not measurable by current observations.
