We present two experiments that achieve phase super-resolution at
telecommunication wavelengths. One of the experiments is realized in the space
domain and the other in the time domain. Both experiments show high
visibilities and are performed with standard lasers and single-photon
detectors. The first experiment uses six-photon coincidences, whereas the
latter needs no coincidence measurements, is easy to perform, and achieves, in
principle, arbitrarily high phase super-resolution. Here, we demonstrate a
30-fold increase of the resolution. We stress that neither entanglement nor
joint detection is needed in these experiments, demonstrating that neither is
necessary to achieve phase super-resolution.
