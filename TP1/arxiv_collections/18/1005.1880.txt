In their preprint Anders et al. [arXiv:1004.0510] propose a crucial
modification of the Bosonic Dynamical Mean-Field Theory (B-DMFT) derived by us
[Phys. Rev. B 77, 235106 (2008)]. Here we show that the modification consists
of two steps which, in fact, cancel each other. Consequently their
self-consistency equations are identical to ours.
