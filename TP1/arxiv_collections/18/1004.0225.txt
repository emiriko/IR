A novel approach to control the grain size of oxide thin film materials has
been investigated. Perovskite BaTiO3 shows interesting grain structures when
deposited on gold predeposited, (111)-oriented, singlecrystal SrTiO3
substrates. Solid oxide films grow epitaxially on patterned seed layers and
show variations in grain size relative to the films deposited on SrTiO3
directly.
