The sensitivity and frequency selectivity of hearing result from tuned
amplification by an active process in the mechanoreceptive hair cells. In most
vertebrates the active process stems from the active motility of hair bundles.
The mammalian cochlea exhibits an additional form of mechanical activity termed
electromotility: its outer hair cells (OHCs) change length upon electrical
stimulation. The relative contributions of these two mechanisms to the active
process in the mammalian inner ear is the subject of intense current debate.
Here we show that active hair-bundle motility and electromotility can together
implement an efficient mechanism for amplification that functions like a
ratchet: sound-evoked forces acting on the basilar membrane are transmitted to
the hair bundles whereas electromotility decouples active hair-bundle forces
from the basilar membrane. This unidirectional coupling can extend the hearing
range well below the resonant frequency of the basilar membrane. It thereby
provides a concept for low-frequency hearing that accounts for a variety of
unexplained experimental observations from the cochlear apex, including the
shape and phase behavior of apical tuning curves, their lack of significant
nonlinearities, and the shape changes of threshold tuning curves of auditory
nerve fibers along the cochlea. The ratchet mechanism constitutes a general
design principle for implementing mechanical amplification in engineering
applications.
