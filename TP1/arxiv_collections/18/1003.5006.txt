Dynamical chiral symmetry breaking (DCSB) is a remarkably effective mass
generating mechanism. It is also, amongst other things, the foundation for a
successful application of chiral effective field theories, the origin of
constituent-quark masses, and intimately connected with confinement in QCD.
Using the Dyson-Schwinger equations (DSEs), we explain the origin and nature of
DCSB, and elucidate some of its consequences, e.g.: a model-independent result
for the pion susceptibility; the generation of a quark anomalous chromomagnetic
moment, which may explain the longstanding puzzle of the a_1-rho mass
splitting; its impact on the behaviour of the electromagnetic pion form factor
-- thereby illustrating how data can be used to chart the momentum-dependence
of the dressed-quark mass function; in the form of the pion and kaon
valence-quark parton distribution functions, and the relation between them; and
aspects of the neutron's electromagnetic form factors, in particular
F_1^u/F_1^d and G_M^n. We argue that in solving QCD, a constructive feedback
between theory and extant and forthcoming experiments will most rapidly enable
constraints to be placed on the infrared behaviour of QCD's \beta-function, the
nonperturbative quantity at the core of hadron physics; and emphasise
throughout the role played by confrontation with data as a means of verifying
our understanding of Nature.
