We study the problem of energy relaxation in a one-dimensional electron
system. The leading thermalization mechanism is due to three-particle
collisions. We show that for the case of spinless electrons in a single channel
quantum wire the corresponding collision integral can be transformed into an
exactly solvable problem. The latter is known as the Schrodinger equation for a
quantum particle moving in a Poschl-Teller potential. The spectrum for the
resulting eigenvalue problem allows for bound-state solutions, which can be
identified with the zero modes of the collision integral, and a continuum of
propagating modes, which are separated by a gap from the bound states. The
inverse gap gives the time scale at which counterpropagating electrons
thermalize.
