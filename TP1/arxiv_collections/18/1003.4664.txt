We study the radiative decay into $\gamma$ and a baryon of the SU(3) octet
and decuplet of nine and ten resonances that are dynamically generated from the
interaction of vector mesons with baryons of the octet and the decuplet
respectively. We obtain quite different partial decay widths for the various
resonances, and for different charge states of the same resonance, suggesting
that the experimental investigation of these radiative decays should bring much
information on the nature of these resonances. For the case of baryons of the
octet we determine the helicity amplitudes and compare them with experimental
data when available.
