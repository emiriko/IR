We report the results of a numerical study of nonequilibrium steady states
for a class of Hamiltonian models. In these models of coupled matter-energy
transport, particles exchange energy through collisions with pinned-down
rotating disks. In [Commun. Math. Phys. 262 (2006)], Eckmann and Young studied
1D chains and showed that certain simple formulas give excellent approximations
of energy and particle density profiles.
  Keeping the basic mode of interaction in [Eckmann-Young], we extend their
prediction scheme to a number of new settings: 2D systems on different
lattices, driven by a variety of boundary (heat bath) conditions including the
use of thermostats. Particle-conserving models of the same type are shown to
behave similarly. The second half of this paper examines memory and finite-size
effects, which appear to impact only minimally the profiles of the models
tested in [Eckmann-Young]. We demonstrate that these effects can be significant
or insignificant depending on the local geometry. Dynamical mechanisms are
proposed, and in the case of directional bias in particle trajectories due to
memory, correction schemes are derived and shown to give accurate predictions.
