A signed labeled forest is defined as a (plane) forest labeled by {1,2,...,
n} along with minus signs associated to some vertices. Signed labeled forests
can be viewed as an extension of signed permutations. We define the inversion
number, the flag major index and the R-major index on signed labeled forests.
They can be considered as type B analogues of the indices for labeled forests
introduced by Bjorner and Wachs. The flag major index for signed labeled
forests is based on the flag major index on signed permutations introduced by
Adin and Roichman, whereas the R-major index for signed labeled forests is
based on the R-major index that we introduce for signed permutations, which is
closely related to the major defined by Reiner. We obtain q-hook length
formulas by q-counting signed labelings of a given forest with respect to the
above indices, from which we see that these three indices are equidistributed
for signed labeled forests. Our formulas for the major indices and the
inversion number are type B analogues of the formula due to Bjorner and Wachs.
We also give a type D analogue with respect to the inversion number of
even-signed labeled forests.
