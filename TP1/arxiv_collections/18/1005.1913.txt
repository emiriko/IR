A long-range interaction via virtual particle-hole pairs between Fermi-liquid
quasiparticles leads to a nonanalytic behavior of the spin susceptibility
$\chi$ as a function of the temperature ($T$), magnetic field ($\mathbf{B}$),
and wavenumber. In this paper, we study the effect of the Rashba spin-orbit
interaction (SOI) on the nonanalytic behavior of $\chi$ for a two-dimensional
electron liquid. Although the SOI breaks the SU(2) symmetry, it does not
eliminate nonanalyticity but rather makes it anisotropic: while the linear
scaling of $\chi_{zz}$ with $T$ and $|\mathbf{B}|$ saturates at the energy
scale set by the SOI, that of $\chi_{xx}$ ($=\chi_{yy}$) continues through this
energy scale, until renormalization of the electron-electron interaction in the
Cooper channel becomes important. We show that the Renormalization Group flow
in the Cooper channel has a non-trivial fixed point, and study the consequences
of this fixed point for the nonanalytic behavior of $\chi$. An immediate
consequence of SOI-induced anisotropy in the nonanalytic behavior of $\chi$ is
a possible instability of a second-order ferromagnetic quantum phase transition
with respect to a first-order transition to an XY ferromagnetic state.
