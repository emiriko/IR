The production rate and kinematics of photons produced in association with Z
bosons are studied using 2/fb of p\bar{p} collision data collected at the
Collider Detector at Fermilab. The cross section for p\bar{p} -> l^+ l^- gamma
+ X (where the leptons l are either muons or electrons with dilepton mass
M_{ll} > 40 GeV/c^2, and where the photon has transverse energy Et_{gamma} > 7
GeV and is well separated from the leptons) is 4.6 +/- 0.2 (stat) +/- 0.3
(syst) +/- 0.3 (lum) pb, which is consistent with standard model expectations.
We use the photon Et distribution from Z-gamma events where the Z has decayed
to mu^+ mu^-, e^+ e^-, or nu\bar{nu} to set limits on anomalous
(non-standard-model) trilinear couplings between photons and Z bosons.
