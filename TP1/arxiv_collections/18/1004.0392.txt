Losses in metamaterials render the applications of such exotic materials less
practical unless an efficient way of reducing them is found. We present two
different techniques to reduce ohmic losses at both lower and higher
frequencies, based on geometric tailoring of the individual magnetic
constituents. We show that an increased radius of curvature, in general, leads
to the least losses in metamaterials. Particularly at higher THz frequencies,
bulky structures outperform the planar structures.
