Alloy is a lightweight modeling formalism based on relational algebra. In
prior work with Fisler, Giannakopoulos, Krishnamurthi, and Yoo, we have
presented a tool, Alchemy, that compiles Alloy specifications into
implementations that execute against persistent databases. The foundation of
Alchemy is an algorithm for rewriting relational algebra formulas into code for
database transactions. In this paper we report on recent progress in improving
the robustness and efficiency of this transformation.
