An population-centric analysis for a version of the p-beauty contest game is
given for the two-player, finite population, and infinite population cases.
Winning strategies are characterized in terms of iterative thinking relative to
the population. To win the game one needs to iterate more times than the
ambient population, but not too many more times depending on the population
size and the value of p.
