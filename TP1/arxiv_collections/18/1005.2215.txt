We calculate the relic abundance of thermally produced neutralino cold dark
matter in the general 19 parameter supergravity (SUGRA-19) model. A scan over
GUT scale parameters reveals that models with a bino-like neutralino typically
give rise to a dark matter density \Omega_{\tz_1}h^2\sim 1-1000, i.e. between 1
and 4 orders of magnitude higher than the measured value. Models with higgsino
or wino cold dark matter can yield the correct relic density, but mainly for
neutralino masses around 700-1300 GeV. Models with mixed bino-wino or
bino-higgsino CDM, or models with dominant co-annihilation or A-resonance
annihilation can yield the correct abundance, but such cases are extremely hard
to generate using a general scan over GUT scale parameters; this is indicative
of high fine-tuning of the relic abundance in these cases. Requiring that
m_{\tz_1}\alt 500 GeV (as a rough naturalness requirement) gives rise to a
minimal probably dip in parameter space at the measured CDM abundance. For
comparison, we also scan over mSUGRA space with four free parameters. Finally,
we investigate the Peccei-Quinn augmented MSSM with mixed axion/axino cold dark
matter. In this case, the relic abundance agrees more naturally with the
measured value. In light of our cumulative results, we conclude that future
axion searches should probe much more broadly in axion mass, and deeper into
the axion coupling.
