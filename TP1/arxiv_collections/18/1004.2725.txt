Scaling and hyperscaling laws provide exact relations among critical
exponents describing the behavior of a system at criticality. For
nonequilibrium growth models with a conserved drift there exist few of them.
One such relation is $\alpha +z=4$, found to be inexact in a renormalization
group calculation for several classical models in this field. Herein we focus
on the two-dimensional case and show that it is possible to construct conserved
surface growth equations for which the relation $\alpha +z=4$ is exact in the
renormalization group sense. We explain the presence of this scaling law in
terms of the existence of geometric principles dominating the dynamics.
