Bound state, valence electronic excitation spectra of N_2 are probed by
nonresonant inelastic x-ray and electron scattering. Within the usual
theoretical treatments, dynamical structure factors derived from the two probes
should be identical. However, we find strong disagreements outside the dipole
scattering limit, even at high probe energies. This suggests an unexpectedly
important contribution from intra-molecular multiple scattering of the probe
electron from core electrons or the nucleus. These effects should grow
progressively stronger as the atomic number of the target species increases.
