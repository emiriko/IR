Numerical simulations of the 3D MHD-equations that describe rotating
magnetoconvection in a Cartesian box have been performed using the code
NIRVANA. The characteristics of averaged quantities like the turbulence
intensity and the turbulent heat flux that are caused by the combined action of
the small-scale fluctuations are computed. The correlation length of the
turbulence significantly depends on the strength and orientation of the
magnetic field and the anisotropic behavior of the turbulence intensity induced
by Coriolis and Lorentz force is considerably more pronounced for faster
rotation. The development of isotropic behavior on the small scales -- as it is
observed in pure rotating convection -- vanishes even for a weak magnetic field
which results in a turbulent flow that is dominated by the vertical component.
In the presence of a horizontal magnetic field the vertical turbulent heat flux
slightly increases with increasing field strength, so that cooling of the
rotating system is facilitated. Horizontal transport of heat is always directed
westwards and towards the poles. The latter might be a source of a large-scale
meridional flow whereas the first would be important in global simulations in
case of non-axisymmetric boundary conditions for the heat flux.
