Two central concepts of quantum mechanics are Heisenberg's uncertainty
principle, and a subtle form of non-locality that Einstein famously called
``spooky action at a distance''. These two fundamental features have thus far
been distinct concepts. Here we show that they are inextricably and
quantitatively linked. Quantum mechanics cannot be more non-local with
measurements that respect the uncertainty principle. In fact, the link between
uncertainty and non-locality holds for all physical theories.More specifically,
the degree of non-locality of any theory is determined by two factors -- the
strength of the uncertainty principle, and the strength of a property called
``steering'', which determines which states can be prepared at one location
given a measurement at another.
