We calculate quantum mechanically exact wave functions of resonances in
spectra of the hydrogen atom in crossed external fields and prove the existence
of long-lived decaying quantum states localized at the Stark saddle point. A
spectrum of ground and excited states reproducing the nodal patterns expected
from simple quadratic and cubic expansions of the potential in the vicinity of
the saddle point can be identified. The results demonstrate the presence of
resonances in the vicinity of the saddle predicted by simple approximations.
