First-principles simulations were performed to investigate reaction of carbon
nanotubes with adsorbed metal atoms. Mechanical modification of their
structures enhances chemical reactivity of carbon nanotubes. Adsorption of a
tungsten, tantalum, or niobium atom on a (5, 0) nanotube with a Stone-Wales
defect was shown to have characteristically strong chemisorption. Bond-breaking
in the carbon-carbon network and formation of a local metal-carbon complex were
observed during the simulation. Adsorption of W, Ta, Ni or Mo on a twisted (5,
0) nanotube showed a preferred breaking of several bonds, even creating an
opening in the wall. The enhanced chemical reactivity of deformed nanotubes is
characterized by formation of a metal-carbon complex. Applications of the
reaction are suggested.
