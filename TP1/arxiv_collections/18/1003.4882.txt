We study the nonequilibrium transport through a quantum dot coupled to normal
and superconducting leads. We use the modified second-order perturbation theory
to calculate the differential conductance and the local density of states at
the quantum dot. In the strong but finite Coulomb interaction regime, the
differential conductance shows an anomalous peak not at a zero bias voltage but
at a finite bias voltage. We also observe an additional Kondo resonance besides
the normal one in the local density of states, where the former is caused by
nonequilibrium Andreev tunneling via the normal Kondo resonance. We explain
that this specific Andreev tunneling gives rise to the anomalous peak in the
differential conductance. Since the Andreev tunneling via the Kondo resonance
is suppressed with increasing temperature, the anomalous peak in the
differential conductance disappears at high temperatures.
