We present Herschel/PACS spectroscopic maps of the dwarf galaxy NC4214
observed in 6 far infrared fine-structure lines: [C II] 158mu, [O III] 88mu, [O
I] 63mu, [O I] 146mu, [N II] 122mu, and [N II] 205mu. The maps are sampled to
the full telescope spatial resolution and reveal unprecedented detail on ~ 150
pc size scales. We detect [C II] emission over the whole mapped area, [O III]
being the most luminous FIR line. The ratio of [O III]/[C II] peaks at about 2
toward the sites of massive star formation, higher than ratios seen in dusty
starburst galaxies. The [C II]/CO ratios are 20 000 to 70 000 toward the 2
massive clusters, which are at least an order of magnitude larger than spiral
or dusty starbursts, and cannot be reconciled with single-slab PDR models.
Toward the 2 massive star-forming regions, we find that L[CII] is 0.5 to 0.8%
of the LTIR . All of the lines together contribute up to 2% of LTIR . These
extreme findings are a consequence of the lower metallicity and young,
massive-star formation commonly found in dwarf galaxies. These conditions
promote large-scale photodissociation into the molecular reservoir, which is
evident in the FIR line ratios. This illustrates the necessity to move to
multiphase models applicable to star-forming clusters or galaxies as a whole.
