Using the updated oscillation spectrum of $\gamma$ Pegasi, we construct a set
of seismic models which reproduce two pulsational frequencies corresponding to
the $\ell=0$, p$_1$ and $\ell=1$, g$_1$ modes. Then, we single out models which
reproduce other well identified modes. Finally, we extend our seismic modelling
by a requirement of fitting also values of the complex, nonadiabatic parameter
$f$ associated to each mode frequency. Such complex asteroseismology of the
B-type pulsators provides a unique test of stellar metallicity and opacities.
In contrast to our previous studies, results for $\gamma$ Peg indicate that
both opacity tables, OPAL and OP, are equally preferred.
