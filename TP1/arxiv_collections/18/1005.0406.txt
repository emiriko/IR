A long phase coherent normal (N) wire between superconductors (S) is
characterized by a dense phase dependent Andreev spectrum . We probe this
spectrum in a high frequency phase biased configuration, by coupling an NS ring
to a multimode superconducting resonator. We detect a dc flux and frequency
dependent response whose dissipative and non dissipative components are related
by a simple Debye relaxation law with a characteristic time of the order of the
diffusion time through the N part of the ring. The flux dependence exhibits
$h/2e$ periodic oscillations with a large harmonics content at temperatures
where the Josephson current is purely sinusoidal. This is explained considering
that the populations of the Andreev levels are frozen on the time-scale of the
experiments.
