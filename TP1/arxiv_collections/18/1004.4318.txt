We present rest-frame optical images and spectra of the gravitationally
lensed, star-forming galaxy J0900+2234 (z=2.03). The observations were
performed with the newly commissioned LUCIFER1 near-infrared instrument mounted
on the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT). We fit lens models to the rest-frame
optical images and find the galaxy has an intrinsic effective radius of 7.4 kpc
with a lens magnification factor of about 5 for the A and B components. We also
discovered a new arc belonging to another lensed high-z source galaxy, which
makes this lens system a potential double Einstein ring system. Using the high
S/N rest-frame optical spectra covering H+K band, we detected Hbeta, OIII,
Halpha, NII and SII emission lines. Detailed physical properties of this high-z
galaxy were derived. The extinction towards the ionized HII regions (E_g(B-V))
is computed from the flux ratio of Halpha and Hbeta and appears to be much
higher than that towards stellar continuum (E_s(B-V)), derived from the optical
and NIR broad band photometry fitting. The metallicity was estimated using N2
and O3N2 indices. It is in the range of 1/5-1/3 solar abundance, which is much
lower than the typical z~2 star-forming galaxies. From the flux ratio of SII
6717 and 6732, we found that the electron number density of the HII regions in
the high-z galaxy were >1000 cm^-3, consistent with other z~2 galaxies but much
higher than that in local HII regions. The star-formation rate was estimated
via the Halpha luminosity, after correction for the lens magnification, to be
about 365\pm69 Msun/yr. Combining the FWHM of Halpha emission lines and the
half-light radius, we found the dynamical mass of the lensed galaxy is
5.8\pm0.9x10^10 Msun. The gas mass is 5.1\pm1.1x10^10~Msun from the H\alpha
flux surface density by using global Kennicutt-Schmidt Law, indicating a very
high gas fraction of 0.79\pm0.19 in J0900+2234.
