Gamma-ray bursts have the potential to produce the particle energies (up to
$10^{21}$\,eV) and the energy budget ($10^{44}\, \rm{erg\, yr^{-1}\,
Mpc^{-3}}$) to accommodate the spectrum of the highest energy cosmic rays; on
the other hand, there is no observational evidence that they accelerate
hadrons. The Fermi GST recently observed two bursts that exhibit a power-law
high-energy extension of the typical (Band) photon spectrum that extends to
$\sim 30$ GeV. On the basis of fireball phenomenology we argue that they, along
with GRB941017 observed by EGRET in 1994, show indirect evidence for
considerable baryon loading. Since the detection of neutrinos is the only
unambiguous way to establish that GRBs accelerate protons, we use two methods
to estimate the neutrino flux produced when they interact with fireball photons
to produce charged pions and neutrinos. While the number of events expected
from the Fermi bursts detected to date is small, we conclude that an event like
GRB941017 will be detected by the IceCube neutrino telescope if gamma-ray
bursts are indeed the sources of the observed cosmic rays.
