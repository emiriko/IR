Quantum uncertainty is described here in two guises: indeterminacy with its
concomitant indeterminism of measurement outcomes, and fuzziness, or
unsharpness. Both features were long seen as obstructions of experimental
possibilities that were available in the realm of classical physics. The birth
of quantum information science was due to the realization that such
obstructions can be turned into powerful resources. Here we review how the
utilization of quantum fuzziness makes room for a notion of approximate joint
measurement of noncommuting observables. We also show how from a classical
perspective quantum uncertainty is due to a limitation of measurability
reflected in a fuzzy event structure -- all quantum events are fundamentally
unsharp.
