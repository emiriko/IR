A new algorithm for calculating the spin- and parity-dependent shell model
nuclear level densities using the moments method in the proton-neutron
formalism is presented. A new, parallelized code based on this algorithm was
developed and tested using up to 4000 cores for a set of nuclei from the sd-,
pf-, and pf + g9/2 - model spaces. By comparing the nuclear level densities at
low excitation energy for a given nucleus calculated in two model spaces, such
as pf and pf + g9/2, one could estimate the ground state energy in the larger
model space, which is not accessible to direct shell model calculations due to
the unmanageable dimension. Examples for the ground state energies of for 64Ge
and 68Se in the pf + g9/2 model space are presented.
