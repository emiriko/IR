In recent articles, the investigation of atomic bases in cluster algebras
associated to affine quivers led the second-named author to introduce a variety
called transverse quiver Grassmannian and the first-named and third-named
authors to consider the smooth loci of quiver Grassmannians. In this paper, we
prove that, for any affine quiver Q, the transverse quiver Grassmannian of an
indecomposable representation M is the set of points N in the quiver
Grassmannian of M such that Ext^1(N,M/N)=0. As a corollary we prove that the
transverse quiver Grassmannian coincides with the smooth locus of the
irreducible components of minimal dimension in the quiver Grassmannian.
