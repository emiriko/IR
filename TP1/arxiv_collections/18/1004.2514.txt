Fundamental topological phenomena in condensed matter physics are associated
with a quantized electromagnetic response in units of fundamental constants.
Recently, it has been predicted theoretically that the time-reversal invariant
topological insulator in three dimensions exhibits a topological
magnetoelectric effect quantized in units of the fine structure constant
$\alpha=e^2/\hbar c$. In this work, we propose an optical experiment to
directly measure this topological quantization phenomenon, independent of
material details. Our proposal also provides a way to measure the
half-quantized Hall conductances on the two surfaces of the topological
insulator independently of each other.
