We present the observation of an efficient mechanism for positron sticking to
surfaces termed here Auger mediated quantum sticking. In this process the
energy associated with the positrons transition from an unbound scattering
state to a bound image potential state is coupled to a valence electron which
can then have sufficient energy to leave the surface. Compelling evidence for
this mechanism is found in a narrow secondary electron peak observed at
incident positron kinetic energies well below the electron work function.
