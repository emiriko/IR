The evolution of encryption algorithms have led to the development of very
complicated and highly versatile algorithms that sacrifice efficiency for
better and harder to decrypt results. But by the application of a genetic
schema to the encryption of data, a new structure can be created. Genetic
methods and procedures are lethal in the way they handle and manipulate data.
The RAmM algorithm uses four genetic operations that have been developed
specifically for encryption of data. The operations are Replication,
Augmentation, Mutation and Multiplication. The proper application of these
methods according to the rules that have been found to be the best for getting
optimal and correct results produces a "fingerprint" that is unique to a pair
of <data , key>. This means that every single data entry can only be decrypted
by using the correct set of key. The application of the RAmM algorithm is in
the field of image encryption and restoration. The boundary and the pixel
values are separately encrypted to produce a very genuine sequence that is
never understood to be an image. The beauty of the procedure is that the entire
image can be reproduced without any color loss or loss of pixel quality.
