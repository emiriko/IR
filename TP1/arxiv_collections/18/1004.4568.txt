We review some applications of self-consistent Green's function theory to
studies of one- and two-nucleon structure in finite nuclei.
  Large-scale microscopic calculations that employ realistic nuclear forces are
now possible. Effects of long-range correlations are seen to play a dominant
role in determining the quenching of absolute spectroscopic factors. They also
enhance considerably (e,e'pn) cross sections in superparallel kinematics, in
agreement with observations.
