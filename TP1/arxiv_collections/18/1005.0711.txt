We investigate the properties of a three-leg quantum spin tube using several
techniques such as the density matrix renormalization group method, strong
coupling approaches and the non linear sigma model. For integer spins S, the
model proves to exhibit a particularly rich phase diagram consisting of an
ensemble of 2S phase transitions. They can be accurately identified by the
behavior of a non local string order parameter associated to the breaking of a
hidden symmetry in the Hamiltonian. The nature of these transitions are further
elucidated within the different approaches. We carry a detailed DMRG analysis
in the specific cases S = 1. The numerical data confirm the existence of two
Haldane phases with broken hidden symmetry separated by a trivial singlet
state. The study of the gap and of the von Neumann entropy suggest a first
order phase transition but at the close proximity of a tricritical point
separating a gapless and a first order transition line in the phase diagram of
the quantum spin tube.
