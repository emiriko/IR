QCD sum rules are analyzed with the help of the Maximum Entropy Method. We
develop a new technique based on the Bayesion inference theory, which allows us
to directly obtain the spectral function of a given correlator from the results
of the operator product expansion given in the deep euclidean 4-momentum
region. The most important advantage of this approach is that one does not have
to make any a priori assumptions about the functional form of the spectral
function, such as the "pole + continuum" ansatz that has been widely used in
QCD sum rule studies, but only needs to specify the asymptotic values of the
spectral function at high and low energies as an input. As a first test of the
applicability of this method, we have analyzed the sum rules of the rho-meson,
a case where the sum rules are known to work well. Our results show a clear
peak structure in the region of the experimental mass of the rho-meson. We thus
demonstrate that the Maximum Entropy Method is successfully applied and that it
is an efficient tool in the analysis of QCD sum rules.
