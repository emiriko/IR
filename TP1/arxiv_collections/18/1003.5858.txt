We investigate the dynamical formation of crystalline states with systems of
polar molecules or Rydberg atoms loaded into a deep optical lattice. External
fields in these systems can be used to couple the atoms or molecules between
two internal states: one that is weakly interacting and one that exhibits a
strong dipole-dipole interaction. By appropriate time variation of the external
fields, we show that it is possible to produce crystalline states of the
strongly interacting states with high filling fractions chosen via the
parameters of the coupling. We study the coherent dynamics of this process in
one dimension (1D) using a modified form of the time-evolving block decimation
(TEBD) algorithm, and obtain crystalline states for system sizes and parameters
corresponding to realistic experimental configurations. For polar molecules
these crystalline states will be long-lived, assisting in a characterization of
the state via the measurement of correlation functions. We also show that as
the coupling strength increases in the model, the crystalline order is broken.
This is characterized in 1D by a change in density-density correlation
functions, which decay to a constant in the crystalline regime, but show
different regions of exponential and algebraic decay for larger coupling
strengths.
