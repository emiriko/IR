We study a special classical current in the O(3) Gross-Neveu model that
becomes supersymmetric when quantum anomalies are included. Following its
definition, we generalize the current for the general case, the O(N)
Gross-Neveu models. We compute its algebra and discuss the possibility of
supersymmetry can be established for these models.
