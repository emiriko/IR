We study the back-action of a nearby measurement device on electrons
undergoing coherent transfer via adiabatic passage (CTAP) in a triple-well
system. The measurement is provided by a quantum point contact capacitively
coupled to the middle well, thus acting as a detector sensitive to the charge
configuration of the triple-well system. We account for this continuous
measurement by treating the whole {triple-well + detector} as a closed quantum
system. This leads to a set of coupled differential equations for the density
matrix of the enlarged system which we solve numerically. This approach allows
to study a single realization of the measurement process while keeping track of
the detector output, which is especially relevant for experiments. In
particular, we find the emergence of a new peak in the distribution of
electrons that passed through the point contact. As one increases the coupling
between the middle potential well and the detector, this feature becomes more
prominent and is accompanied by a substantial drop in the fidelity of the CTAP
scheme.
