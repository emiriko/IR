We use the SPIRE Fourier-Transform Spectrometer (FTS) on-board the ESA
Herschel Space Telescope to analyse the submillimetre spectrum of the
Ultra-compact HII region G29.96-0.02. Spectral lines from species including
13CO, CO, [CI], and [NII] are detected. A sparse map of the [NII] emission
shows at least one other HII region neighbouring the clump containing the
UCHII. The FTS spectra are combined with ISO SWS and LWS spectra and fluxes
from the literature to present a detailed spectrum of the source spanning three
orders of magnitude in wavelength. The quality of the spectrum longwards of 100
{\mu}m allows us to fit a single temperature greybody with temperature
80.3\pm0.6K and dust emissivity index 1.73\pm0.02, an accuracy rarely obtained
with previous instruments. We estimate a mass of 1500 Msol for the clump
containing the HII region. The clump's bolometeric luminosity of 4 x 10^6 Lsol
is comparable to, or slightly greater than, the known O-star powering the UCHII
region.
