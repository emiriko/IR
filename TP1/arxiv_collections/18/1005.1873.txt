The 14N(p, \gamma)15O reaction is the slowest reaction of the
carbon-nitrogen-oxygen cycle of hydrogen burning in stars. As a consequence, it
determines the rate of the cycle. The 15N(p, \alpha \gamma)12C reaction is
frequently used in inverse kinematics for hydrogen depth profiling in
materials. The 14N(p, \gamma)15O and 15N(p, \alpha \gamma)12C reactions have
been studied simultaneously, using titanium nitride targets of natural isotopic
composition and a proton beam. The strengths of the resonances at Ep = 1058 keV
in 14N(p, \gamma)15O and at Ep = 897 and 430 keV in 15N(p, \alpha \gamma)12C
have been determined with improved precision, relative to the well-known
resonance at Ep = 278 keV in 14N(p, \gamma)15O. The new recommended values are
\omega \gamma = 0.353$\pm$0.018, 362$\pm$20, and 21.9$\pm$1.0 eV for their
respective strengths. In addition, the branching ratios for the decay of the Ep
= 1058 keV resonance in 14N(p, \gamma)15O have been redetermined. The data
reported here should facilitate future studies of off-resonant capture in the
14N(p, \gamma)15O reaction that are needed for an improved R-matrix
extrapolation of the cross section. In addition, the data on the 430 keV
resonance in 15N(p, \alpha \gamma)12C may be useful for hydrogen depth
profiling.
