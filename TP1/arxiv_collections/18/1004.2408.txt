We study how stable excited many-body states of the Bose-Hubbard model,
including both the gas-like state for strongly attractive bosons and bound
cluster state for repulsive bosons, can be produced with cold bosonic atoms in
an one-dimensional optical lattice. Starting from the initial ground states of
strongly interacting bosonic systems, we can achieve stable excited states of
the systems with opposite interaction strength by suddenly switching the
interaction to the opposite limit. By exactly solving dynamics of the
Bose-Hubbard model, we demonstrate that the produced excited state can be a
very stable dynamic state. This allows the experimental study of excited state
properties of ultracold atoms system in optical lattices.
