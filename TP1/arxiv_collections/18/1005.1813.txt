Full quantum statistical $NVT$ simulation of the five-particle system H$_3^+$
has been carried out using the path integral Monte Carlo method. Structure and
energetics is evaluated as a function of temperature up to the thermal
dissociation limit. The weakly density dependent dissociation temperature is
found to be around $4000$ K. Contributions from the quantum dynamics and
thermal motion are sorted out by comparing differences between simulations with
quantum and classical nuclei. The essential role of the quantum description of
the protons is established.
