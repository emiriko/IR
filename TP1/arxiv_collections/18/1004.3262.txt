The science of versification and analysis of verse in Sanskrit is governed by
rules of metre or chandas. Such metre-wise classification of verses has
numerous uses for scholars and researchers alike, such as in the study of poets
and their style of Sanskrit poetical works. This paper presents a comprehensive
computational scheme and set of algorithms to identify the metre of verses
given as Sanskrit (Unicode) or English E-text (Latin Unicode). The paper also
demonstrates the use of euphonic conjunction rules to correct verses in which
these conjunctions, which are compulsory in verse, have erroneously not been
implemented.
