I review how the determination of quark masses from lattice QCD can be used
to study textures in quark mass matrices. This type of theory relates quark
masses to CKM matrix elements. I demonstrate how the recent precision results
from the HPQCD and MILC collaborations for quark masses can be used to test
some of these ideas.
