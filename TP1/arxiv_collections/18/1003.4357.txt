We study the optical properties of a two-axis galvanometric optical scanner
constituted by a pair of rotating planar mirrors, focusing our attention on the
transformation induced on the polarization state of the input beam. We obtain
the matrix that defines the transformation of the propagation direction of the
beam and the Jones matrix that defines the transformation of the polarization
state. Both matrices are expressed in terms of the rotation angles of two
mirrors. Finally, we calculate the parameters of the general rotation in the
Poincare' sphere that describes the change of polarization state for each
mutual orientation of the mirrors.
