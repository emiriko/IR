We consider the effect of mobile ions on the applied potential needed to
reorient a lamellar system of two different materials placed between two planar
electrodes. The reorientation occurs from a configuration parallel to the
electrodes favored by surface interactions to an orientation perpendicular to
the electrodes favored by the electric field. The system consists of
alternating A and B layers with different dielectric constants. The mobile ions
are assumed to be insoluble in the B layers and hence confined to the A layers.
We find that the ions reduce the needed voltage most strongly when they are
constrained such that each A lamella is electrically neutral. In this case, a
macroscopic separation of charge and its concomitant lowering of free energy,
is attained only in the perpendicular orientation. When the ions are free to
move between different A layers, such that charge neutrality is only required
globally, their effect is smaller and depends upon the preferred surface
interaction of the two materials. Under some conditions, the addition of ions
can actually stabilize the parallel configuration. Our predictions are relevant
to recent experiments conducted on lamellar phases of diblock copolymer films
with ionic selective impurities.
