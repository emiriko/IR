We use spatial and non spatial models to argue that competition alone may
explain why two influenza strains do not usually coexist. The more virulent
strain is likely to crowd out the less virulent one. This can be seen as a
consequence of the Exclusion Principle of Ecology. We exhibit, however, a
spatial model for which coexistence is possible.
