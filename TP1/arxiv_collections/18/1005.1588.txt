A numerical method for the computation of the magnetic flux in the vacuum
surrounding the plasma in a Tokamak is investigated. It is based on the
formulation of a Cauchy problem which is solved through the minimization of an
energy error functional. Several numerical experiments are conducted which show
the efficiency of the method.
