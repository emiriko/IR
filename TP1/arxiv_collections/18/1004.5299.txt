We discuss phases in dense hadronic and quark matter from chiral model
approaches. Within PNJL models the phase diagram for various number of colors
$N_c$ is studied. How phases are constrained in quantum field theories are also
discussed along with the anomaly matching. An exotic phase with unbroken center
symmetry of chiral group has a characteristic feature in the thermodynamics,
which can be interpreted as one realization of the quarkyonic phase in QCD for
$N_c=3$.
