We report on the low frequency noise in the ballistic point-contacts between
a silver tip and a niobium foil. The ballistic nature of the point-contacts is
confirmed by Andreev reflection spectroscopy at low bias voltage with the Nb
foil cooled below its superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$). We find
that the voltage dependence of the low frequency noise differs for different
point-contacts with varying contact resistances. At high bias voltages, random
two level fluctuations appear and dominate over the background $1/f$ noise.
From analysis of the Andreev reflection spectra, we show that such two level
fluctuators may give rise to depairing of the superconducting order parameter.
