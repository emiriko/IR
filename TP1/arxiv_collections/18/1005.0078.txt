Two proper polynomial maps $f_1, \,f_2 \colon \mC^n \lr \mC^n$ are said to be
\emph{equivalent} if there exist $\Phi_1,\, \Phi_2 \in \textrm{Aut}(\mC^n)$
such that $f_2=\Phi_2 \circ f_1 \circ \Phi_1$. In this article we investigate
proper polynomial maps of topological degree $d \geq 2$ up to equivalence. In
particular we describe some of our recent results in the case $n=2$ and we
partially extend them in higher dimension.
