We analyzed two XMM-Newton observations of the bright atoll source 4U
1705-44, which can be considered a prototype of the class of the persistent NS
LMXBs showing both hard and soft states. The first observation was performed
when the source was in a hard low flux state, the second during a soft,
high-flux state. Both the spectra show broad iron emission lines. We fit the
spectra using a two-component model, together with a reflection model
specifically suited to the case of a neutron star, where the incident spectrum
has a blackbody shape. In the soft state, the reflection model, convolved with
a relativistic smearing component, consistently describes the broad features
present in the spectrum, and we find a clear relation between the temperature
of the incident flux and the temperature of the harder X-ray component that we
interpret as the boundary layer emission. In this state we find converging
evidence that the boundary layer outer radius is ~ 2 times the neutron star
radius. In the low flux state, we observe a change in the continuum shape of
the spectrum with respect to the soft state. Still, the broad local emission
features can be associated with a disk reflecting matter, but in a lower
ionization state, and possibly produced in an accretion disk truncated at
greater distance. Our analysis provides strong evidence that the reflection
component in soft states of LMXBs comes from to hard X-ray thermal irradiation,
which we identify with the boundary layer emission, also present in the
continuum model. In the hard state, the broad iron line if also produced by
reflection, and the continuum disk emission can be self-consistently accounted
if the disk is truncated at a greater distance than the soft state.
