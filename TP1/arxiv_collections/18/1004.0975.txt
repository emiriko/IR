Lightly triggered events may yield surprises about the nature of "soft"
particle production at LHC energies. I suggest that event displays in
coordinates matched to the dynamics of particle production (rapidity and
transverse momentum) may help sharpen intuition, identify interesting classes
of events, and test expectations about the underlying event that accompanies
hard-scattering phenomena.
