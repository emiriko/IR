The Kepler space mission, successfully launched in March 2009, is providing
continuous, high-precision photometry of thousands of stars simultaneously. The
uninterrupted time-series of stars of all known pulsation types are a precious
source for asteroseismic studies. The Kepler data do not provide information on
the physical parameters, such as effective temperature, surface gravity,
metallicity, and vsini, which are crucial for successful asteroseismic
modelling. Additional ground-based time-series data are needed to characterize
mode parameters in several types of pulsating stars. Therefore, ground-based
multi-colour photometry and mid/high-resolution spectroscopy are needed to
complement the space data. We present ground-based activities within KASC on
selected asteroseismic Kepler targets of several pulsation types.
