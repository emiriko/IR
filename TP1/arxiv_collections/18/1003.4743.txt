The CREAM calorimeter, designed to measure the spectra of cosmic-ray nuclei
from under 1 TeV to 1000 TeV, is a 20 radiation length (X0) deep sampling
calorimeter. The calorimeter is comprised of 20 layers of tungsten interleaved
with 20 layers of scintillating fiber ribbons, and is preceded by a pair of
graphite interaction targets providing about 0.42 proton interaction lengths
(\lambda int). The calorimeter was placed in one of CERN's SPS accelerator
beams for calibration and testing. Beams of 150 GeV electrons were used for
calibration, and a variety of electron, proton, and nuclear fragment beams were
used to test the simulation model of the detector. In this paper we discuss the
performance of the calorimeter in the electron beam and compare electron beam
data with simulation results.
