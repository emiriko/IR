We construct Super-Eddington Slim Disks models around both stellar and
super-massive black holes by allowing the formation of a porous layer with a
reduced effective opacity. We show that at high accretion rates, the inner part
of the disks become radiation pressure dominated. However, unlike the standard
scenario in which the disks become thick, super-Eddington disks remain slim. In
addition, they accelerate a significant wind with a "thick disk" geometry. We
show that above about 1.5 times the standard critical mass accretion rate
(needed to release the Eddington luminosity), the net luminosity released is
above Eddington. At above about 5 times the standard critical rate, the central
BH accretes more than the Eddington accretion rate. Above about 20 m-dot_crit,
the disk remains slim but the wind becomes spherical, and the present model
breaks down.
