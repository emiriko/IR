A minimal Lorentz gauge gravity model with R^2-type Lagrangian is proposed.
In the absence of torsion the model admits a topological phase with unfixed
metric. The model possesses a minimal set of dynamical degrees of freedom for
the torsion. Remarkably, the torsion has the same number of dynamical of-shell
degrees of freedom as the metric tensor. We trace an analogy between the
structure of the quantum chromodynamics and the structure of possible theory of
quantum gravity.
