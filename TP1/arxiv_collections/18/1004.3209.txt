Extensive numerical simulations were performed to investigate all stages of
modulation instability development from the initial pulse of pico-second
duration in photonic crystal fiber: quasi-solitons and dispersive waves
formation, their interaction stage and the further propagation. Comparison
between 4 different NLS-like systems was made: the classical NLS equation, NLS
system plus higher dispersion terms, NLS plus higher dispersion and
self-steepening and also fully generalized NLS equation with Raman scattering
taken into account. For the latter case a mechanism of energy transfer from
smaller quasi-solitons to the bigger ones is proposed to explain the dramatical
increase of rogue waves appearance frequency in comparison to the systems when
the Raman scattering is not taken into account.
