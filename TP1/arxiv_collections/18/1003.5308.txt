So far, GJ 710 is the only known star supposed to pass through outskirts of
the solar system within 1 ly. We have reexamined the SIMBAD database for
additional stellar candidates (from highest ratios of squared parallax to total
proper motion) and compared them with new HIP2 parallaxes and known radial
velocities. At the moment, the best nominee is double star HD 107914 in the
constellation Centaurus at $\approx$ 78.3 pc from the Sun whose principal
component is a white (A-type) giant. It does not seem to appear neither in
general catalogues of radial velocities available at SIMBAD nor in
authoritative Garcia-Sanchez et al. papers on stellar encounters with the solar
system. Awaiting for the value $v_r$ of its radial velocity, uknown to the
author, we have calculated limits of $|v_r|$ necessary to this star to pass
within 1 ly and 1 pc from the Sun in linear approximation. A very accurate
value of its total proper motion is also extremely important. In the case of
$v_r=-100$ km/s and most "advantageous" HIP2 data, HD 107914 could pass as near
as 8380 AU from the Sun in an almost direct collision course with the inner
part of the solar system! Inversely, if $v_r$ had a great positive value, then
HIP 60503 could be the creator of peculiar trajectories of detached
trans-Neptunian objects like Sedna.
