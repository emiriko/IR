We examine a moduli problem for real and quaternionic vector bundles on a
smooth complex projective curve with a fixed real structure, and we give a
gauge-theoretic construction of moduli spaces for semi-stable such bundles with
fixed topological type. These spaces embed onto connected subsets of real
points inside a complex projective variety. We relate our point of view to
previous work by Biswas, Huisman and Hurtubise (arxiv:0901.3071), and we use
this to study the Galois action induced on moduli varieties of stable
holomorphic bundles on a complex curve by a given real structure on the curve.
We show in particular a Harnack-type theorem, bounding the number of connected
components of the fixed-point set of that action by $2^g +1$, where $g$ is the
genus of the curve. In fact, taking into account all the topological invariants
of the real structure, we give an exact count of the number of connected
components, thus generalising to rank $r > 1$ the results of Gross and Harris
on the Picard scheme of a real algebraic curve.
