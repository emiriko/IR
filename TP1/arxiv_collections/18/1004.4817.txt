We calculate low-energy meson decay processes and pion-pion scattering
lengths in a globally chirally invariant two-flavour linear sigma model
exploring the quark content of the scalar mesons f(0)(600) and a(0)(980), as
well as f(0)(1370) and a(0)(1450). To this end, we investigate which one of
these sets of fields is more likely to contain quark-antiquark states.
