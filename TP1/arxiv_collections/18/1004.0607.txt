We examine a concrete realization of the quantum Weyl algebra and expand it
to first order. From here we apply the resulting algebra to a quantum harmonic
oscillator in its ground state and observe how a slightly noncommutative space
affects the physical system. The main result is, similar to a free particle a
magnetic field appears, but a new observation is that a dissipative term
appears in the perturbed Hamiltonian as well.
