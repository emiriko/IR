We propose a two-temperature radial inflow-outflow model near Sgr A* with
self-consistent feeding and conduction. Stellar winds from individual stars are
considered to find the rates of mass injection and energy injection. These
source terms help to partially eliminate the boundary conditions on the inflow.
Electron thermal conduction is crucial for inhibiting the accretion. Energy
diffuses out from several gravitational radii, unbinding more gas at several
arcseconds and limiting the accretion rate to <1% of Bondi rate. We
successfully fit the X-Ray surface brightness profile found from the extensive
Chandra observations and reveal the X-Ray point source in the center. The
super-resolution technique allows us to infer the presence and estimate the
unabsorbed luminosity $L\approx4\cdot10^{32}{\rm erg s^{-1}}$ of the point
source. The employed relativistic heat capacity and direct heating of electrons
naturally lead to low electron temperature $T_e\approx 4\cdot10^{10}$ K near
the black hole. Within the same model we fit 86 GHz optically thick emission
and obtain the order of magnitude agreement of Faraday rotation measure, thus
achieving a single accretion model suitable at all radii.
