Using the reduction of the string sigma model to the 1-d Neumann integrable
model we reconstruct the closed string solution with two equal spins in AdS_5
which is specified by the number of round arcs and one winding number. From the
string sigma model itself as well as its reducion to the Neumann-Rosochatius
system we construct a spiky string solution with two unequal spins in AdS_5
whose ratio is fixed and derive its energy-spin relation. The string
configuration is characterized by the number of spikes and two equal winding
numbers associated with the two rotating angular directions.
