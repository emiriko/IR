We present a new three-dimensional general relativistic hydrodynamics code,
the Whisky code. This code incorporates the expertise developed over the past
years in the numerical solution of Einstein equations and of the hydrodynamics
equations in a curved spacetime, and is the result of a collaboration of
several European Institutes. We here discuss the ability of the code to carry
out long-term accurate evolutions of the linear and nonlinear dynamics of
isolated relativistic stars.
