In a previous article a relationship was established between the linearized
metrics of General Relativity associated with geodesics and the Dirac Equation
of quantum mechanics. In this paper the extension of that result to arbitrary
curves is investigated. In the case of scalar fields, a relationship between
mass and temperature is also worked out.
