A simple analytical expression for the electric dipole polarizability of the
three-hadron bound system having only one stable bound state has been derived
neglecting by the higher orbital components of the off-shell three-body
transition matrix at the energy of the bound state. As a case in point, we have
estimated the electric dipole polarizability of the triton, using a cluster
triton wave function and the Hulthen potential to describe the related p-n and
n-d bound states.
