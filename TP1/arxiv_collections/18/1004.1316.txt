We assess quantum non-locality of multiparty entangled thermal states by
studying, quantitatively, both tripartite and quadripartite states belonging to
the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ), W and linear cluster-state classes and
showing violation of relevant Bell-like inequalities. We discuss the conditions
for maximizing the degree of violation against the local thermal character of
the states and the inefficiency of the detection apparatuses. We demonstrate
that such classes of multipartite entangled states can be made to last quite
significantly, notwithstanding adverse operating conditions. This opens up the
possibility for coherent exploitation of multipartite quantum channels made out
of entangled thermal states. Our study is accompanied by a detailed description
of possible generation schemes for the states analyzed.
