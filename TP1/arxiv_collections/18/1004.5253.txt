Various possibilities are currently under discussion to explain the observed
weakness of the intrinsic magnetic field of planet Mercury. One of the possible
dynamo scenarios is a dynamo with feedback from the magnetosphere. Due to its
weak magnetic field Mercury exhibits a small magnetosphere whose subsolar
magnetopause distance is only about 1.7 Hermean radii. We consider the magnetic
field due to magnetopause currents in the dynamo region. Since the external
field of magnetospheric origin is antiparallel to the dipole component of the
dynamo field, a negative feedback results. For an alpha-omega-dynamo two
stationary solutions of such a feedback dynamo emerge, one with a weak and the
other with a strong magnetic field. The question, however, is how these
solutions can be realized. To address this problem, we discuss various
scenarios for a simple dynamo model and the conditions under which a steady
weak magnetic field can be reached. We find that the feedback mechanism
quenches the overall field to a low value of about 100 to 150 nT if the dynamo
is not driven too strongly.
