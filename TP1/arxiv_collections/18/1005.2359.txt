As a first step to understanding the role of molecular or chemical
polydispersity in self-assembly, we put forward a coarse-grained model that
describes the spontaneous formation of quasi-linear polymers in solutions
containing two self-assembling species. Our theoretical framework is based on a
two-component self-assembled Ising model in which the bidispersity is
parameterized in terms of the strengths of the binding free energies that
depend on the monomer species involved in the pairing interaction. Depending
upon the relative values of the binding free energies involved, different
morphologies of assemblies that include both components are formed, exhibiting
paramagnetic-, ferromagnetic- or anti ferromagnetic-like order,i.e., random,
blocky or alternating ordering of the two components in the assemblies.
Analyzing the model for the case of ferromagnetic ordering, which is of most
practical interest, we find that the transition from conditions of minimal
assembly to those characterized by strong polymerization can be described by a
critical concentration that depends on the concentration ratio of the two
species. Interestingly, the distribution of monomers in the assemblies is
different from that in the original distribution, i.e., the ratio of the
concentrations of the two components put into the system. The monomers with a
smaller binding free energy are more abundant in short assemblies and monomers
with a larger binding affinity are more abundant in longer assemblies. Under
certain conditions the two components congregate into separate supramolecular
polymeric species and in that sense phase separate. We find strong deviations
from the expected growth law for supramolecular polymers even for modest
amounts of a second component, provided it is chemically sufficiently distinct
from the main one.
