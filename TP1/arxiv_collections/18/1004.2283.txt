Based on the uniqueness and universality of gravity, it is clear that
theories with different dynamical exponents are related in the holographic
approach. Concretely, we construct an M-theory background from pure QCD dual
and show that a deformed $Sch_{6}^{4}$ geometry is obtained by compactification
from the same background. The deformed $Sch_{6}^{4}$ geometry is considered as
the geometrical realization of a four-dimensional nonrelativistic field theory.
Several aspects of this nonrelativistic field theory are studied in the
holographic picture.
