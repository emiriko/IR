We investigate a model for the shallow decay phases of Gamma-ray Burst (GRB)
afterglows discovered by Swift/XRT in the first hours following a GRB event. In
the context of the fireball scenario, we consider the possibility that
long-lived energy injection from a millisecond spinning, ultramagnetic neutron
star (magnetar) powers afterglow emission during this phase. We consider the
energy evolution in a relativistic shock subject to both radiative losses and
energy injection from a spinning down magnetar in spherical symmetry. We model
the energy injection term through magnetic dipole losses and discuss an
approximate treatment for the dynamical evolution of the blastwave. We obtain
an analytic solution for the energy evolution in the shock and associated
lightcurves. To fully illustrate the potential of our solution we calculate
lightcurves for a few selected X-ray afterglows observed by Swift and fit them
using our theoretical lightcurves. Our solution naturally describes in a single
picture the properties of the shallow decay phase and the transition to the
so-called normal decay phase. In particular, we obtain remarkably good fits to
X-ray afterglows for plausible parameters of the magnetar. Even though
approximate, our treatment provides a step forward with respect to previously
adopted approximations and provides additional support to the idea that a
millisecond spinning (1-3 ms), ultramagnetic (B$\sim 10^{14}-10^{15}$ G)
neutron star loosing spin energy through magnetic dipole radiation can explain
the luminosity, durations and shapes of X-ray GRB afterglows.
