We study phase transition in the ferromagnetic Potts model with invisible
states that are added as redundant states by mean-field calculation and Monte
Carlo simulation. Invisible states affect the entropy and the free energy,
although they do not contribute to the internal energy. The internal energy and
the number of degenerated ground states do not change, if invisible states are
introduced into the standard Potts model. A second-order phase transition takes
place at finite temperature in the standard $q$-state ferromagnetic Potts model
on two-dimensional lattice for $q=2,3$, and 4. However, our present model on
two-dimensional lattice undergoes a first-order phase transition with
spontaneous $q$-fold symmetry breaking ($q=2,3$, and 4) due to entropy effect
of invisible states. We believe that our present model is a fundamental model
for analysis of a first-order phase transition with spontaneous discrete
symmetry breaking.
