Weak measurements can provide a complete characterization of post-selected
ensembles, including the uncertainties of observables. Interestingly, the
average uncertainties for pure initial and final states are always zero,
suggesting the kind of complete knowledge that would allow a knowledge of past,
presence and future in the sense of Laplace's demon. However, the quantum
version actually describes cancellations of positive and negative uncertainties
made possible by the strangeness of weak values. In this paper, I take a closer
look at the relation between statistics and causality in quantum mechanics, in
an attempt to recover the traces of classical determinism in the statistical
relations of quantum measurement outcomes.
