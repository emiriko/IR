We model the immune surveillance of a pathogen which passes through $n$
immunologically distinct stages. The biological parameters of this system
induce a partial order on the stages, and this, in turn, determines which
stages will be subject to immune regulation. This corresponds to the system's
unique asymptotically stable fixed point.
