We describe and experimentally demonstrate a technique for deterministic
coupling between a photonic crystal (PC) nanocavity and single emitters. The
technique is based on in-situ scanning of a PC cavity over a sample and allows
the positioning of the cavity over a desired emitter with nanoscale resolution.
The power of the technique, which we term a Scanning Cavity Microscope (SCM),
is demonstrated by coupling the PC nanocavity to a single nitrogen vacancy (NV)
center in diamond, an emitter system that provides optically accessible
electron and nuclear spin qubits.
