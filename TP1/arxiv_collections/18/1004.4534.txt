The rectification of a single file of attracting particles subjected to a low
frequency ac drive is proposed as a working mechanism for particle shuttling in
an asymmetric narrow channel. Increasing the particle attraction results in the
file condensing, as signalled by the dramatic enhancement of the net particle
current. Magnitude and direction of the current become extremely sensitive to
the actual size of the condensate, which can then be made to shuttle between
two docking stations, transporting particles in one direction, with an
efficiency much larger than conventional diffusive models predict.
