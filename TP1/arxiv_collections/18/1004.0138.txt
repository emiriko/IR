In conformal field theory (CFT) on simply connected domains of the Riemann
sphere, the natural conformal symmetries under self-maps are extended, in a
certain way, to local symmetries under general conformal maps, and this is at
the basis of the powerful techniques of CFT. Conformal maps of simply connected
domains naturally have the structure of an infinite-dimensional groupoid, which
generalizes the finite-dimensional group of self-maps. We put a topological
structure on the space of conformal maps on simply connected domains, which
makes it into a topological groupoid. Further, we (almost) extend this to a
local manifold structure based on the infinite-dimensional Frechet topological
vector space of holomorphic functions on a given domain A. From this, we
develop the notion of conformal A-differentiability at the identity. Our main
conclusion is that quadratic differentials characterizing cotangent elements on
the local manifold enjoy properties similar to those of the holomorphic
stress-energy tensor of CFT; these properties underpin the local symmetries of
CFT. Applying the general formalism to CFT correlation functions, we show that
the stress-energy tensor is exactly such a quadratic differential. This is at
the basis of constructing the stress-energy tensor in conformal loop ensembles.
It also clarifies the relation between Cardy's boundary conditions for CFT on
simply connected domains, and the expression of the stress-energy tensor in
terms of metric variations.
