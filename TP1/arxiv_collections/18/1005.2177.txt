In the context of the evolution of large structures in the Universe, it is
unclear whether active galaxies are a phase which each galaxy undergoes, and
what is the importance of the evolution of black holes in their centers. Binary
black hole (BBH) systems could play a key role in our understanding of the
above question.
  We investigate the Caltech-Jodrell Bank flat-spectrum (CJF) sample for
evidence in favor of the merger-driven evolution scheme of active galaxies and
search tracer-systems of AGN evolution and possible indications of BBH
candidates. We discuss the validity and ambiguity of such indications and
formulate a set of selection criteria for the detection of such systems. We
conduct an extensive literature search for all available multi-wavelength
information, concentrating on the optical and infrared regime, in addition to
morphological information of the CJF sources. We analyze the statistics of this
sample, in terms of these properties.
  We find 1 ULIRG (Mrk 231) included in the CJF, prototype of a transitory
system. In total 28.6% of the CJF sources with z<0.4 are distorted or have a
companion. Given the unbiased sample used here, this provides strong evidence
for the ubiquity of the merger phenomenon in the context of active galaxies. We
find a correlation between the radio and the near-infrared luminosity for the
high-luminosity sources, interpreted in the context of the interplay between a
star-formation and AGN component. We find a connection between variability and
evolutionary transitory systems, as selected through their near-infrared
colors. We select 28 sources that trace the different evolution phases of an
AGN, as well as a number of the most promising BBH candidates. We find 4
sources with almost periodical variability in the optical and radio on similar
timescales.
