Since its inception in 2001, the science and technology of epitaxial graphene
on hexagonal silicon carbide has matured into a major international effort and
is poised to become the first carbon electronics platform. A historical
perspective is presented and the unique electronic properties of single and
multilayered epitaxial graphenes on electronics grade silicon carbide are
reviewed. Early results on transport and the field effect in Si-face grown
graphene monolayers provided proof-of-principle demonstrations. Besides
monolayer epitaxial graphene, attention is given to C-face grown multilayer
graphene, which consists of electronically decoupled graphene sheets.
Production, structure, and electronic structure are reviewed. The electronic
properties, interrogated using a wide variety of surface, electrical and
optical probes, are discussed. An overview is given of recent developments of
several device prototypes including resistance standards based on epitaxial
graphene quantum Hall devices and new ultrahigh frequency analog epitaxial
graphene amplifiers.
