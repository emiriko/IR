We report on experimental tests of the trend of random laserlinewidth versus
pumping power as predicted by an Haus master equation that is formally
identical to the one-dimensional Gross- Pitaevskii equation in an harmonic
potential. Experiments are done by employing picosecond pumped dispersions of
Titaniumdioxide particles in dye-doped methanol. The derivation of the master
equations is also detailed and shown to be in agreement with experiments
analytically predicting the value of the threshold linewidth.
