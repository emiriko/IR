We consider a four-dimensional PDE possessing partner symmetries mainly on
the example of complex Monge-Amp\`ere equation (CMA). We use simultaneously two
pairs of symmetries related by a recursion relation, which are mutually complex
conjugate for CMA. For both pairs of partner symmetries, using Lie equations,
we introduce explicitly group parameters as additional variables, replacing
symmetry characteristics and their complex conjugates by derivatives of the
unknown with respect to group parameters. We study the resulting system of six
equations in the eight-dimensional space, that includes CMA, four equations of
the recursion between partner symmetries and one integrability condition of
this system. We use point symmetries of this extended system for performing its
symmetry reduction with respect to group parameters that facilitates solving
the extended system. This procedure does not imply a reduction in the number of
physical variables and hence we end up with orbits of non-invariant solutions
of CMA, generated by one partner symmetry, not used in the reduction. These
solutions are determined by six linear equations with constant coefficients in
the five-dimensional space which are obtained by a three-dimensional Legendre
transformation of the reduced extended system. We present algebraic and
exponential examples of such solutions that govern Legendre-transformed
Ricci-flat K\"ahler metrics with no Killing vectors. A similar procedure is
briefly outlined for Husain equation.
