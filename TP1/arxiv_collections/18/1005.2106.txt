We consider quantum critical points (QCP) in which quantum fluctuations
associated with charge rather than magnetic order induce unconventional
metallic properties. Based on finite-T calculations on a two-dimensional
extended Hubbard model we show how the coherence scale T* characteristic of
Fermi liquid behavior of the homogeneous metal vanishes at the onset of charge
order. A strong effective mass enhancement reminiscent of heavy fermion
behavior indicates the possible destruction of quasiparticles at the QCP.
Experimental probes on quarter-filled layered organic materials are proposed
for unveiling the behavior of electrons across the quantum critical region.
