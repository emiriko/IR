The universe of potentially interesting, searchable literature is expanding
continuously. Besides the normal expansion, there is an additional influx of
literature because of interdisciplinary boundaries becoming more and more
diffuse. Hence, the need for accurate, efficient and intelligent search tools
is bigger than ever. Even with a sophisticated search engine, looking for
information can still result in overwhelming results. An overload of
information has the intrinsic danger of scaring visitors away, and any
organization, for-profit or not-for-profit, in the business of providing
scholarly information wants to capture and keep the attention of its target
audience. Publishers and search engine engineers alike will benefit from a
service that is able to provide visitors with recommendations that closely meet
their interests. Providing visitors with special deals, new options and
highlights may be interesting to a certain degree, but what makes more sense
(especially from a commercial point of view) than to let visitors do most of
the work by the mere action of making choices? Hiring psychics is not an
option, so a technological solution is needed to recommend items that a visitor
is likely to be looking for. In this presentation we will introduce such a
solution and argue that it is practically feasible to incorporate this approach
into a useful addition to any information retrieval system with enough usage.
