We study the interplay between proximity-induced superconductivity and
ferromagnetism in graphene by self-consistently solving the Bogoliubov-de
Gennes equations on the honeycomb lattice. We find that a strong triplet
proximity effect is generated in graphene, leading to odd-frequency pairing
correlations. These odd-frequency correlations are clearly manifested in the
local density of states of the graphene sheet, which can be probed via
STM-measurements. Motivated by recent experiments on S$\mid$N$\mid$S graphene
Josephson junctions, we also study the spectrum of Andreev-bound states formed
in the normal region due to the proximity effect. Our results may be useful for
interpreting spectroscopic data and can also serve as a guideline for future
experiments.
