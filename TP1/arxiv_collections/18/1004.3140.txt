Neutrino\antineutrino deep inelastic scattering (DIS) data provide useful
constrains for the flavor decomposition in global fits of parton distribution
functions (PDF). The smallness of the cross-sections requires the use of
nuclear targets in the experimental setup. Understanding the nuclear
corrections is, for this reason, of utmost importance for a precise
determination of the PDFs. Here, we explore the nuclear effects in the
neutrino\antineutrino-nucleon DIS by comparing the NuTeV, CDHSW, and CHORUS
cross-sections to the predictions derived from the latest parton distribution
functions and their nuclear modifications. We obtain a good description of
these data and find no apparent disagreement between the nuclear effects in
neutrino DIS and those in charged lepton DIS. These results also indicate that
further improvements in the knowledge of the nuclear PDFs could be obtained by
a more extensive use of these sets of neutrino data.
