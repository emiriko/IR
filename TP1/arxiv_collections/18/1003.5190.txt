Millisecond pulsars are rapidly rotating neutron stars where general
relativity plays a strong role in the propagation of light from the neutron
star to observer. The observed X-ray pulse shapes carry information on the
mass, radius and surface shape of the neutron star. Comparison of theoretical
calculations of pulse shapes with observed pulse shapes can give useful
constraints on neutron star properties. Then comparison with calculated
properties giving an assumed equation of state (EOS) can confirm or rule out
the assumed EOS.
