We report quantum degeneracy in a gas of ultra-cold fermionic $^{87}$Sr
atoms. By evaporatively cooling a mixture of spin states in an optical dipole
trap for 10.5\,s, we obtain samples well into the degenerate regime with
$T/T_F=0.26^{+.05}_{-.06}$. The main signature of degeneracy is a change in the
momentum distribution as measured by time-of-flight imaging, and we also
observe a decrease in evaporation efficiency below $T/T_F \sim 0.5$.
