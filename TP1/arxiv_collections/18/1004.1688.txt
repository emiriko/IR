We report the $^{75}$As-NQR and NMR studies on the iron arsenide
superconductor Li$_{x}$FeAs with $T_{\rm c} \sim 17$ K. The spin lattice
relaxation rate, $1/T_{1}$, decreases below $T_{\rm c}$ without a coherence
peak, and can be fitted by gaps with s$^{\pm}$-wave symmetry in the presence of
impurity scattering. In the normal state, both $1/T_{1}T$ and the Knight shift
decrease with decreasing temperature but become constant below $T \leq 50 K$.
Estimate of the Korringa ratio shows that the spin correlations are weaker than
that in other families of iron arsenides, which may account for the lower
$T_{\rm c}$ in this material.
