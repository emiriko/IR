We calculate the equation of state (EoS) of dense matter, using a
relativistic mean field (RMF) model with a density dependent coupling that is a
slightly modified form of the original NL3 interaction. For nonuniform nuclear
matter we approximate the unit lattice as a spherical Wigner-Seitz cell,
wherein the meson mean fields and nucleon Dirac wave functions are solved fully
self-consistently. We also calculate uniform nuclear matter for a wide range of
temperatures, densities, and proton fractions, and match them to non-uniform
matter as the density decreases. The calculations took over 6,000 CPU days in
Indiana University's supercomputer clusters. We tabulate the resulting EoS at
over 107,000 grid points in the proton fraction range $Y_P$ = 0 to 0.56. For
the temperature range $T$ = 0.16 to 15.8 MeV we cover the density range $n_B$ =
10$^{-4}$ to 1.6 fm$^{-3}$; and for the higher temperature range $T$ = 15.8 to
80 MeV we cover the larger density range $n_B$ = 10$^{-8}$ to 1.6 fm$^{-3}$. In
the future we plan to study low density, low temperature (T$<$15.8 MeV),
nuclear matter using a Virial expansion, and we will match the low density and
high density results to generate a complete EoS table for use in astrophysical
simulations of supernova and neutron star mergers.
