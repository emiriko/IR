The magnetic properties, the magnetostriction, and the magnetoelectric effect
in the d-electron free rare-earth aluminum borate TmAl$_3$(BO$_3$)$_4$ are
investigated between room temperature and 2 K. The magnetic susceptibility
reveals a strong anisotropy with the hexagonal c-axis as the hard magnetic
axis. Magnetostriction measurements show a large effect of an in-plane field
reducing both, the a- and c-axis lattice parameters. The magnetoelectric
polarization change in a- and c-directions reaches up to 300 $\mu$C/m$^2$ at 70
kOe with the field applied along the a-axis. The magnetoelectric polarization
is proportional to the lattice contraction in magnetic field. The results of
this investigation prove the existence of a significant coupling between the
rare earth magnetic moment and the lattice in $R$Al$_3$(BO$_3$)$_4$ compounds
($R$ = rare earth). They further show that the rare earth moment itself will
generate a large magnetoelectric effect which makes it easier to study and to
understand the origin of the magnetoelectric interaction in this class of
materials.
