The electronic properties of ultrathin crystals of molybdenum disulfide
consisting of N = 1, 2, ... 6 S-Mo-S monolayers have been investigated by
optical spectroscopy. Through characterization by absorption,
photoluminescence, and photoconductivity spectroscopy, we trace the effect of
quantum confinement on the material's electronic structure. With decreasing
thickness, the indirect band gap, which lies below the direct gap in the bulk
material, shifts upwards in energy by more than 0.6 eV. This leads to a
crossover to a direct-gap material in the limit of the single monolayer. Unlike
the bulk material, the MoS2 monolayer emits light strongly. The freestanding
monolayer exhibits an increase in luminescence quantum efficiency by more than
a factor of 1000 compared with the bulk material.
