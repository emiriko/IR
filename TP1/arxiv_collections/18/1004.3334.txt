We present a solution to the problem of understanding a system that produces
a sequence of temporally ordered observations. Our solution is based on
generating and interpreting a set of temporal decision rules. A temporal
decision rule is a decision rule that can be used to predict or retrodict the
value of a decision attribute, using condition attributes that are observed at
times other than the decision attribute's time of observation. A rule set,
consisting of a set of temporal decision rules with the same decision
attribute, can be interpreted by our Temporal Investigation Method for
Enregistered Record Sequences (TIMERS) to signify an instantaneous, an acausal
or a possibly causal relationship between the condition attributes and the
decision attribute. We show the effectiveness of our method, by describing a
number of experiments with both synthetic and real temporal data.
