Dissipative effects on a microscopic level are included in the Schr\"odinger
equation. When the decay between different local levels as a result of the
coupling to a bath, the Schr\"odinger equation no longer conserves energy, but
the probability of the states is conserved. The procedure is illustrated with
several examples that include direct electronic decay and damping of local
phonons (vibrational levels). This method significantly reduces the
calculational effort compared to conventional density matrix techniques.
