Using first-principles calculations within generalized gradient
approximation, the electronic and magnetic properties of zinc blende (zb)
CrP/MnP superlattice are investigated. The equilibrium lattice constant is
calculated to be $5.33\,$\AA. The stability of ferromagnetic zb CrP/MnP
superlattice against antiferromagnetism is considered and it is found that the
ferromagnetic CrP/MnP superlattice is more stable than the antiferromagnetic
one. It is shown that at the equilibrium lattice constant the CrP/MnP
superlattice does not show any half metallicity mainly due to the minority
$t_{2g}$ states of Cr and Mn. However, if strain is imposed on the CrP/MnP
superlattice then the minority $t_{2g}$ electrons shift to higher energies and
the proposed superlattice becomes a half-metal ferromagnet. The effect of
tetragonal and orthorhombic distortions on the half metallicity of zb CrP/MnP
superlattice is also discussed. It is also shown that InP-CrP/MnP/InP is a true
half-metal ferromagnet. The half metallicity and magnetization of these
superlattices are robust against tetragonal/ orthorhombic deformation.
