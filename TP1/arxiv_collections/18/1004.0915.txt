We introduce a method to analyze the effect of hybridization by shifting
corresponding atomic levels using external potentials. Based on this approach,
we study perovskite ruthenates,\ and unambiguously identify that the covalency
between the \textit{A}-site cation and O ion will modify the Ru-O hybridization
and change the density of state at Fermi level, consequently affect the
magnetic properties significantly. We also study the effect of pressure and
reveal that hydrostatic pressure has a small effect on the Ru-O-Ru bond angle
of SrRuO$_{3}$, while it will decrease the Ru-O length and increase the band
width significantly. Therefore, the magnetic ordering temperature will decrease
monotonically with pressure.
