The search for physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM) is one of the most
important goals for the general purpose detector ATLAS at the Large Hadron
Collider at CERN. We review some of the current strategies to search for
generic SUSY models with R-parity conservation in channels with jets, leptons
and missing transverse energy for an integrated luminosity of L = 200 pb-1 at a
centre-of-mass energy s = 10 TeV. Only a selection of the results is presented
with a focus on the discovery potential for inclusive searches. The discovery
reach for a centre-of-mass energy of s = 7 TeV and an integrated luminosity of
L = 1 f b-1 is expected to be similar to the one discussed in this note.
