In this paper, we compare two analytical models for evaluation of cache
coherence overhead of a shared bus multiprocessor with private caches. The
models are based on a closed queuing network with different service
disciplines. We find that the priority discipline can be used as a lower-level
bound. Some numerical results are shown graphically.
