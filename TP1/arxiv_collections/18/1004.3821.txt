We give a new, elementary proof of a key inequality used by Rudelson in the
derivation of his well-known bound for random sums of rank-one operators. Our
approach is based on Ahlswede and Winter's technique for proving operator
Chernoff bounds. We also prove a concentration inequality for sums of random
matrices of rank one with explicit constants.
