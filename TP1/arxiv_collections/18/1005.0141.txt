The structure of relativistic radiation mediated shocks (RRMS) propagating
into a cold electron-proton plasma is calculated and analyzed. A qualitative
discussion of the physics of relativistic and non relativistic shocks,
including order of magnitude estimates for the relevant temperature and length
scales, is presented. Detailed numerical solutions are derived for shock
Lorentz factors $\Gamma_u$ in the range $6\le\Gamma_u\le30$, using a novel
iteration technique solving the hydrodynamics and radiation transport equations
(the protons, electrons and positrons are argued to be coupled by collective
plasma processes and are treated as a fluid). The shock transition
(deceleration) region, where the Lorentz factor $ \Gamma $ drops from $
\Gamma_u $ to $ \sim 1 $, is characterized by high plasma temperatures $ T\sim
\Gamma m_ec^2 $ and highly anisotropic radiation, with characteristic
shock-frame energy of upstream and downstream going photons of a few~$\times\,
m_ec^2$ and $\sim \Gamma^2 m_ec^2$, respectively.Photon scattering is dominated
by e$^\pm$ pairs, with pair to proton density ratio reaching
$\approx10^2\Gamma_u$. The width of the deceleration region, in terms of
Thomson optical depths for upstream going photons, is large,
$\Delta\tau\sim\Gamma_u^2$ ($\Delta\tau\sim1$ neglecting the contribution of
pairs) due to Klein Nishina suppression of the scattering cross section. A high
energy photon component, narrowly beamed in the downstream direction, with a
nearly flat power-law like spectrum, $\nu I_\nu\propto\nu^0$, and an energy
cutoff at $ \sim \Gamma_u^2 m_ec^2 $ carries a fair fraction of the energy flux
at the end of the deceleration region. An approximate analytic model of RRMS,
reproducing the main features of the numerical results, is provided.
