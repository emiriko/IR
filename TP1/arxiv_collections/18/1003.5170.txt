The dynamics of the Luttinger model after a quantum quench is studied. We
compute in detail one and two-point correlation functions for two types of
quenches: from a non-interacting to an interacting Luttinger model and
vice-versa. In the former case, the non-interacting Fermi gas features in the
momentum distribution and other correlation functions are destroyed as time
evolves. In the infinite-time limit, equal-time correlations are power-laws but
the critical exponents are found to differ from their equilibrium values. In
all cases, we find that these correlations are well described by a generalized
Gibbs ensemble [M. Rigol et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 98, 050405 (2007)], which
assigns a momentum dependent temperature to each eigenmode.
