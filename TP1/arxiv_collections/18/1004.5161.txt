This paper considers influence of spinning electric field on statistics of
natural background gamma-radiation. The spinning electric field, shown as a
virtual gyroscope, has quantum mechanics characteristics. Interaction of the
virtual fermion-like gyroscope with bosons (gamma-quanta) results in lowering
intensity of the gamma-radiation and altering Poisson distribution. The
statistic of the observed phenomenon depends on the direction of rotation of
the virtual gyroscope. The results are discussed in a shade of spin-spin
interaction having regard to realizing thermodynamically profitable conditions.
Similarity of observed reduction of gamma-radiation in spinning electric fields
and that for mechanical rotation stresses a special role of rotation itself,
disregarding the matter of its carrier.
