Coupled quantum electrodynamics (QED) cavities have been recently proposed as
new systems to simulate a variety of equilibrium and non-equilibrium many-body
phenomena. We present a brief review of their main properties together with a
survey of the last developments of the field and some perspectives concerning
their experimental realizations and possible new theoretical directions.
