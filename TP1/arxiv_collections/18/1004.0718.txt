In this short note we review a recently found formulation of two-dimensional
causal quantum gravity defined through Causal Dynamical Triangulations and
stochastic quantization. This procedure enables one to extract the
nonperturbative quantum Hamiltonian of the random surface model including the
sum over topologies. Interestingly, the generally fictitious stochastic time
corresponds to proper time on the geometries.
