Error-free transmission (EFT) of quantum information is a crucial ingredient
in quantum communication network. To overcome the unavoidable decoherence in
noisy channel, to date, many efforts have focused on faithfully transmitting
one state by consuming large numbers of synchronized ancillary states. However,
huge demands of quantum resources are hard to meet with current technology,
thus restrict practical applications. Here we propose and demonstrate an
economical method of reliably transmitting quantum information. An arbitrary
unknown quantum state is converted into time bins deterministically in terms of
its own polarization using a modified Franson interferometer. Any arisen noise
in channel will induce an associated error to the reference frame of the time
bins, which can be utilized to reject errors and recover the initial state. By
virtue of state-independent feature, our method can be applied to entanglement
distribution. After passing through 0.8 km randomly twisted optical fiber, the
entanglement still survives and is verified. Our approach significantly
simplifies the implementation of quantum EFT and enables a general quantum
state even entanglement to be protected by feedback, thus can be used as a
basic building block in practical long-distance quantum communication network.
