The critical phase of bond percolation on the random growing tree is
examined. It is shown that the root cluster grows with the system size $N$ as
$N^\psi$ and the mean number of clusters with size $s$ per node follows a power
function $n_s \propto s^{-\tau}$ in the whole range of open bond probability
$p$. The exponent $\tau$ and the fractal exponent $\psi$ are also derived as a
function of $p$ and the degree exponent $\gamma$, and are found to satisfy the
scaling relation $\tau=1+\psi^{-1}$. Numerical results with several network
sizes are quite well fitted by a finite size scaling for a wide range of $p$
and $\gamma$, which gives a clear evidence for the existence of a critical
phase.
