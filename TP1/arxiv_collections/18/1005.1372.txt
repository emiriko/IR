We suggest new simple model of generating tiny neutrino masses through a
TeV-scale seesaw mechanism without requiring tiny Yukawa couplings. This model
is a simple extension of the standard model by introducing extra one Higgs
singlet, and one Higgs doublet with a tiny vacuum expectation value.
Experimental constraints, electroweak precision data and no large flavor
changing neutral currents, are satisfied since the extra doublet only has a
Yukawa interaction with lepton doublets and right-handed neutrinos, and their
masses are heavy of order a TeV-scale. Since active light neutrinos are
Majorana particles, this model predicts a neutrinoless double beta decay.
