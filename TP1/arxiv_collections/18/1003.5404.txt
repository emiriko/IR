We have performed scanning gate microscopy (SGM) on graphene field effect
transistors (GFET), using a biased metallic nanowire coated with a dielectric
layer as a contact mode tip and local top gate. Electrical transport through
graphene at various back gate voltages is monitored as a function of tip
voltage and tip position. Near the Dirac point, the dependence of graphene
resistance on tip voltage shows a significant variation with tip position. SGM
imaging reveals mesoscopic domains of electron-doped and hole-doped regions.
Our measurements indicate a substantial spatial fluctuation (on the order of
10^12/cm^2) in the carrier density in graphene due to extrinsic local doping.
Important sources for such doping found in our samples include metal contacts,
edges of graphene, structural defects, and resist residues.
