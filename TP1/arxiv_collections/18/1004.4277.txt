One of the main problems in all-optical packet-switched networks is the lack
of optical buffers, and one feasible technology for the constructions of
optical buffers is to use optical crossbar Switches and fiber Delay Lines
(SDL). In this two-part paper, we consider SDL constructions of optical queues
with a limited number of recirculations through the optical switches and the
fiber delay lines. Such a problem arises from practical feasibility
considerations. In Part I, we have proposed a class of greedy constructions for
certain types of optical queues, including linear compressors, linear
decompressors, and 2-to-1 FIFO multiplexers, and have shown that every optimal
construction among our previous constructions of these types of optical queues
under the constraint of a limited number of recirculations must be a greedy
construction. In Part II, the present paper, we further show that there are at
most two optimal constructions and give a simple algorithm to obtain the
optimal construction(s). The main idea in Part II is to use \emph{pairwise
comparison} to remove a sequence $\dbf_1^M\in \Gcal_{M,k}$ such that
$B(\dbf_1^M;k)<B({\dbf'}_1^M;k)$ for some ${\dbf'}_1^M\in \Gcal_{M,k}$. To our
surprise, the simple algorithm for obtaining the optimal construction(s) is
related to the well-known \emph{Euclid's algorithm} for finding the greatest
common divisor (gcd) of two integers. In particular, we show that if
$\gcd(M,k)=1$, then there is only one optimal construction; if $\gcd(M,k)=2$,
then there are two optimal constructions; and if $\gcd(M,k)\geq 3$, then there
are at most two optimal constructions.
