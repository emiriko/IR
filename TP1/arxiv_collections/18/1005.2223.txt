Models for the production of knowledge and systems of innovation and science
are key elements for characterizing a country in view of its scientific
thematic profile. With regard to scientific output and publication in journals
of international visibility, the countries of the world may be classified into
three main groups according to their thematic bias. This paper aims to classify
the countries of the world in several broad groups, described in terms of
behavioural models that attempt to sum up the characteristics of their systems
of knowledge and innovation. We perceive three clusters in our analysis: 1) the
biomedical cluster, 2) the basic science & engineering cluster, and 3) the
agricultural cluster. The countries are conceptually associated with the
clusters via Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and a Multidimensional Scaling
(MDS) map with all the countries is presented.
