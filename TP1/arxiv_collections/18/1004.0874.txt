We demonstrate how the ineluctable presence of thermal noise alters the
measurement of forces acting on microscopic and nanoscopic objects. We quantify
this effect exemplarily for a Brownian particle near a wall subjected to
gravitational and electrostatic forces. Our results demonstrate that the force
measurement process is prone to artifacts if the noise is not correctly taken
into account.
