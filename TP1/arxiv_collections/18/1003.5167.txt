In connection with the the thermalization problem in isolated quantum
systems, we investigate the dynamics following a quantum quench of the
sine-Gordon model in the Luther-Emery and the semiclassical limits. We consider
the quench from the gapped to the gapless phase as well as reversed one. By
obtaining analytic expressions for the one and two-point correlation functions
of the order parameter operator at zero-temperature, the manifestations of
integrability in the absence of thermalization in the sine-Gordon model are
studied. It is thus shown that correlations in the long time regime after the
quench are well described by a generalized Gibbs ensemble. We also consider the
case where the system is initially in contact with a reservoir at finite
temperature. The possible relevance of our results to current and future
experiments with ultracold atomic systems is also critically considered.
