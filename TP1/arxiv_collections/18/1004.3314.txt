In this note we reinvestigate the task of computing creative telescoping
relations in differential-difference operator algebras. Our approach is based
on an ansatz that explicitly includes the denominators of the delta parts. We
contribute several ideas of how to make an implementation of this approach
reasonably fast and provide such an implementation. A selection of examples
shows that it can be superior to existing methods by a large factor.
