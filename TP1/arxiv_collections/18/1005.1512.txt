The Tully-Fisher relation (TFR) represents a connection between fundamental
galaxy parameters, such as its total mass and the mass locked in stars.
Therefore, the study of the evolution of this relation in the optical and
infrared bands can provide valuable information about the evolution of the
individual galaxies through the changes found in each band. This work aims to
study the TFR at high redshift in the B, V, R, I, and K-bands by comparison
with the local relations derived from a large sample of galaxies in the
redshift range 0.1<z<0.3, processed in the same way, and with the same
instrumental constraints that the high-redshift sample. Using the large
photometric information available in the AEGIS database, we have studied the
best procedure to obtain reliable k-corrections. Instrumental magnitudes are
then k and extinction corrected and the absolute magnitudes derived, using the
concordance cosmological model. The rotational velocities have been obtained
from the widths of optical lines using DEEP2 spectra. Finally, morphology has
been determined via visual classification of the HST images. We detect
evolution in the B, V and R-band TFRs in the sense that galaxies were brighter
in the past for the same rotation velocity. The change in luminosity is more
noticeable in the bluer bands. This colour evolution, unnoticed in our previous
work (Fern\'andez Lorenzo et al. 2009) has been detected thanks to the more
reliable k-corrections carried out in this paper, which included photometry
from B to IRAC bands. The change in the (V-K) and (R-I) colours (for a fixed
velocity) could be interpreted as an ageing of the stellar populations as
consequence of the star formation decrease since z=1.25. In addition, we
conclude that spiral galaxies could have doubled their stellar masses in the
last 8.6 Gyr.
