We review the basic aspects of electrons in graphene (two-dimensional
graphite) exposed to a strong perpendicular magnetic field. One of its most
salient features is the relativistic quantum Hall effect the observation of
which has been the experimental breakthrough in identifying pseudo-relativistic
massless charge carriers as the low-energy excitations in graphene. The effect
may be understood in terms of Landau quantization for massless Dirac fermions,
which is also the theoretical basis for the understanding of more involved
phenomena due to electronic interactions. We present the role of
electron-electron interactions both in the weak-coupling limit, where the
electron-hole excitations are determined by collective modes, and in the
strong-coupling regime of partially filled relativistic Landau levels. In the
latter limit, exotic ferromagnetic phases and incompressible quantum liquids
are expected to be at the origin of recently observed (fractional) quantum Hall
states. Furthermore, we discuss briefly the electron-phonon coupling in a
strong magnetic field. Although the present review has a dominating theoretical
character, a close connection with available experimental observation is
intended.
