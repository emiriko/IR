The identification of the solar-like oscillation modes, as measured by
asteroseismology, is a necessary requirement in order to infer the physical
properties of the interior of the stars. Difficulties occur when a large number
of modes of oscillations with a low signal-to-noise ratio are observed. In
those cases, it is of common use to apply a likelihood-ratio test to
discriminate between the possible scenarios. We present here a statistical
analysis of the likelihood-ratio test and discuss its accuracy to identify the
correct modes. We use the AsteroFLAG artificial stars, simulated over a range
of magnitude, inclination angle, and rotation rate. We show that the
likelihood-ratio test is appropriate up to a certain magnitude (signal-to-noise
ratio).
