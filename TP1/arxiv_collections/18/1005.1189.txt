We propose an entanglement swapping of atomic states confined by cavities QED
using a photonic Faraday rotation. Two schemes are considered in which we use
three and four cavities, respectively, plus an additional circularly-polarized
photon. After interacting with an atom trapped inside the cavity the system
evolves to an entangled atom-photon state. The entanglement swapping is then
achieved by a Bell-state measurement upon the entire atom-photon state.
