We present experimental observation of electromagnetically induced
transparency (EIT) on a single macroscopic artificial "atom" (superconducting
quantum system) coupled to open 1D space of a transmission line. Unlike in a
optical media with many atoms, the single atom EIT in 1D space is revealed in
suppression of reflection of electromagnetic waves, rather than absorption. The
observed almost 100 % modulation of the reflection and transmission of
propagating microwaves demonstrates full controllability of individual
artificial atoms and a possibility to manipulate the atomic states. The system
can be used as a switchable mirror of microwaves and opens a good perspective
for its applications in photonic quantum information processing and other
fields.
