Spatially resolved tunneling spectroscopic studies of colossal
magnetoresistive (CMR) manganite $\rm La_{0.7}Ca_{0.3}MnO_3$ (LCMO) epitaxial
films on $\rm (LaAlO_3)_{0.3}(Sr_2AlTaO_6)_{0.7}$ substrate are investigated as
functions of temperature, magnetic field and spin polarization by means of
scanning tunneling spectroscopy. Systematic surveys of the tunneling spectra
taken with Pt/Ir tips reveal spatial variations on the length scale of a few
hundred nanometers in the ferromagnetic state, which may be attributed to the
intrinsic heterogeneity of the manganites due to their tendency towards phase
separation. The electronic heterogeneity is found to decrease either with
increasing field at low temperatures or at temperatures above all magnetic
ordering temperatures. On the other hand, spectra taken with Cr-coated tips are
consistent with convoluted electronic properties of both LCMO and Cr. In
particular, for temperatures below the magnetic ordering temperatures of both
Cr and LCMO, the magnetic-field dependent tunneling spectra may be
quantitatively explained by the scenario of spin-polarized tunneling in a
spin-valve configuration. Moreover, a low-energy insulating energy gap $\sim
0.6$ eV commonly found in the tunneling conductance spectra of bulk metallic
LCMO at $T \to 0$ may be attributed to a surface ferromagnetic insulating (FI)
phase, as evidenced by its spin filtering effect at low temperatures and
vanishing gap value above the Curie temperature. Additionally, temperature
independent pseudogap (PG) phenomena existing primarily along the boundaries of
magnetic domains are observed in the zero-field tunneling spectra. The PG
becomes strongly suppressed by applied magnetic fields at low temperatures when
the tunneling spectra of LCMO become highly homogeneous. These findings suggest
that the occurrence PG is associated with the electronic heterogeneity of the
manganites.
