Driven lattice gases as the ASEP are useful tools for the modeling of various
stochastic transport processes carried out by self-driven particles, such as
molecular motors or vehicles in road traffic. Often these processes take place
in one-dimensional systems offering several tracks to the particles, and in
many cases the particles are able to change track with a given rate. In this
work we consider the case of strong coupling where the hopping rate along the
tracks and the exchange rates are of the same order, and show how a
phenomenological approach based on a domain wall theory can describe the
dynamics of the system. In particular, the domain walls on the different tracks
form pairs, whose dynamics dominate the behavior of the system.
