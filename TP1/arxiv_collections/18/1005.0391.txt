For any n-by-n complex matrix T and any $1\leqslant k\leqslant n$, let
$\Lambda_{k}(T)$ the set of all $\lambda\in \C$ such that $PTP=\lambda P$ for
some rank-k orthogonal projection $P$ be its higher rank-k numerical range. It
is shown that if $\bbS$ is the n-dimensional shift on ${\C}^{n}$ then its
rank-k numerical range is the circular disc centred in zero and with radius
$\cos\dfrac{k\pi}{n+1}$ if $1<k\leqslant[\frac{n+1}{2}]$ and the empty set if
$[\frac{n+1}{2}]<k\leqslant n$, where $[x] $ denote the integer part of $x$.
This extends and rafines previous results of U. Haagerup, P. de la Harpe
\cite{Haagerup} on the classical numerical range of the n-dimensional shift
on${\C}^{n}$. An interesting result for higher rank-$k$ numerical range of
nilpotent operator is also established.
