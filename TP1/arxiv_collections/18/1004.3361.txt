For a class of quantized open chaotic systems satisfying a natural dynamical
assumption, we show that the study of the resolvent, and hence of scattering
and resonances, can be reduced to the study of a family of open quantum maps,
that is of finite dimensional operators obtained by quantizing the Poincar\'e
map associated with the flow near the set of trapped trajectories.
