We present photocurrent power-enhancement calculations of a carbon nanotube
p-n junction electromagnetically coupled to a highly-efficient photonic
structure. Particular attention is paid to a GaAs photonic structure
specifically modified to increase the intensity of infrared light onto the
nanotube region for effective energy conversion. Using finite-difference
time-domain calculations, we compute a significant increase in electric field
intensity in the nanotube region which enables an estimation of power
efficiency. These results demonstrate the potential of using a photonic
structure to couple large-scale infrared sources with carbon nanotubes while
still retaining all the unique optoelectronic properties found at the
nanoscale.
