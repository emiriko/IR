The theorem of Jentzsch--Szeg\H{o} describes the limit measure of a sequence
of discrete measures associated to the zeroes of a sequence of polynomials in
one variable. Following the presentation of this result by Andrievskii and
Blatt in their book, we extend this theorem to compact Riemann surfaces, then
to analytic curves over an ultrametric field. The particular case of the
projective line over an ultrametric field gives as corollaries information
about the irreducibility of the truncations of a power series in one variable.
