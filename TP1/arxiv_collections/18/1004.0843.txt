We investigate the evolution of Type Ib/c supernova (SN Ib/c) progenitors in
close binary systems, using new evolutionary models that include the effects of
rotation, with initial masses of 12 - 25 Msun for the primary components, and
of single helium stars with initial masses of 2.8 - 20 Msun. We find that,
despite the impact of tidal interaction on the rotation of primary stars, the
amount of angular momentum retained in the core at the presupernova stage in
different binary model sequences converge to a value similar to those found in
previous single star models. This amount is large enough to produce millisecond
pulsars, but too small to produce magnetars or long gamma-ray bursts. We employ
the most up-to-date estimate for the Wolf-Rayet mass loss rate, and its
implications for SN Ib/c progenitors are discussed in detail. In terms of
stellar structure, SN Ib/c progenitors in binary systems are predicted to have
a wide range of final masses even up to 7 Msun, with helium envelopes of 0.16 -
1.5 Msun. Our results indicate that, if the lack of helium lines in the spectra
of SNe Ic were due to small amounts of helium, the distribution of both initial
and final masses of SN Ic progenitors should be bimodal. Furthermore, we find
that a thin hydrogen layer (0.001 - 0.01 Msun) is expected to be present in
many SN Ib progenitors at the presupernova stage. We show that the presence of
hydrogen, together with a rather thick helium envelope, can lead to a
significant expansion of some SN Ib/c progenitors by the time of supernova
explosion. This may have important consequences for the shock break-out and
supernova light curve. We also argue that some SN progenitors with thin
hydrogen layers produced via Case AB/B transfer might be related to Type IIb
supernova progenitors with relatively small radii of about 10 Rsun.
