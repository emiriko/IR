We provide an explanation of the main ideas underlying G\"otze's main result
in using Stein's method. We also provide detailed derivations of various
intermediate estimates. Curiously, we are led to a different dimensional
dependence of the constant than that given G\"otze's paper. We would like to
dedicate this to Charles Stein on the occasion of his 90th birthday.
