The analysis of a new "rolling release" mechanism is presented for three
different "siege engine" designs. The range obtained with the rolling release
is compared to the ranges obtained using the simpler "cup" and the proven
"sling" release mechanisms. It is found that the rolling release is a
significant improvement over the cup release, but the range of the rolling
release is still well short of that attained with the sling release. It is also
noted that the familiar "spoon" projectile holder used on many siege engines
operates in a rolling release manner, contrary to appearances and to some
previous published studies. Instead, the release mechanism used in ancient
engines and in modern kit-purchased replicas is the rolling release.
