A number of anomalies have been reported in molten Bi, including a
first-order liquid-liquid transition at 1010K and ambient pressure, which is
irreversible at cooling rates of several degrees per minute. An interpretation
of these effects as due to long-range orientational order is suggested.
Significant evidence for directionality in liquid Bi, albeit only immediately
after melting, is available in experiments made circa 1930. Further
experimentation is called for.
