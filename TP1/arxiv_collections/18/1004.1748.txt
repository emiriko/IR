Biometrics deal with automated methods of identifying a person or verifying
the identity of a person based on physiological or behavioral characteristics.
Visual cryptography is a secret sharing scheme where a secret image is
encrypted into the shares which independently disclose no information about the
original secret image. As biometric template are stored in the centralized
database, due to security threats biometric template may be modified by
attacker. If biometric template is altered authorized user will not be allowed
to access the resource. To deal this issue visual cryptography schemes can be
applied to secure the iris template. Visual cryptography provides great means
for helping such security needs as well as extra layer of authentication.
