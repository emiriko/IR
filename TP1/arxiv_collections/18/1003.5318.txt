If gamma-ray bursts are sources of ultra-high energy cosmic rays, then
radiative signatures of hadronic acceleration are expected in GRB data.
Observations with the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope offer the best means to
search for evidence of UHECRs in GRBs through electromagnetic channels. Various
issues related to UHECR acceleration in GRBs are reviewed, with a focus on the
question of energetics.
