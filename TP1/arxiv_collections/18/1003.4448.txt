Analyzing the NEIC-data we have shown that the spatial deep-focus earthquake
distribution in the Earth interior over the 1993-2006 is characterized by the
clearly defined periodical fine discrete structure with period L=50 km, which
is solely generated by earthquakes with magnitude M 3.9 to 5.3 and only on the
convergent boundary of plates. To describe the formation of this structure we
used the model of complex systems by A. Volynskii and S. Bazhenov. The key
property of this model consists in the presence of a rigid coating on a soft
substratum. It is shown that in subduction processes the role of a rigid
coating plays the slab substance (lithosphere) and the upper mantle acts as a
soft substratum. Within the framework of this model we have obtained the
estimation of average values of stress in the upper mantle and Young's modulus
for the oceanic slab (lithosphere) and upper mantle.
