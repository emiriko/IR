We study the representation theory of a certain finite group for which
Kloosterman sums appear as character values. This leads us to consider a
concrete family of commuting hermitian matrices which have Kloosterman sums as
eigenvalues. These matrices satisfy a number of "magical" combinatorial
properties and they encode various arithmetic properties of Kloosterman sums.
These matrices can also be regarded as adjacency matrices for multigraphs which
display Ramanujan-like behavior.
