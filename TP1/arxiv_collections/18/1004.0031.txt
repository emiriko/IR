We prove that the category of abelian gerbes with connection over a smooth
manifold is equivalent to a certain category of principal bundles over the free
loop space. These bundles are equipped with a connection and with a "fusion"
product with respect to triples of paths. The equivalence is established by
explicit functors in both directions: transgression and regression. We describe
applications to geometric lifting problems and loop group extensions.
