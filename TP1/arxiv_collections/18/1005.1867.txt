We study the proximity effect in SF'(AF)F'S and SF'(F)F'S planar junctions,
where S is a clean conventional (s-wave) superconductor, while F' and middle
layers are clean or moderately diffusive ferromagnets. Middle layers consist of
two equal ferromagnets with antiparallel (AF) or parallel (F) magnetizations
that are not collinear with magnetizations in the neighboring F' layers. We use
fully self-consistent numerical solutions of the Eilenberger equations to
calculate the superconducting pair amplitudes and the Josephson current for
arbitrary thickness of ferromagnetic layers and the angle between in-plane
magnetisations. For moderate disorder in ferromagnets the triplet proximity
effect is practically the same for AF and F structures, like in the dirty
limit. Triplet Josephson current is dominant for $d'\approx\hbar v_F/2h'$,
where $d'$ is the F' layer thickness and $h'$ is the exchange energy. Our
results are in a qualitative agreement with the recent experimental
observations [T. S. Khaire, M. A. Khasawneh, W. P. Pratt, and N. O. Birge,
