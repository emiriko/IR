We report on magneto-transport measurement in disordered graphene under
pulsed magnetic field of up to 57T. For large electron or hole doping, the
system displays the expected anomalous Integer Quantum Hall Effect (IQHE)
specific to graphene up to filling factor $\nu=2$. In the close vicinity of the
charge neutrality point, the system breaks up into co-existing puddles of holes
and electrons, leading to a vanishing Hall and finite longitudinal resistance
with no hint of divergence at very high magnetic field. Large resistance
fluctuations are observed near the Dirac point. They are interpreted as the the
natural consequence of the presence of electron and hole puddles. The magnetic
field at which the amplitude of the fluctuations are the largest is directly
linked to the mean size of the puddles.
