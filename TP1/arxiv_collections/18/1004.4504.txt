The textbook contains the problems in mechanics and special relativity for
physics departments of universities. Many original problems were proposed by
active scientists from the institutes of the Siberian Branch of Russian Academy
of Science, while teaching at the Novosibirsk State University. The problems
have been used in seminars, students' homework and in the written examinations
at Novosibirsk State University. They are arranged according to the program of
the introductory mechanics course, adopted at Novosibirsk State University.
This part contains only problems. Answers and solutions of some problems can be
also provided in a separate submission in future, if there would be enough
interest in them. Previous versions of the textbook were published several
times in the past. This submission is based only on the author's original
materials and does not use any copyrighted files from the publishers.
