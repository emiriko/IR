We describe von Neumann's elegant idea for sampling from the exponential
distribution, Forsythe's generalization for sampling from a probability
distribution whose density has the form exp(-G(x)), where G(x) is easy to
compute (e.g. a polynomial), and my refinement of these ideas to give an
efficient algorithm for generating pseudo-random numbers with a normal
distribution. Later developments are also mentioned.
