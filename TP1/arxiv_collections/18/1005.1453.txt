X-ray observations of galaxy clusters at high redshift (z>0.5) indicate that
they are more morphologically complex and less virialized than those at
low-redshift. We present the first subarcmin resolution at 18 GHz observations
of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect for ClJ0152-1357 using the Australia
Telescope Compact Array. ClJ0152-1357 is a massive cluster at redshift z=0.83
and has a complex structure including several merging subclumps which have been
studied at optical, X-ray, and radio wavelengths. Our high-resolution
observations indicate a clear displacement of the maximum SZ effect from the
peak of X-ray emission for the most massive sub-clump. This result shows that
the cluster gas within the cluster substructures is not virialised in
ClJ0152-1357 and we suggest that it is still recovering from a recent merger
event. A similar offset of the SZ effect has been recently seen in the `bullet
cluster' by Malu et al. This non-equilibrium situation implies that high
resolution observations are necessary to investigate galaxy cluster evolution,
and to extract cosmological constraints from a comparison of the SZ effect and
X-ray signals.
