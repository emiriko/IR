Soliton operation and soliton wavelength tuning of erbium-doped fiber lasers
mode locked with atomic layer graphene was experimentally investigated under
various cavity dispersion conditions. It was shown that not only wide range
soliton wavelength tuning but also soltion pulse width variation could be
obtained in the fiber lasers. Our results show that the graphene mode locked
erbium-doped fiber lasers provide a compact, user friendly and low cost
wavelength tunable ultrahsort pulse source.
