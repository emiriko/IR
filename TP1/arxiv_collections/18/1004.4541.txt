Parallel Global Optimization Algorithms (PGOA) provide an efficient way of
dealing with hard optimization problems. One method of parallelization of GOAs
that is frequently applied and commonly found in the contemporary literature is
the so-called Island Model (IM). In this paper we analyze the impact of the
migration topology on the performance of a PGOA which uses the Island Model. In
particular we consider parallel Differential Evolution and Simulated Annealing
with Adaptive Neighborhood and draw first conclusions that emerge from the
conducted experiments.
