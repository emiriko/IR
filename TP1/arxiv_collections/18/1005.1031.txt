During an X-ray survey of the Small Magellanic Cloud, carried out with the
XMM-Newton satellite, we detected significant soft X-ray emission from the
central star of the high-excitation planetary nebula SMP SMC 22. Its very soft
spectrum is well fit with a non local thermodynamical equilibrium model
atmosphere composed of H, He, C, N, and O, with abundances equal to those
inferred from studies of its nebular lines. The derived effective temperature
of 1.5x10^5 K is in good agreement with that found from the optical/UV data.
The unabsorbed flux in the 0.1-0.5 keV range is about 3x10^{-11} erg cm^-2
s^-1, corresponding to a luminosity of 1.2x10^37 erg/s at the distance of 60
kpc. We also searched for X-ray emission from a large number of SMC planetary
nebulae, confirming the previous detection of SMP SMC 25 with a luminosity of
(0.2-6)x10^35 erg/s (0.1-1 keV). For the remaining objects that were not
detected, we derived flux upper limits corresponding to luminosity values from
several tens to hundreds times smaller than that of SMP SMC 22. The
exceptionally high X-ray luminosity of SMP SMC 22 is probably due to the high
mass of its central star, quickly evolving toward the white dwarf's cooling
branch, and to a small intrinsic absorption in the nebula itself.
