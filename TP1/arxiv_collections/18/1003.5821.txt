The Coherence Length Diagram and the related maps have been shown to
represent a useful tool for image analysis. Setting threshold parameters is one
of the most important issues when dealing with such applications, as they
affect both the computability, which is outlined by the support map, and the
appearance of the coherence length diagram itself and of defect maps. A coupled
optimization analysis, returning a range for the basic (saturation) threshold,
and a histogram based method, yielding suitable values for a desired map
appearance, are proposed for an effective control of the analysis process.
