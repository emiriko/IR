The AMTHA (Automatic Mapping Task on Heterogeneous Architectures) algorithm
for task-to-processors assignment and the MPAHA (Model of Parallel Algorithms
on Heterogeneous Architectures) model are presented. The use of AMTHA is
analyzed for multicore processor-based architectures, considering the
communication model among processes in use. The results obtained in the tests
carried out are presented, comparing the real execution times on multicores of
a set of synthetic applications with the predictions obtained with AMTHA.
Finally current lines of research are presented, focusing on clusters of
multicores and hybrid programming paradigms.
