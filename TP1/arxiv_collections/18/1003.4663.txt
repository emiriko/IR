Methods based on Wilson's renormalization group have been successfully
applied in the context of nuclear physics to analyze the scale dependence of
effective nucleon-nucleon ($NN$) potentials, as well as to consistently
integrate out the high-momentum components of phenomenological high-precision
$NN$ potentials in order to derive phase-shift equivalent softer forms, the so
called $V_{low-k}$ potentials. An alternative renormalization group approach
that has been applied in this context is the Similarity Renormalization Group
(SRG), which is based on a series of continuous unitary transformations that
evolve hamiltonians with a cutoff on energy differences. In this work we study
the SRG evolution of a leading order (LO) chiral effective $NN$ potential in
the $^1 S_0$ channel derived within the framework of the Subtracted Kernel
Method (SKM), a renormalization scheme based on a subtracted scattering
equation.
