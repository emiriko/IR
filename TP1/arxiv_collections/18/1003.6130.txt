The model of Nielsen and Ninomiya claims that "the SSC (Superconducting
Supercollider) were stopped by the US Congress due to the backward causation
from the big amounts of Higgs particles, which it would have produced, if it
had been allowed to run". They also proposed to play a card game and if the
"close LHC" card is drawn (with probability $\sim 10^{-6}$), really close LHC
on the eve of Higgs particle discovery to avoid more severe bad luck. Crazy?
Probably. But paraphrasing Salvador Dali, if you believe that you and me are
smarter in physics than Nielsen and Ninomiya, don't read this article, just go
right on in your blissful idiocy. Therefore, I will try to make sense of
backward causation. It turns out that not only the backward causation makes
perfect sense in some models of possible reality, but that Nielsen and Ninomiya
really have a chance to close LHC by a card game. The only thing they need is
to be smart enough to manage to develop their theory up to the level of
brilliance beginning from which it becomes a part of the fabric of reality. We
hope, however, that they will use their outstanding abilities to bring about
some more interesting future.
