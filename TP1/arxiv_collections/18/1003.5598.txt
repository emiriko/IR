This paper presents an analysis of the set of connections and covariant
derivatives on a U(1) quantum Hopf bundle on the standard Podles sphere, whose
total space quantum SU(2) is equipped with the 3d left covariant differential
calculus by Woronowicz. The introduction of a Hodge duality on the exterior
algebras on both total and base space of the bundle allows for the study of
Laplacians and of gauged Laplacians.
