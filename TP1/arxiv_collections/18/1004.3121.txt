We calculate NLTE models of stellar winds of hot compact stars (central stars
of planetary nebulae and subdwarf stars). The studied range of subdwarf
parameters is selected to cover a large part of these stars. The models predict
the wind hydrodynamical structure and provide mass-loss rates for different
abundances. Our models show that CNO elements are important drivers of subdwarf
winds, especially for low-luminosity stars. We study the effect of X-rays and
instabilities on these winds. Due to the line-driven wind instability, a
significant part of the wind could be very hot.
