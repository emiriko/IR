A Direct Sum Theorem holds in a model of computation, when solving some k
input instances together is k times as expensive as solving one. We show that
Direct Sum Theorems hold in the models of deterministic and randomized decision
trees for all relations. We also note that a near optimal Direct Sum Theorem
holds for quantum decision trees for boolean functions.
