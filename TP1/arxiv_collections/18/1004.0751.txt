In the paper we first investigate symmetries of isospectral and
non-isospectral four-potential Ablowitz-Ladik hierarchies. We express these
hierarchies in the form of $u_{n,t}=L^m H^{(0)}$, where $m$ is an arbitrary
integer (instead of a nature number) and $L$ is the recursion operator. Then by
means of the zero-curvature representations of the isospectral and
non-isospectral flows, we construct symmetries for the isospectral equation
hierarchy as well as non-isospectral equation hierarchy, respectively. The
symmetries, respectively, form two centerless Kac-Moody-Virasoro algebras. The
recursion operator $L$ is proved to be hereditary and a strong symmetry for
this isospectral equation hierarchy. Besides, we make clear for the relation
between four-potential and two-potential Ablowitz-Ladik hierarchies. The even
order members in the four-potential Ablowitz-Ladik hierarchies together with
their symmetries and algebraic structures can be reduced to two-potential case.
The reduction keeps invariant for the algebraic structures and the recursion
operator for two potential case becomes $L^2$.
