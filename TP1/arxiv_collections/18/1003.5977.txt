This paper is to explore the de Haas-van Alphen effect $(dHvA)$ of graphene
in the presence of an in-plane uniform electric field. Three major findings are
yielded. First of all, the electric field is found to modulate the de Haas-van
Alphen magnetization and magnetic susceptibility through the dimensionless
parameter $(\beta =\frac{E}{\upsilon_{F}B})$. As the parameter $\beta$
increases, the values of magnetization and magnetic susceptibility increase to
positive infinity or decrease to negative infinity at the exotic point
$\beta_{c}=1$. Besides, the $dHvA$ oscillation amplitude rises abruptly to
infinity for zero temperature at $\beta_{c}=1$, but eventually collapses at a
finite temperature thereby leading to the vanishing of de Haas-van Alphen
effect. In addition, the magnetic susceptibility depends on the electric and
magnetic fields, suggesting that the graphene should be a non-linear magnetic
medium in the presence of the external field. These results, which are
different from those obtained in the standard nonrelativistic 2D electron gas,
are attributed to its anomalous Landau level spectrum in graphene.
