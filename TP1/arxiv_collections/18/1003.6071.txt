This paper describes an experimental setup that has been developed to measure
and characterise properties of Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPM). The measured
SiPM properties are of general interest for a multitude of potential
applications and comprise the Photon Detection Efficiency (PDE), the voltage
dependent cross-talk and the after-pulse probabilities. With the described
setup the absolute PDE can be determined as a function of wavelength covering a
spectral range from 350 to 1000nm. In addition, a method is presented which
allows to study the pixel uniformity in terms of the spatial variations of
sensitivity and gain. The results from various commercially available SiPMs -
three HAMAMATSU MPPCs and one SensL SPM - are presented and compared.
