We employ pulse shaping to abate single-qubit gate errors arising from the
weak anharmonicity of transmon superconducting qubits. By applying shaped
pulses to both quadratures of rotation, a phase error induced by the presence
of higher levels is corrected. Using a derivative of the control on the
quadrature channel, we are able to remove the effect of the anharmonic levels
for multiple qubits coupled to a microwave resonator. Randomized benchmarking
is used to quantify the average error per gate, achieving a minimum of
0.007+/-0.005 using 4 ns-wide pulse.
