The primary target in the seismo-field of CoRoT, HD 49434, known to be a bona
fide hybrid gamma Doradus/delta Scuti, shows excited intermediate-order g
modes. Time-Dependent Convection models, however, predict a range in frequency
that is stable to pulsations, between the simultaneously excited high-order g
modes (gamma Dor) and low-order p and g modes (delta Sct). Furthermore,
theoretical studies based on model computations of delta Sct stars suggest that
stochastically excited modes are likely to be observed. A pertinent question
would then be to ask: Might those observed intermediate-order g modes be
stochastically excited? By employing a statistical method which searches for
the signature of stochastic excitation in stellar pulsations, we investigate
the nature of those modes with possible implications on the identification of
their excitation mechanism. Preliminary results are rather inconclusive about
the presence of stochastic excitation. A new analysis that thoroughly takes
into account sampling effects is necessary in order to get more reliable
results.
