The LiFeP sample has been prepared by means of high-temperature solid state
reaction. A transition temperature to the superconducting state was found as
about 5.5 K by measurements of magnetization versus temperature. The second
critical field was found above 1 kOe. Moessbauer spectra of the LiFeP phase are
characterized by the quadrupole split doublet having splitting of about 0.10
mm/s at room temperature and 0.12 mm/s at 4.2 K. No magnetic order occurs down
to 4.2 K.
