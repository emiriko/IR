Using spontaneous parametric down conversion and a 50:50 beam splitter, we
generate coaxial polarization-entangled photon pairs, of which the two photons
are far separated from each other. The photons are then sent one by one through
one port of a modified Mach-Zehnder interferometer. We observe interference
fringes with a periodicity half of the single-photon wavelength, independent of
the distance between the photons. This feature can find applications in
quantum-enhanced measurement.
