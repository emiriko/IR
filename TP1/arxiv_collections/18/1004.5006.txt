We consider the quantum optical eight-port homodyne detection scheme in the
case that each of the associated photon detectors is assigned with a different
quantum efficiency. We give a mathematically rigorous and strictly quantum
mechanical proof of the fact that the measured observable (positive operator
measure) in the high-amplitude limit is a smearing of the covariant phase space
observable related to the ideal measurement. The result is proved for an
arbitary parameter field. Furthermore, we investigate some properties of the
measured observable. In particular, we show that the state distinguishing power
of the observable is not affected by detector inefficiencies.
