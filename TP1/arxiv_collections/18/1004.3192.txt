The new model of $n\bar{n}$ transitions in nuclei based on unitary $S$-matrix
is considered. The $|in>$-state of nucleus is described by single-particle
shell model. The dynamical process part is calculated by means of
field-theoretical approach with finite time interval. The lower limit on the
free-space $n\bar{n}$ oscillation time $\tau_{{\rm min}}$ is in the range
$10^{16}\; {\rm yr}>\tau_{{\rm min}}>1.2\cdot 10^{9}\; {\rm s}$. \end{abstract}
