The expected utility hypothesis is one of the building blocks of classical
economic theory and founded on Savage's Sure-Thing Principle. It has been put
forward, e.g. by situations such as the Allais and Ellsberg paradoxes, that
real-life situations can violate Savage's Sure-Thing Principle and hence also
expected utility. We analyze how this violation is connected to the presence of
the 'disjunction effect' of decision theory and use our earlier study of this
effect in concept theory to put forward an explanation of the violation of
Savage's Sure-Thing Principle, namely the presence of 'quantum conceptual
thought' next to 'classical logical thought' within a double layer structure of
human thought during the decision process. Quantum conceptual thought can be
modeled mathematically by the quantum mechanical formalism, which we illustrate
by modeling the Hawaii problem situation, a well-known example of the
disjunction effect, and we show how the dynamics in the Hawaii problem
situation is generated by the whole conceptual landscape surrounding the
decision situation.
