Substitution of Re for Ru in the heavy fermion compound URu2Si2 suppresses
the hidden order transition and gives rise to ferromagnetism at higher
concentrations. The hidden order transition of URu(2-x)Re(x)Si2, tracked via
specific heat and electrical resistivity measurements, decreases in temperature
and broadens, and is no longer observed for x>0.1. A critical scaling analysis
of the bulk magnetization indicates that the ferromagnetic ordering temperature
and ordered moment are suppressed continuously towards zero at a critical
concentration of x = 0.15, accompanied by the additional suppression of the
critical exponents gamma and (delta-1) towards zero. This unusual trend appears
to reflect the underlying interplay between Kondo and ferromagnetic
interactions, and perhaps the proximity of the hidden order phase.
