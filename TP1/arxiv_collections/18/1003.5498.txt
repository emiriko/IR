Neutrinos with hierarchical masses and two large mixing angles may naturally
originate from sequential dominance (SD). Within this framework we present
analytic expressions for the neutrino mixing angles including the
next-to-leading order (NLO) and next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO)
corrections arising from the second lightest and lightest neutrino masses. The
analytic results for neutrino mixing angles in SD presented here, including the
NLO and NNLO corrections, are applicable to a wide class of models and may
provide useful insights when confronting the models with data from high
precision neutrino experiments. We also point out that for special cases of SD
corresponding to form dominance (FD) the NLO and NNLO corrections both vanish.
For example we study tri-bimaximal (TB) mixing via constrained sequential
dominance (CSD) which involves only a NNLO correction and tri-bimaximal-reactor
(TBR) mixing via partially constrained sequential dominance (PCSD) which
involves a NLO correction suppressed by the small reactor angle and show that
the analytic results have good agreement with the numerical results for these
cases.
