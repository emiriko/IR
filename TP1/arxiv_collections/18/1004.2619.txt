We investigate propagation of a transverse magnetic field through a nonlinear
metamaterial slab of sub-wavelength thickness and with a very small and
negative linear dielectric permittivity. We prove that, for a given input
intensity, the output intensity is a multi-valued function of the field
incidence angle so that the transmissivity exhibits angular multi-stability and
a pronounced directional hysteresis behavior. The predicted directional
hysteresis is a consequence of the fact that the linear and nonlinear
contributions to the overall dielectric response can be comparable so that the
electromagnetic matching conditions at the output slab boundary allow more than
one field configurations within the slab to be compatible with the transmitted
field.
