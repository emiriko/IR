A report on the recent next-to-leading order QCD calculations to t anti-t b
anti-b and t anti-t + 2j processes at the CERN Large Hardon Collider is
presented. Results for integrated and differential cross sections are given. A
significant reduction of the scale dependence is observed in both cases, which
indicates that the perturbative expansion is well under control. The results
are obtained in the framework of the HELAC-NLO system.
