The topos approach to the formulation of physical theories includes a new
form of quantum logic. We present this topos quantum logic, including some new
results, and compare it to standard quantum logic, all with an eye to
conceptual issues. In particular, we show that topos quantum logic is
distributive, multi-valued, contextual and intuitionistic. It incorporates
superposition without being based on linear structures, has a built-in form of
coarse-graining which automatically avoids interpretational problems usually
associated with the conjunction of propositions about incompatible physical
quantities, and provides a material implication that is lacking from standard
quantum logic. Importantly, topos quantum logic comes with a clear geometrical
underpinning. The representation of pure states and truth-value assignments are
discussed. It is briefly shown how mixed states fit into this approach.
