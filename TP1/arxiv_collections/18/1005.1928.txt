We study properties of phase transitions of 2D superconductor liquid crystal
phases, and analyze the competition between the recently proposed Pair Density
Wave (PDW) and nematic $4e$ superconductor ($4e$SC). Nematic fluctuations
enhance the $4e$SC and suppress the PDW phase. In the absence of lattice
effects, the PDW state exists only at T=0 and the low temperature phase is a
nematic $4e$SC with short ranged PDW order. A geometric description of the $4e$
SC is presented.
