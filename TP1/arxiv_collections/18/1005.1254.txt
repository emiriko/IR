We study the possibility to measure sin^2 theta_W by neutrino-electron
scattering at a value of the momentum transfer Q ~ 30 MeV with a precision of
0.24% which is only a factor three below the one obtained by LEP-I at the
Z-pole. The neutrino source is a proton beam dump providing a clean beam from
muon decay at rest and the detector is a 100 kt scale water Cerenkov detector,
which results in about 20 million signal events.
