Long-time dynamical decoupling and quantum control of qubits require
high-precision control pulses. Full characterization (quantum tomography) of
imperfect pulses presents a bootstrap problem: tomography requires initial
states of a qubit which can not be prepared without imperfect pulses. We
present a protocol for pulse error analysis, specifically tailored for a wide
range of the single solid-state electron spins. Using a single electron spin of
a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond, we experimentally verify the
correctness of the protocol, and demonstrate its usefulness for quantum control
tasks.
