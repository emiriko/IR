We describe the most recent efforts made by various groups in implementing
resistive electrodes in micropattern gaseous detectors with the aim to combine
in the same design the best features of RPCs (for the example, their robustness
and spark protection property) with the high granularity and thus the good
position resolution offered by microelectronic technology. In the stream of
this activity, we have recently developed two novel detectors with resistive
electrodes: one was based on resistive micromeshes and the second one is a MSGC
with resistive electrodes. We have demonstrated that the resistive meshes are a
convenient construction element for various designs of spark protective
detectors: RPCs type, GEM type and MICROMEGAS type. These new detectors enable
to considerably enhance the RPC and micropattern detectors applications since
they feature not only a high position resolution but also a relatively good
energy resolution (25-30 persent FWHM at 6 keV) and, if necessary, they can
operate in cascaded mode allowing the achievement of a high overall gas gain.
The main conclusion from these studies is that the implementation of resistive
electrodes in micropattern detectors makes them fully spark protected; on this
basis we consider this direction very promising.
