Is there a meaningful quantum counterpart to public communication? We argue
that the symmetric-side channel -- which distributes quantum information
symmetrically between the receiver and the environment -- is a good candidate
for a notion of public quantum communication in entanglement distillation and
quantum error correction.
  This connection is partially motivated by [Brand\~ao and Oppenheim,
arXiv:1004.3328], where it was found that if a sender would like to communicate
a secret message to a receiver through an insecure quantum channel using a
shared quantum state as a key, then the insecure quantum channel is only ever
used to simulate a symmetric-side channel, and can always be replaced by it
without altering the optimal rate. Here we further show, in complete analogy to
the role of public classical communication, that assistance by a symmetric-side
channel makes equal the distillable entanglement, the recently-introduced
mutual independence, and a generalization of the latter, which quantifies the
extent to which one of the parties can perform quantum privacy amplification.
  Symmetric-side channels, and the closely related erasure channel, have been
recently harnessed to provide examples of superactivation of the quantum
channel capacity. Our findings give new insight into this non-additivity of the
channel capacity and its relation to quantum privacy. In particular, we show
that single-copy superactivation protocols with the erasure channel, which
encompasses all examples of non-additivity of the quantum capacity found to
date, can be understood as a conversion of mutual independence into distillable
entanglement.
