The occurrence of digits one through nine as the leftmost nonzero digit of
numbers from real world sources is often not uniformly distributed, but
instead, is distributed according to a logarithmic law, known as Benford's law.
Here, we investigate systematically the mantissa distributions of some pulsar
quantities, and find that for most quantities their first digits conform to
this law. However, the barycentric period shows significant deviation from the
usual distribution, but satisfies a generalized Benford's law roughly.
Therefore pulsars can serve as an ideal assemblage to study the first digit
distributions of real world data, and the observations can be used to constrain
theoretical models of pulsar behavior.
