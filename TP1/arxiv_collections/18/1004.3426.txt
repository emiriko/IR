We consider the horizontal branch (HB) of the Globular Cluster Terzan 5,
recently shown to be split into two parts, the fainter one (delta M_K ~ 0.3mag)
having a lower metallicity than the more luminous. Both features show that it
contains at least two stellar populations. The separation in magnitude has been
ascribed to an age difference of ~6 Gyr and interpreted as the result of an
atypical evolutionary history for this cluster. We show that the observed HB
morphology is also consistent with a model in which the bright HB is composed
of second generation stars that are metal enriched and with a helium mass
fraction larger (by delta Y ~ 0.07) than that of first generation stars
populating the fainter part of the HB. Terzan 5 would therefore be anomalous,
compared to most "normal" clusters hosting multiple populations, only because
its second generation is strongly contaminated by supernova ejecta; the
previously proposed prolonged period of star formation, however, is not
required. The iron enrichment of the bright HB can be ascribed either to
contamination from Type Ia supernova ejecta of the low-iron, helium rich,
ejecta of the massive asympotic giant branch stars of the cluster, or to its
mixing with gas, accreting on the cluster from the environment, that has been
subject to fast metal enrichment due to its proximity with the galactic bulge.
The model here proposed requires only a small age difference, of ~100Myr.
