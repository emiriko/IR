We discuss the effect of surface energy coefficients as well as nuclear
surface diffuseness in the proximity potential and ultimately in the fusion of
heavy-ions. Here we employ different versions of surface energy coefficients.
Our analysis reveals that these technical parameters can influence the fusion
barriers by a significant amount. A best set of these parameters is also given
that explains the experimental data nicely.
