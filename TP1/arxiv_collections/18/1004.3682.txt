Graphene research is currently one of the largest fields in condensed matter.
Due to its unusual electronic spectrum with Dirac-like quasiparticles, and the
fact that it is a unique example of a metallic membrane, graphene has
properties that have no match in standard solid state textbooks. In these
lecture notes, I discuss some of these properties that are not covered in
detail in recent reviews. We study the particular aspects of the
physics/chemistry of carbon that influence the properties of graphene; the
basic features of graphene's band structure including the pi and sigma bands;
the phonon spectra in free floating graphene; the effects of a substrate on the
structural properties of graphene; and the effect of deformations in the
propagation of electrons. The objective of these notes is not to provide an
unabridged theoretical description of graphene but to point out some of the
peculiar aspects of this material.
