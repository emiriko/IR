We study certain differential operators of the form AD arising from a
first-order approach to the Kato square root problem. We show that if such
operators are R-bisectorial in L^p, they remain R-bisectorial in L^q for all q
close to p. In combination with our earlier results with Portal, which required
such R-bisectoriality in different L^q spaces to start with, this shows that
the R-bisectoriality in just one L^p actually implies bounded H-infinity
calculus in L^q for all q close to p. We adapt the approach to related
second-order results developed by Auscher, Hofmann and Martell, and also employ
abstract extrapolation theorems due to Kalton and Mitrea.
