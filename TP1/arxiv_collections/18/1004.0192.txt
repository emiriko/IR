A remarkable U(1) gauge extension of the supersymmetric standard model was
proposed eight years ago. It is anomaly-free, has no mu term, and conserves
baryon and lepton numbers automatically. The phenomenology of a specific
version of this model is discussed. In particular, leptoquarks are predicted,
with couplings to the heavy singlet neutrinos, the scalar partners of which may
be components of dark matter. The Majorana neutrino mass matrix itself may have
two zero subdeterminants.
