3He and the triton are studied as three-body bound states in the effective
field theory without pions. We study 3He using the set of integral equations
developed by Kok et al. which includes the full off-shell T-matrix for the
Coulomb interaction between the protons. To leading order, the theory contains:
two-body contact interactions whose renormalized strengths are set by the NN
scattering lengths, the Coulomb potential, and a three-body contact
interaction. We solve the three coupled integral equations with a sharp
momentum cutoff, Lambda, and find that a three-body interaction is required in
3He at leading order, as in the triton. It also exhibits the same limit-cycle
behavior as a function of Lambda, showing that the Efimov effect remains in the
presence of the Coulomb interaction. We also obtain the difference between the
strengths of the three-body forces in 3He and the triton.
