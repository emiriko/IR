The aim of this paper is to study the qualitative behaviour of non-negative
entire solutions of certain differential inequalities involving gradient terms
on the Heisenberg group. We focus our investigation on the two classes of
inequalities of the form $\Delta^\phi u \ge f(u)l(|\nabla u|)$ and $\Delta^\phi
u \ge f(u) - h(u) g(|\nabla u|)$, where $f,l,h,g$ are non-negative continuous
functions satisfying certain monotonicity properties. The operator
$\Delta^\phi$, called the $\phi$-Laplacian, can be viewed as a natural
generalization of the $p$-Laplace operator recently considered by various
authors in this setting. We prove some Liouville theorems introducing two new
Keller-Osserman type conditions, both extending the classical one which
appeared long ago in the study of the prototype differential inequality $\Delta
u \ge f(u)$ in $\erre^m$. Furthermore, we show sharpness of our conditions when
we specialize to the case of the $p$-Laplacian. Needless to say, our results
continue to hold, with the obvious minor modifications, also in the Euclidean
space.
