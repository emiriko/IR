The emission and absorption of single photons by single atomic particles is a
fundamental limit of matter-light interaction, manifesting its quantum
mechanical nature. At the same time, as a controlled process it is a key
enabling tool for quantum technologies, such as quantum optical information
technology [1, 2] and quantum metrology [3, 4, 5, 6]. Controlling both emission
and absorption will allow implementing quantum networking scenarios [1, 7, 8,
9], where photonic communication of quantum information is interfaced with its
local processing in atoms. In studies of single-photon emission, recent
progress includes control of the shape, bandwidth, frequency, and polarization
of single-photon sources [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17], and the
demonstration of atom-photon entanglement [18, 19, 20]. Controlled absorption
of a single photon by a single atom is much less investigated; proposals exist
but only very preliminary steps have been taken experimentally such as
detecting the attenuation and phase shift of a weak laser beam by a single atom
[21, 22], and designing an optical system that covers a large fraction of the
full solid angle [23, 24, 25]. Here we report the interaction of single
heralded photons with a single trapped atom. We find strong correlations of the
detection of a heralding photon with a change in the quantum state of the atom
marking absorption of the quantum-correlated heralded photon. In coupling a
single absorber with a quantum light source, our experiment demonstrates
previously unexplored matter-light interaction, while opening up new avenues
towards photon-atom entanglement conversion in quantum technology.
