The CoGeNT collaboration has recently reported a rising low energy spectrum
in their ultra low noise germanium detector. This is particularly interesting
as the energy range probed by CoGeNT overlaps with the energy region in which
DAMA has observed their annual modulation signal. We show that the mirror dark
matter candidate can simultaneously explain both the DAMA annual modulation
signal and the rising low energy spectrum observed by CoGeNT. This constitutes
a model dependent confirmation of the DAMA signal and adds weight to the mirror
dark matter paradigm.
