The electrodynamic properties of Ba(Fe$_{0.92}$Co$_{0.08})_2$As$_{2}$ and
Ba(Fe$_{0.95}$Ni$_{0.05})_As$_{2}$ single crystals have been investigated by
reflectivity measurements in a wide frequency range. In the metallic state, the
optical conductivity consists of a broad incoherent background and a narrow
Drude-like component which determines the transport properties; only the latter
contribution strongly depends on the composition and temperature. This
subsystem reveals a $T^2$ behavior in the dc resistivity and scattering rate
disclosing a hidden Fermi-liquid behavior in the 122 iron-pnictide family. An
extended Drude analysis yields the frequency dependence of the effective mass
(with $m^*/m_b\approx 5$ in the static limit) and scattering rate that does not
disclose a simple power law. The spectral weight shifts to lower energies upon
cooling; a significant fraction is not recovered within the infrared range of
frequencies.
