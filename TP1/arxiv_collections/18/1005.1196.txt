The diffuse meta-galactic radiation field at ultraviolet to infrared
wavelengths - commonly labeled extragalactic background light (EBL) - contains
the integrated emission history of the universe. Difficult to access via direct
observations indirect constraints on its density can be derived through
observations of very-high energy (VHE; E>100 GeV) gamma-rays from distant
sources: the VHE photons are attenuated via pair-production with the low energy
photons from the EBL, leaving a distinct imprint in the VHE spectra measured on
earth. Discoveries made with current generation VHE observatories like H.E.S.S.
and MAGIC enabled strong constraints on the density of the EBL especially in
the near-infrared. In this article the prospect of future VHE observatories to
derive new constraints on the EBL density are discussed. To this end, results
from current generation instruments will be extrapolated to the future
experiment's sensitivity and investigated for their power to enable new methods
and improved constraints on the EBL density.
