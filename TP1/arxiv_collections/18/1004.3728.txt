We study experimentally light localization at phase-slip waveguides and at
the intersection of phase-slips in a two-dimensional (2D) square photonic
lattice. Such system allows to observe a variety of effects, including the
existence of spatially localized modes for low powers, the generation of
strongly localized states in the form of discrete bulk and surface solitons, as
well as a crossover between one-dimensional (1D) and 2D localization.
