We observed the new X-ray transient and black-hole candidate XTE J1652-453
simultaneously with XMM-Newton and the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE). The
observation was done during the decay of the 2009 outburst, when XTE J1652-453
was in the hard-intermediate state. The spectrum shows a strong and broad iron
emission line with an equivalent width of ~ 450 eV. The profile is consistent
with that of a line being produced by reflection off the accretion disk,
broadened by relativistic effects close to the black hole. The best-fitting
inner radius of the accretion disk is ~ 4 gravitational radii. Assuming that
the accretion disk is truncated at the radius of the innermost stable circular
orbit, the black hole in XTE J1652-453 has a spin parameter of ~ 0.5. The power
spectrum of the RXTE observation has an additional variability component above
50 Hz, which is typical for the hard-intermediate state. No coherent
quasi-periodic oscillations at low frequency are apparent in the power
spectrum, which may imply that we view the system at a rather low inclination
angle.
