Fusion excitation functions are measured for the system $^6$Li+$^{28}$Si
using the characteristic $\gamma$-ray method, encompassing both the sub-barrier
and above barrier regions, viz., $E_{lab}$= 7-24 MeV. Two separate experiments
were performed, one for the above barrier region ($E_{lab}$= 11-24 MeV) and
another for the below barrier region ($E_{lab}$= 7-10 MeV). The results were
compared with our previously measured fusion cross section for the
$^7$Li+$^{28}$Si system. We observed enhancement of fusion cross section at
sub-barrier regions for both $^6$Li and $^7$Li, but yield was substantially
larger for $^6$Li. However, for well above barrier regions, similar type of
suppression was identified for both the systems.
