Network epidemiology often assumes that the relationships defining the social
network of a population are static. The dynamics of relationships is only taken
indirectly into account, by assuming that the relevant information to study
epidemic spread is encoded in the network obtained by considering numbers of
partners accumulated over periods of time roughly proportional to the
infectious period of the disease at hand. On the other hand, models explicitly
including social dynamics are often too schematic to provide a reasonable
representation of a real population, or so detailed that no general conclusions
can be drawn from them. Here we present a model of social dynamics that is
general enough that its parameters can be obtained by fitting data from surveys
about sexual behaviour, but that can still be studied analytically, using mean
field techniques. This allows us to obtain some general results about epidemic
spreading. We show that using accumulated network data to estimate the static
epidemic threshold leads to a significant underestimation of it. We also show
that, for a dynamic network, the relative epidemic threshold is an increasing
function of the infectious period of the disease, implying that the static
value is a lower bound to the real threshold.
