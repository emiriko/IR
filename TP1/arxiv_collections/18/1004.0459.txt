In this paper, we suggest a novel data hiding technique in an HTML Web page.
HTML Tags are case insensitive and hence an alphabet in lowercase and one in
uppercase present inside an HTML tag are interpreted in the same manner by the
browser,i.e., change in case in an web page is imperceptible to the browser. We
basically exploit this redundancy and use it to embed secret data inside an web
page, with no changes visible to the user of the web page, so that he can not
even suspect about the data hiding. The embedded data can be recovered by
viewing the source of the HTML page. This technique can easily be extended to
embed secret message inside any piece of source-code where the standard
interpreter of that language is case-insensitive.
