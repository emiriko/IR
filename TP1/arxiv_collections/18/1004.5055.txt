We deal with the problem of assigning electromagnetic moments to a
quasi-stable particle (i.e., a particle with mass located at particle's decay
threshold). In this case, an application of a small external electromagnetic
field changes the energy in a non-analytic way, which makes it difficult to
assign definitive moments. On the example of a spin-1/2 field with mass $M_{*}$
interacting with two fields of masses $M$ and $m$, we show how a conventionally
defined magnetic dipole moment diverges at $M_{*}=M+m$. We then show that the
conventional definition makes sense only when the values of the applied
magnetic field $B$ satisfy $|eB|/2M_{*}\ll|M_{*}-M-m|$. We discuss implications
of these results to existing studies in electroweak theory, chiral
effective-field theory, and lattice QCD.
