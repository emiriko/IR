We perform a detailed study of the renormalization group equations in the
inverse seesaw model. Especially, we derive compact analytical formulas for the
running of the neutrino parameters in the standard model and the minimal
supersymmetric standard model, and illustrate that, due to large Yukawa
coupling corrections, significant running effects on the leptonic mixing angles
can be naturally obtained in the proximity of the electroweak scale, perhaps
even within the reach of the LHC. In general, if the mass spectrum of the light
neutrinos is nearly degenerate, the running effects are enhanced to
experimentally accessible levels, well suitable for the investigation of the
underlying dynamics behind the neutrino mass generation and the lepton flavor
structure. In addition, the effects of the seesaw thresholds are discussed, and
a brief comparison to other seesaw models is carried out.
