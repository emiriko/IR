We propose a scheme for generating Rashba spin-orbit coupling and
perpendicular Zeeman field simultaneously for cold fermionic atoms in a
harmonic trap through the coupling between atoms and laser fields. The
realization of Rashba spin-orbit coupling and perpendicular Zeeman field
provides opportunities for exploring many topological phenomena using cold
fermionic atoms. We focus on the intrinsic anomalous Hall effect and show that
it may be observed through the response of atomic density to a rotation of the
harmonic trap.
