We consider the problem of distributed formation control of a large number of
vehicles. An individual vehicle in the formation is assumed to be a fully
actuated point mass. A distributed control law is examined: the control action
on an individual vehicle depends on (i) its own velocity and (ii) the relative
position measurements with a small subset of vehicles (neighbors) in the
formation. The neighbors are defined according to an information graph.
  In this paper we describe a methodology for modeling, analysis, and
distributed control design of such vehicular formations whose information graph
is a D-dimensional lattice. The modeling relies on an approximation based on a
partial differential equation (PDE) that describes the spatio-temporal
evolution of position errors in the formation. The analysis and control design
is based on the PDE model. We deduce asymptotic formulae for the closed-loop
stability margin (absolute value of the real part of the least stable
eigenvalue) of the controlled formation. The stability margin is shown to
approach 0 as the number of vehicles N goes to infinity. The exponent on the
scaling law for the stability margin is influenced by the dimension and the
structure of the information graph. We show that the scaling law can be
improved by employing a higher dimensional information graph.
  Apart from analysis, the PDE model is used for a mistuning-based design of
control gains to maximize the stability margin. Mistuning here refers to small
perturbation of control gains from their nominal symmetric values. We show that
the mistuned design can have a significantly better stability margin even with
a small amount of perturbation. The results of the analysis with the PDE model
are corroborated with numerical computation of eigenvalues with the state-space
model of the formation.
