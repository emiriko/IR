This work shows that the cryptanalysis of the shrinking generator requires
fewer intercepted bits than what indicated by the linear complexity. Indeed,
whereas the linear complexity of shrunken sequences is between $A \cdot
2^(S-2)$ and $A \cdot 2^(S-1)$, we claim that the initial states of both
component registers are easily computed with less than $A \cdot S$ shrunken
bits. Such a result is proven thanks to the definition of shrunken sequences as
interleaved sequences. Consequently, it is conjectured that this statement can
be extended to all interleaved sequences. Furthermore, this paper confirms that
certain bits of the interleaved sequences have a greater strategic importance
than others, which may be considered as a proof of weakness of interleaved
generators.
