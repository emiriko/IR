We briefly outline shorter and longer term physics motivation for
constructing a dual, fast-cycling superconducting synchrotron accelerator
(DSFMR - Dual Super-Ferric Main Ring) in the Tevatron tunnel at Fermilab. We
discuss using this accelerator as a high-intensity dual neutrino beam source
for the long-baseline neutrino oscillation search experiments, and also as a
fast, dual pre-injector accelerator for the VLHC (Very Large Hadron Collider).
