A new proof of a pathwise uniqueness result of Krylov and R\"{o}ckner is
given. It concerns SDEs with drift having only certain integrability
properties. In spite of the poor regularity of the drift, pathwise continuous
dependence on initial conditions may be obtained, by means of this new proof.
The proof is formulated in such a way to show that the only major tool is a
good regularity theory for the heat equation forced by a function with the same
regularity of the drift.
