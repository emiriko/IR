We report on the experimental realization of an optical analogue of a quantum
geometric potential for light wave packets constrained on thin dielectric
guiding layers fabricated in silica by the femtosecond laser writing
technology. We further demonstrate the optical version of a topological
crystal, with the observation of Bloch oscillations and Zener tunneling of
purely geometric nature.
