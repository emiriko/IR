The neutron detection efficiency of a sampling calorimeter made of 1 mm
diameter scintillating fibers embedded in a lead/bismuth structure has been
measured at the neutron beam of the The Svedberg Laboratory at Uppsala. A
significant enhancement of the detection efficiency with respect to a bulk
organic scintillator detector with the same thickness is observed.
