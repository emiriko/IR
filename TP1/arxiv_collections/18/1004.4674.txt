The properties of linear instabilities in the Large Plasma Device [W.
Gekelman et al., Rev. Sci. Inst., 62, 2875 (1991)] are studied both through
analytic calculations and solving numerically a system of linearized
collisional plasma fluid equations using the 3D fluid code BOUT [M. Umansky et
al., Contrib. Plasma Phys. 180, 887 (2009)], which has been successfully
modified to treat cylindrical geometry. Instability drive from plasma pressure
gradients and flows is considered, focusing on resistive drift waves, the
Kelvin-Helmholtz and rotational interchange instabilities. A general linear
dispersion relation for partially ionized collisional plasmas including these
modes is derived and analyzed. For LAPD relevant profiles including strongly
driven flows it is found that all three modes can have comparable growth rates
and frequencies. Detailed comparison with solutions of the analytic dispersion
relation demonstrates that BOUT accurately reproduces all characteristics of
linear modes in this system.
