The entanglement characteristics including the so-called sudden death effect
between two identical two-level atoms trapped in two separate cavities
connected by an optical fiber are studied. The results show that the time
evolution of entanglement is sensitive not only to the degree of entanglement
of the initial state but also to the ratio between cavity-fiber coupling () and
atom-cavity coupling (). This means that the entanglement dynamics can be
controlled by choosing specific v and g.
