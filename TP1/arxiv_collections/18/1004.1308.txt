The idea of a magnetic axion helioscope was first proposed by Pierre Sikivie
in 1983. Tokyo axion helioscope was built exploiting its detection principle
with a dedicated cryogen-free superconducting magnet and PIN photodiodes for
x-ray detectors. Solar axions, if exist, would be converted into x-ray photons
in the magnetic field. Conversion is coherently enhanced even for massive
axions by filling the conversion region with helium gas. Its start up, search
results so far and prospects are presented.
