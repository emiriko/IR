We describe the impact of the full one-loop electroweak terms of O(alpha_s
alpha_EM^3) entering the electron-positron into three-jet cross-section from
sqrt(s)=M_Z to TeV scale energies. We include both factorisable and
non-factorisable virtual corrections and photon bremsstrahlung. Their
importance for the measurement of alpha_S from jet rates and shape variables is
explained qualitatively and illustrated quantitatively, also in presence of
b-tagging.
