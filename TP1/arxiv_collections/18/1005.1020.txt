We investigate the dynamics of spreading of a small liquid droplet in gas in
a one-component simple fluid, where the temperature is inhomogeneous around
0.9Tc and latent heat is released or generated at the interface upon
evaporation or condensation (with Tc being the critical temperature). In the
scheme of the dynamic van der Waals theory, the hydrodynamic equations
containing the gradient stress are solved in the axisymmetric geometry. We
assume that the substrate has a finite thickness and its temperature obeys the
thermal diffusion equation. A precursor film then spreads ahead of the bulk
droplet itself in the complete wetting condition. Cooling the substrate
enhances condensation of gas onto the advancing film, which mostly takes place
near the film edge and can be the dominant mechanism of the film growth in a
late stage. The generated latent heat produces a temperature peak or a hot spot
in the gas region near the film edge. On the other hand, heating the substrate
induces evaporation all over the interface. For weak heating, a steady-state
circular thin film can be formed on the substrate. For stronger heating,
evaporation dominates over condensation, leading to eventual disappearance of
the liquid region.
