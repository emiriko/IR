The last decade has shown us that the observational properties of neutron
stars are remarkably diverse. From magnetars to rotating radio transients, from
radio pulsars to `isolated neutron stars,' from central compact objects to
millisecond pulsars, observational manifestations of neutron stars are
surprisingly varied, with most properties totally unpredicted. The challenge is
to establish an overarching physical theory of neutron stars and their birth
properties that can explain this great diversity. Here I survey the disparate
neutron stars classes, describe their properties, and highlight results made
possible by the Chandra X-ray Observatory, in celebration of its tenth
anniversary. Finally, I describe the current status of efforts at physical
`grand unification' of this wealth of observational phenomena, and comment on
possibilities for Chandra's next decade in this field.
