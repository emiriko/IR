We study transition form factors for radiative and rare semi-leptonic B-meson
decays into light pseudoscalar or vector mesons, combining theoretical
constraints and phenomenological information from Lattice QCD, light-cone sum
rules, and dispersive bounds. We pay particular attention to form factor
parameterisations which are based on the so-called series expansion, and study
the related systematic uncertainties on a quantitative level. In this context,
we also provide the NLO corrections to the correlation function between two
flavour-changing tensor currents, which enters the unitarity constraints for
the coefficients in the series expansion.
