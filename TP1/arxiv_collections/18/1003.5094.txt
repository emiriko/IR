We have reinvestigated the B-X and C-X band systems of CuCl by recording the
laser-induced fluorescence excitation spectra in 20400-21800 cm^{-1}. The
rotational analyses in Hund's case (a) revealed unambiguously a
singlet-to-singlet transition nature. The measured lifetimes of a few
microseconds seem too long for singlets and too short for triplets, which we
think is actually in favor of a picture of singlet ({1}^Pi and
{1}^Sigma^{+})-triplet ({3}^Pi_{0,1,2}) mixed states in the B and C band
systems of CuCl. The two excited states we observed in our spectra may be the
singlets that have been strongly "contaminated" by their triplet neighbors.
