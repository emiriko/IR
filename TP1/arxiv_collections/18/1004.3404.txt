The charge asymmetry in W + jets production at the LHC can serve to calibrate
the presence of New Physics contributions. We study the ratio {\sigma}(W^+ + n
jets)/{\sigma}(W^- + n jets) in the Standard Model for n <= 4, paying
particular attention to the uncertainty in the prediction from higher-order
perturbative corrections and uncertainties in parton distribution functions. We
show that these uncertainties are generally of order a few percent, making the
experimental measurement of the charge asymmetry ratio a particularly useful
diagnostic tool for New Physics contributions.
