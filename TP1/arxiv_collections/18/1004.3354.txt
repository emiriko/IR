We present a parallel computation scheme based on the Arnoldi algorithm for
exact diagonalization of quantum-electron models. It contains a selective data
transferring method and distributed storage format for efficient computing of
the matrix-vector product on distributed computing systems. The performed
numerical experiments demonstrated good performance and scalability of our
eigenvalue solver. The developed technique has been applied to investigate the
electronic properties of Sr2RuO4 at experimental temperatures. The role of the
spin-flip term in the electronic Hamiltonian was analyzed.
