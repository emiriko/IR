The Dirichlet series $L_m(s)$ are of fundamental importance in number theory.
Shanks defined the generalized Euler and class numbers in connection with these
Dirichlet series, denoted by $\{s_{m,n}\}_{n\geq 0}$. We obtain a formula for
the exponential generating function $s_m(x)$ of $s_{m,n}$, where m is an
arbitrary positive integer. In particular, for m>1, say, $m=bu^2$, where b is
square-free and u>1, we prove that $s_m(x)$ can be expressed as a linear
combination of the four functions $w(b,t)\sec (btx)(\pm \cos ((b-p)tx)\pm \sin
(ptx))$, where p is an integer satisfying $0\leq p\leq b$, $t|u^2$ and
$w(b,t)=K_bt/u$ with $K_b$ being a constant depending on b. Moreover, the
Dirichlet series $L_m(s)$ can be easily computed from the generating function
formula for $s_m(x)$. Finally, we show that the main ingredient in the formula
for $s_{m,n}$ has a combinatorial interpretation in terms of the m-signed
permutations defined by Ehrenborg and Readdy. In principle, this answers a
question posed by Shanks concerning a combinatorial interpretation for the
numbers $s_{m,n}$.
