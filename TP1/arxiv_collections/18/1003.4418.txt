Dynamic web applications such as mashups need efficient access to web data
that is only accessible via entity search engines (e.g. product or publication
search engines). However, most current mashup systems and applications only
support simple keyword searches for retrieving data from search engines. We
propose the use of more powerful search strategies building on so-called query
generators. For a given set of entities query generators are able to
automatically determine a set of search queries to retrieve these entities from
an entity search engine. We demonstrate the usefulness of query generators for
on-demand web data integration and evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of
query generators for a challenging real-world integration scenario.
