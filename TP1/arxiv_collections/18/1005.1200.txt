This paper proposes a more comprehensive evaluation methodology to measure
the usability and user experience qualities of accessible synchronous
computer-mediated communication applications. The methodology goes beyond
current practices by evaluating how the interaction between a user and a
product influences the user experience of those at the other endpoint of the
communication channel. A major contribution is given with the proposal of a
user test where one of the participants tries to guess whether the other
participant has a disability or not. The proposed test is inspired in the
Turing Test, and is a consequence of user requirements elicited from a group of
individuals with motor and speech disabilities. These ideas are tested and
validated with two examples of synchronous communication applications.
