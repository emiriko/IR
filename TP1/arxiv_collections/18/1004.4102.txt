Following an extremely interesting idea \cite{R1}, published long ago, the
work function associated with the emission of ultra-relativistic electrons from
magnetically deformed metallic crystal of astrophysical relevance is obtained
using relativistic version of Thomas-Fermi type model. In the present scenario,
surprisingly, the work function becomes anisotropic; the longitudinal part is
an increasing function of magnetic field strength, whereas the transverse part
diverges.
