Index Coding has received considerable attention recently motivated in part
by real-world applications and in part by its connection to Network Coding. The
basic setting of Index Coding encodes the problem input as an undirected graph
and the fundamental parameter is the broadcast rate $\beta$, the average
communication cost per bit for sufficiently long messages (i.e. the non-linear
vector capacity). Recent nontrivial bounds on $\beta$ were derived from the
study of other Index Coding capacities (e.g. the scalar capacity $\beta_1$) by
Bar-Yossef et al (2006), Lubetzky and Stav (2007) and Alon et al (2008).
However, these indirect bounds shed little light on the behavior of $\beta$:
there was no known polynomial-time algorithm for approximating $\beta$ in a
general network to within a nontrivial (i.e. $o(n)$) factor, and the exact
value of $\beta$ remained unknown for any graph where Index Coding is
nontrivial.
  Our main contribution is a direct information-theoretic analysis of the
broadcast rate $\beta$ using linear programs, in contrast to previous
approaches that compared $\beta$ with graph-theoretic parameters. This allows
us to resolve the aforementioned two open questions. We provide a
polynomial-time algorithm with a nontrivial approximation ratio for computing
$\beta$ in a general network along with a polynomial-time decision procedure
for recognizing instances with $\beta=2$. In addition, we pinpoint $\beta$
precisely for various classes of graphs (e.g. for various Cayley graphs of
cyclic groups) thereby simultaneously improving the previously known upper and
lower bounds for these graphs. Via this approach we construct graphs where the
difference between $\beta$ and its trivial lower bound is linear in the number
of vertices and ones where $\beta$ is uniformly bounded while its upper bound
derived from the naive encoding scheme is polynomially worse.
