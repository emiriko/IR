The Witten Laplacian in one dimension is studied further by methods of
resurgent analysis in order to approach Fukaya's conjectures relating WKB
asymptotics and disc instantons. In this paper more precise connection formulae
are presented, which allows the calculation of a subdominant exponential term
in the hyperasymptotic expansion of a low-lying eigenvalue. Calculation of
eigenfunctions corresponding to low-lying eigenvalues is presented in two
examples.
