We use an almost model-independent analytical parameterization for $pp$ and
$\bar{p}p$ elastic scattering data to analyze the eikonal, profile, and
inelastic overlap functions in the impact parameter space. Error propagation in
the fit parameters allows estimations of uncertainty regions, improving the
geometrical description of the hadron-hadron interaction. Several predictions
are shown and, in particular, the prediction for $pp$ inelastic overlap
function at $\sqrt{s}=14$ TeV shows the saturation of the Froissart-Martin
bound at LHC energies.
