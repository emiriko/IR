Extrasolar planet host stars have been found to be enriched in key
planet-building elements. These enrichments have the potential to drastically
alter the composition of material available for terrestrial planet formation.
Here we report on the combination of dynamical models of late-stage terrestrial
planet formation within known extrasolar planetary systems with chemical
equilibrium models of the composition of solid material within the disk. This
allows us to determine the bulk elemental composition of simulated extrasolar
terrestrial planets. A wide variety of resulting planetary compositions are
found, ranging from those that are essentially "Earth-like", containing
metallic Fe and Mg-silicates, to those that are dominated by graphite and SiC.
This shows that a diverse range of terrestrial planets may exist within
extrasolar planetary systems.
