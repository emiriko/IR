We construct two families of deterministic sensing matrices where the columns
are obtained by exponentiating codewords in the quaternary Delsarte-Goethals
code $DG(m,r)$. This method of construction results in sensing matrices with
low coherence and spectral norm. The first family, which we call
Delsarte-Goethals frames, are $2^m$ - dimensional tight frames with redundancy
$2^{rm}$. The second family, which we call Delsarte-Goethals sieves, are
obtained by subsampling the column vectors in a Delsarte-Goethals frame.
Different rows of a Delsarte-Goethals sieve may not be orthogonal, and we
present an effective algorithm for identifying all pairs of non-orthogonal
rows. The pairs turn out to be duplicate measurements and eliminating them
leads to a tight frame. Experimental results suggest that all $DG(m,r)$ sieves
with $m\leq 15$ and $r\geq2$ are tight-frames; there are no duplicate rows. For
both families of sensing matrices, we measure accuracy of reconstruction
(statistical 0-1 loss) and complexity (average reconstruction time) as a
function of the sparsity level $k$. Our results show that DG frames and sieves
outperform random Gaussian matrices in terms of noiseless and noisy signal
recovery using the LASSO.
