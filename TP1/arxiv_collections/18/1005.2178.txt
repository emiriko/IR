A system of periodic poly-disperse coated nano-rods is considered. Both the
coated nano-rods and host material are non-magnetic. The exterior nano-coating
has a frequency dependent dielectric constant and the rod has a high dielectric
constant. A negative effective magnetic permeability is generated near the Mie
resonances of the rods while the coating generates a negative permittivity
through a field resonance controlled by the plasma frequency of the coating and
the geometry of the crystal. The explicit band structure for the system is
calculated in the sub-wavelength limit. Tunable pass bands exhibiting negative
group velocity are generated and correspond to simultaneously negative
effective dielectric permittivity and magnetic permeability. These can be
explicitly controlled by adjusting the distance between rods, the coating
thickness, and rod diameters.
