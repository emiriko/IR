The low-frequency magneto-optical properties of bilayer Bernal graphene are
studied by the tight-binding model with four most important interlayer
interactions taken into account. Since the main features of the wave functions
are well depicted, the Landau levels can be divided into two groups based on
the characteristics of the wave functions. These Landau levels lead to four
categories of absorption peaks in the optical absorption spectra. Such
absorption peaks own complex optical selection rules and these rules can be
reasonably explained by the characteristics of the wave functions. In addition,
twin-peak structures, regular frequency-dependent absorption rates and complex
field-dependent frequencies are also obtained in this work. The main features
of the absorption peaks are very different from those in monolayer graphene and
have their origin in the interlayer interactions.
