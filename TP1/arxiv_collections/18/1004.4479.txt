The decay of an excited atom in the presence of a medium that both scatters
and absorbs radiation is studied with the help of a quantum-electrodynamical
model. The medium is represented by a half space filled with a randomly
distributed set of non-overlapping spheres, which consist of a linear
absorptive dielectric material. The absorption effects are described by means
of a quantized damped-polariton theory. It is found that the effective
susceptibility of the bulk does not fully account for the medium-induced change
in the atomic decay rate. In fact, surface effects contribute to the
modification of the decay properties as well. The interplay of scattering and
absorption in the total decay rate is discussed.
