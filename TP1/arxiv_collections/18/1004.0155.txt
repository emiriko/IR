We introduce a notion of chain of evolution algebras. The sequence of
matrices of the structural constants for this chain of evolution algebras
satisfies an analogue of Chapman-Kolmogorov equation. We give several examples
(time homogenous, time non-homogenous, periodic, etc.) of such chains. For a
periodic chain of evolution algebras we construct a continuum set of
non-isomorphic evolution algebras and show that the corresponding discrete time
chain of evolution algebras is dense in the set. We obtain a criteria for an
evolution algebra to be baric and give a concept of a property transition. For
several chains of evolution algebras we describe the behavior of the baric
property depending on the time. For a chain of evolution algebras given by the
matrix of a two-state evolution we define a baric property controller function
and under some conditions on this controller we prove that the chain is not
baric almost surely (with respect to Lebesgue measure). We also construct
examples of the almost surely baric chains of evolution algebras. We show that
there are chains of evolution algebras such that if it has a unique (resp.
infinitely many) absolute nilpotent element at a fixed time, then it has unique
(resp. infinitely many) absolute nilpotent element any time; also there are
chains of evolution algebras which have not such property. For an example of
two dimensional chain of evolution algebras we give the full set of idempotent
elements and show that for some values of parameters the number of idempotent
elements does not depend on time, but for other values of parameters there is a
critical time $t_{c}$ such that the chain has only two idempotent elements if
time $t\geq t_{\rm c}$ and it has four idempotent elements if time $t< t_{\rm
c}$
