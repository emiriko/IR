Size-Change Termination (SCT) is a method of proving program termination
based on the impossibility of infinite descent. To this end we may use a
program abstraction in which transitions are described by monotonicity
constraints over (abstract) variables. When only constraints of the form x>y'
and x>=y' are allowed, we have size-change graphs. Both theory and practice are
now more evolved in this restricted framework then in the general framework of
monotonicity constraints. This paper shows that it is possible to extend and
adapt some theory from the domain of size-change graphs to the general case,
thus complementing previous work on monotonicity constraints. In particular, we
present precise decision procedures for termination; and we provide a procedure
to construct explicit global ranking functions from monotonicity constraints in
singly-exponential time, which is better than what has been published so far
even for size-change graphs.
