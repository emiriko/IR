In this paper different types of compositions involving independent
fractional Brownian motions B^j_{H_j}(t), t>0, j=1,$ are examined. The partial
differential equations governing the distributions of
I_F(t)=B^1_{H_1}(|B^2_{H_2}(t)|), t>0 and
J_F(t)=B^1_{H_1}(|B^2_{H_2}(t)|^{1/H_1}), t>0 are derived by different methods
and compared with those existing in the literature and with those related to
B^1(|B^2_{H_2}(t)|), t>0. The process of iterated Brownian motion I^n_F(t), t>0
is examined in detail and its moments are calculated. Furthermore for
J^{n-1}_F(t)=B^1_{H}(|B^2_H(...|B^n_H(t)|^{1/H}...)|^{1/H}), t>0 the following
factorization is proved J^{n-1}_F(t)=\prod_{j=1}^{n} B^j_{\frac{H}{n}}(t), t>0.
A series of compositions involving Cauchy processes and fractional Brownian
motions are also studied and the corresponding non-homogeneous wave equations
are derived.
