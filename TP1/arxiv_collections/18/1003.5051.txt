We report on numerical simulations of the dynamics of a test particle coupled
to competing Boltzmann heat baths of finite size. After discussing some
features of the single bath case, we show that the presence of two heat baths
further constraints the conditions necessary for the test particle to
thermalize with the heat baths. We find that thermalization is a spectral
property in which the oscillators of the bath with frequencies in the range of
the test particle characteristic frequency determine its degree of
thermalization. We also find an unexpected frequency shift of the test particle
response with respect to the spectra of the two heat baths. Finally, we discuss
implications of our results for the study of high-frequency nanomechanical
resonators through cold damping cooling techniques, and for engineering
reservoirs capable of mitigating the back-action on a mechanical system.
