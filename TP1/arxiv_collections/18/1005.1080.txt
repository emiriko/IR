Recently, several authors studied small quantum systems weakly coupled to
free boson or fermion fields at positive temperature. All the approaches we are
aware of employ complex deformations of Liouvillians or Mourre theory (the
infinitesimal version of the former). We present an approach based on polymer
expansions of statistical mechanics. Despite the fact that our approach is
elementary, our results are slightly sharper than those contained in the
literature up to now. We show that, whenever the small quantum system is known
to admit a Markov approximation (Pauli master equation \emph{aka} Lindblad
equation) in the weak coupling limit, and the Markov approximation is
exponentially mixing, then the weakly coupled system approaches a unique
invariant state that is perturbatively close to its Markov approximation.
