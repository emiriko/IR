In mobile database environments, multiple users may access similar data items
irrespective of their physical location leading to concurrent access anomalies.
As disconnections and mobility are the common characteristics in mobile
environment, performing concurrent access to a particular data item leads to
inconsistency. Most of the approaches use locking mechanisms to achieve
concurrency control. However this leads to increase in blocking and abort rate.
In this paper an optimistic concurrency control strategy using on-demand
multicasting is proposed for mobile database environments which guarantees
consistency and introduces application-specific conflict detection and
resolution strategies. The simulation results specify increase in system
throughput by reducing the transaction abort rates as compared to the other
optimistic strategies proposed in literature.
