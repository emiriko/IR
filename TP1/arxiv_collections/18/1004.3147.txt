This thesis investigates the use of problem-specific knowledge to enhance a
genetic algorithm approach to multiple-choice optimisation problems.It shows
that such information can significantly enhance performance, but that the
choice of information and the way it is included are important factors for
success.Two multiple-choice problems are considered.The first is constructing a
feasible nurse roster that considers as many requests as possible.In the second
problem, shops are allocated to locations in a mall subject to constraints and
maximising the overall income.Genetic algorithms are chosen for their
well-known robustness and ability to solve large and complex discrete
optimisation problems.However, a survey of the literature reveals room for
further research into generic ways to include constraints into a genetic
algorithm framework.Hence, the main theme of this work is to balance
feasibility and cost of solutions.In particular, co-operative co-evolution with
hierarchical sub-populations, problem structure exploiting repair schemes and
indirect genetic algorithms with self-adjusting decoder functions are
identified as promising approaches.The research starts by applying standard
genetic algorithms to the problems and explaining the failure of such
approaches due to epistasis.To overcome this, problem-specific information is
added in a variety of ways, some of which are designed to increase the number
of feasible solutions found whilst others are intended to improve the quality
of such solutions.As well as a theoretical discussion as to the underlying
reasons for using each operator,extensive computational experiments are carried
out on a variety of data.These show that the indirect approach relies less on
problem structure and hence is easier to implement and superior in solution
quality.
