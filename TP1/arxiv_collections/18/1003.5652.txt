Spin foams of 4d gravity were recently extended from complexes with purely
spacelike surfaces to complexes that also contain timelike surfaces. In this
article, we express the associated partition function in terms of vertex
amplitudes and integrals over coherent states. The coherent states are
characterized by unit 3--vectors which represent normals to surfaces and lie
either in the 2--sphere or the 2d hyperboloids. In the case of timelike
surfaces, a new type of coherent state is used and the associated completeness
relation is derived. It is also shown that the quantum simplicity constraints
can be deduced by three different methods: by weak imposition of the
constraints, by restriction of coherent state bases and by the master
constraint.
