We analyze a data set comprised of academic records of undergraduates at the
University of Oregon from 2000-2004. We find correlations of roughly 0.35 to
0.5 between SAT scores and upper division, in-major GPA (henceforth, GPA).
Interestingly, low SAT scores do not preclude high performance in most majors.
That is, the distribution of SAT scores after conditioning on high GPA (e.g.,
3.5 or even 4.0) typically extends below 1000 (the average among test takers).
We hypothesize that "overachievers" overcome cognitive deficits through hard
work, and discuss to what extent they can be identified from high school
records. Only a few majors seem to exhibit a "cognitive threshold" -- such that
high GPA (mastery of the subject matter) is very unlikely below a certain SAT
threshold (i.e., no matter how dedicated or hard working the student). Our
results suggest that almost any student admitted to university can achieve
academic success, if they work hard enough. In addition to our primary result,
we find that the best predictor of GPA is a roughly equally weighted sum of SAT
and high school GPA, measured in standard deviation units. Using a
sub-population of honors college students, we can estimate how students at
elite universities would fare at a typical state university, allowing us to
comment on issues such as grade inflation. Finally, we observe that 1) SAT
scores fluctuate little on retest (very high reliability), 2) SAT and GRE
scores (where available) correlate at roughly 0.75 (consistent with the notion
that both tests measure a stable general cognitive ability) and 3) the SAT
distribution of students that obtained a degree does not differ substantially
from that of the entering class.
