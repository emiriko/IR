Intrusion Detection & Prevention Systems generally aims at detecting /
preventing attacks against Information systems and networks. The basic task of
IDPS is to monitor network & system traffic for any malicious packets/patterns
and hence to prevent any unwarranted incidents which leads the systems to
insecure state. The monitoring is done by checking each packet for its validity
against the signatures formulated for identified vulnerabilities. Since,
signatures are the heart & soul of an Intrusion Detection and Prevention System
(IDPS), we, in this paper, discuss two methodologies we adapted in our research
effort to improve the current Intrusion Detection and Prevention (IDP) systems.
The first methodology RUDRAA is for formulating, verifying & validating the
potential signatures to be used with IDPS. The second methodology DSP-FED is
aimed at processing the signatures in less time with our proposed fast
elimination method using DFA. The research objectives of this project are 1) To
formulate & process potential IPS signatures to be used with Intrusion
prevention system. 2) To propose a DFA based approach for signature processing
which, upon a pattern match, could process the signatures faster else could
eliminate it efficiently if not matched
