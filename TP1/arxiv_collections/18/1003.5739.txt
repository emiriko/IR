We prove the Strengthened Hanna Neumann Conjecture, in its common graph
theoretic formulation. Our original approach to this conjecture used cohomology
of sheaves on graphs, although here we give a short combinatorial proof that we
found in a succession of simplifications of the cohomological approach. Our
proof is inductive, and requires Tardos' previous result settling the rank two
case of the conjecture.
