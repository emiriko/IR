A technique to study the dynamics of solving of a research task is suggested.
The research task was based on specially developed software Right- Wrong
Responder (RWR), with the participants having to reveal the response logic of
the program. The participants interacted with the program in the form of a
semi-binary dialogue, which implies the feedback responses of only two kinds -
"right" or "wrong". The technique has been applied to a small pilot group of
volunteer participants. Some of them have successfully solved the task
(solvers) and some have not (non-solvers). In the beginning of the work, the
solvers did more wrong moves than non-solvers, and they did less wrong moves
closer to the finish of the work. A phase portrait of the work both in solvers
and non-solvers showed definite cycles that may correspond to sequences of
partially true hypotheses that may be formulated by the participants during the
solving of the task.
