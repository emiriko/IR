The effect of molecule size (excluded volume) and the range of interaction on
the surface tension, phase diagram and nucleation properties of a model
globular protein is investigated using a combinations of Monte Carlo
simulations and finite temperature classical Density Functional Theory
calculations. We use a parametrized potential that can vary smoothly from the
standard Lennard-Jones interaction characteristic of simple fluids, to the ten
Wolde-Frenkel model for the effective interaction of globular proteins in
solution. We find that the large excluded volume characteristic of large
macromolecules such as proteins is the dominant effect in determining the
liquid-vapor surface tension and nucleation properties. The variation of the
range of the potential only appears important in the case of small excluded
volumes such as for simple fluids. The DFT calculations are then used to study
homogeneous nucleation of the high-density phase from the low-density phase
including the nucleation barriers, nucleation pathways and the rate. It is
found that the nucleation barriers are typically only a few $k_{B}T$ and that
the nucleation rates substantially higher than would be predicted by Classical
Nucleation Theory.
