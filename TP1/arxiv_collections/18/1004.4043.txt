The shear viscosity $\eta $ of a quantum liquid in the vicinity of
$T_{\lambda}$ is examined. In liquid helium 4 above $T_{\lambda}$
($T_{\lambda}<T<3.7K$), under a strong effect of Bose statistics, the coherent
many-body wave function grows to an intermediate size between a macroscopic
level and a microscopic one. These wave functions are qualitatively different
from thermal fluctuation, and manifest themselves in the gradual decrease in
shear viscosity above $T_{\lambda}$. To formulate this phenomenon, we combine
the correlation function with fluid dynamics. Applying the Kramers-Kronig
relation to the generalized Poiseuille's formula for capillary flow, we perform
a perturbation calculation of the reciprocal $1/\eta $ with respect to the
particle interaction, and examine how the growth of coherent wave functions
gradually decreases shear viscosity. Comparing with the experimentally
determined $\eta (T)$, $\hat {\rho\cdot}_s(T)/\rho\cdot$ of such a mesoscopic
condensate is estimated to reach $10^{-5}$ just above $T_{\lambda}$. We examine
the effect of condensate size on the stability of such a superflow, and touch
upon the superflow in porous media.
