In the vicinity of boundaries the bulk universality class of critical
phenomena splits into several boundary universality classes, depending upon
whether the tendency to order in the boundary is smaller or larger than in the
bulk. For Ising universality class there are five different boundary
universality classes: periodic, antiperiodic, free, fixed and mixed (mixture of
the last two). In this paper we present the new set of the universal amplitude
ratios for the mixed boundary universality class. The results are in perfect
agreement with a perturbated conformal field theory scenario proposed by Cardy
\cite{cardy86}.
