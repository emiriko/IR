Starting from the pioneering works on software architecture precious
guidelines have emerged to indicate how computer programs should be organized.
For example the "separation of concerns" suggests to split a program into
modules that overlap in functionality as little as possible. However these
recommendations are mainly conceptual and are thus hard to express in a
quantitative form. Hence software architecture relies on the individual
experience and skill of the designers rather than on quantitative laws. In this
article I apply the methods developed for the classification of information on
the World-Wide-Web to study the organization of Open Source programs in an
attempt to establish the statistical laws governing software architecture.
