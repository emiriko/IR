We investigate creation, manipulation, and steering of entanglement in spin
chains from the viewpoint of quantum communication between distant parties. We
demonstrate how global parametric driving of the spin-spin coupling and/or
local time-dependent Zeeman fields produce a large amount of entanglement
between the first and the last spin of the chain. This occurs whenever the
driving frequency meets a resonance condition, identified as "entanglement
resonance". Our approach marks a promising step towards an efficient quantum
state transfer or teleportation in solid state system. Following the reasoning
of Zueco et al. [1], we propose generation and routing of multipartite
entangled states by use of symmetric tree-like structures of spin chains.
Furthermore, we study the effect of decoherence on the resulting spin
entanglement between the corresponding terminal spins.
