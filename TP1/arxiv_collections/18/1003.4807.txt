Contribution of simplest loops for hadron-nucleus scattering cross-sections
is studied in the Local Reggeon Field Theory with a supercritical pomeron. It
is shown that inside the nucleus the supercritical pomeron transforms into a
subcritical one, so that perturbative treatment becomes possible. The pomeron
intercept becomes complex, which leads to oscillations in the cross-sections.
