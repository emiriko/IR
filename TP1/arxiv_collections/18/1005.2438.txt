There has been considerable recent interest in the consequences of closed
timelike curves (CTCs) for the dynamics of quantum mechanical systems. A vast
majority of research into this area makes use of the dynamical equations
developed by Deutsch, which were developed from a consistency condition that
assumes that mixed quantum states uniquely describe the physical state of a
system. We criticise this choice of consistency condition from an epistemic
perspective, i.e., a perspective in which the quantum state represents a state
of knowledge about a system. We demonstrate that directly applying Deutsch's
condition when mixed states are treated as representing an observer's knowledge
of a system can conceal time travel paradoxes from the observer, rather than
resolving them. To shed further light on the appropriate dynamics for quantum
systems traversing CTCs, we make use of a toy epistemic theory with a strictly
classical ontology due to Spekkens and show that, in contrast to the results of
Deutsch, many of the traditional paradoxical effects of time travel are
present.
