The foaming properties, foaming capacity and foam stability, of soluble
complexes of pectin and a globular protein, napin, have been investigated with
a "Foamscan" apparatus. Complementary, we also used SANS with a recent method
consisting in an analogy between the SANS by foams and the neutron reflectivity
of films to measure in situ film thickness of foams. The effect of ionic
strength, of protein concentration and of charge density of the pectin has been
analysed. Whereas the foam stability is improved for samples containing soluble
complexes, no effect has been noticed on the foam film thickness, which is
almost around 315 {\AA} whatever the samples. These results let us specify the
role of each specie in the mixture: free proteins contribute to the foaming
capacity, provided the initial free protein content in the bulk is sufficient
to allow the foam formation, and soluble complexes slow down the drainage by
their presence in the Plateau borders, which finally results in the
stabilisation of foams.
