We calculate the effect of local magnetic moments on the electron-phonon
coupling in BaFe$_{2}$As$_{2}+\delta$ using the density functional perturbation
theory. We show that the magnetism enhances the total electron-phonon coupling
by $\sim 50%$, up to $\lambda \lesssim 0.35$, still not enough to explain the
high critical temperature, but strong enough to have a non-negligible effect on
superconductivity, for instance, by frustrating the coupling with spin
fluctuations and inducing order parameter nodes. The enhancement comes mostly
from a renormalization of the electron-phonon matrix elements. We also
investigate, in the rigid band approximation, the effect of doping, and find
that $\lambda$ versus doping does not mirror the behavior of the density of
states; while the latter decreases upon electron doping, the former does not,
and even increases slightly.
