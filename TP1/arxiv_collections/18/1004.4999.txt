The situational analysis lies in the basis of space and ground-based
experiment planning. It is connected with the use of complex computation models
of environment and with verification of the restricting conditions, due to the
character of the conducted experiments and the solved scientific tasks. The
present work proposes a formulation of the situational analysis on the basis of
the finite abstract automata theory. On this basis, optimization of the
situational analysis is suggested by formal schemes for adaptation to the
conditions of the model environment. The efficiency enhancement is illustrated
by results from the application of the proposed real-time optimization for
photometric system control.
