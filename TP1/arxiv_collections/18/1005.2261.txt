It is shown that the Pioneer anomaly is a natural consequence of variable
speed of light cosmological models wherein the speed of light is assumed to be
a power-law function of the scale factor (or cosmic time). In other words, the
Pioneer anomaly can be regarded as a non-gravitational effect of the
continuously decreasing speed of light which indicates itself as an anomalous
light propagation time delay in local frames. This time delay is accordingly
interpreted as an additional Doppler blue shift.
