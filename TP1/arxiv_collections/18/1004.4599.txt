We investigate the question of whether the entropy and the Renyi entropies of
the vacuum state reduced to a region of the space can be represented in terms
of correlators in quantum field theory. In this case, the positivity relations
for the correlators are mapped into inequalities for the entropies. We write
them using a real time version of reflection positivity, which can be
generalized to general quantum systems. Using this generalization we can prove
an infinite sequence of inequalities which are obeyed by the Renyi entropies of
integer index. There is one independent inequality involving any number of
different subsystems. In quantum field theory the inequalities acquire a simple
geometrical form and are consistent with the integer index Renyi entropies
being given by vacuum expectation values of twisting operators in the Euclidean
formulation. Several possible generalizations and specific examples are
analyzed.
