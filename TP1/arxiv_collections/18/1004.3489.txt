We studied 16 sunspots with different sizes and shapes using the observations
with the Hinode Solar Optical Telescope. The ratio of G-band and CaII H images
reveal rich structures both within the umbra and penumbra of most spots. The
striking features are the compact blob at the foot point of the umbra side of
the penumbral fibrils with disk center-limb side asymmetry. In this paper, we
present properties of these features using the spectropolarimetry and images in
G-band, CaII and blue filters. We discuss the results using the contemporary
models of the sunspots.
