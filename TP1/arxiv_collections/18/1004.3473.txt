I review lattice calculations and results for hadronic parameters relevant
for kaon physics, in particular the vector form factor f+(0) of semileptonic
kaon decays, the ratio fK/fpi of leptonic decay constants and the kaon bag
parameter BK. For each lattice calculation a colour code rating is assigned, by
following a procedure which is being proposed by the Flavianet Lattice
Averaging Group (FLAG), and the following final averages are obtained:
f+(0)=0.962(3)(4), fK/fpi = 1.196(1)(10) and \hat BK = 0.731(7)(35). In the
last part of the talk, the present status of lattice studies of non-leptonic
K--> pi pi decays is also briefly summarized.
