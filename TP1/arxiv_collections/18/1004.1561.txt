This paper deals with the modeling of the interstellar hydrogen atoms (H
atoms) distribution in the heliosphere. We study influence of the heliospheric
interface, that is the region of the interaction between solar wind and local
interstellar medium, on the distribution of the hydrogen atoms in vicinity of
the Sun. The distribution of H atoms obtained in the frame of the
self-consistent kinetic-gasdynamic model of the heliospheric interface is
compared with a simplified model which assumes Maxwellian distribution of H
atoms at the termination shock and is called often as 'hot' model. This
comparison shows that the distribution of H atoms is significantly affected by
the heliospheric interface not only at large heliocentric distances, but also
in vicinity of the Sun at 1-5 AU. Hence, for analysis of experimental data
connected with direct or undirect measurements of the interstellar atoms one
necessarily needs to take into account effects of the heliospheric interface.
In this paper we propose a new model that is relatively simple but takes into
account all major effects of the heliospheric interface. This model can be
applied for analysis of backscattered Ly-alpha radiation data obtained on board
of different spacecraft.
