We develop a framework based on differential equations (DE) and differential
inclusions (DI) for analyzing Random Network Coding (RNC), as well as a
nonlinear variant referred to as Random Coupon (RC), in a wireless network. The
DEDI framework serves as a powerful numerical and analytical tool to study RNC.
We demonstrate its versatility by proving theoretical results on multicast
information flows in a wireless network using RNC or RC. We also demonstrate
the accuracy and flexibility of the performance analysis enabled by this
framework via illustrative examples of networks with multiple multicast
sessions, user cooperation and arbitrary topologies.
