The first study of quasi-free Compton scattering on the neutron in the energy
range of $E_{\gamma}=0.75 - 1.5$ GeV is presented. The data reveals a narrow
peak at $W\sim 1.685$ GeV. This result, being considered in conjunction with
the recent evidence for a narrow structure at $W\sim 1.68$GeV in the $\eta$
photoproduction on the neutron, suggests the existence of a new nucleon
resonance with unusual properties: the mass $M\sim 1.685$GeV, the narrow width
$\Gamma \leq 30$MeV, and the much stronger photoexcitation on the neutron than
on the proton.
