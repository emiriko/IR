The mapping between genotype and phenotype is encoded in the complex web of
epistatic interaction between genetic loci. In this rugged fitness landscape,
recombination processes, which tend to increase variation in the population,
compete with selection processes that tend to reduce genetic variation. Here we
show that the Bose-Einstein distribution describe the multiple stationary
states of a diploid population under this multi-loci evolutionary dynamics.
Moreover, the evolutionary process might undergo an interesting condensation
phase transition in the universality class of a Bose-Einstein condensation when
a finite fraction of pairs of linked loci, is fixed into given allelic states.
Below this phase transition the genetic variation within a species is
significantly reduced and only maintained by the remaining polymorphic loci.
