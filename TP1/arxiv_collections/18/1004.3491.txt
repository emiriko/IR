The homogeneous isotropic Boltzmann equation (HIBE) is a fundamental dynamic
model for many applications in thermodynamics, econophysics and sociodynamics.
Despite recent hardware improvements, the solution of the Boltzmann equation
remains extremely challenging from the computational point of view, in
particular by deterministic methods (free of stochastic noise). This work aims
to improve a deterministic direct method recently proposed [V.V. Aristov,
Kluwer Academic Publishers, 2001] for solving the HIBE with a generic
collisional kernel and, in particular, for taking care of the late dynamics of
the relaxation towards the equilibrium. Essentially (a) the original problem is
reformulated in terms of particle kinetic energy (exact particle number and
energy conservation during microscopic collisions) and (b) the computation of
the relaxation rates is improved by the DVM-like correction, where DVM stands
for Discrete Velocity Model (ensuring that the macroscopic conservation laws
are exactly satisfied). Both these corrections make possible to derive very
accurate reference solutions for this test case. Moreover this work aims to
distribute an open-source program (called HOMISBOLTZ), which can be
redistributed and/or modified for dealing with different applications, under
the terms of the GNU General Public License. The program has been purposely
designed in order to be minimal, not only with regards to the reduced number of
lines (less than 1,000), but also with regards to the coding style (as simple
as possible).
