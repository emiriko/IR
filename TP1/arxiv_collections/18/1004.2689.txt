Magnetization ground states are studied in toroidal nanomagnets. The
energetics associated to the ferromagnetic, vortex and onion-like
configurations are explicitly computed. The analysis reveals that the vortex
appears to be the most prominent of such states, minimizing total energy in
every torus with internal radius $r\gtrsim10\,{\rm nm}$ (for Permalloy). For
$r\lesssim10\,{\rm nm}$ the vortex remains the most favorable pattern whenever
$R/\ell_{ex}\gtrsim1.5$ ($R$ is the torus external radius and $\ell_{ex}$ is
the exchange length), being substituted by the ferromagnetic state whenever
$R/\ell_{ex}\lesssim1.5$.
