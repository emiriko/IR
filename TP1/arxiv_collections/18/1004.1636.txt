Proposed even-denominator fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) states
suggest the possibility of excitations with non-Abelian braid statistics.
Recent experiments on wide square quantum wells observe even-denominator FQHE
even under electrostatic tilt. We theoretically analyze these structures and
develop a procedure to accurately test proposed quantum Hall wavefunctions. We
find that tilted wells favor partial subband polarization to yield Abelian
even-denominator states. Our results show that tilting quantum wells
effectively engineers different interaction potentials allowing exploration of
a wide variety of even-denominator states.
