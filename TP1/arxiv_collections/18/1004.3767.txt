We present a catalog of sources of very high energy (E>100 GeV) gamma-rays
detected by the Large Area Telescope (LAT) onboard the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space
Telescope at Galactic latitudes |b|>=10 degrees. We cross-correlate the
directions of individual photons with energies above 100 GeV detected by
Fermi/LAT with the first year Fermi catalog of sources detected at lower
energies. We find a significant correlation between the arrival directions of
the highest energy photons and positions of Fermi sources, with the possibility
of chance coincidences at the level of 1e-45. We present a list of Fermi
sources contributing to the correlation signal. A similar analysis is performed
to cross-correlate the catalog of BL Lac objects with the highest energy
photons detected by Fermi. We produce a catalog of high Galactic latitude Fermi
sources visible at 100-300 GeV energies. The catalog is divided into two parts.
The first part contains a list of 50 higher significance sources among which
there can be three possible false detections. The second part of the catalog
contains a list of 25 lower significance sources, among which six are possibly
false detections. Finally we identify eight additional sources from the
cross-correlation analysis with the BL Lac catalog. The reported sources of
E>100 GeV gamma-rays span a broad range of redshifts, up to z~1. Most of the
sources are BL Lac type objects. Only 17 out of 83 objects in our list were
previously reported as VHE gamma-ray sources.
