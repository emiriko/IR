In this work we investigate operation in the Geiger mode of the new single
photon avalanche photo diode (SPAD) SAP500 manufactured by Laser Components.
This SPAD is sensitive in the range 400-1000nm and has a conventional
reach-through structure which ensures good quantum efficiency at the long end
of the spectrum. By use of passive and active quenching schemes we investigate
detection efficiency, timing jitter, dark counts, afterpulsing, gain and other
important parameters and compare them to the "standard" low noise SPAD C30902SH
from Perkin Elmer. We conclude that SAP500 offers better combination of
detection efficiency, low noise and timing precision.
