A simple scheme is presented for achieving effectively maximal pure-state
entanglement between non-interacting atoms through purely collective decay and
controlled symmetry breaking. The scheme requires no measurements or feedback
or even knowledge of the initial states of the atoms. It relies on breaking the
symmetry of the system Hamiltonian to ensure the existence of a unique
attractive steady state and minimal control to achieve almost perfect overlap
of this steady state with the maximally entangled singlet state. We demonstrate
how our scheme can be implemented for two qubits encoded in hyperfine levels of
atoms such as Rubidium in a lossy microwave cavity using only small magnetic
field gradient. Error analysis suggests considerable robustness with regard to
many imperfections including atomic decay, asymmetric atom-cavity coupling and
frequency offsets.
