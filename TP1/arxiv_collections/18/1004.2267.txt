This survey is about Galois theory of curves in characteristic p, a topic
which has inspired major research in algebraic geometry and number theory and
which contains many open questions. We illustrate important phenomena which
occur for covers of curves in characteristic p. We explain key results on the
structure of fundamental groups. We end by describing areas of active research
and giving two new results about the genus and p-rank of certain covers of the
affine line.
