In this work we examine the time-resolved, instantaneous current response for
the spinless Falicov-Kimball model at half-filling, on both sides of the
Mott-Hubbard metal-insulator transition, driven by a strong electric field pump
pulse. The results are obtained using an exact, nonequilibrium, many-body
impurity solution specifically designed to treat the out-of-equilibrium
evolution of electrons in time-dependent fields. We provide a brief
introduction to the method and its computational details. We find that the
current develops Bloch oscillations, similar to the case of DC driving fields,
with an additional amplitude modulation, characterized by beats and induced by
correlation effects. Correlations primarily manifest themselves through an
overall reduction in magnitude and shift in the onset time of the current
response with increasing interaction strength.
