We discuss the generation of the mu-term in a class of supersymmetric models
characterized by a low energy effective superpotential containing a term lambda
S H_1 H_2 with a large coupling lambda~2. These models generically predict a
lightest Higgs boson well above the LEP limit of 114 GeV and have been shown to
be compatible with the unification of gauge couplings. Here we discuss a
specific example where the superpotential has no dimensionful parameters and we
point out the relation between the generated mu-term and the mass of the
lightest Higgs boson. We discuss the fine-tuning of the model and we find that
the generation of a phenomenologically viable mu-term fits very well with a
heavy lightest Higgs boson and a low degree of fine-tuning. We discuss
experimental constraints from collider direct searches, precision data, thermal
relic dark matter abundance, and WIMP searches finding that the most natural
region of the parameter space is still allowed by current experiments. We
analyse bounds on the masses of the superpartners coming from Naturalness
arguments and discuss the main signatures of the model for the LHC and future
WIMP searches.
