We present first results of a Chandra X-ray observation of the rare
oxygen-type Wolf-Rayet star WR 142 (= Sand 5 = St 3) harbored in the young,
heavily-obscured cluster Berkeley 87. Oxygen type WO stars are thought to be
the most evolved of the WRs and progenitors of supernovae or gamma ray bursts.
As part of an X-ray survey of supposedly single Wolf-Rayet stars, we observed
WR 142 and the surrounding Berkeley 87 region with Chandra ACIS-I. We detect WR
142 as a faint, yet extremely hard X-ray source. Due to weak emission, its
nature as a thermal or nonthermal emitter is unclear and thus we discuss
several emission mechanisms. Additionally, we report seven detections and eight
non-detections by Chandra of massive OB stars in Berkeley 87, two of which are
bright yet soft X-ray sources whose spectra provide a dramatic contrast to the
hard emission from WR 142.
