We study the evolution of a N-body weakly interacting system of Bosons. Our
work forms an extension of our previous paper I, in which we derived a
second-order correction to a mean-field evolution law for coherent states in
the presence of small interaction potential. Here, we remove the assumption of
smallness of the interaction potential and prove global existence of solutions
to the equation for the second-order correction. This implies an improved
Fock-space estimate for our approximation of the N-body state.
