We present the first non-LTE, co-moving frame molecular line calculations of
a star-forming cluster simulated using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH),
from which we derive high-resolution synthetic observations. We have resampled
a particle representation onto an adaptive mesh and self-consistently solved
the equations of statistical equilibrium in the co-moving frame, using TORUS, a
three-dimensional adaptive mesh refined (AMR) radiative transfer (RT) code. We
verified the applicability of the code to the conditions of the SPH simulation
by testing its output against other codes. We find that the level populations
obtained for optically thick and thin scenarios closely match the ensemble
average of the other codes. We have used the code to obtain non-LTE level
populations of multiple molecular species throughout the cluster and have
created three-dimensional velocity-resolved spatial maps of the emergent
intensity. Line profiles of cores traced by N2H+ (1-0) are compared to probes
of low density gas, 13CO (1-0) and C18O (1-0), surrounding the cores along the
line of sight. The relative differences of the line-centre velocities are shown
to be small compared to the velocity dispersion, matching recent observations.
We conclude that one cannot reject competitive accretion as a viable theory of
star formation based on observed velocity profiles.
