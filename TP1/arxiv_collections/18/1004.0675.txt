We present the McMaster Unbiased Galaxy Simulations (MUGS), the first 9
galaxies of an unbiased selection ranging in total mass from 5$\times10^{11}$
M$_\odot$ to 2$\times10^{12}$ M$_\odot$ simulated using n-body smoothed
particle hydrodynamics (SPH) at high resolution. The simulations include a
treatment of low temperature metal cooling, UV background radiation, star
formation, and physically motivated stellar feedback. Mock images of the
simulations show that the simulations lie within the observed range of
relations such as that between color and magnitude and that between brightness
and circular velocity (Tully-Fisher). The greatest discrepancy between the
simulated galaxies and observed galaxies is the high concentration of material
at the center of the galaxies as represented by the centrally peaked rotation
curves and the high bulge-to-total ratios of the simulations determined both
kinematically and photometrically. This central concentration represents the
excess of low angular momentum material that long has plagued morphological
studies of simulated galaxies and suggests that higher resolutions and a more
accurate description of feedback will be required to simulate more realistic
galaxies. Even with the excess central mass concentrations, the simulations
suggest the important role merger history and halo spin play in the formation
of disks.
