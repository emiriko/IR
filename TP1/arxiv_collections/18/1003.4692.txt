We study the asymptotic zero distribution of type II multiple orthogonal
polynomials associated with two Macdonald functions (modified Bessel functions
of the second kind). Based on the four-term recurrence relation, it is shown
that, after proper scaling, the sequence of normalized zero counting measures
converges weakly to the first component of a vector of two measures which
satisfies a vector equilibrium problem with two external fields. We also give
the explicit formula for the equilibrium vector in terms of solutions of an
algebraic equation.
