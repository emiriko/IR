We use N-body simulations to find the effect of neutrino masses on halo
properties, and investigate how the density profiles of both the neutrino and
the dark matter components change as a function of the neutrino mass. We
compare our neutrino density profiles with results from the N-one-body method
and find good agreement. We also show and explain why the Tremaine-Gunn bound
for the neutrinos is not saturated. Finally we study how the halo mass function
changes as a function of the neutrino mass and compare our results with the
Sheth-Tormen semi-analytic formulae. Our results are important for surveys
which aim at probing cosmological parameters using clusters, as well as future
experiments aiming at measuring the cosmic neutrino background directly.
