In studies of accreting black holes in binary systems, empirical relations
have been proposed to quantify the coupling between accretion processes and
ejection mechanisms. These processes are probed respectively by means of X-ray
and radio/optical-infrared observations. The relations predict, given certain
accretion conditions, the expected energy output in the form of a jet. We
investigated this coupling by studying the black hole candidate Swift
J1753.5-0127, via multiwavelength coordinated observations over a period of ~4
years. We present the results of our campaign showing that, all along the
outburst, the source features a jet that is fainter than expected from the
empirical correlation between the radio and the X-ray luminosities in hard
spectral state. Because the jet is so weak in this system the near-infrared
emission is, unusually for this state and luminosity, dominated by thermal
emission from the accretion disc. We briefly discuss the importance and the
implications of a precise determination of both the slope and the normalisation
of the correlations, listing some possible parameters that broadband jet models
should take into account to explain the population of sources characterized by
a dim jet. We also investigate whether our data can give any hint about the
nature of the compact object in the system, since its mass has not been
dynamically measured.
