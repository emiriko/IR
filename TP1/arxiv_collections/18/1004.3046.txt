For a general class of divergence type quasi-linear degenerate parabolic
equations with differentiable structure and lower order coefficients form
bounded with respect to the Laplacian we obtain $L^q$-estimates for the
gradients of solutions, and for the lower order coefficients from a Kato-type
class we show that the solutions are Lipschitz continuous with respect to the
space variable.
