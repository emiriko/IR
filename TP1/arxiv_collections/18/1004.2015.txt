We consider a model where a scalar field develops a metastable vacuum state
and weakly interacts with another scalar field. In this situation we find the
probability of decay of the false vacuum stimulated by the presence and
collisions of particles of the second field. The discussed calculation is an
illustration of the recently suggested thermal approach to treatment of induced
semiclassical processes.
