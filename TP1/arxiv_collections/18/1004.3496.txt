In this paper, we show that an arbitrary separable state can be the output of
a certain entanglement-breaking channel corresponding exactly to the input of a
maximally entangled state. A necessary and sufficient separability criterion
and some sufficient separability criteria from entanglement-breaking channels
are given.
