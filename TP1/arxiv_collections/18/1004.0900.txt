We present a complete systematics (excitation function, impact parameter,
system size, isospin asymmetry, and equations of state dependences) of global
stopping and fragment production for heavy-ion reactions in the energy range
between 50 and 1000 MeV/nucleon in the presence of symmetry energy and an
isospin-dependent cross section. It is observed that the degree of stopping
depends weakly on the symmetry energy and strongly on the isospin-dependent
cross section. However, the symmetry energy and isospin-dependent cross section
has an effect of the order of more than 10% on the emission of light charged
particles (LCP's). It means that nuclear stopping and LCP's can be used as a
tool to get the information of an isospin-dependent cross section.
Interestingly, the LCP's emission in the presence of symmetry energy is found
to be highly correlated with the global stopping.
