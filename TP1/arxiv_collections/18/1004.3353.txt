We present exact results on certain electronic properties of an anisotropic
Sierpinski gasket fractal. We use a tight binding Hamiltonian and work within
the formalism of a real space renormalization group (RSRG) method. The
anisotropy is introduced in the values of the nearest neighbor hopping
integrals. An extensive numerical examination of the two terminal transmission
spectrum and the flow of the hopping integrals under the RSRG iterations
strongly suggest that an anisotropic gasket is more conducting than its
isotropic counter part and that, even a minimal anisotropy in the hopping
integrals generate {\it continuous bands} of eigenstates in the spectrum for
finite Sierpinski gaskets of arbitrarily large size. We also discuss the effect
of a magnetic field threading the planar gasket on its transport properties and
calculate the persistent current in the system. The sensitivity of the
persistent current on the anisotropy and on the band filling is also discussed.
