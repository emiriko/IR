The French regulation on residential building ventilation relies on an
overall and continuous air renewal. The fresh air should enter the building
through the "habitable rooms" while the polluted air is extracted in the
service rooms. In this way, internal air is drained from the lowest polluted
rooms to the highest polluted ones. However, internal pressure equilibrium and
air movements in buildings result from the combined effects ventilation system
and parameters such as wind, temperature difference or doors opening. This
paper aims to analyse the influence of these parameters on pollutant transfer
within buildings. In so doing, experiments are carried out using tracer gas
release for representing pollution sources in an experimental house. Mechanical
exhaust, balanced and natural ventilation systems are thus tested. Results show
the followings: - For all cases, internal doors' opening causes the most
important pollutant spread. - When doors are closed, the best performances are
obtained with balanced ventilation. - Independently to heating and doors
opening, pollutant transfer from lower levels to higher levels of the building
is limited in the case of balanced ventilation. - Pollutant spread is quite
similar whether the whole building is heated or not.
