The string-black hole correspondence principle can be investigated in the
non-BPS scenario by studying the string configuration and entropy when the
string coupling is slowly increased. Through a rigorous analysis, it is shown
how an ensemble of string states at fixed mass and Neveu-Schwarz charges gets
dominated in any dimension by compact states for which the one-loop corrections
are important (possibly signaling the transition to a black hole
regime/description) and with a size (spread) within the horizon radius of the
expected correspondent black holes.
