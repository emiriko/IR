In this work, we investigate the prospects for detecting the Inert Doublet
Model via the trilepton channel at the LHC. We present a set of representative
benchmark scenarios in which all applicable constraints are satisfied, and show
that in some of these scenarios, it is possible to obtain a signal at the 5
sigma significance level or better with integrated luminosity of 300 fb^{-1}.
