In this paper, we describe efficient MapReduce simulations of parallel
algorithms specified in the BSP and PRAM models. We also provide some
applications of these simulation results to problems in parallel computational
geometry for the MapReduce framework, which result in efficient MapReduce
algorithms for sorting, 1-dimensional all nearest-neighbors, 2-dimensional
convex hulls, 3-dimensional convex hulls, and fixed-dimensional linear
programming. For the case when reducers can have a buffer size of
$B=O(n^\epsilon)$, for a small constant $\epsilon>0$, all of our MapReduce
algorithms for these applications run in a constant number of rounds and have a
linear-sized message complexity, with high probability, while guaranteeing with
high probability that all reducer lists are of size $O(B)$.
