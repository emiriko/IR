We explore the consequences of treating the X(3872) meson as a tetraquark
bound state. As dynamical framework we employ a relativistic constituent quark
model which includes infrared confinement in an effective way. We calculate the
decay widths of the observed channels X-> Jpsi+2\pi (3\pi) and X-> \bar
D0+D0+\pi0 via the intermediate off--shell states X-> Jpsi+\rho(\omega) and X->
\bar D + D*. For reasonable values of the size parameter of the X(3872) we find
consistency with the available experimental data. We also discuss the possible
impact of the X(3872) in a s-channel dominance description of the
Jpsi-dissociation cross section.
