We formalize a classification of pair interactions based on the convergence
properties of the {\it forces} acting on particles as a function of system
size. We do so by considering the behavior of the probability distribution
function (PDF) P(F) of the force field F in a particle distribution in the
limit that the size of the system is taken to infinity at constant particle
density, i.e., in the "usual" thermodynamic limit. For a pair interaction
potential V(r) with V(r) \rightarrow \infty) \sim 1/r^a defining a {\it
bounded} pair force, we show that P(F) converges continuously to a well-defined
and rapidly decreasing PDF if and only if the {\it pair force} is absolutely
integrable, i.e., for a > d-1, where d is the spatial dimension. We refer to
this case as {\it dynamically short-range}, because the dominant contribution
to the force on a typical particle in this limit arises from particles in a
finite neighborhood around it. For the {\it dynamically long-range} case, i.e.,
a \leq d-1, on the other hand, the dominant contribution to the force comes
from the mean field due to the bulk, which becomes undefined in this limit. We
discuss also how, for a \leq d-1 (and notably, for the case of gravity, a=d-2)
P(F) may, in some cases, be defined in a weaker sense. This involves a
regularization of the force summation which is generalization of the procedure
employed to define gravitational forces in an infinite static homogeneous
universe. We explain that the relevant classification in this context is,
however, that which divides pair forces with a > d-2 (or a < d-2), for which
the PDF of the {\it difference in forces} is defined (or not defined) in the
infinite system limit, without any regularization. In the former case dynamics
can, as for the (marginal) case of gravity, be defined consistently in an
infinite uniform system.
