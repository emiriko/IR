We report on the first asteroseismic analysis of solar-type stars observed by
Kepler. Observations of three G-type stars, made at one-minute cadence during
the first 33.5d of science operations, reveal high signal-to-noise solar-like
oscillation spectra in all three stars: About 20 modes of oscillation can
clearly be distinguished in each star. We discuss the appearance of the
oscillation spectra, including the presence of a possible signature of faculae,
and the presence of mixed modes in one of the three stars.
