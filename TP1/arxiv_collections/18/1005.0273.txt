Initialization, manipulation, and measurement of a three-spin qubit are
demonstrated using a few-electron triple quantum dot, where all operations can
be driven by tuning the nearest-neighbor exchange interaction. Multiplexed
reflectometry, applied to two nearby charge sensors, allows for qubit readout.
Decoherence is found to be consistent with predictions based on gate voltage
noise with a uniform power spectrum. The theory of the exchange-only qubit is
developed and it is shown that initialization of only two spins suffices for
operation. Requirements for full multi-qubit control using only exchange and
electrostatic interactions are outlined.
