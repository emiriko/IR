We report ultrafast response of femtosecond photoexcited carriers in single
layer reduced graphene oxide flakes suspended in water as well as few layer
thick film deposited on indium tin oxide coated glass plate using pump-probe
differential transmission spectroscopy at 790 nm. The carrier relaxation
dynamics has three components: ~200 fs, 1 to 2 ps, and ~25 ps, all of them
independent of pump fluence. It is seen that the second component (1 to 2 ps)
assigned to the lifetime of hot optical phonons is larger for graphene in
suspensions whereas other two time constants are the same for both the
suspension and the film. The value of third order nonlinear susceptibility
estimated from the pump-probe experiments is compared with that obtained from
the open aperture Z-scan results for the suspension.
