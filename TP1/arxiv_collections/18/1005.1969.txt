We report here on a recent lattice study of the QCD transition region at
finite temperature and zero chemical potential using domain wall fermions
(DWF). We also present a parameterization of the QCD equation of state obtained
from lattice QCD that is suitable for use in hydrodynamics studies of heavy ion
collisions. Finally, we show preliminary results from a multi-stage
hydrodynamics/hadron cascade model of a heavy ion collision, in an attempt to
understand how well the experimental data (e.g. particle spectra, elliptic
flow, and HBT radii) can constrain the inputs (e.g. initial temperature,
freezeout temperature, shear viscosity, equation of state) of the theoretical
model.
