Object-oriented programming laws have been proposed in the context of
languages that are not combined with a behavioral interface specification
language (BISL). The strong dependence between source-code and interface
specifications may cause a number of difficulties when transforming programs.
In this paper we introduce a set of programming laws for object-oriented
languages like Java combined with the Java Modeling Language (JML). The set of
laws deals with object-oriented features taking into account their
specifications. Some laws deal only with features of the specification
language. These laws constitute a set of small transformations for the
development of more elaborate ones like refactorings.
