We investigated the effect of torsional rigidity of a semiflexible chain on
the wrapping transition around a spherical core, as a model of nucleosome, the
fundamental unit of chromatin. Through molecular dynamics simulation, we show
that the torsional effect has a crucial effect on the chain wrapping around the
core under the topological constraints. In particular, the torsional stress (i)
induces the wrapping/unwrapping transition, and (ii) leads to a unique complex
structure with an antagonistic wrapping direction which never appears without
the topological constraints. We further examine the effect of the stretching
stress for the nucleosome model, in relation to the unique characteristic
effect of the torsional stress on the manner of wrapping.
