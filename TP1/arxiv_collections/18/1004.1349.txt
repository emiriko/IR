We introduce a generalized Ulam method and apply it to symplectic dynamical
maps with a divided phase space. Our extensive numerical studies based on the
Arnoldi method show that the Ulam approximant of the Perron-Frobenius operator
on a chaotic component converges to a continuous limit. Typically, in this
regime the spectrum of relaxation modes is characterized by a power law decay
for small relaxation rates. Our numerical data show that the exponent of this
decay is approximately equal to the exponent of Poincar\'e recurrences in such
systems. The eigenmodes show links with trajectories sticking around stability
islands.
