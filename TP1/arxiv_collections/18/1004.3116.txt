Metallic glasses are formed by splat-cooling; this ensures that atomic
motions are arrested before the latent heat of solidification can be extracted.
Glass is defined as a higher disorder metastable state with arrested kinetics.
Arrested kinetics is a defining property of a glass, rather than structural
disorder as, e.g., in amorphous silicon [1]. `Magnetic glasses' identified
recently possess structural as well as magnetic long-range order, but show
relaxation and specific heat as for a structural glass [1]. The values of Tc
and Tg in these materials are easily varied by varying the magnetic field H,
allowing one to go from metallic glass to glass former like scenario.
