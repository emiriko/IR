We study theoretically the simultaneous, photo-induced two-particle
excitations of strongly correlated systems on the basis of the Hubbard model.
Under certain conditions specified in this work, the corre- sponding transition
probability is related to the two-particle spectral function which we calculate
using three different methods: the dynamical-mean field theory combined with
quantum Monte Carlo (DMFT- QMC) technique, the first order perturbation theory
and the ladder approximations. The results are analyzed and compared for
systems at the verge of the metal-insulator transitions. The dependencies on
the electronic correlation strength and on doping are explored. In addition,
the account for the orbital degeneracy allows an insight into the influence of
interband correlations on the two particle excitations. A suitable experimental
realization is discussed.
