One of the important issues in nanomagnetism is to lower the current needed
for a technologically useful domain wall (DW) propagation speed. Based on the
modified Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation with both Slonczewski
spin-transfer torque and the field-like torque, we derive the optimal spin
current pattern for fast DW propagation along nanowires. Under such conditions,
the DW velocity in biaxial wires can be enhanced as much as ten times compared
to the velocities achieved in experiments so far. Moreover, the fast variation
of spin polarization can help DW depinning. Possible experimental realizations
are discussed.
