We derive the effective Hamiltonian for a quantum system constrained to a
submanifold (the constraint manifold) of configuration space (the ambient
space) in the asymptotic limit where the restoring forces tend to infinity. In
contrast to earlier works we consider at the same time the effects of
variations in the constraining potential and the effects of interior and
exterior geometry which appear at different energy scales and thus provide, for
the first time, a complete picture ranging over all interesting energy scales.
We show that the leading order contribution to the effective Hamiltonian is the
adiabatic potential given by an eigenvalue of the confining potential
well-known in the context of adiabatic quantum wave guides. At next to leading
order we see effects from the variation of the normal eigenfunctions in form of
a Berry connection. We apply our results to quantum wave guides and provide an
example for the occurrence of a topological phase due to the geometry of a
quantum wave circuit, i.e. a closed quantum wave guide.
