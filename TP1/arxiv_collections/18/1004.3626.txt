Measurement-based quantum computing, a powerful alternative to the standard
circuit model, proceeds using only local adaptive measurements on a
highly-entangled resource state of many spins on a graph or lattice. Along with
the canonical cluster state, the valence-bond solid ground state on a chain of
spin-1 particles, studied by Affleck, Kennedy, Lieb, and Tasaki (AKLT), is such
a resource state. We propose a simulation of this AKLT state using linear
optics, wherein we can make use of the high-fidelity projective measurements
that are commonplace in quantum optical experiments, and describe how quantum
logic gates can be performed on this chain. In our proposed implementation, the
spin-1 particles comprizing the AKLT state are encoded on polarization
biphotons: three level systems consisting of pairs of polarized photons in the
same spatio-temporal mode. A logical qubit encoded on the photonic AKLT state
can be initialized, read out and have an arbitrary single qubit unitary applied
to it by performing projective measurements on the constituent biphotons. For
MBQC, biphoton measurements are required which cannot be deterministically
performed using only linear optics and photodetection.
