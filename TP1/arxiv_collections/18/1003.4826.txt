We present new kinetic-gasdynamic model of the solar wind interaction with
the local interstellar medium. The model incorporates several processes
suggested by McComas et al. (2009) for the origin of the heliospheric ENA
ribbon -- the most prominent feature seen in the all sky maps of heliospheric
ENAs discovered by the Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX). The ribbon is a
region of enhanced fluxes of ENAs crossing almost the entire sky. Soon after
the ribbon's discovery it was realized (McComas et al., 2009) that the
enhancement of the fluxes could be in the directions where the radial component
of the interstellar magnetic field around the heliopause is close to zero
(Schwadron et al., 2009). Our model includes secondary charge exchange of the
interstellar H atoms with the interstellar pickup protons outside the
heliopause and is a further advancement of the kinetic-gasdynamic model by
Malama et al. (2006) where pickup protons were treated as a separate kinetic
component. Izmodenov et al. (2009) have shown in the frame of Malama's model
that the interstellar pickup protons outside the heliopause maybe a significant
source of ENAs at energies above 1 keV. The difference between the current work
and that of Izmodenov et al. (2009) is in the assumption of no-scattering for
newly created pickup protons outside the heliopause. In this limit the model
produces a feature qualitatively similar to the ribbon observed by IBEX.
