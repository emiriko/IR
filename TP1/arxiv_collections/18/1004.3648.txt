The conductance in two-dimensional (2D) normal-superconducting (NS) systems
is analyzed in the limit of strong magnetic fields when the transport is
mediated by the electron-hole states bound to the sample edges and NS
interface, i.e., in the Integer Quantum Hall Effect regime.The Andreev-type
process of the conversion of the quasiparticle current into the superflow is
shown to be strongly affected by the mixing of the edge states localized at the
NS and insulating boundaries. The magnetoconductance in 2D NS structures is
calculated for both quadratic and Dirac-like normal state spectra. Assuming a
random scattering of the edge modes we analyze both the average value and
fluctuations of conductance for an arbitrary number of conducting channels.
