We present a study of the experimental determination of the forward-backward
asymmetry in the process $e^+e^-\to t\bar t$ and in the subsequent $t\to Wb$
decay, studied in the context of the International Linear Collider. This
process probes the elementary couplings of the top quark to the photon, the $Z$
and the $W$ bosons at a level of precision that is difficult to achieve at
hadron colliders. Measurement of the forward-backward asymmetry requires
excellent $b$ quark identification and determination of the quark charge. The
study reported here is performed in the most challenging all-hadronic channel
$e^+e^- \to b\bar b q\bar q q\bar q$. It includes realistic details of the
experimental environment, a full Monte Carlo simulation of the detector, based
on the Silicon Detector concept, and realistic event reconstruction. The
forward-backward asymmetries are determined to a precision of approximately 1%
for each of two choices of beam polarization. We analyze the implications for
the determination of the $t\bar t Z$ and $Wtb$ couplings.
