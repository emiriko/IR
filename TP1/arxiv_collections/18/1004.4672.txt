Expressing explicitly the parameters of the standard Skyrme interaction in
terms of the macroscopic properties of asymmetric nuclear matter, we show in
the Skyrme-Hartree-Fock approach that unambiguous correlations exist between
observables of finite nuclei and nuclear matter properties. We find that
existing data on neutron skin thickness $\Delta r_{np}$ of Sn isotopes give an
important constraint on the symmetry energy $E_{sym}({\rho _{0}})$ and its
density slope $L$ at saturation density ${\rho _{0}}$. Combining these
constraints with those from recent analyses of isospin diffusion and double
neutron/proton ratio in heavy-ion collisions at intermediate energies leads to
a more stringent limit on $L$ approximately independent of $E_{sym}({\rho
_{0}})$. The implication of these new constraints on the $\Delta r_{np}$ of
$^{208}$Pb as well as the core-crust transition density and pressure in neutron
stars is discussed.
