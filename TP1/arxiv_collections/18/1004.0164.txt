A relation between equilibrium, steady-state, and waiting-time dependent
dynamical two-time correlation functions in dense glass-forming liquids subject
to homogeneous steady shear flow is discussed. The systems under study show
pronounced shear thinning, i.e., a significant speedup in their steady-state
slow relaxation as compared to equilibrium. An approximate relation that
recovers the exact limit for small waiting times is derived following the
integration through transients (ITT) approach for the nonequilibrium
Smoluchowski dynamics, and is exemplified within a schematic model in the
framework of the mode-coupling theory of the glass transition (MCT). Computer
simulation results for the tagged-particle density correlation functions
corresponding to wave vectors in the shear-gradient directions from both
event-driven stochastic dynamics of a two-dimensional hard-disk system and from
previously published Newtonian-dynamics simulations of a three-dimensional
soft-sphere mixture are analyzed and compared with the predictions of the
ITT-based approximation. Good qualitative and semi-quantitative agreement is
found. Furthermore, for short waiting times, the theoretical description of the
waiting time dependence shows excellent quantitative agreement to the
simulations. This confirms the accuracy of the central approximation used
earlier to derive fluctuation dissipation ratios (Phys. Rev. Lett. 102,
135701). For intermediate waiting times, the correlation functions decay faster
at long times than the stationary ones. This behavior is predicted by our
theory and observed in simulations.
