Systematic studies of dipole and other multipole excitations in stable and
exotic nuclei are discussed theoretically. Exploring the relation of the
strengths of low-energy dipole and quadrupole pygmy resonances to the thickness
of the neutron (proton) skin a close connection between static and dynamic
properties of the nucleus is observed. The fine structure of low-energy dipole
strength in 138Ba nucleus is revealed from E1 and spin-flip M1 strengths
distributions.
