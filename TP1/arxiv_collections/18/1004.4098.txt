I conjecture that the time modulated decay rates reported in single ion
measurements of two body electron capture decay of hydrogen like heavy ions at
GSI may be related to neutrino spin precession in the static magnetic field of
the storage ring. These `GSI Oscillations' arise from interference between
amplitudes of decay within and without the magnetic field, a scenario that
requires a Dirac neutrino magnetic moment six times lower than the Borexino
solar neutrino upper limit of 0.54 x 10E(-10) Bohr magneton. I also show in a
way not discussed before that the time modulation associated with interference
between massive neutrino amplitudes, if such interference could arise, is of a
period at least four orders of magnitude shorter than reported and must average
to zero given the time resolution of the GSI measurements.
