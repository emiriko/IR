We discuss in the planar approximation the effect of double-trace
deformations on CFT's. We show that this large class of models posses a
conformal window describing a non-trivial flow between two fixed points of the
renormalization group, and reveal the presence of a resonance which we
associate to the remnant of a dilaton pole. As the conformal window shrinks to
zero measure the theory undergoes a conformal phase transition separating a
symmetric from a nonsymmetric phase. The recently conjectured strongly coupled
branch of non-supersymmetric, non-abelian gauge theories with a large number of
flavors is analyzed in light of these results, and a model for the strong
branch is proposed. Some phenomenological implications in the context of
unparticle physics are also emphasized.
