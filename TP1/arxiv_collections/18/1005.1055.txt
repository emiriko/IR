We investigate the Andreev reflection process in high-mobility HgTe/CdTe
quantum wells. We find that Andreev conductance probes the dynamics of massive
2+1 Dirac fermions, and that both specular Andreev reflection and
retroreflection can be realized even in presence of a large mismatch between
the Fermi wavelengths at the two sides of the normal/superconducting junction.
