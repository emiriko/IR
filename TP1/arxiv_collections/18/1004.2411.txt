The rheology of nanoparticle suspensions for nanoparticles of various shapes
with equal mass is studied using molecular dynamics simulations. The
equilibrium structure and the response to imposed shear are analyzed for
suspensions of spheres, rods, plates, and jacks in an explicit solvent for both
charged and uncharged nanoparticles. For the volume fraction studied,
?$\phi_{vf}=0.075$, the uncharged systems are all in their isotropic phase and
the viscosity is only weakly dependent on shape for spheres, rods, and plate
whereas for the jacks the viscosity is an order of magnitude larger than for
the other three shapes. The introduction of charge increases the viscosity for
all four nanoparticle shapes with the increase being the largest for rods and
plates. The presence of a repulsive charge between the particles decreases the
amount of stress reduction that can be achieved by particle reorientation.
