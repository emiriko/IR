This is the second part, after [1], of the research devoted to analysis of
1-ports composed of similar conductors ("f-circuits") described by the
characteristic i = f(v) of a polynomial type. This analysis is performed by
means of the power-law "alfa"-circuits" introduced in [2], for which f(v) ~
v^"alfa". The f-circuits are constructed from the "alfa"-circuits of the same
topology, with the proper "alfa", so that the given topology is kept, and 'f'
is an additive function of the connection. Explaining the situation described
in detail in [1], we note and analyze a simple "circuit mechanism" that causes
the difference between the input current of the f-circuit and the sum of the
input currents of the f-circuits before the composition to be relatively small.
The case of two degrees, f(v) = Dmv^m + Dnv^n, m unequal n, is treated in the
main proofs. Some simulations are presented, and some boundaries for the error
of the superposition are found. The cases of f(.) being a polynomial of the
third or fourth degrees are finally briefly considered.
