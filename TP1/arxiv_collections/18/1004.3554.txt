The magnetic phase diagram of CuFeO2 as a function of applied magnetic field
and temperature is thoroughly explored and expanded, both for magnetic fields
applied parallel and perpendicular to the material's c-axis. Pulsed field
magnetization measurements extend the typical magnetic staircase of CuFeO2 at
various temperatures, demonstrating the persistence of the recently discovered
high field metamagnetic transition up to Tn2 ~ 11 K in both field
configurations. An extension of the previously introduced phenomenological spin
model used to describe the high field magnetization process (Phys. Rev. B, 80,
012406 (2009)) is applied to each of the consecutive low-field commensurate
spin structures, yielding a semi-quantitative simulation and intuitive
description of the entire experimental magnetization process in both relevant
field directions with a single set of parameters.
