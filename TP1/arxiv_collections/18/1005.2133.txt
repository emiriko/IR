We study various aspects of the defect conformal field theory that arises
when placing a single M5-brane probe in AdS_4 x S^7. We derive the full set of
fluctuation modes and dimensions of the corresponding dual operators. We argue
that the latter does not depend on the presence of a non-trivial magnetic flux
on the M5-brane world-volume. Finally we give a mass to the hypermultiplet
living on the defect, and compute the resulting mesonic spectrum.
