Zero field and longitudinal field muon spin relaxation measurements have been
performed in optimally doped and overdoped superconductors LaFeAsO$_{1-x}$F$_x$
in order to investigate the magnetic fluctuation over a wide range of
temperature and longitudinal field. We have observed no sign of magnetic
fluctuation against temperature in the muons' time window (10$^{-5}\sim$
10$^{-9}$s). Considering the current results and other results, i.e., spin
fluctuation observed by neutron scattering, pseudogap-like behaviors by NMR and
photoemission spectroscopy, it is suggested that not only the spin fluctuation
but also the multiband character with several different orbital contributions
at the Fermi surface may play an important role in the superconducting pairing
mechanism of LaFeAsO$_{1-x}$F$_x$.
