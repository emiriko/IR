Light beams carrying orbital angular momentum, such as Laguerre-Gaussian
beams, give rise to the violation of the standard dipolar selection rules
during the interaction with matter yielding, in general, an exchange of angular
momentum larger than hbar per absorbed photon. By means of ab initio 3D
numerical simulations, we investigate in detail the interaction of a hydrogen
atom with intense Gaussian and Laguerre-Gaussian light pulses. We analyze the
dependence of the angular momentum exchange with the polarization, the orbital
angular momentum, and the carrier-envelope phase of light, as well as with the
relative position between the atom and the light vortex. In addition, a
quantum-trajectory approach based on the de Broglie-Bohm formulation of quantum
mechanics is used to gain physical insight into the absorption of angular
momentum by the hydrogen atom.
