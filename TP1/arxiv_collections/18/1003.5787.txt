Cryptographic hash functions for calculating the message digest of a message
has been in practical use as an effective measure to maintain message integrity
since a few decades. This message digest is unique, irreversible and avoids all
types of collisions for any given input string. The message digest calculated
from this algorithm is propagated in the communication medium along with the
original message from the sender side and on the receiver side integrity of the
message can be verified by recalculating the message digest of the received
message and comparing the two digest values. In this paper we have designed and
developed a new algorithm for calculating the message digest of any message and
implemented t using a high level programming language. An experimental analysis
and comparison with the existing MD5 hashing algorithm, which is predominantly
being used as a cryptographic hashing tool, shows this algorithm to provide
more randomness and greater strength from intrusion attacks. In this algorithm
the plaintext message string is converted into binary string and fragmented
into blocks of 128 bits after being padded with user defined padding bits. Then
using a pseudo random number generator a key is generated for each block and
operated with the respective block by a bitwise operator. This process is
terated for the whole message and finally a fixed length message digest is
obtained.
