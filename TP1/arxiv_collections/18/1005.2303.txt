Plasmodium of \emph{Physarum polycephalum} is a single cell visible by
unaided eye. The plasmodium's foraging behaviour is interpreted in terms of
computation. Input data is a configuration of nutrients, result of computation
is a network of plasmodium's cytoplasmic tubes spanning sources of nutrients.
Tsuda et al (2004) experimentally demonstrated that basic logical gates can be
implemented in foraging behaviour of the plasmodium. We simplify the original
designs of the gates and show --- in computer models --- that the plasmodium is
capable for computation of two-input two-output gate $<x, y> \to <xy, x+y>$ and
three-input two-output $<x, y, z> \to < \bar{x}yz, x+y+z>$. We assemble the
gates in a binary one-bit adder and demonstrate validity of the design using
computer simulation.
