In this paper we prove that a morphism between schemes or stacks naturally
corresponds to a symmetric monoidal functor between stable infinity-categories
of quasi-coherent complexes. It can be viewed as a derived analogue of Tannaka
duality. As a consequence, we deduce that an algebraic stack satisfying a
certain condition can be recovered from the stable infinity-category of
quasi-coherent complexes with tensor operation.
