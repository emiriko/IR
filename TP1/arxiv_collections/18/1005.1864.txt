The authors try to probe the inner components of rapidly rotating compact
stars such as the millisecond pulsar SAX J1808.4-3658 and the possible
sub-millisecond pulsar XTE J1739-285 in their own way by comparing the genuine
rotation frequencies under different theoretical models with the observational
data, which may exert more stringent constraint on matter composition of
compact stars. According to their treatment, the SAX J1808.4-3658 is a star
with exotic matter and XTE J1739-285 a hybrid star.
