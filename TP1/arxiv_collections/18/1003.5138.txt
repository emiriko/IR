The paper compares the methods used to calculate matrix elements of the
operator of radail electron coordinates in an arbitrary order in the
Foldy-Wouthuysen representation and with the use of the Dirac equation for
1s-states of the hydrogen-like and helium-like ions of transuranic elements.
The obtained analytical and numerical results for 1s-states of the
hydrogen-like and helium-like ions proves that the wave function reduction
requirement is met with transformation to the Foldy-Wouthuysen representation
and confirms that matrix elements can be calculated using only one component
(either upper, or lower) of the Dirac bispinor wave function.
