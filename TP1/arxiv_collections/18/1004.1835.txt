We present spectroscopic orbits for the active stars HD 82159 (GS Leo), HD
89959, BD +39 2587 (a visual companion to HD 112733), HD 138157 (OX Ser), HD
143705, and HD 160934. This paper is a sequel to one published in this journal
in 2006, with similar avowed intention, by Galvez et al.. They showed only
graphs, and gave no data, and no orbital elements apart from the periods (only
two of which were correct) and in some cases the eccentricities. Here we
provide full information and reliable orbital elements for all the stars apart
from HD 160934, which has not completed a cycle since it was first observed for
radial velocity.
