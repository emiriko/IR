Context: Intermediate mass protostars provide a bridge between low- and
high-mass protostars. Furthermore, they are an important component of the UV
interstellar radiation field. Despite their relevance, little is known about
their formation process. Aims: We present a systematic study of the physical
structure of five intermediate mass, candidate Class 0 protostars. Our two
goals are to shed light on the first phase of intermediate mass star formation
and to compare these protostars with low- and high-mass sources. Methods: We
derived the dust and gas temperature and density profiles of the sample. We
analysed all existing continuum data on each source and modelled the resulting
SED with the 1D radiative transfer code DUSTY. The gas temperature was then
predicted by means of a modified version of the code CHT96. Results: We found
that the density profiles of five out of six studied intermediate mass
envelopes are consistent with the predictions of the "inside-out" collapse
theory.We compared several physical parameters, like the power law index of the
density profile, the size, the mass, the average density, the density at 1000
AU and the density at 10 K of the envelopes of low-, intermediate, and
high-mass protostars. When considering these various physical parameters, the
transition between the three groups appears smooth, suggesting that the
formation processes and triggers do not substantially differ.
