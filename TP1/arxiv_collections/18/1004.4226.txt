This thesis studies meta- and exactly stable supersymmetry breaking
mechanisms in heterotic and type IIB string theories and constructs an F-theory
Grand Unified Theory model for neutrino physics in which neutrino mass is
determined by the supersymmetry breaking mechanism. Focussing attention on
heterotic string theory compactified on a 4-torus, stability of
non-supersymmetric states is studied. A non-supersymmetric state with robust
stability is constructed, and its exact stability is proven in a large region
of moduli space of T^4 against all the possible decay mechanisms allowed by
charge conservation. Using string-string duality, the results are interpreted
in terms of Dirichlet-branes in type IIA string theory compactified on an
orbifold limit of a K3 surface. In type IIB string theory, metastable and
exactly stable non-supersymmetric systems are constructed using D-branes and
Calabi-Yau geometry. Branes and anti-branes wrap rigid and separate 2-spheres
inside a non-compact Calabi-Yau three-fold: supersymmetry is spontaneously
broken. These metastable vacua are analyzed in a holographic dual picture on a
complex-deformed CY3 where 2-spheres have been replaced by 3-spheres with flux
through them. By computing bosonic masses, we identify location and mode of
instability. The moduli space of this complex-deformed CY3 is studied, and
methods for studying the global phase structure of supersymmetric and
non-supersymmetric flux vacua are proposed. By turning on a varying
Neveu-Schwarz flux inside the CY3, we build meta- and exactly stable
non-supersymmetric configurations with D-branes but with no anti-D-branes.
Finally, a scenario for Dirac neutrinos in an F-theory SU(5) GUT model is
proposed. Supersymmetry breaking leads to an F-term for Higgs field which
induces a Dirac mass. A mild normal hierarchy and large mixing angles are
predicted.
