We report muon spin rotation ($\mu$SR) measurements of single crystal
Ba(Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$)$_2$As$_2$ and Sr(Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$)$_2$As$_2$. From
measurements of the magnetic field penetration depth $\lambda$ we find that for
optimally- and over-doped samples, $1/\lambda(T\to 0)^2$ varies monotonically
with the superconducting transition temperature T$_{\rm C}$. Within the
superconducting state we observe a positive shift in the muon precession
signal, likely indicating that the applied field induces an internal magnetic
field. The size of the induced field decreases with increasing doping but is
present for all Co concentrations studied.
