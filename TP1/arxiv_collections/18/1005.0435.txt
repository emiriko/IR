We report La-139 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) data in La4Ni3O8 which
reveals the presence of antiferromagnetic order below T_N ~ 105 K. This
compound contains two-dimensional layers of NiO2 that are isostructural to the
copper oxide planes of the high temperature superconductors. This compound is
remarkable because the average Ni valence of 1.33+ for formally 2Ni1+ + Ni2+
indicates a 3d9/3d8 electronic configuration. Nickel oxides with Ni1+ valence
are rare and unstable, yet may provide new routes to high temperature
superconductivity. La4Ni3O8, with antiferromagnetic order of S=1/2 Ni1+ spins,
is analogous to the parent compounds of the cuprate superconductors. Our data
clearly reveal dramatic spectral changes and low energy antiferromagnetic
correlations associated with the onset of long range order below T_N.
