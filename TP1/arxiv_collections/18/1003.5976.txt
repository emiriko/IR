The main aim of this thesis is to look for a logical deductive calculus (we
will adopt sequent calculus, originally introduced in Gentzen, 1935), which
could describe quantum information and its properties. More precisely, we
intended to describe in logical terms the formation of the qubit (the unit of
quantum information) which is a particular linear superposition of the two
classical bits 0 and 1. To do so, we had to introduce the new connective
"quantum superposition", in the logic of one qubit, Lq, as the classical
conjunction cannot describe this quantum link.
