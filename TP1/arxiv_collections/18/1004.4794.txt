In this paper we summarise the status of single field models of inflation in
light of the WMAP 7 data release. We find little has changed since the 5 year
release, and results are consistent with previous findings. The increase in the
upper bound on the running of the spectral index impacts on the status of the
production of Primordial Black Holes from single field models. The lower bound
on the equilateral configuration of the non-gaussianity parameter is reduced
and thus the bounds on the theoretical parameters of (UV) DBI single brane
models are weakened. In the case of multiple coincident branes the bounds are
also weakened and the two, three or four brane cases will produce a
tensor-signal that could possibly be observed in the future.
