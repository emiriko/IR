(Abridged) We present CARMA observations of the thermal dust emission from
the circumstellar disks around the young stars RYTau and DGTau at wavelengths
of 1.3mm and 2.8mm. The angular resolution of the maps is as high as
0.15arcsec, or 20AU at the distance of the Taurus cloud, which is a factor of 2
higher than has been achieved to date at these wavelengths. The unprecedented
detail of the resulting disk images enables us to address three important
questions related to the formation of planets. (1) What is the radial
distribution of the circumstellar dust? (2) Does the dust emission show any
indication of gaps that might signify the presence of (proto-)planets? (3) Do
the dust properties depend on the orbital radius? We find that modeling the
disk surface density in terms of either a classical power law or the similarity
solution for viscous disk evolution, reproduces the observations well. The
1.3mm image from RYTau shows two peaks separated by 0.2arcsec with a decline in
the dust emission toward the stellar position, which is significant at about
2-4sigma. For both RYTau and DGTau, the dust emission at radii larger than 15
AU displays no significant deviation from an unperturbed viscous disk model. In
particular, no radial gaps in the dust distribution are detected. Under
reasonable assumptions, we exclude the presence of planets more massive than 5
Jupiter masses orbiting either star at distances between about 10 and 60 AU.
The radial variation of the dust opacity slope, beta, was investigated by
comparing the 1.3mm and 2.8mm observations. We find mean values of beta of 0.5
and 0.7 for DGTau and RYTau respectively. Variations in beta are smaller than
0.7 between 20 and 70 AU. These results confirm that the circumstellar dust
throughout these disks differs significantly from dust in the interstellar
medium.
