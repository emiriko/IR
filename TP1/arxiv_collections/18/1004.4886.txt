We prove the Murgnaghan--Nakayama rule for $k$-Schur functions of Lapointe
and Morse, that is, we give an explicit formula for the expansion of the
product of a power sum symmetric function and a $k$-Schur function in terms of
$k$-Schur functions. This is proved using the noncommutative $k$-Schur
functions in terms of the nilCoxeter algebra introduced by Lam and the affine
analogue of noncommutative symmetric functions of Fomin and Greene.
