Using the method of integral-field (3D) spectroscopy, we have investigated
the kinematics and distribution of the gas and stars at the center of the
early-type spiral galaxy with a medium scale bar NGC 7177 as well as the change
in the mean age of the stellar population along the radius. A classical picture
of radial gas inflow to the galactic center along the shock fronts delineated
by dust concentration at the leading edges of the bar has been revealed. The
gas inflow is observed down to a radius R = 1".5 -- 2", where the gas flows at
the inner Lindblad resonance concentrate in an azimuthally highly inhomogeneous
nuclear star formation ring. The bar in NGC 7177 is shown to be thick in z
coordinate; basically, it has already turned into a pseudo-bulge as a result of
secular dynamical evolution. The mean stellar age inside the star formation
ring, in the galactic nucleus, is old, ~10 Gyr. Outside, at a distance R = 6" -
8" from the nucleus, the mean age of the stellar population is ~2 Gyr. If we
agree that the bar in NGC 7177 is old, then, obviously, the star formation ring
has migrated radially inward in the last 1-2 Gyr, in accordance with the
predictions of some dynamical models.
