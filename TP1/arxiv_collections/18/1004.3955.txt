By application of the coinduction method as well as Magri method to the ideal
of real Hilbert-Schmidt operators we construct the hierarchies of integrable
Hamiltonian systems on the Banach Lie-Poisson spaces which consist of these
type of operators. We also discuss their algebraic and analytic properties as
well as solve them in dimensions N=2,3,4.
