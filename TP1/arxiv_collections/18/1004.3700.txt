Shortcomings of experimental techniques are usually assumed to diminish
nonclassical properties of quantum systems. Here it is demonstrated that this
standard assumption is not true in general. It is theoretically shown that the
inability to resolve different photon numbers in photodetection may
pseudo-increase a measured Bell parameter. Under proper conditions one even
pseudo-violates the quantum Cirel'son bound of the Bell parameter, the
corresponding density operator fails to be positive semi-definite. This paradox
can be resolved by appropriate squash models.
