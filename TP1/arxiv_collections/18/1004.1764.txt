In recent times the algorithms for the simulation of hadronic collisions have
been subject to two substantial improvements: the inclusion, within parton
showering, of exact higher order tree level matrix elements (MEPS) and,
separately, next-to-leading order corrections (NLOPS). In this work we examine
the key criteria to be met in merging the two approaches in such a way that the
accuracy of both is preserved, in the framework of the POWHEG approach to
NLOPS. We then ask to what extent these requirements may be fulfilled using
existing simulations, without modifications. The result of this study is a
pragmatic proposal for merging MEPS and NLOPS events to yield much improved
MENLOPS event samples. We apply this method to W boson and top quark pair
production. In both cases results for distributions within the remit of the NLO
calculations exhibit no discernible changes with respect to the pure NLOPS
prediction; conversely, those sensitive to the distribution of multiple hard
jets assume, exactly, the form of the corresponding MEPS results.
