We suggest a duality between the statistical and standard (dynamical)
distributions of partons in the nucleons. The temperature parameter entering
into the statistical form for the quark distributions is estimated. It is found
that this effective temperature is practically the same for the dependence on
logitudinal and transverse momenta and, it is close to the freeze-out
temperature in high energy heavy-ion collisions.
