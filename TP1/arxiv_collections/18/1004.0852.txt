We apply Painlev\'e test to the most general variable coefficient nonlinear
Schrodinger (VCNLS) equations as an attempt to identify integrable classes and
compare our results versus those obtained by the use of other tools like
group-theoretical approach and the Lax pairs technique of the soliton theory.
We present explicit transformation formulae that can be used to generate new
analytic solutions of VCNLS equations from those of the integrable NLS
equation.
