Complete and physically adequate analytical and semi-analytical solutions
have been obtained using a practical dimensionless form of kinetic equation
assuming azimuthal symmetry and Maxwellian distributions of target plasma
species. Formerly considered simplified equations with truncated Coulomb
collision term do not conserve the number of particles, are inapplicable to
describe high energy distribution tails, and are also essentially unable to
demonstrate the Maxwellization process naturally observed in the low energy
region of correct distributions. The results may be useful in numerical
modeling and in experimental data analysis, especially concerning nuclear
processes and advanced localized, angle-resolved suprathermal particle
diagnostics.
