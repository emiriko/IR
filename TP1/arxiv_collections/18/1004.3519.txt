The main goal of the IceCube Deep Core Array is to search for neutrinos of
astrophysical origins. Atmospheric neutrinos are commonly considered as a
background for these searches. We show here that cascade measurements in the
Ice Cube Deep Core Array can provide strong evidence for tau neutrino
appearance in atmospheric neutrino oscillations. A careful study of these tau
neutrinos is crucial, since they constitute an irreducible background for
astrophysical neutrino detection.
