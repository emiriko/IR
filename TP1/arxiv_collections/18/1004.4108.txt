We show a method to accelerate quantum adiabatic dynamics of wavefunctions
under electro-magnetic field by developing the previous theory (Masuda &
Nakamura 2008 and 2010). Firstly we investigate the orbital dynamics of a
charged particle. We derive the driving field which accelerates quantum
adiabatic dynamics in order to obtain the final adiabatic states except for the
spatially uniform phase such as the adiabatic phase in any desired short time.
Fast-forward of adiabatic squeezing and transport in the electro-magnetic field
is exhibited. Secondly we investigate spin dynamics under the magnetic field,
showing the fast-forward of adiabatic spin inversion and of adiabatic dynamics
in Landau-Zener model. The connection of the present framework with
Kato-Berry's transitionless quantum driving is elucidated in Appendix.
