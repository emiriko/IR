Cloud computing is an emerging platform of service computing designed for
swift and dynamic delivery of assured computing resources. Cloud computing
provide Service-Level Agreements (SLAs) for guaranteed uptime availability for
enabling convenient and on-demand network access to the distributed and shared
computing resources. Though the cloud computing paradigm holds its potential
status in the field of distributed computing, cloud platforms are not yet to
the attention of majority of the researchers and practitioners. More
specifically, still the researchers and practitioners community has fragmented
and imperfect knowledge on cloud computing principles and techniques. In this
context, one of the primary motivations of the work presented in this paper is
to reveal the versatile merits of cloud computing paradigm and hence the
objective of this work is defined to bring out the remarkable significances of
cloud computing paradigm through an application environment. In this work, a
cloud computing model for software testing is developed.
