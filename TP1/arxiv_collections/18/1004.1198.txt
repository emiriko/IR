This paper introduces a class of structured lowdensity parity-check (LDPC)
codes whose parity check matrices are arrays of permutation matrices. The
permutation matrices are obtained from Latin squares and form a finite field
under some matrix operations. They are chosen so that the Tanner graphs do not
contain subgraphs harmful to iterative decoding algorithms. The construction of
column-weight-three codes is presented. Although the codes are optimized for
the Gallager A/B algorithm over the binary symmetric channel (BSC), their error
performance is very good on the additive white Gaussian noise channel (AWGNC)
as well.
