We show that, in antiferromagnetic superconductors, the optical spectral
weight transferred to low frequencies below the superconducting transition
temperature originates from energies that can be much larger than twice the
superconducting gap $\Delta$. This contrasts to non-magnetic superconductors,
where the optical spectrum is suppressed only for frequencies below $2\Delta$.
In particular, we demonstrate that the superfluid condensate of the
magnetically ordered superconductor is not only due to states of the
magnetically reconstructed Fermi surface, but is enhanced by transfer of
spectral weight from the mid infrared peak generated by the spin density wave
gap. We apply our results to the iron arsenide superconductors, addressing the
decrease of the zero-temperature superfluid density in the doping regime where
magnetism coexists with unconventional superconductivity.
