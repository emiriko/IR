We report on THz emission measurements and low temperature scanning laser
imaging of Bi_2Sr_2CaCu_2O_8 intrinsic Josephson junction stacks. Coherent
emission is observed at large dc input power, where a hot spot and a standing
wave, formed in the "cold" part of the stack, coexist. By varying the hot spot
size the cavity resonance frequency and the emitted radiation can be tuned. The
linewidth of radiation is much smaller than expected from the quality factor of
the cavity mode excited. Thus, an additional mechanism of synchronization seems
to play a role, possibly arising from nonequilibrium processes at the hot spot
edge.
