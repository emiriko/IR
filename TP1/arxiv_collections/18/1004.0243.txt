In this paper, we report a case study using two easy-to-deploy
psychophysiological measures - electrodermal activity (EDA) and heart rate (HR)
- and correlating them with a gameplay experience questionnaire (GEQ) in an
attempt to establish this mixed-methods approach for rapid application in a
commercial game development context. Results indicate that there is a
statistically significant correlation (p < 0.01) between measures of
psychophysiological arousal (HR, EDA) and self-reported UX in games (GEQ), with
some variation between the EDA and HR measures. Results are consistent across
three major commercial First-Person Shooter (FPS) games.
