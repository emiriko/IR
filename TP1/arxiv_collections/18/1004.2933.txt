The purpose of this paper is to come up with a framework that "converts"
existing concepts from configuration space to ordinary one. This is done by
modeling our universe as a big "computer" that simulates configuration space.
If that "computer" exists in ordinary space and is ran by "classical" laws, our
theory becomes "classical" by default. We have first applied this concept to a
version of quantum field theory in which elementary particles have size (that
is, a theory that does not yet exists). After that, we have also done the same
with Pilot Wave model of discrete jumps, due to D\"urr et el.
