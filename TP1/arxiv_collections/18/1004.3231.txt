A constraint on the viable f(R) model is investigated by confronting
theoretical predictions with the multipole power spectrum of the luminous red
galaxy sample of the Sloan Digital Sky survey data release 7. We obtain a
constraint on the Compton wavelength parameter of the f(R) model on the scales
of cosmological large-scale structure. A prospect of constraining the Compton
wavelength parameter with a future redshift survey is also investigated. The
usefulness of the redshift-space distortion for testing the gravity theory on
cosmological scales is demonstrated.
