We present a study of axial charges of baryon ground and resonant states with
relativistic constituent quark models. In particular, the axial charges of
octet and decuplet $N$, $\Sigma$, $\Xi$, $\Delta$, $\Sigma^*$, and $\Xi^*$
baryons are considered. The theoretical predictions are compared to existing
experimental data and results from other approaches, notably from lattice
quantum chromodynamics and chiral perturbation theory. The relevance of axial
charges with regard to $\pi$-dressing and spontaneous chiral-symmetry breaking
is discussed.
