... This paper is to describe exploratory research on the design of a modular
autonomous mobile robot controller. The controller incorporates a fuzzy logic
[8] [9] approach for steering and speed control [37], a FL approach for
ultrasound sensing and an overall expert system for guidance. The advantages of
a modular system are related to portability and transportability, i.e. any
vehicle can become autonomous with minimal modifications. A mobile robot test
bed has been constructed in university of Cincinnati using a golf cart base.
This cart has full speed control with guidance provided by a vision system and
obstacle avoidance using ultrasonic sensors. The speed and steering fuzzy logic
controller is supervised through a multi-axis motion controller. The obstacle
avoidance system is based on a microcontroller interfaced with ultrasonic
transducers. This micro-controller independently handles all timing and
distance calculations and sends distance information back to the fuzzy logic
controller via the serial line. This design yields a portable independent
system in which high speed computer communication is not necessary. Vision
guidance has been accomplished with the use of CCD cameras judging the current
position of the robot.[34] [35][36] It will be generating a good image for
reducing an uncertain wrong command from ground coordinate to tackle the
parameter uncertainties of the system, and to obtain good WMR dynamic
response.[1] Here we Apply 3D line following mythology. It transforms from 3D
to 2D and also maps the image coordinates and vice versa, leading to the
improved accuracy of the WMR position. ...
