In this work we discuss the summation of the Parquet class of diagrams within
Green's function theory as a possible framework for ab initio nuclear structure
calculations. The theory is presented and some numerical details are discussed,
in particular the approximations employed. We apply the Parquet method to a
simple model, and compare our results with those from an exact solution. The
main conclusion is that even at the level of approximation presented here, the
results shows good agreement with other comparable ab initio approaches.
