The possibility to probe new physics scenarios of light Majorana neutrino
exchange and right-handed currents at the planned next generation neutrinoless
double beta decay experiment SuperNEMO is discussed. Its ability to study
different isotopes and track the outgoing electrons provides the means to
discriminate different underlying mechanisms for the neutrinoless double beta
decay by measuring the decay half-life and the electron angular and energy
distributions.
