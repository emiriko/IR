We study evolution of isolated neutron stars on long time scale and calculate
distribution of these sources in the main evolutionary stages: Ejector,
Propeller, Accretor, and Georotator. We compare different initial magnetic
field distributions taking into account a possibility of magnetic field decay,
and include in our calculations the stage of subsonic Propeller. It is shown
that though the subsonic propeller stage can be relatively long, initially
highly magnetized neutron stars ($B_0\ga 10^{13}$ G) reach the accretion regime
within the Galactic lifetime if their kick velocities are not too large. The
fact that in previous studies made $>$10 years ago, such objects were not
considered results in a slight increase of the Accretor fraction in comparison
with earlier conclusions. Most of the neutron stars similar to the Magnificent
seven are expected to become accreting from the interstellar medium after few
billion years of their evolution. They are the main predecestors of accreting
isolated neutron stars.
