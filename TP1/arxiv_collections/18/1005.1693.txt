Mean-field theories claim that the capacitance of the double-layer formed at
a metal/ionic conductor interface cannot be larger than that of the Helmholtz
capacitor, whose width is equal to the radius of an ion. However, in some
experiments the apparent width of the double-layer capacitor is substantially
smaller. We propose an alternate, non-mean-field theory of the ionic
double-layer to explain such large capacitance values. Our theory allows for
the binding of discrete ions to their image charges in the metal, which results
in the formation of interface dipoles. We focus primarily on the case where
only small cations are mobile and other ions form an oppositely-charged
background. In this case, at small temperature and zero applied voltage dipoles
form a correlated liquid on both contacts. We show that at small voltages the
capacitance of the double-layer is determined by the transfer of dipoles from
one electrode to the other and is therefore limited only by the weak
dipole-dipole repulsion between bound ions, so that the capacitance is very
large. At large voltages the depletion of bound ions from one of the capacitor
electrodes triggers a collapse of the capacitance to the much smaller
mean-field value, as seen in experimental data. We test our analytical
predictions with a Monte Carlo simulation and find good agreement. We further
argue that our ``one-component plasma" model should work well for strongly
asymmetric ion liquids. We believe that this work also suggests an improved
theory of pseudo-capacitance.
