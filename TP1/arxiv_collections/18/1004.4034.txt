G. B. Riccioli's 1651 Almagestum Novum contains a table of diameters of stars
measured by Riccioli and his associates with a telescope. These telescopically
measured star diameters are spurious, caused by the diffraction of light waves
through the circular aperture of the telescope, but astronomers of the time,
including Riccioli and Galileo Galilei, were unaware of this phenomenon. They
believed that they were seeing the physical bodies of stars. In the Almagestum
Novum Riccioli uses these telescopically measured disks to determine the
physical sizes of stars under both geocentric (or geo-heliocentric - Tychonic)
and heliocentric (Copernican) hypotheses. The physical sizes obtained under the
Copernican hypothesis are immense - dwarfing the Earth, the Sun, and the
Earth's orbit; even exceeding the distances to the stars given by Tycho Brahe.
Thus Riccioli felt that telescopic observations were an effective argument
against the Copernican system.
