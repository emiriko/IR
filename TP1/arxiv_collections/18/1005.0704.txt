This paper introduces a new framework for data hiding security. Contrary to
the existing ones, the approach introduced here is not based on probability
theory. In this paper, a scheme is considered as secure if its behavior is
proven unpredictable. The objective of this study is to enrich the existing
notions of data hiding security with a new rigorous and practicable one. This
new definition of security is based on the notion of topological chaos. It
could be used to reinforce the confidence on a scheme previously proven as
secure by other approaches and it could also be used to study some classes of
attacks that currently cannot be studied by the existing security approaches.
After presenting the theoretical framework of the study, a concrete example is
detailed in order to show how our approach can be applied.
