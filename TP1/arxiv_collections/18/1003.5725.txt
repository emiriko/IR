Topological quantum interactions, namely Chern-Simons terms and global
Wess-Zumino terms, arise naturally in theories with extra dimensions of space
compactified on orbifolds. If the extra dimensions become manifest at the TeV
scale, experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) could observe signatures
of topological interactions. Decays of Kaluza-Klein excitations of neutral
electroweak gauge bosons into pairs of neutral Standard Model gauge bosons, ZZ
and Z+photon, would provide a clean signature, since such decays do not occur
at tree level. In this paper, we investigate the prospects for discovering such
decays at the LHC, in the context of the Higgsless model of electroweak
symmetry breaking. We identify the form of the relevant topological
interactions, and estimate their strength. We find that in the minimal version
of the model, the signal may be observed with about 100 inverse fb of data at
the LHC using the Drell-Yan production process of the Kaluza-Klein gauge
bosons. In addition, it is likely that the ultraviolet completion of the model
would contain additional massive fermions, which can significantly enhance the
signal. With two additional fermion multiplets, observation of the topological
decay modes at the 3-sigma level would be possible with about 100 inverse fb of
data using the highly model-independent vector boson fusion production channel.
