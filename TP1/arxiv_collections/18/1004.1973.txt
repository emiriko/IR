A general analytic procedure is developed for the post-Newtonian limit of
$f(R)$-gravity with metric approach in the Jordan frame by using the harmonic
gauge condition. In a pure perturbative framework and by using the Green
function method a general scheme of solutions up to $(v/c)^4$ order is shown.
Considering the Taylor expansion of a generic function $f$ it is possible to
parameterize the solutions by derivatives of $f$. At Newtonian order,
$(v/c)^2$, all more important topics about the Gauss and Birkhoff theorem are
discussed. The corrections to "standard" gravitational potential
($tt$-component of metric tensor) generated by an extended uniform mass
ball-like source are calculated up to $(v/c)^4$ order. The corrections, Yukawa
and oscillating-like, are found inside and outside the mass distribution. At
last when the limit $f\rightarrow R$ is considered the $f(R)$-gravity converges
in General Relativity at level of Lagrangian, field equations and their
solutions.
