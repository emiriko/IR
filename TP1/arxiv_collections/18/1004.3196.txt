Dendritic cells are antigen presenting cells that provide a vital link
between the innate and adaptive immune system. Research into this family of
cells has revealed that they perform the role of coordinating T-cell based
immune responses, both reactive and for generating tolerance. We have derived
an algorithm based on the functionality of these cells, and have used the
signals and differentiation pathways to build a control mechanism for an
artificial immune system. We present our algorithmic details in addition to
some preliminary results, where the algorithm was applied for the purpose of
anomaly detection. We hope that this algorithm will eventually become the key
component within a large, distributed immune system, based on sound
immunological concepts.
