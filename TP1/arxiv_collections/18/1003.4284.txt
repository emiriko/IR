We present a method to synthesize an arbitrary quantum state of two
superconducting resonators. This state-synthesis algorithm utilizes a coherent
interaction of each resonator with a tunable artificial atom to create
entangled quantum superpositions of photon number (Fock) states in the
resonators. We theoretically analyze this approach, showing that it can
efficiently synthesize NOON states, with large photon numbers, using existing
technology.
