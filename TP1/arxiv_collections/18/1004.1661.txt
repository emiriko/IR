In this article we will show that for every natural $d$ and $n>1$ there
exists a natural number $t$ such that for every $d$-dimensional simplicial
complex $\mathcal{T}$ with vertices in $\mathbb{Z}^d$, the number of lattice
points in the $t^{\mathrm{th}}$ dilate of $\mathcal{T}$ is exactly
$\chi(\mathcal{T})$ modulo $n$, where $\chi(\mathcal{T})$ is the Euler
characteristic of $\mathcal{T}$.
