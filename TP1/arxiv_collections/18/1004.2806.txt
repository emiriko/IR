The paper concerns the classification problem of a subclass of complex
filiform Leibniz algebras in dimensions 7 and 8. This subclass arises from
naturally graded filiform Lie algebras. We give a complete list of isomorphism
classes of algebras including Lie case. In parametric families cases, the
corresponding orbit functions (invariants) are given. In discrete orbits case,
we show representatives of the orbits.
