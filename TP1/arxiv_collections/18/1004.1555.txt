Within a formulation of a Dynamical AdS/QCD model we calculate the spectrum
of light flavored mesons. The background fields of the model correspond to an
IR deformed Anti de Sitter metric coupled to a dilaton field. Confinement comes
as a consequence of the dilaton dynamics coupled to gravity. Additionally to
the Regge-like spectrum of light- scalar, vector and higher spin mesons, we
obtain the decay width of scalar mesons into two pions.
