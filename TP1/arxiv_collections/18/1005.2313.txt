We study pattern formation processes in anisotropic system governed by the
Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation with multiplicative noise as a generalization of
the Bradley-Harper model for ripple formation induced by ion bombardment. For
both linear and nonlinear systems we study noise induced effects at ripple
formation and discuss scaling behavior of the surface growth and roughness
characteristics. It was found that the secondary parameters of the ion beam
(beam profile and variations of an incidence angle) can crucially change the
topology of patterns and the corresponding dynamics.
