Based on the multiple energy level Anderson model, this study theoretically
examines the thermoelectric effects of semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) in the
nonlinear response regime. The charge and heat currents in the sequential
tunneling process are calculated by using the Keldysh Green's function
technique. Results show that the thermal rectification effect can be observed
in a multiple QD junction system, whereas the tunneling rate, size fluctuation,
and location distribution of QD significantly influence the rectification
efficiency.
