A multispecies artificial ecosystem is formulated using cellular automata
with species interactions and food chain hierarchy. The constructed finite
state automaton can simulate the complexity and self-organized characteristics
of the evolving multispecies living ecosystems. Numerical experiments show that
a small perturbation or extinction event may affect many other species in the
ecosystem in an avalanche manner. Both the avalanches and the extinction
arising from these changes follow a power law, reflecting that the multispecies
living ecosytems have the characteristics of self-organized criticality.
