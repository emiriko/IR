By inelastic neutron scattering, we have analyzed the magnetic correlations
in the paramagnetic metallic region of the series Ca(2-x)Sr(x)RuO(4),
0.2<=x<=0.62. We find different contributions that correspond to 2D
ferromagnetic fluctuations and to fluctuations at incommensurate wave vectors
(0.11,0,0), (0.26,0,0) and (0.3,0.3,0). These components constitute the
measured response as function of the Sr-concentration x, of the magnetic field
and of the temperature. A generic model is applicable to metallic
Ca(2-x)Sr(x)RuO(4) close to the Mott transition, in spite of their strongly
varying physical properties. The amplitude, characteristic energy and width of
the incommensurate components vary only little as function of x, but the
ferromagnetic component depends sensitively on concentration, temperature and
magnetic field. While ferromagnetic fluctuations are very strong in
Ca1.38Sr0.62RuO4 with a low characteristic energy of 0.2 meV at T=1.5 K, they
are strongly suppressed in Ca1.8Sr0.2RuO4, but reappear upon the application of
a magnetic field and form a magnon mode above the metamagnetic transition. The
inelastic neutron scattering results document how the competition between
ferromagnetic and incommensurate antiferromagnetic instabilities governs the
physics of this system.
