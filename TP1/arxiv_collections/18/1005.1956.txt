Viral quasispecies can be regarded as a swarm of genetically related mutants
or a quasispecies (QS). A common formalism to approach QS is the
replicator-mutator equation (RME). However, a problem with the RME is how to
quantify the interaction coefficients between viral variants. Here, this is
addressed by adopting an ecological perspective and resorting to the niche
theory of competing communities, which assumes that the utilization of
resources primarily determines ecological segregation between competing
individuals (the different viral variants that constitute the QS). Using this
novel combination of RME plus the ecological concept of niche overlapping, for
describing QS, we explore the population distributions of viral variants that
emerge, as well as the corresponding dynamics. We observe that the population
distribution requires very long transients both to A) reach equilibrium and B)
to show a clear dominating master sequence. Based on different independent and
recent experimental evidence, we find that when some cooperation or
facilitation between variants is included in appropriate doses we can solve
both A) and B). We show that a useful quantity to calibrate the degree of
cooperation is the Shannon entropy. Therefore, in order to get a typical
quasispecies profile, it seems that pure competition is not enough. Rather,
some degree of cooperation among viral variants is needed. This has several
biological implications that might contribute to shed light on the mechanisms
operating in QS dynamics and to understand the QS as a whole entity.
