It is well understood that the studies of correlations between produced
particles, the effects of coherence and chaoticity, an estimation of particle
emitting source size play an important role in high energy physics [1]. We mean
the investigation of the space-time extension or even squeezing of particle
sources via the multiparticle quantum-statistics correlation. We obtain the
two-photon correlation function that can provide the space-time information
about the Higgs-boson source in thermal environment and we argue that such an
investigation could probe the Higgs-boson mass.
