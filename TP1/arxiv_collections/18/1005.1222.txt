We introduce a new control strategy on a two-way deterministic cryptographic
scheme, which relies on a suitable unitary transformation rather than quantum
measurement. The study is developed for d-ary alphabets and the particular
choice of the transformation works when d is an odd prime power. It leads to an
improvement of the protocol security, which we prove to increase with the
alphabet order d.
