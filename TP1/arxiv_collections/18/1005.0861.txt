We discuss decoherence due to electromagnetic fluctuations in charge qubits
formed by two lateral quantum dots. We use an effective circuit model to
evaluate correlations of voltage fluctuations in the qubit setup. These
correlations allows us to estimate energy (T1) and phase (T2) relaxation times
of the the qubit system. Our theoretical estimate of the quality factor due to
dephasing by electromagnetic fluctuations yields values much higher than those
found in recent experiments, indicating that other sources of decoherence play
a dominant role.
