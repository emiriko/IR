In an organic blend the vibrational normal mode excited by exciton splitting
is the same as the one coupled to charge hopping. Excess driving force for
exciton splitting can therefore aid charge transfer, if vibrational relaxation
is slow compared to charge transfer. A model is developed that takes this into
account and hence explains the experimentally observed relation of driving
force for exciton splitting and charge yield and that high charge yields can be
achieved with the observed fast rates of recombination.
