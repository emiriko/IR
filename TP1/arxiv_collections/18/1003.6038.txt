The nonlinear propagation of small but finite amplitude dust ion-acoustic
waves (DIAWs) in an ion-beam driven plasma with Boltzmannian electrons,
positive ions and stationary charged dust grains, is studied by using the
standard reductive perturbation technique (RPT). It is shown that there exist
two critical values $(\gamma_{c1}$ and $\gamma_{c2})$ of ion-beam to ion phase
speed ratio $(\gamma)$, beyond which the beam generated solitons are not
possible. The effects of the parameters, namely $\gamma$, the ratio of the
ion-beam to plasma ion density $(\mu_{i})$, the dust to ion density ratio
$(\mu_{d})$ as well as the ion-beam to plasma ion mass ratio $(\mu)$ on both
the amplitude and width of the stationary DIAWs are analyzed numerically, and
applications of the results to laboratory ion-beam as well as space plasmas
(e.g., auroral plasmas) are explained.
