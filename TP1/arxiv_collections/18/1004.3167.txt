In order to construct accurate point sources simulations at the frequencies
relevant to 21-cm experiments, the angular correlation of radio sources must be
taken into account. This paper presents a measurement of angular two-point
correlation function, w(\theta), at 232 MHz from the MIYUN survey - tentative
measurements of w(\theta) are also performed at 151 MHz. It is found that
double power law with shape w(\theta) = A \theta^{-\gamma} fits the 232 MHz
data well. For the angular lenght of 0.2 degrees < \theta < 0.6 degrees, \gamma
~ -1.12, and this value of slope is independent of the flux-density threshold;
while for angular lenghts much greater than 0.6 degrees, \gamma has a shallower
value of about -0.16. By comparing the results of this paper with previous
measurements of w(\theta), it is discussed how w(\theta) changes with the
change of frequency and completness limit.
