Factorial series played a major role in Stirling's classic book "Methodus
Differentialis" (1730), but now only a few specialists still use them. This
article wants to show that this neglect is unjustified, and that factorial
series are useful numerical tools for the summation of divergent (inverse)
power series. This is documented by summing the divergent asymptotic expansion
for the exponential integral $E_{1} (z)$ and the factorially divergent
Rayleigh-Schr\"{o}dinger perturbation expansion for the quartic anharmonic
oscillator. Stirling numbers play a key role since they occur as coefficients
in expansions of an inverse power in terms of inverse Pochhammer symbols and
vice versa. It is shown that the relationships involving Stirling numbers are
special cases of more general orthogonal and triangular transformations.
