We propose a two-path vortex interferometry experiment based on the
Aharonov-Casher effect for detecting the non-Abelian nature of vortices in a
chiral p-wave superconductor. The effect is based on observing vortex
interference patterns upon enclosing a finite charge of externally controllable
magnitude within the interference path. We predict that when the interfering
vortices enclose an odd number of identical vortices in their path, the
interference pattern disappears only for non-Abelian vortices. When pairing
involves two distinct spin species, we derive the mutual statistics between
half quantum and full quantum vortices and show that, remarkably, our
predictions still hold for the situation of a full quantum vortex enclosing a
half quantum vortex in its path. We discuss the experimentally relevant
conditions under which these effects can be observed.
