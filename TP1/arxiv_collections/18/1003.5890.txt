This paper presents an brief review of some recent work on the causal set
approach to quantum gravity. Causal sets are a discretisation of spacetime that
allow the symmetries of GR to be preserved in the continuum approximation. One
proposed application of causal sets is to use them as the histories in a
quantum sum-over-histories, i.e. to construct a quantum theory of spacetime.
  It is expected by many that quantum gravity will introduce some kind of
"fuzziness", uncertainty and perhaps discreteness into spacetime, and generic
effects of this fuzziness are currently being sought. Applied as a model of
discrete spacetime, causal sets can be used to construct simple
phenomenological models which allow us to understand some of the consequences
of this general expectation.
