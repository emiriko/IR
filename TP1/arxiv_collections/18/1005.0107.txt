We demonstrate and explain a simple and efficient way to remove gas bubbles
from liquid-filled microchannels, by integrating a hydrophobic porous membrane
on top of the microchannel. A prototype chip is manufactured in hard,
transparent polymer with the ability to completely filter gas plugs out of a
segmented flow at rates up to 7.4 microliter/s per mm2 of membrane area. The
device involves a bubble generation section and a gas removal section. In the
bubble generation section, a T-junction is used to generate a train of gas
plugs into a water stream. These gas plugs are then transported towards the gas
removal section, where they slide along a hydrophobic membrane until complete
removal. The system has been successfully modeled and four necessary operating
criteria have been determined to achieve a complete separation of the gas from
the liquid. The first criterion is that the bubble length needs to be larger
than the channel diameter. The second criterion is that the gas plug should
stay on the membrane for a time sufficient to transport all the gas through the
membrane. The third criterion is that the gas plug travel speed should be lower
than a critical value: otherwise a stable liquid film between the bubble and
the membrane prevents mass transfer. The fourth criterion is that the pressure
difference across the membrane should not be larger than the Laplace pressure
to prevent water from leaking through the membrane.
