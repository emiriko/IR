We investigate the phase space structure and dynamics of a Hamiltonian
isokinetic thermostat, for which ergodic thermostat trajectories at fixed
(zero) energy generate a canonical distribution in configuration space. Model
potentials studied consist of a single bistable mode plus transverse harmonic
modes. Interpreting the bistable mode as a reaction (isomerization) coordinate,
we establish connections with the theory of unimolecular reaction rates, in
particular the formulation of isomerization rates in terms of gap times. The
distribution of gap times (or associated lifetimes) for a microcanonical
ensemble initiated on the dividing surface is of great dynamical significance;
an exponential lifetime distribution is usually taken to be an indicator of
`statistical' behavior. Moreover, comparison of the magnitude of the phase
space volume swept out by reactive trajectories as they pass through the
reactant region with the total phase space volume (classical density of states)
for the reactant region provides a necessary condition for ergodic dynamics. We
compute gap times, associated lifetime distributions, mean gap times, reactive
fluxes, reactive volumes and total reactant phase space volumes for model
systems with 3 degrees of freedom, at three different temperatures. At all
three temperatures, the necessary condition for ergodicity is approximately
satisfied. At high temperatures a non-exponential lifetime distribution is
found, while at low temperatures the lifetime is more nearly exponential. The
degree of exponentiality of the lifetime distribution is quantified by
computing the information entropy deficit with respect to pure exponential
decay. The efficacy of the Hamiltonian isokinetic thermostat is examined by
computing coordinate distributions averaged over single long trajectories
initiated on the dividing surface.
