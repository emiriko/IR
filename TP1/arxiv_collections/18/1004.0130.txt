Recent experiments have confirmed the importance of nuclear quantum effects
even in large biomolecules at physiological temperature. Here we describe how
the path integral formalism can be used to describe rigorously the nuclear
quantum effects on equilibrium and kinetic properties of molecules.
Specifically, we explain how path integrals can be employed to evaluate the
equilibrium (EIE) and kinetic (KIE) isotope effects, and the temperature
dependence of the rate constant. The methodology is applied to the [1,5]
sigmatropic hydrogen shift in pentadiene. Both the KIE and the temperature
dependence of the rate constant confirm the importance of tunneling and other
nuclear quantum effects as well as of the anharmonicity of the potential energy
surface. Moreover, previous results on the KIE were improved by using a
combination of a high level electronic structure calculation within the
harmonic approximation with a path integral anharmonicity correction using a
lower level method.
