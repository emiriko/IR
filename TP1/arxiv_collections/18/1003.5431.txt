Storage networking technology has enjoyed strong growth in recent years, but
security concerns and threats facing networked data have grown equally fast.
Today, there are many potential threats that are targeted at storage networks,
including data modification, destruction and theft, DoS attacks, malware,
hardware theft and unauthorized access, among others. In order for a Storage
Area Network (SAN) to be secure, each of these threats must be individually
addressed. In this paper, we present a comparative study by implementing
different security methods in IP Storage network.
