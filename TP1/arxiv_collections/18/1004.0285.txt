This chapter describes the progress made during the past three decades in the
finite size scaling analysis of the critical phenomena of the Anderson
transition. The scaling theory of localisation and the Anderson model of
localisation are briefly sketched. The finite size scaling method is described.
Recent results for the critical exponents of the different symmetry classes are
summarised. The importance of corrections to scaling are emphasised. A
comparison with experiment is made, and a direction for future work is
suggested.
