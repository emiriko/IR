Although the so called tetralemma might seem to be incompatible with any
recognized scheme of logical inference, its four alternatives arise naturally
within the anhomomorphic logics which have been proposed in order to
accommodate certain features of microscopic (i.e. quantum) physics. This
suggests that the possibility of similar, "non-classical" logics might have
been recognized in India at the time when Buddhism arose.
