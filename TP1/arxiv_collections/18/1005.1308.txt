Nucleon transfer reactions in low-energy deuteron-deuteron scattering are
described by solving exact four-particle equations in momentum space. The
Coulomb interaction between the protons is included using the screening and
renormalization method. Various realistic potentials are used between nucleon
pairs. The energy dependence of the differential cross section, analyzing
powers, polarizations, spin-transfer coefficient, and the quintet suppression
factor is studied.
