The approach of Observational Astronomy is mainly aimed at the construction
of larger aperture telescopes, more sensitive detectors and broader wavelength
coverage. Certainly fruitful, this approach turns out to be not completely
fulfilling the needs when phenomena related to the formation of black holes
(BH), neutron stars (NS) and relativistic stars in general are concerned.
Recently, mainly through the Vela, Beppo-SAX and Swift satellites, we reached a
reasonable knowledge of the most violent events in the Universe and of some of
the processes we believe are leading to the formation of black holes (BH). We
plan to open a new window of opportunity to study the variegated physics of
very fast astronomical transients, particularly the one related to extreme
compact objects. The innovative approach is based on three cornerstones: 1) the
design (the conceptual design has been already completed) of a 3m robotic
telescope and related focal plane instrumentation characterized by the unique
features: "No telescope points faster"; 2) simultaneous multi-wavelengths
observations (photometry, spectroscopy o\& polarimetry); 3) high time
resolution observations. The conceptual design of the telescope and related
instrumentation is optimized to address the following topics: High frequency
a-periodic variability, Polarization, High z GRBs, Short GRBs, GRB-Supernovae
association, Multi-wavelengths simultaneous photometry and rapid low dispersion
spectroscopy. This experiment will turn the "exception" (like the optical
observations of GRB 080319B) to "routine".
