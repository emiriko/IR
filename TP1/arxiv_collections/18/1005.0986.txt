We report on the ground-based follow-up program of spectroscopic and
photometric observations of solar-like asteroseismic targets for the Kepler
space mission. These stars constitute a large group of more than thousand
objects which are the subject of an intensive study of the Kepler Asteroseismic
Science Consortium Working Group 1 (KASC WG-1). The main goal of this
coordinated research is the determination of the fundamental stellar
atmospheric parameters, which are used for the computing of their asteroseismic
models, as well as for the verification of the Kepler Input Catalogue (KIC).
