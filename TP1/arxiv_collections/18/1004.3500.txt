Currently there exists no known way to construct the Stress-Energy Tensor
$(T_{\mu \nu})$ of the produced medium in heavy ion collisions at strong
coupling from purely theoretical grounds. In this paper, some steps are taken
in that direction. In particular, the evolution of $T_{\mu \nu}$ at strong
coupling and at high energies is being studied for early proper times $(\tau)$.
This is achieved in the context of the AdS/CFT duality by constructing the
evolution of the dual geometry in an AdS$_5$ background. Improving the earlier
works in the literature, the two incident nuclei have an impact parameter $b$
and a non-trivial transverse profile. The nuclear matter is modeled by two
shock waves corresponding to a non-zero five dimensional bulk Stress-Energy
Tensor $J_{MN}$. An analytic formula for $T_{\mu \nu}$ at small $\tau$ is
derived and is used in order to calculate the momentum anisotropy and spatial
eccentricity of the medium produced in the collision as a function of the ratio
$\frac{\tau}{b}$. The result for eccentricity at intermediate $\frac{\tau}{b}$
agrees qualitatively with the results obtained in the context of perturbation
theory and by using hydrodynamic simulations. Finally, the problem of the
negative energy density and its natural connection to the eikonal approximation
is discussed.
