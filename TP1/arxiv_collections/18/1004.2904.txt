We discuss an experimental technique aimed at tagging electron neutrinos in
multi-GeV artificial sources on an event-by-event basis. It exploits in a novel
manner calorimetric and tracking technologies developed in the framework of the
LHC experiments and of rare kaon decay searches. The setup is suited for
slow-extraction, moderate power beams and it is based on an instrumented decay
tunnel equipped with tagging units that intercept secondary and tertiary
leptons from the bulk of undecayed \pi^+ and protons. We show that the taggers
are able to reduce the \nue contamination originating from K_e3 decays by about
one order of magnitude. Only a limited suppression (~60%) is achieved for \nue
produced by the decay-in-flight of muons; for low beam powers, similar
performance as for K_e3 can be reached supplementing the tagging system with an
instrumented beam dump.
