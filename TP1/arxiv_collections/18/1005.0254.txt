We examine the nonlinear magnetofrictional extrapolation scheme using the
solar active region model by Titov and D\'emoulin as test field. This model
consists of an arched, line-tied current channel held in force-free equilibrium
by the potential field of a bipolar flux distribution in the bottom boundary. A
modified version, having a parabolic current density profile, is employed here.
We find that the equilibrium is reconstructed with very high accuracy in a
representative range of parameter space, using only the vector field in the
bottom boundary as input. Structural features formed in the interface between
the flux rope and the surrounding arcade-"hyperbolic flux tube" and "bald patch
separatrix surface"-are reliably reproduced, as are the flux rope twist and the
energy and helicity of the configuration. This demonstrates that force-free
fields containing these basic structural elements of solar active regions can
be obtained by extrapolation. The influence of the chosen initial condition on
the accuracy of reconstruction is also addressed, confirming that the initial
field that best matches the external potential field of the model quite
naturally leads to the best reconstruction. Extrapolating the magnetogram of a
Titov-D\'emoulin equilibrium in the unstable range of parameter space yields a
sequence of two opposing evolutionary phases which clearly indicate the
unstable nature of the configuration: a partial buildup of the flux rope with
rising free energy is followed by destruction of the rope, losing most of the
free energy.
