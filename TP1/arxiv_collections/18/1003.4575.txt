In a unified viewpoint in quantum channel estimation, we compare the
Cramer-Rao and the mini-max approaches, which gives the Bayesian bound in the
group covariant model. For this purpose, we introduce the local asymptotic
mini-max bound, whose maximum is shown to be equal to the asymptotic limit of
the mini-max bound. It is shown that the local asymptotic mini-max bound is
strictly larger than the Cramer-Rao bound in the phase estimation case while
the both bounds coincide when the minimum mean square error decreases with the
order O(1/n). We also derive a sufficient condition for that the minimum mean
square error decreases with the order O(1/n).
