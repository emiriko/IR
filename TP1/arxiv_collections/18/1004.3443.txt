We report the results of our multicolor observations of PG 1115+080 with the
1.5-m telescope of the Maidanak Observatory (Uzbekistan, Central Asia) in
2001-2006. Monitoring data in filter R spanning the 2004, 2005 and 2006 seasons
(76 data points) demonstrate distinct brightness variations of the source
quasar with the total amplitude of almost 0.4 mag. Our R light curves have
shown image C leading B by 16.4d and image (A1+A2) by 12d that is inconsistent
with the previous estimates obtained by Schechter et al. in 1997 - 24.7d
between B and C and 9.4d between (A1+A2) and C. The new values of time delays
in PG 1115+080 must result in larger values for the Hubble constant, thus
reducing difference between its estimates taken from the gravitational lenses
and with other methods. Also, we analyzed variability of the A2/A1 flux ratio,
as well as color changes in the archetypal "fold" lens PG 1115+080. We found
the A1/A2 flux ratio to grow during 2001-2006 and to be larger at longer
wavelengths. In particular, the A2/A1 flux ratio reached 0.85 in filter I in
2006. We also present evidence that both the A1 and A2 images might have
undergone microlensing during 2001-2006, with the descending phase for A1 and
initial phase for A2. We find that the A2/A1 flux ratio anomaly in PG 1115 can
be well explained both by microlensing and by finite distance of the source
quasar from the caustic fold.
