We show, considering a specific f(R)-gravity model, that the Jordan frame and
the Einstein frame are physically non-equivalent, although they are connected
by a conformal transformation which yields a mathematical equivalence. Since
all the calculations are performed analytically, this non-equivalence is shown
in an unambiguous way.
