Some of X-ray dim isolated neutron stars (XDINS) and central compact objects
in supernova remnants (CCO) show absorption features in their thermal soft
X-ray spectra. It has been hypothesized that these features could be due to the
periodic peaks in free-free absorption opacities, caused by either Landau
quantization of electron motion in magnetic fields B<10^{11} G or analogous
quantization of ion motion in magnetic fields B>10^{13} G. Here, I review the
physics behind cyclotron quantum harmonics in free-free photoabsorption,
discuss different approximations for their calculation, and explain why the ion
cyclotron harmonics (beyond the fundamental) cannot be observed.
