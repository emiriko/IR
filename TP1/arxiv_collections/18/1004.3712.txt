This article presents and grounds (i.e. presents proof of the existence, the
truth, the self-consistence and the completeness of)the informational
conception ("the Information as Absolute" conception)in physics and philosophy.
the conception defines the information as an ultimately common, real and
fundamental concept/phenomenon - "Absolute", which exists as anabsolutely
infinite set ("Information" Set) of elements (members) and informational (e.g.,
logical) linksbetween the elements; where any element itself is some
informational structure also. Correspondingly, for example, Matter as the
substence, radiation, etc., is some development or realization of informational
patterns, constituting a specific - and practically infinitesimal comparing to
the Set - subset of the "Information" Set. The conception allows for the
resolution, or at least for a consideration on a higher level of comprehension,
of the basic ontological and epistemological problems in philosophy and natural
sciences; in physics it allows to suggest reasonable model, which makes more
clear basic phisical notions,such as space, time, matter, etc.
