In this paper we present a theoretical and experimental study of the
dynamical behaviour of birefringent cavities. Our experimental data show that
usual hypothesis which provides that a Fabry-Perot cavity is a first-order low
pass filter cannot explain the behaviour of a birefringent cavity. We explain
this phenomenon, and give the theoretical expression of the equivalent cavity
filter which corresponds to a second-order low pass filter.
