For 100-Gb/s quadriphase-shift keying (QPSK) signal with on-off keying (OOK)
signal in neighboring wavelength-division-multiplexed (WDM) channel, the
smoothing filter in the feedforward phase estimation scheme must be optimized
to minimize the phase error. With optimal Wiener filter, typical 0-dBm launched
power 10-Gb/s OOK signals give a SNR penalty of 0.66 and 0.30 dB for standard
single-mode and nonzero dispersion-shifted fibers, respectively.
