In paper the closed Friedmann-Robertson-Walker model with quantization in
presence of the positive cosmological constant, radiation and Chaplygin gas is
studied. For analysis of tunneling probability for birth of an asymptotically
deSitter, inflationary Universe as a function of the radiation energy a new
definition of a "free" wave propagating inside strong fields is introduced.
Vilenkin's tunneling boundary condition is corrected, penetrability and
reflection are calculated in fully quantum stationary approach.
