We have measured de Haas-van Alphen oscillations of Cr$_{1-x}$V$_x$, $0 \le x
\le 0.05$, at high fields for samples on both sides of the quantum critical
point at $x_c=0.035$. For all samples we observe only those oscillations
associated with a single small hole band with magnetic breakdown orbits of the
reconstructed Fermi surface evident for $x<x_c$. The absence of oscillations
from Fermi surface sheets most responsible for the spin density wave (SDW) in
Cr for $x>x_c$ is further evidence for strong fluctuation scattering of these
charge carriers well into the paramagnetic regime. We find no significant mass
enhancement of the carriers in the single observed band at any $x$. An
anomalous field dependence of the dHvA signal for our $x=0.035$ crystal at
particular orientations of the magnetic field is identified as due to magnetic
breakdown that we speculate results from a field induced SDW transition at high
fields.
