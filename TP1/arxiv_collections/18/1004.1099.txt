We present the results of our investigation into the stellar populations of
24 radio galaxies at z~0.5 drawn from four complete, low-frequency selected
radio surveys. We use the strength of the 4000A break as an indicator of recent
star formation, and compare this with radio luminosity, optical spectral
classification and morphological classification. We find evidence of different
star formation histories for high- and low-luminosity radio sources; our group
of low radio luminosity sources (typically FRI-type sources) has systematically
older stellar populations than the higher radio luminosity group. Our sample is
also fairly well divided by optical spectral classification. We find that
galaxies classified as having low excitation spectra (LEGs) possess older
stellar populations than high excitation line objects (HEGs), with the HEGs
showing evidence for recent star formation. We also investigate the link
between radio morphology, as used by Owen & Laing (1989), and the stellar
populations. We find that there is a preference for the "fat-double" sources to
have older stellar populations than the "classical double" sources, although
this is also linked to these sources lying predominantly in the LEG and HEG
categories respectively. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that
HEGs are powered by accretion of cold gas, which could be supplied, for
example, by recent mergers, secular instabilities, or filamentary cold flows.
These processes could also trigger star formation in the host galaxy. The host
galaxies of the LEGs do not show evidence for recent star formation and an
influx of cold gas, and are consistent with being powered by the accretion of
the hot phase of the inter-stellar medium.
