We consider deeply virtual Compton scattering and deep inelastic scattering
in presence of Regge exchanges that are part of the non-perturbative
quark-nucleon amplitude. In particular we discuss contribution from the Pomeron
exchange and demonstrate how it leads to Regge scaling of the Compton
amplitude. Comparison with HERA data is given.
