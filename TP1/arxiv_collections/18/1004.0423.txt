Recently, Biswas and Milovic [Appl. Math. Comput. 208 (2009) 209-302] have
found optical one-soliton solutions of a fourth order dispersive cubic-quintic
nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. In this comment, we first show there are
mistakes in the paper and demonstrate that the obtained solutions do not
satisfy the considered equation. And then we reconstruct a series of analytical
exact solutions by means of a direct ansatz method and F-expansion method.
These solutions include solitary wave solutions of the bell shape, solitary
wave solutions of the kink shape, and periodic wave solutions of Jacobian
elliptic function.
