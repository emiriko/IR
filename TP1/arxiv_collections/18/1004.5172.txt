Electrons hopping on the sites of a two-dimensional Lieb lattice and
three-dimensional edge centered cubic (perovskite) lattice are shown to form
topologically non-trivial insulating phases when spin-orbit coupling is
introduced. These simple models on lattices with cubic symmetry show a
Dirac-like structure in the excitation spectrum but with the unusual feature
that there is a dispersionless band through the center of the spectrum and only
a single Dirac cone per Brillouin zone.
