We look for algebraic certificates of positivity for functions which are not
necessarily polynomial functions. Similar questions were examined earlier by
Lasserre and Putinar and by Putinar. We explain how these results can be
understood as results on hidden positivity: The required positivity of the
functions implies their positivity when considered as polynomials on the real
variety of the respective algebra of functions. This variety is however not
directly visible in general. We show how algebras and quadratic modules with
this hidden positivity property can be constructed. We can then use known
results, for example Jacobi's representation theorem or the Krivine-Stengle
Positivstellensatz to obtain certificates of positivity relative to a quadratic
module of an algebra of real-valued functions. Our results go beyond the
results of Lasserre and Putinar, for example when dealing with non-continuous
functions. The conditions are also easier to check. We explain the application
of our result to various sorts of real finitely generated algebras of
semialgebraic functions. The emphasis is on the case where the quadratic module
is also finitely generated. Our results also have application to optimization
of real-valued functions, using the semidefinite programming relaxation methods
pioneered by Lasserre.
