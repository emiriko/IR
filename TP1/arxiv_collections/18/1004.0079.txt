Mass calculations carried out by Strutinsky's shell correction method are
based on the notion of smooth single particle level density. The smoothing
procedure is always performed using curvature correction. In the presence of
curvature correction a smooth function remains unchanged if smoothing is
applied. Two new curvature correction methods are introduced. The performance
of the standard and new methods are investigated using harmonic oscillator and
realistic potentials.
