We investigate three-body recombination loss across a Feshbach resonance in a
gas of ultracold 7Li atoms prepared in the absolute ground state and perform a
comparison with previously reported results of a different nuclear-spin state
[N. Gross et.al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 103 163202, (2009)]. We extend the
previously reported universality in three-body recombination loss across a
Feshbach resonance to the absolute ground state. We show that the positions and
widths of recombination minima and Efimov resonances are identical for both
states which indicates that the short-range physics is nuclear-spin
independent.
