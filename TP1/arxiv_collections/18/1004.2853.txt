As a result of the variability survey in Chi Persei and NGC6910, the number
of Beta Cep stars that are members of these two open clusters is increased to
twenty stars, nine in NGC6910 and eleven in Chi Persei. We compare pulsational
properties, in particular the frequency spectra, of Beta Cep stars in both
clusters and explain the differences in terms of the global parameters of the
clusters. We also indicate that the more complicated pattern of the variability
among B type stars in Chi Persei is very likely caused by higher rotational
velocities of stars in this cluster. We conclude that the sample of pulsating
stars in the two open clusters constitutes a very good starting point for the
ensemble asteroseismology of Beta Cep-type stars and maybe also for other
B-type pulsators.
