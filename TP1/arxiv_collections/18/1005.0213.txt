This article deals with OLAP systems based on multidimensional model. The
conceptual model we provide, represents data through a constellation
(multi-facts) composed of several multi-hierarchy dimensions. In this model,
data are displayed through multidimensional tables. We define a query algebra
handling these tables. This user oriented algebra is composed of a closure core
of OLAP operators as soon as advanced operators dedicated to complex analysis.
Finally, we specify a graphical OLAP language based on this algebra. This
language facilitates analyses of decision makers.
