Coherent charge transfer through a ballistic gated SINIS junction is mediated
by the resonant tunneling via the Andreev states. Extra charge accommodated on
the Andreev levels partially compensates the charge induced by the gate voltage
preserving the electron wavelength and maintaining the resonance conditions in
a broad range of gate voltages. As a result, the transparency of the junction
as well as the supercurrent trough it can be substantially increased as
compared to the zero-Coulomb case.
