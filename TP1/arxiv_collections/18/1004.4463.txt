Software developers and maintainers need to read and understand source
programs and other software artifacts. The increase in size and complexity of
software drastically affects several quality attributes, especially
understandability and maintainability. False interpretation often leads to
ambiguities, misunderstanding and hence to faulty development results. Despite
the fact that software understandability is vital and one of the most
significant components of the software development process, it is poorly
managed. This is mainly due to the lack of its proper management and control.
The paper highlights the importance of understandability in general and as a
factor of software testability. Two major contributions are made in the paper.
A relation between testability factors and object oriented characteristics has
been established as a first contribution. In second contribution, a model has
been proposed for estimating understandability of object oriented software
using design metrics. In addition, the proposed model has been validated using
experimental try-out.
