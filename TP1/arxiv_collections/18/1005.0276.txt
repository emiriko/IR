For a finite dimensional hereditary algebra, we consider: exceptional
sequences in the category of finite dimensional modules, silting objects in the
bounded derived category, and m-cluster tilting objects in the m-cluster
category. There are mutation operations on both the set of m-cluster tilting
objects and the set of exceptional sequences. It is also possible to define a
mutation operation for silting objects. We compare these three different
notions of mutation.
