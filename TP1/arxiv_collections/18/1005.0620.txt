Sun-like stars are promising candidates to host exoplanets and are often
included in exoplanet surveys by radial velocity (RV) and direct imaging. In
this paper we report on the detection of a stellar companion to the nearby
solar-analogue star HD 104304, which previously was considered to host a
planetary mass or brown dwarf companion. We searched for close stellar and
substellar companions around extrasolar planet host stars with high angular
resolution imaging to characterize planet formation environments. The detection
of the stellar companion was achieved by high angular resolution measurements,
using the "Lucky Imaging" technique at the ESO NTT 3.5m with the AstraLux Sur
instrument. We combined the results with VLT/NACO archive data, where the
companion could also be detected. The results were compared to precise RV
measurements of HD 104304, obtained at the Lick and Keck observatories from
2001-2010.
  We confirmed common proper motion of the binary system. A spectral type of
M4V of the companion and a mass of 0.21 M_Sun was derived. Due to comparison of
the data with RV measurements of the unconfirmed planet candidate listed in the
Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia, we suggest that the discovered companion is
the origin of the RV trend and that the inclination of the orbit of
approximately 35 degrees explains the relatively small RV signal.
