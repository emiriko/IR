Visual Cryptography is a secret sharing scheme that uses the human visual
system to perform computations. This paper presents a recursive hiding scheme
for 3 out of 5 secret sharing. The idea used is to hide smaller secrets in the
shares of a larger secret without an expansion in the size of the latter.
