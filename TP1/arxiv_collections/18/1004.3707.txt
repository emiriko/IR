For a bipartite honeycomb lattice, we show that the Berry phase depends not
only on the shape of the system but also on the hopping couplings. Using the
entanglement entropy spectra obtained by diagonalizing the block Green's
function matrices, the maximal entangled state with the eigenvalue
$\lambda_m=1/2$ of the reduced density matrix is shown to have one-to-one
correspondence to the zero energy states of the lattice with open boundaries,
which depends on the Berry phase. For the systems with finite bearded edges
along $x$-direction we find critical hopping couplings: the maximal entangled
states (zero-energy states) appear pair by pair if one increases the hopping
coupling $h$ over the critical couplings $h_c$s.
