We examine several conducting spheres moving through a magnetic field
gradient. An analytical approximation is derived and an experiment is conducted
to verify the analytical solution. The experiment is simulated as well to
produce a numerical result. Both the low and high magnetic Reynolds number
regimes are studied. Deformation of the sphere is noted in the high Reynolds
number case. It is suggested that this deformation effect could be useful for
designing or enhancing present protection systems against space debris.
