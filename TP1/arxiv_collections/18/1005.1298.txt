We present two complementary methods, each applicable in a different range,
to evaluate the distribution of the lowest eigenvalue of random matrices in a
Jacobi ensemble. The first method solves an associated Painleve VI nonlinear
differential equation numerically, with suitable initial conditions that we
determine. The second method proceeds via constructing the power-series
expansion of the Painleve VI function. Our results are applied in a forthcoming
paper in which we model the distribution of the first zero above the central
point of elliptic curve L-function families of finite conductor and of
conjecturally orthogonal symmetry.
