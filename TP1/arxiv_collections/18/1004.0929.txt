Bases of finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces (in dimension d) of relevance for
quantum information and quantum computation are constructed from angular
momentum theory and su(2) Lie algebraic methods. We report on a formula for
deriving in one step the (1+p)p qupits (i.e., qudits with d = p a prime
integer) of a complete set of 1+p mutually unbiased bases in C^p. Repeated
application of the formula can be used for generating mutually unbiased bases
in C^d with d = p^e (e > or = 2) a power of a prime integer. A connection
between mutually unbiased bases and the unitary group SU(d) is briefly
discussed in the case d = p^e.
