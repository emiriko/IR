In this paper, the fading broadcast channel with confidential messages is
studied in the presence of statistical quality of service (QoS) constraints in
the form of limitations on the buffer length. We employ the effective capacity
formulation to measure the throughput of the confidential and common messages.
We assume that the channel side information (CSI) is available at both the
transmitter and the receivers. Assuming average power constraints at the
transmitter side, we first define the effective secure throughput region, and
prove that the throughput region is convex. Then, we obtain the optimal power
control policies that achieve the boundary points of the effective secure
throughput region.
