It has been shown by us recently that Einstein was right in his controversy
with Bohr or that the so called hidden-variable theory should be preferred to
the Copenhagen quantum mechanics. In the following paper the corresponding
arguments will be shortly repeated. The main attention will be then devoted to
explaining main differences between these two quantum alternatives, differing
in the access to the problem of chance, causality and locality of microscopic
objects. The actual meaning of the mentioned hidden variables will be
discussed, too, the essence of which remained practically unclear during all
past discussions. It will be shown that the theory of hidden variables (or
Schroedinger equation alone) is able to represent the properties of the whole
known physical reality.
