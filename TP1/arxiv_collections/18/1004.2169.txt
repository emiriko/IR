We present a full calculation of the supersymmetric NLO corrections to Higgs
boson production via vector-boson fusion. The supersymmetric QCD corrections
turn out to be significantly smaller than the electroweak ones. These
higher-order corrections are an important ingredient to a precision analysis of
the Higgs sector at the LHC.
