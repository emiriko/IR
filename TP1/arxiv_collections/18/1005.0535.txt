It was previously shown that models with deformations of special relativity
that have an energy-dependent yet observer-independent speed of light suffer
from nonlocal effects that are in conflict with observation to very high
precision. In a recent paper it has been proposed that these paradoxa arise
only in the classical limit and can be prevented by an ad-hoc introduction of a
quantum uncertainty that would serve to hide the nonlocality. We will show here
that the proposed ansatz for this resolution is inconsistent with
observer-independence and, when corrected, is in agreement with the earlier
argument that revealed the troublesome nonlocality. We further offer an
alternative derivation for the energy-dependent speed of light in the model
used.
