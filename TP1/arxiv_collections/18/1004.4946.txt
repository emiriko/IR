Using data from 2.9/fb of integrated luminosity collected with the CDF II
detector at the Tevatron, we search for resonances decaying into a pair of
on-shell gauge bosons, WW or WZ, where one W decays into an electron and a
neutrino, and the other boson decays into two jets. We observed no
statistically significant excess above the expected standard model background,
and we set cross section limits at 95% confidence level on G*(Randall-Sundrum
graviton), Z', and W' bosons. By comparing these limits to theoretical cross
sections, mass exclusion regions for the three particles are derived. The mass
exclusion regions for Z' and W' are further evaluated as a function of their
gauge coupling strength.
