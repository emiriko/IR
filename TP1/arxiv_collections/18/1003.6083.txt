In the presence of a neighboring atom, electron-ion recombination can proceed
resonantly via excitation of an electron in the atom, with subsequent
relaxation through radiative decay. It is shown that this two-center
dielectronic process can largely dominate over single-center radiative
recombination at internuclear distances as large as several nanometers. The
relevance of the predicted process is demonstrated by using examples of
water-dissolved alkali cations and warm dense matter.
