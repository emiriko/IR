We fabricated thermoresponsive colloidal molecules of ca. 250 nm size.
Electron- and scanning force microscopy reveal the dumbbell-shaped morphology.
The temperature dependence of the size and aspect ratio (ca. 1.4 to 1.6) is
analyzed by depolarized dynamic light scattering and found to be in good
agreement with microscopic evidence.
