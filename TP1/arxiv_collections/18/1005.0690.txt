The corset effect is an experimentally established dynamic confinement
phenomenon first observed by field-cycling NMR relaxometry and transverse NMR
relaxation in polymer melts in pores with dimensions ranging from a few
nanometers up to 0.06 micrometers or even more. The techniques employed are
specifically sensitive to rotational fluctuations of polymer segments. It will
be shown that neutron scattering and other methods probing translational
fluctuations are not suitable for the detection of this phenomenon.
