Primordial non-Gaussianity is a potentially powerful discriminant of the
physical mechanisms that generated the cosmological fluctuations observed
today. Any detection of non-Gaussianity would have profound implications for
our understanding of cosmic structure formation. In this paper, we review past
and current efforts in the search for primordial non-Gaussianity in the large
scale structure of the Universe.
