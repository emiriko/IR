The billiard motion inside an ellipsoid $Q \subset \Rset^{n+1}$ is completely
integrable. Its phase space is a symplectic manifold of dimension $2n$, which
is mostly foliated with Liouville tori of dimension $n$. The motion on each
Liouville torus becomes just a parallel translation with some frequency
$\omega$ that varies with the torus. Besides, any billiard trajectory inside
$Q$ is tangent to $n$ caustics $Q_{\lambda_1},...,Q_{\lambda_n}$, so the
caustic parameters $\lambda=(\lambda_1,...,\lambda_n)$ are integrals of the
billiard map. The frequency map $\lambda \mapsto \omega$ is a key tool to
understand the structure of periodic billiard trajectories. In principle, it is
well-defined only for nonsingular values of the caustic parameters. We present
four conjectures, fully supported by numerical experiments. The last one gives
rise to some lower bounds on the periods. These bounds only depend on the type
of the caustics. We describe the geometric meaning, domain, and range of
$\omega$. The map $\omega$ can be continuously extended to singular values of
the caustic parameters, although it becomes "exponentially sharp" at some of
them. Finally, we study triaxial ellipsoids of $\Rset^3$. We compute
numerically the bifurcation curves in the parameter space on which the
Liouville tori with a fixed frequency disappear. We determine which ellipsoids
have more periodic trajectories. We check that the previous lower bounds on the
periods are optimal, by displaying periodic trajectories with periods four,
five, and six whose caustics have the right types. We also give some new
insights for ellipses of $\Rset^2$.
