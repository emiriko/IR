An opportunistic relay selection based on instantaneous knowledge of channels
is considered to increase security against eavesdroppers. The closed-form
expressions are derived for the average secrecy rates and the outage
probability when the cooperative networks use Decode-and-Forward (DF) or
Amplify-and-Forward (AF) strategy. These techniques are demonstrated
analytically and with simulation results.
