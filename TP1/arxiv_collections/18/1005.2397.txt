We perform direct numerical simulations of the tidal encounter of a rotating
planet on a highly eccentric or parabolic orbit about a central star formulated
as an initial value problem. This approach enables us to extend previous work
of Ivanov & Papaloizou to consider planet models with solid cores and to avoid
making an anelastic approximation. We obtain a power spectrum of the tidal
response of coreless models which enables global inertial modes to be
identified. Their frequencies are found to be in good agreement with those
obtained using either a WKBJ approach or the anelastic spectral approach
adopted in previous work for small planet rotation rates. We also find that the
dependence of the normal mode frequencies on the planet angular velocity in
case of higher rotation rates can for the most part be understood by applying
first order perturbation theory to the anelastic modes. We calculate the energy
and angular momentum exchanged as a result of the tidal encounter and for
coreless models again find good agreement with results obtained using either
the anelastic spectral method. Models with a solid core showed evidence of the
emission of shear layers at critical latitudes and possibly wave attractors
after the encounter but the total energy exchanged during the encounter did not
differ dramatically from the coreless case as long as the ratio of the core
radius to the total radius was less than 50%, there being hardly any difference
at all when this ratio was less than 25% of the total radius. We give a
physical and mathematical interpretation of this result. Finally we are able to
validate the use of the anelastic approximation for both the work presented
here and our previous work which led to estimates of circularisation rates for
planets in highly eccentric orbits.
