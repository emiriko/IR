We report the synthesis and evidence of graphene fluoride, a two-dimensional
wide bandgap semiconductor derived from graphene. Graphene fluoride exhibits
hexagonal crystalline order and strongly insulating behavior with resistance
exceeding 10 G$\Omega$ at room temperature. Electron transport in graphene
fluoride is well described by variable-range hopping in two dimensions due to
the presence of localized states in the band gap. Graphene obtained through the
reduction of graphene fluoride is highly conductive, exhibiting a resistivity
of less than 100 k$\Omega$ at room temperature. Our approach provides a new
path to reversibly engineer the band structure and conductivity of graphene for
electronic and optical applications.
