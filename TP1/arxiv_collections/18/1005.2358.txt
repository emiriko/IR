We introduce quantum versions of the $\chi^2$-divergence, provide a detailed
analysis of their properties, and apply them in the investigation of mixing
times of quantum Markov processes. An approach similar to the one presented in
[1-3] for classical Markov chains is taken to bound the trace-distance from the
steady state of a quantum processes. A strict spectral bound to the convergence
rate can be given for time-discrete as well as for time-continuous quantum
Markov processes. Furthermore the contractive behavior of the
$\chi^2$-divergence under the action of a completely positive map is
investigated and contrasted to the contraction of the trace norm. In this
context we analyse different versions of quantum detailed balance and, finally,
give a geometric conductance bound to the convergence rate for unital quantum
Markov processes.
