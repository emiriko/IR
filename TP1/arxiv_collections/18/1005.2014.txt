Hard bremsstrahlung production in proton-proton collisions has been studied
with the ANKE spectrometer at COSY-Juelich in the energy range of 353-800 MeV
by detecting the final proton pair {pp}_s from the pp -> {pp}_s reaction with
very low excitation energy. Differential cross sections were measured at small
diproton c.m. angles from 0 to 20 degrees and the average over this angular
interval reveals a broad peak at a beam energy around 650 MeV with a FWHM of
about 220 MeV, suggesting the influence of Delta(1232)N intermediate states.
Comparison with deuteron photodisintegration shows that the cross section for
diproton production is up to two orders of magnitude smaller, due largely to
differences in the selection rules.
