We study heat transport in hybrid normal metal - superconductor - normal
metal (NSN) structures. We find the thermal conductance of a short
superconducting wire to be strongly enhanced beyond the BCS value due to
inverse proximity effect. The measurements agree with a model based on the
quasiclassical theory of superconductivity in the diffusive limit. We determine
a crossover temperature below which quasiparticle heat conduction dominates
over the electron-phonon relaxation.
