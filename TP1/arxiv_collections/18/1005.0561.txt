The one-dimensional long-range Ising spin glass provides useful insights into
the properties of finite dimensional spin glasses with short-range
interactions. The defect energy renormalization group equations derived for it
by Kotliar, Anderson and Stein have been re-examined and a new fixed point has
been found. The fixed points which have previously been studied are found to be
inappropriate. It is shown that the renormalization group equations themselves
directly imply that the spin glass phase is replica symmetric, in agreement
with droplet model expectations, when the range exponent $\sigma$ lies between
the upper and lower critical values.
