Recent groundbreaking experiments studying the effects of spin polarization
on pairing in unitary Fermi gases encountered mutual qualitative and
quantitative discrepancies which seem to be a function of the confining
geometry. Using novel numerical algorithms we study the solution space for a
3-dimensional fully self-consistent formulation of realistic systems with up to
$10^{5}$ atoms. A study of the three types of solutions obtained demonstrates a
tendency towards metastability as the confining geometry is elongated. One of
these solutions, which is consistent with Rice experiments at high trap aspect
ratio, supports a state strikingly similar to the long sought
Fulde-Ferrel-Larkin-Ovchinnikov state. Our study helps to resolve the
long-standing controversy concerning the discrepancies between the findings
from two different experimental groups and highlights the versatility of
actual-size numerical calculations for investigating inhomogeneous fermionic
superfluids.
