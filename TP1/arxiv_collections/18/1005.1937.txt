The intermediate-mass star-forming core UYSO 1 has previously been found to
exhibit intriguing features. While deeply embedded and previously only
identified by means of its (sub-)millimeter emission, it drives two powerful,
dynamically young, molecular outflows. Although the process of star formation
has obviously started, the chemical composition is still pristine. We present
Herschel PACS and SPIRE continuum data of this presumably very young region.
The now complete coverage of the spectral energy peak allows us to precisely
constrain the elevated temperature of 26 - 28 K for the main bulge of gas
associated with UYSO1, which is located at the interface between the hot HII
region Sh 2-297 and the cold dark nebula LDN 1657A. Furthermore, the data
identify cooler compact far-infrared sources of just a few solar masses, hidden
in this neighbouring dark cloud.
