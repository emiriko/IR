We study the expansion dynamics of a condensate in a strongly interacting
Bose gas in the presence of an obstacle. Our focus is on the generation of
shock waves after the Bose gas has passed the obstacle. The strongly
interacting Bose gas is described in the slave-boson representation. A
saddle-point approximation provides a nonlinear equation of motion for the
macroscopic wave function, analogous to the Gross-Pitaevskii equation of a
weakly interacting Bose gas but with different nonlinearity. We compare the
results with the Gross-Pitaevskii dynamics of a weakly interacting Bose gas and
find a similar behavior with a slower behavior of the strongly interacting
system.
