Heating mechanisms of the solar corona will be investigated at the
high-altitude solar observatory Lomnicky Peak of the Astronomical Institute of
SAS (Slovakia) using its mid-size Lyot coronagraph and post-focal instrument
SECIS provided by Astronomical Institute of the University of Wroclaw (Poland).
The data will be studied with respect to the energy transport and release
responsible for heating the solar corona to temperatures of mega-Kelvins. In
particular investigations will be focused on detection of possible
high-frequency MHD waves in the solar corona. The scientific background of the
project, technical details of the SECIS system modified specially for the
Lomnicky Peak coronagraph, and inspection of the test data are described in the
paper.
