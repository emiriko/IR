Crisis response requires information intensive efforts utilized for reducing
uncertainty, calculating and comparing costs and benefits, and managing
resources in a fashion beyond those regularly available to handle routine
problems. This paper presents an Artificial Immune Systems (AIS) metaphor for
agent based modeling of crisis response operations. The presented model
proposes integration of hybrid set of aspects (multi-agent systems, built-in
defensive model of AIS, situation management, and intensity-based learning) for
crisis response operations. In addition, the proposed response model is applied
on the spread of pandemic influenza in Egypt as a case study.
