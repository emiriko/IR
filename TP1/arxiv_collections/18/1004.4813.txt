We present a formulation of the density-functional theory + Hubbard model
(DFT+U) method that is self-consistent over the choice of Hubbard projectors
used to define the correlated subspaces. In order to overcome the arbitrariness
in this choice, we propose the use of non-orthogonal generalized Wannier
functions (NGWFs) as projectors for the DFT+U correction. We iteratively refine
these NGWF projectors and, hence, the DFT+U functional, such that the
correlated subspaces are fully self-consistent with the DFT+U ground-state. We
discuss the convergence characteristics of this algorithm and compare
ground-state properties thus computed with those calculated using hydrogenic
projectors. Our approach is implemented within, but not restricted to, a
linear-scaling DFT framework, opening the path to DFT+U calculations on systems
of unprecedented size.
