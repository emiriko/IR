Atomic nanowires formed by Au on Ge(001) are scrutinized for the band
topology of the conduction electron system by k-resolved photoemission. Two
metallic electron pockets are observed. Their Fermi surface sheets form
straight lines without undulations perpendicular to the chains within
experimental uncertainty. The electrons hence emerge as strictly confined to
one dimension. Moreover, the system is stable against a Peierls distortion down
to 10 K, lending itself for studies of the spectral function. Indications for
unusually low spectral weight at the chemical potential are discussed.
