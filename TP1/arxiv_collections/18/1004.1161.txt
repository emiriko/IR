State preparation, qubit rotation, and high fidelity readout are demonstrated
for two separate \baseven qubit types. First, an optical qubit on the narrow
6S$_{1/2}$ to 5D$_{5/2}$ transition at 1.76 $\mu$m is implemented. Then,
leveraging the techniques developed there for readout, a ground state hyperfine
qubit using the magnetically insensitive transition at 8 GHz is accomplished.
