We study the ground-state entanglement of two halves of a critical transverse
Ising chain, separated by an interface defect. From the relation to a
two-dimensional Ising model with a defect line we obtain an exact expression
for the continuously varying effective central charge. The result is relevant
also for other fermionic chains.
