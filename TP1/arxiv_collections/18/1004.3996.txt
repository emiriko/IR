We present kinematic data for 211 bright planetary nebulae in eleven Local
Group galaxies: M31 (137 PNe), M32 (13), M33 (33), Fornax (1), Sagittarius (3),
NGC 147 (2), NGC 185 (5), NGC 205 (9), NGC 6822 (5), Leo A (1), and Sextans A
(1). The data were acquired at the Observatorio Astron\'omico Nacional in the
Sierra de San Pedro M\'artir using the 2.1m telescope and the Manchester
Echelle Spectrometer in the light of [\ion{O}{3}]$\lambda$5007 at a resolution
of 11 km/s. A few objects were observed in H$\alpha$. The internal kinematics
of bright planetary nebulae do not depend strongly upon the metallicity or age
of their progenitor stellar populations, though small systematic differences
exist. The nebular kinematics and H$\beta$ luminosity require that the nebular
shells be accelerated during the early evolution of their central stars. Thus,
kinematics provides an additional argument favoring similar stellar progenitors
for bright planetary nebulae in all galaxies.
