High-density and ultracold atomic gases have emerged as promising media for
storage of individual photons for quantum memory applications. In this paper we
provide an overview of our theoretical and experimental efforts in this
direction, with particular attention paid to manipulation of light storage (a)
through complex recurrent optical scattering processes in very high density
gases (b) by an external control field in a characteristic electromagnetically
induced transparency configuration.
