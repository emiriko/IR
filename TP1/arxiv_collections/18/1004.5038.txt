Polycrystalline samples of Sr2Mn2CuAs2O2, Sr2Mn3As2O2, and Sr2Zn2MnAs2O2 were
synthesized. Their temperature- and applied magnetic field-dependent
structural, transport, thermal, and magnetic properties were characterized by
means of x-ray and neutron diffraction, electrical resistivity rho, heat
capacity, magnetization and magnetic susceptibility measurements. These
compounds have a body-centered-tetragonal crystal structure (space group
I4/mmm) that consists of MO2 (M = Zn and/or Mn) oxide layers similar to the
CuO2 layers in high superconducting transition temperature Tc cuprate
superconductors, and intermetallic MAs (M = Cu and/or Mn) layers similar to the
FeAs layers in high-Tc pnictides. These two types of layers alternate along the
crystallographic c-axis and are separated by Sr atoms. The site occupancies of
Mn, Cu and Zn were studied using Rietveld refinements of x-ray and neutron
powder diffraction data. The temperature dependences of rho suggest metallic
character for Sr2Mn2CuAs2O2 and semiconducting character for Sr2Mn3As2O2 and
Sr2Zn2MnAs2O2. Sr2Mn2CuAs2O2 is inferred to be a ferrimagnet with a Curie
temperature TC = 95(1) K. Remarkably, we find that the magnetic ground state
structure changes from a G-type antiferromagnetic structure in Sr2Mn3As2O2 to
an A-type ferrimagnetic structure in Sr2Mn2CuAs2O2 in which the Mn ions in each
layer are ferromagnetically aligned, but are antiferromagnetically aligned
between layers.
