The proximal average of two convex functions has proven to be a useful tool
in convex analysis. In this note, we express Goebel's self-dual smoothing
operator in terms of the proximal average, which allows us to give a simple
proof of self duality. We also provide a novel self-dual smoothing operator.
Both operators are illustrated by smoothing the norm.
