Antares is currently the largest neutrino telescope operating in the Northern
Hemisphere, aiming at the detection of high-energy neutrinos from astrophysical
sources. Such observations would provide important clues about the processes at
work in those sources, and possibly help solve the puzzle of ultra-high energy
cosmic rays. In this context, Antares is developing several programs to improve
its capabilities of revealing possible spatial and/or temporal correlations of
neutrinos with other cosmic messengers: photons, cosmic rays and gravitational
waves. The neutrino telescope and its most recent results are presented,
together with these multi-messenger programs.
