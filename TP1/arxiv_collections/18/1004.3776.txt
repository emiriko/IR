A non-symplectic generalization of Hamiltonian mechanics is considered. It
allows include into consideration "non-Lagrange" systems, such as theory of
charged particle in the field of magnetic monopole. The corresponding
generalization for the Fedosov manifolds is given. The structure of phase space
of "charged particle in the field of magnetic monopole" is studied.
