A wide variety of models for concurrent programs has been proposed during the
past decades, each one focusing on various aspects of computations: trace
equivalence, causality between events, conflicts and schedules due to resource
accesses, etc. More recently, models with a geometrical flavor have been
introduced, based on the notion of cubical set. These models are very rich and
expressive since they can represent commutation between any bunch of events,
thus generalizing the principle of true concurrency. While they seem to be very
promising - because they make possible the use of techniques from algebraic
topology in order to study concurrent computations - they have not yet been
precisely related to the previous models, and the purpose of this paper is to
fill this gap. In particular, we describe an adjunction between Petri nets and
cubical sets which extends the previously known adjunction between Petri nets
and asynchronous transition systems by Nielsen and Winskel.
