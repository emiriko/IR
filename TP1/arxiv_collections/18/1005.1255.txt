Very light gravitino scenario m_{3/2} < 16 eV is very interesting, since
there is no cosmological problem. However in such a scenario, stability of the
vacuum is an important issue. Recently, Yonekura and one of the authors RS have
investigated the parameter space of a low scale gauge mediation with a
perturbatively stable vacuum and found that there are severe upper bound on the
gaugino masses. In this paper, we show that such a model can be completely
excluded/discovered at very early stage of the LHC run.
