In ordinary quantum theory any mixed state can be purified in an enlarged
Hilbert space by bringing an ancillary system. The purified state does not
depend on the state of any extraneous system with which the mixed state is
going to interact and on the physical interaction. Here, we prove that it is
not possible to purify a mixed state that traverses a closed time like curve
(CTC) and allowed to interact in a consistent way with a causality-respecting
(CR) quantum system in the same manner. Thus, in general for arbitrary
interactions between CR and CTC systems there is no universal 'Church of the
larger Hilbert space' for mixed states with CTC. This shows that in quantum
theory with CTCs there can exist 'proper' and 'improper' mixtures.
