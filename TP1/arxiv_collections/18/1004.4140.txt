We present the first neutron inelastic scattering results on the low
temperature magnetic state of the three dimensional hyperkagom\'e compound
Gd$_{3}$Ga$_{5}$O$_{12}$ (GGG). GGG is often classified as a strongly
frustrated system with a manifold of continuously connected states. However, in
contrast to the expectation of a continuum of gap-less excitations above a spin
liquid-like ground state our results reveal three distinct inelastic modes
found at 0.04(1), 0.12(2) an 0.58(3) meV at 0.06 K. The inelastic modes can be
attributed to the magnetic ground state with the lowest and highest energy
excitations showing spatial dependencies indicative of dimerized short range
antiferromagnetic correlations. Short range correlations, reminiscent of spin
liquid-like order, are static within the instrumental resolution (50 $\mu$eV)
and represent 82% of the spectral weight. Longer range correlations, first
observed by Petrenko, et al.\cite{Petrenko1998, develop below 0.14 ~K within
the elastic cross section. The short range static correlations and dynamic
components survive to high temperatures, comparable to the nearest neighbor
exchange interactions. Our results suggest that the ground state of a three
dimensional hyperkagom\'e compound differs distinctly from its frustrated
counterparts on a pyrochlore lattice and reveals a juxtaposition of spin liquid
order and strong dimerised coupling.
