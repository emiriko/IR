We investigate the variability of CIV 1549A broad absorption line (BAL)
troughs over rest-frame time scales of up to ~7 yr in 14 quasars at redshifts
z>2.1. For 9 sources at sufficiently high redshift, we also compare CIV and
SiIV 1400A absorption variation. We compare shorter- and longer-term
variability using spectra from up to four different epochs per source and find
complex patterns of variation in the sample overall. The scatter in the change
of absorption equivalent width (EW), Delta EW, increases with the time between
observations. BALs do not, in general, strengthen or weaken monotonically, and
variation observed over shorter (<months) time scales is not predictive of
multi-year variation. We find no evidence for asymmetry in the distribution of
Delta EW that would indicate that BALs form and decay on different time scales,
and we constrain the typical BAL lifetime to be >~30 yr. The BAL absorption for
one source, LBQS 0022+0150, has weakened and may now be classified as a
mini-BAL. Another source, 1235+1453, shows evidence of variable, blue continuum
emission that is relatively unabsorbed by the BAL outflow. CIV and SiIV BAL
shape changes are related in at least some sources. Given their high
velocities, BAL outflows apparently traverse large spatial regions and may
interact with parsec-scale structures such as an obscuring torus. Assuming BAL
outflows are launched from a rotating accretion disk, notable azimuthal
symmetry is required in the outflow to explain the relatively small changes
observed in velocity structure over times up to 7 yr.
