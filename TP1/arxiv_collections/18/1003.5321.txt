A tuple (T_1,...,T_k) of (n x n) matrices over R is called hypercyclic if for
some x in R^n the set {T^{m_1} T^{m_2}...T^{m_k} x : m_1,m_2,...,m_k in N} is
dense in R^n. We prove that the minimum number of (n x n) matrices in Jordan
form over R which form a hypercyclic tuple is n+1. This answers a question of
Costakis, Hadjiloucas and Manoussos.
