{\sl Ground Level Enhancement (GLE)} events represent the largest class of
{\sl solar energetic particle (SEP)} events that require acceleration processes
to produce $\gapprox 1$ GeV ions in order to produce showers of secondary
particles in the Earth's atmosphere with sufficient intensity to be detected by
ground-level neutron monitors, above the background of cosmics rays. Although
the association of GLE events with both solar flares and coronal mass ejections
(CMEs) is undisputed, the question arises about the location of the responsible
acceleration site: coronal flare sites or heliospheric CME-associated shocks?
To investigate the first possibility we explore the timing of GLE events with
respect to hard X-ray production in solar flares, considering the height and
magnetic topology of flares, the role of extended acceleration, and particle
trapping. We find that 50% (6 out of 12) of recent (non-occulted) GLE events
are accelerated during the impulsive flare phase, while the remaining half are
accelerated significantly later. It appears that the prompt GLE component,
which is observed in virtually all GLE events, is caused by flare-accelerated
particles in the lower corona, while the delayed gradual GLE component can be
produced by both, either by extended acceleration and/or trapping in flare
sites, or by particles accelerated in CME-associated shocks during their
propagation through the heliosphere.
