Convective driving, the mechanism originally proposed by Brickhill (1991,
1983) for pulsating white dwarf stars, has gained general acceptance as the
generic linear instability mechanism in DAV and DBV white dwarfs. This physical
mechanism naturally leads to a nonlinear formulation, reproducing the observed
light curves of many pulsating white dwarfs. This numerical model can also
provide information on the average depth of a star's convection zone and the
inclination angle of its pulsation axis. In this paper, we give two sets of
results of nonlinear light curve fits to data on the DBV GD 358. Our first fit
is based on data gathered in 2006 by the Whole Earth Telescope (WET); this data
set was multiperiodic, containing at least 12 individual modes. Our second fit
utilizes data obtained in 1996, when GD 358 underwent a dramatic change in
excited frequencies accompanied by a rapid increase in fractional amplitude;
during this event it was essentially monoperiodic. We argue that GD 358's
convection zone was much thinner in 1996 than in 2006, and we interpret this as
a result of a short-lived increase in its surface temperature. In addition, we
find strong evidence of oblique pulsation using two sets of evenly split
triplets in the 2006 data. This marks the first time that oblique pulsation has
been identified in a variable white dwarf star.
