Bilayer lipid membranes [BLMs] are an essential component of all biological
systems, forming a functional barrier for cells and organelles from the
surrounding environment. The lipid molecules that form membranes contain both
permanent and induced dipoles, and an electric field can induce the formation
of pores when the transverse field is sufficiently strong (electroporation).
Here, a phenomenological free energy is constructed to model the response of a
BLM to a transverse static electric field. The model contains a continuum
description of the membrane dipoles and a coupling between the headgroup
dipoles and the membrane tilt. The membrane is found to become unstable through
buckling modes, which are weakly coupled to thickness fluctuations in the
membrane. The thickness fluctuations, along with the increase in interfacial
area produced by membrane buckling, increase the probability of localized
membrane breakdown, which may lead to pore formation. The instability is found
to depend strongly on the strength of the coupling between the dipolar
headgroups and the membrane tilt as well as the degree of dipolar ordering in
the membrane.
