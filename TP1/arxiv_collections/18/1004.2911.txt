We report two novel fabrication techniques, as well as spectral transmission
and propagation loss measurements of the subwavelength plastic wires with
highly porous (up to 86%) and non-porous transverse geometries. The two
fabrication techniques we describe are based on the microstructured molding
approach. In one technique the mold is made completely from silica by stacking
and fusing silica capillaries to the bottom of a silica ampoule. The melted
material is then poured into the silica mold to cast the microstructured
preform. Another approach uses microstructured mold made of plastic which is
co-drawn with a cast preform. Material of the mold is then dissolved after
fiber drawing. We also describe a novel THz-TDS setup with an easily adjustable
optical path length, designed to perform cutback measurements using THz fibers
of up to 50 cm in length. We find that while both porous and non-porous
subwavelength fibers of the same outside diameter have low propagation losses
(\alpha \leg 0.02cm-1), however, the porous fibers exhibit a much wider
spectral transmission window and enable transmission at higher frequencies
compared to the non-porous fibers. We then show that the typical bell-shaped
transmission spectra of the subwavelengths fibers can be very well explained by
the onset of material absorption loss at higher frequencies due to strong
confinement of the modal fields in the material region of the fiber, as well as
strong coupling loss at lower frequencies due to mismatch of the modal field
diameter and a size of the gaussian-like beam of a THz source.
