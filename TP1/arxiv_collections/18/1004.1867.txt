With the development of laser technology, pulse length enters the optical
cycle regime and hence the interaction time between laser pulse and atoms
becomes prominent. We investigate this problem in this Letter through the
photoelectron spectrum of hydrogen atom in few-cycle xuv laser pulses. By
solving one-dimensional time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation, we find that due
to the insufficient interaction time, the electron can not gain enough energy
from optical field when escaping the bind of the nuclear and then the
abnormality appears in the photoelectron spectrum: the peak of photoelectron
spectrum shows red shift compared with the well-known Einstein photo-electric
effect formula. The shift becomes large as the pulse duration decreases.
