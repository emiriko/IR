Theory of differential operators on associative algebras is not extended to
the non-associative ones in a straightforward way. We consider differential
operators on Lie algebras. A key point is that multiplication in a Lie algebra
is its derivation. Higher order differential operators on a Lie algebra are
defined as composition of the first order ones. The Chevalley--Eilenberg
differential calculus over a Lie algebra is defined. Examples of
finite-dimensional Lie algebras, Poisson algebras, algebras of vector fields,
and algebras of canonical commutation relations are considered. Differential
operators on graded Lie algebras are defined just as on the Lie ones.
