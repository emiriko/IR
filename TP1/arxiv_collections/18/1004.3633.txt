We study the optical oscillations of supermodes in planar optical waveguide
arrays with parabolically graded propagation constant in individual waveguide
interacting through nearest neighbor couplings. In these arrays, we have
identified a transition between a symmetric dipole oscillation (DO) and a
symmetry-breaking Bloch oscillation (BO) under appropriate conditions. There
exist obvious correspondences between gradon localization and various optical
oscillations. By virtue of an analogue between the oscillation of optical
system and that of a plane pendulum, we propose a shift of the graded profile
to cause a transition from BO to DO. We confirm the optical transition by means
of Hamiltonian optics, as well as by the field evolution of the supermodes. The
results offer great potential applications in optical switching, which can be
applied to design suitable optical devices.
