We report the discovery by B. G. Harris and S. Dvorak on JD 2455224.9385
(2010 Jan 28.4385 UT) of the predicted eruption of the recurrent nova U Scorpii
(U Sco). We also report on 815 magnitudes (and 16 useful limits) on the
pre-eruption light curve in the UBVRI and Sloan r' and i' bands from 2000.4 up
to 9 hours before the peak of the January 2010 eruption. We found no
significant long-term variations, though we did find frequent fast variations
(flickering) with amplitudes up to 0.4 mag. We show that U Sco did not have any
rises or dips with amplitude greater than 0.2 mag on timescales from one day to
one year before the eruption. We find that the peak of this eruption occurred
at JD 2455224.69+-0.07 and the start of the rise was at JD 2455224.32+-0.12.
From our analysis of the average B-band flux between eruptions, we find that
the total mass accreted between eruptions is consistent with being a constant,
in agreement with a strong prediction of nova trigger theory. The date of the
next eruption can be anticipated with an accuracy of +-5 months by following
the average B-band magnitudes for the next ~10 years, although at this time we
can only predict that the next eruption will be in the year 2020+-2.
