We first construct generalized Riemann-normal coordinates by using
autoparallels, instead of geodesics, in an arbitrary Riemann-Cartan spacetime.
With the aid of generalized Riemann-normal coordinates and their associated
orthonormal frames, we obtain a momentum-space representation of the Feynman
propagator for scalar fields, which is a direct generalization of Bunch and
Parker's works to curved spacetime with torsion. We further derive the
proper-time representation in $n$ dimensional Riemann-Cartan spacetime from the
momentum-space representation. It leads us to obtain the renormalization of
one-loop effective Lagrangians of free scalar fields by using dimensional
regularization. When torsion tensor vanishes, our resulting momentum-space
representation returns to the standard Riemannian results.
