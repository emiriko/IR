The paper is a survey of recent results in geometric representation theory
describing group actions which induce multiplicity-free representations in the
spaces of holomorphic functions. For connected compact Lie groups of
automorphisms of Stein manifolds we characterize such actions in terms of
antiholomorphic involutions. Some proofs are given and some results are new.
For example, spherical complex spaces are defined for arbitrary real forms of
complex reductive groups. Their properties, which we prove here, were known
only for compact real forms. We also show that a complex compact homogeneous
manifold of a complex reductive group is spherical if and only if the fiber of
its Tits fibration is a complex torus.
