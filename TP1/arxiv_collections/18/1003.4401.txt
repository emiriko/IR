We investigate the behavior of bipartite as well as genuine multipartite
entanglement of a resonating valence bond state on a ladder. We show that the
system possesses significant amounts of bipartite entanglement in the steps of
the ladder while no substantial bipartite entanglement is present in the rails.
Genuine multipartite entanglement present in the system is negligible. The
results are in stark contrast with the entanglement properties of the same
state on isotropic lattices in two and higher dimensions, indicating that the
geometry of the lattice can have important implications on the quality of
quantum information and other tasks that can be performed by using multiparty
states on that lattice.
