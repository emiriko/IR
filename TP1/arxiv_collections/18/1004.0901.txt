We present an updated catalog of 113 X-ray flares detected by Swift in the
~33% of the X-ray afterglows of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRB). 43 flares have a
measured redshift. For the first time the analysis is performed in 4 different
X-ray energy bands, allowing us to constrain the evolution of the flare
temporal properties with energy. We find that flares are narrower at higher
energies: their width follows a power-law relation w~E^{-0.5} reminiscent of
the prompt emission. Flares are asymmetric structures, with a decay time which
is twice the rise time on average. Both time scales linearly evolve with time,
giving rise to a constant rise-to-decay ratio: this implies that both time
scales are stretched by the same factor. As a consequence, the flare width
linearly evolves with time to larger values: this is a key point that clearly
distinguishes the flare from the GRB prompt emission. The flare 0.3-10 keV peak
luminosity decreases with time, following a power-law behaviour with large
scatter: L_{pk}~ t_{pk}^{-2.7}. When multiple flares are present, a global
softening trend is established: each flare is on average softer than the
previous one. The 0.3-10 keV isotropic energy distribution is a log-normal
peaked at 10^{51} erg, with a possible excess at low energies. The flare
average spectral energy distribution (SED) is found to be a power-law with
spectral energy index beta~1.1. These results confirmed that the flares are
tightly linked to the prompt emission. However, after considering various
models we conclude that no model is currently able to account for the entire
set of observations.
