We consider the capture of galactic dark matter by the Solar System, due to
the gravitational three-body interaction of the Sun, a planet, and a dark
matter particle. Simple estimates are presented for the capture cross-section,
as well as for density and velocity distribution of captured dark matter
particles close to the Earth.
