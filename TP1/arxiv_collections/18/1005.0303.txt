We study the reduced fidelity and reduced fidelity susceptibility in the
Kitaev honeycomb model. It is shown that the reduced fidelity susceptibility of
two nearest site manifest itself a peak at the quantum phase transition point,
although the one-site reduced fidelity susceptibility vanishes. Our results
directly reveal that the reduced fidelity susceptibility can be used to
characterize the quantum phase transition in the Kitaev honeycomb model, and
thus suggest that the reduced fidelity susceptibility is an accurate marker of
the topological phase transition when it is properly chosen, despite of its
local nature.
