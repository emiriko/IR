We study the low-momentum ghost propagator Dyson-Schwinger equation (DSE) in
Landau gauge, assuming for the truncation a constant ghost-gluon vertex, as it
is extensively done, and a simple model for a massive gluon propagator. Then,
regular DSE solutions (the zero-momentum ghost dressing function not diverging)
appear to emerge and we show the ghost propagator to be described by an
asymptotic expression reliable up to the order ${\cal O}(q^2)$. That
expression, depending on the gluon mass and the zero-momentum Taylor-scheme
effective charge, is proven to fit pretty well the low-momentum ghost
propagator obtained through big-volume lattice simulations.
