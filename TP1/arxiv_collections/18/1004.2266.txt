We revisit the issue of relaxation to thermal equilibrium in the so-called
"sheet model", i.e., particles in one dimension interacting by attractive
forces independent of their separation. We show that this relaxation may be
very clearly detected and characterized by following the evolution of order
parameters defined by appropriately normalized moments of the phase space
distribution which probe its entanglement in space and velocity coordinates.
For a class of quasi-stationary states which result from the violent relaxation
of rectangular waterbag initial conditions, characterized by their virial ratio
R_0, we show that relaxation occurs on a time scale which (i) scales
approximately linearly in the particle number N, and (ii) shows also a strong
dependence on R_0, with quasi-stationary states from colder initial conditions
relaxing much more rapidly. The temporal evolution of the order parameter may
be well described by a stretched exponential function. We study finally the
correlation of the relaxation times with the amplitude of fluctuations in the
relaxing quasi-stationary states, as well as the relation between temporal and
ensemble averages.
