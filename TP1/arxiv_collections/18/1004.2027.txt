In this paper, we propose a novel policy iteration method, called dynamic
policy programming (DPP), to estimate the optimal policy in the
infinite-horizon Markov decision processes. We prove the finite-iteration and
asymptotic l\infty-norm performance-loss bounds for DPP in the presence of
approximation/estimation error. The bounds are expressed in terms of the
l\infty-norm of the average accumulated error as opposed to the l\infty-norm of
the error in the case of the standard approximate value iteration (AVI) and the
approximate policy iteration (API). This suggests that DPP can achieve a better
performance than AVI and API since it averages out the simulation noise caused
by Monte-Carlo sampling throughout the learning process. We examine this
theoretical results numerically by com- paring the performance of the
approximate variants of DPP with existing reinforcement learning (RL) methods
on different problem domains. Our results show that, in all cases, DPP-based
algorithms outperform other RL methods by a wide margin.
