We report on lasing at room temperature and at telecommunications wavelength
from photonic crystal nanocavities based on InAsP/InP quantum dots. Such laser
cavities with a small modal volume and high quality factor display a high
spontaneous emission coupling factor beta. Lasing is confirmed by measuring the
second order autocorrelation function. A smooth transition from chaotic to
coherent emission is observed, and coherent emission is obtained at 8 times the
threshold power.
