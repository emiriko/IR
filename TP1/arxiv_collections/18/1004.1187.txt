We establish a geometric lower bound for the principal curvature of the level
surfaces of solutions to $F(D^2u, Du, u, x)=0$ in convex ring domains, under a
refined structural condition introduced by Bianchini-Longinetti-Salani in
\cite{BLS}. We also prove a constant rank theorem for the second fundamental
form of the convex level surfaces of these solutions.
