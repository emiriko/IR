The distribution of the gluon action density in mesonic systems is
investigated at finite temperature. The simulations are performed in quenched
QCD for two temperatures below the deconfinment phase. Unlike the gluonic
profiles displayed at T=0, the action density iso-surfaces display a
prolate-spheroid like shape. The curved width profile of the flux-tube is found
to be consistent with the prediction of the free Bosonic string model at large
distances.
