Low-lying spectra and several high-spin states of odd--even $^{61,63,65}$Co
isotopes are calculated in two different shell-model spaces. First set of
calculations have been carried out in ${fp}$ shell valence space (full $fp$
space for $^{63,65}$Co and a truncated one for $^{61}$Co) using two recently
derived ${fp}$ shell interactions, namely GXPF1A and KB3G, with $^{40}$Ca as
core. Similarly, the second set of calculations have been performed in
${fpg_{9/2}}$ valence space using an ${fpg}$ effective interaction due to
Sorlin {\it et al}., with $^{48}$Ca as core and imposing a truncation. It is
seen that the results of GXPF1A and KB3G are reasonable for $^{61,63}$Co. For
$^{65}$Co, shell-model results show that the ${fpg}$ interaction adopted in the
study is inadequate and also point out that it is necessary to include orbitals
higher than $1g_{9/2}$ for neutron-rich Co isotopes.
