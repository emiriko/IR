Entropic aging consists in a progressive slowing down of the low-temperature
dynamics of a glassy system due to the rarefaction of downwards directions on
the energy landscape, as lower and lower energy levels are reached. A
prototypical model exhibiting this scenario is the Barrat-M\'ezard model. We
argue that in the zero-temperature limit, this model precisely corresponds to a
dynamical realization of extreme value statistics, providing an interesting
connection between the two fields. This mapping directly yields the long-time
asymptotic shape of the dynamical energy distribution, which is then one of the
standard extreme value distributions (Gumbel, Weibull or Fr\'echet), thus
restricting the class of asymptotic energy distributions with respect to the
original preasymptotic results. We also briefly discuss similarities and
differences between the Barrat-M\'ezard model and undriven dissipative systems
like granular gases.
