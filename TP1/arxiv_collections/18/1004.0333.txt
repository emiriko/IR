Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) has been widely used in the graphene oxide
(GO) structure study. However, the detailed relationship between its
spectroscopic features and the GO structural configuration has remained
elusive. Based on first principles $^{13}$C chemical shift calculations using
the gauge including projector augmented waves (GIPAW) method, we provide a
spectrum-structure connection. Chemical shift of carbon is found to be very
sensitive to atomic environment, even with an identical oxidation group.
Factors determining the chemical shifts for epoxy and hydroxy groups have been
discussed. GO structures previously reported in the literature have been
checked from the NMR point of view. The energetically favorable hydroxy chain
structure is not expected to be widely existed in real GO samples according to
our NMR simulations. The epoxy pair we proposed previously is also supported by
chemical shift calculations.
