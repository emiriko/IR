In this letter, we show that the electroweak symmetry is restored at high
temperature for Little Higgs (LH), when including dominant higher order thermal
corrections, that are consequence of the non-linear nature of the scalar
sector. This leads us to suggest that the LH requires a UV completion above the
scale $\Lambda\lesssim f$.
