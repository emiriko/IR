We address both theoretically and experimentally the generation of pulsed
non-Gaussian states from classical Gaussian ones by means of conditional
measurements. The setup relies on a beam splitter and a pair of linear
photodetectors able to resolve up to tens of photons in the two outputs. We
show the reliability of the setup and the good agreement with the theory for a
single-mode thermal field entering the beam splitter and present a thorough
characterization of the photon statistics of the conditional states.
