A new approach for signature region of interest pre-processing was presented.
It used new auto cropping preparation on the basis of the image content, where
the intensity value of pixel is the source of cropping. This approach provides
both the possibility of improving the performance of security systems based on
signature images, and also the ability to use only the region of interest of
the used image to suit layout design of biometric systems. Underlying the
approach is a novel segmentation method which identifies the exact region of
foreground of signature for feature extraction usage. Evaluation results of
this approach shows encouraging prospects by eliminating the need for false
region isolating, reduces the time cost associated with signature false points
detection, and addresses enhancement issues. A further contribution of this
paper is an automated cropping stage in bio-secure based systems.
