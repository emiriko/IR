Neutrino masses arise via a seesaw mechanism and its mass hierarchy, with
assumption that heavy Majorana neutrino mass matrix subject to $\mu-\tau$
symmetry and invariant under a cyclic permutation, are evaluated. Within this
scenario, the neutrino masses:
$\left|m_{1}\right|=\left|m_{2}\right|<\left|m_{3}\right|$ are obtained, which
are incompatible with the experimental data. By modifying neutrino mass matrix
with the zero sum rule condition, the neutrino masses in inverted hierarchy:
$\left|m_{3}\right|<\left|m_{1}\right|<\left|m_{2}\right|$ are obtained.
