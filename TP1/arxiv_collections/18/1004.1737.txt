We remark on the claim that the string-net model of Levin and Wen is a
microscopic Hamiltonian formulation of the Turaev-Viro topological quantum
field theory. Using simple counterexamples we indicate where interesting extra
structure may be needed in the Levin-Wen model for this to hold (however we
believe that some form of the correspondence is true). In order to be
accessible to the condensed matter community we provide a brief and gentle
introduction to the relevant concepts in category theory (relying heavily on
analogy with ordinary group representation theory). Likewise, some physical
ideas are briefly surveyed for the benefit of the more mathematical reader. The
main feature of group categories under consideration is Turaev's unimodality.
We pinpoint where unimodality should fit into the Levin-Wen construction, and
show that the simplest example fails to be unimodal. Unimodality is
straightforward to compute for group categories, and we provide a complete
classification at the end of the paper.
