Using cosmological MHD simulations of the magnetic field in galaxy clusters
and filaments we evaluate the possibility to infer the magnetic field strength
in filaments by measuring cross-correlation functions between Faraday Rotation
Measures (RM) and the galaxy density field. We also test the reliability of
recent estimates considering the problem of data quality and Galactic
foreground (GF) removal in current datasets. Besides the two self-consistent
simulations of cosmological magnetic fields based on primordial seed fields and
galactic outflows analyzed here, we also explore a larger range of models
scaling up the resulting magnetic fields of one of the simulations. We find
that, if an unnormalized estimator for the cross-correlation functions and a GF
removal procedure is used, the detectability of the cosmological signal is only
possible for future instruments (e.g. SKA and ASKAP). However, mapping of the
observed RM signal to the underlying magnetization of the Universe (both in
space and time) is an extremely challenging task which is limited by the
ambiguities of our model parameters, as well as to the weak response of the RM
signal in low density environments. Therefore, we conclude that current data
cannot constrain the amplitude and distribution of magnetic fields within the
large scale structure and a detailed theoretical understanding of the build up
and distribution of magnetic fields within the Universe will be needed for the
interpretation of future observations.
