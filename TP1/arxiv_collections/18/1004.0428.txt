In this work, we present a performance analysis of Field Effect Transistors
based on recently fabricated 100% hydrogenated graphene (the so-called
graphane) and theoretically predicted semi-hydrogenated graphene (i.e.
graphone). The approach is based on accurate calculations of the energy bands
by means of GW approximation, subsequently fitted with a three-nearest neighbor
(3NN) sp3 tight-binding Hamiltonian, and finally used to compute ballistic
transport in transistors based on functionalized graphene. Due to the large
energy gap, the proposed devices have many of the advantages provided by
one-dimensional graphene nanoribbon FETs, such as large Ion and Ion/Ioff
ratios, reduced band-to-band tunneling, without the corresponding disadvantages
in terms of prohibitive lithography and patterning requirements for circuit
integration.
