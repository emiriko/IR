We study for random quantum spin systems the energy gap between the ground
and first excited states to clarify a relation to the spin-glass-paramagnetic
phase transition. We find that for the transverse Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model
the vanishing of the averaged gap does not identify the transition. A power-law
form of the gap distribution function leads to power-law distributions of the
linear, spin-glass, and nonlinear susceptibilities. They diverge at different
points, which we attribute to a quantum Griffiths mechanism. On the other hand,
the classical treatment is justified for the transverse random energy model and
the phase transition can be found by a sudden change of the ground state.
