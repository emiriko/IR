Cygnus X-3 is a unique microquasar. Its X-ray emission shows a very strong
4.8-hour orbital modulation. But its mass-donating companion is a Wolf-Rayet
star. Also unlike most other X-ray binaries Cygnus X-3 is relatively bright in
the radio virtually all of the time (the exceptions being the quenched states).
Cygnus X-3 also undergoes giant radio outbursts (up to 20 Jy). In this
presentation we discuss and review the flaring behavior of Cygnus X-3 and its
various radio/X-ray states. We present a revised set of radio/X-ray states
based on Cygnus X-3's hardness-intensity diagram (HID). We also examine the
connection of a certain type of activity to the reported AGILE/Fermi gamma-ray
detections of Cygnus X-3.
