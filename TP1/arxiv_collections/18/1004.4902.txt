Motivated by dark-matter considerations in supersymmetric theories, we
investigate in a fairly model-independent way the detection at the LHC of
nearly degenerate gauginos with mass differences between a few GeV and about 30
GeV. Due to the degeneracy of gaugino states, the conventional leptonic signals
are likely lost. We first consider the leading signal from gluino production
and decay. We find that it is quite conceivable to reach a large statistical
significance for the multi-jet plus missing energy signal with an integrated
luminosity about 50 pb^-1 (50 fb^-1) for a gluino mass of 500 GeV (1 TeV). If
gluinos are not too heavy, less than about 1.5 TeV, this channel can typically
probe gaugino masses up to about 100 GeV below the gluino mass. We then study
the Drell-Yan type of gaugino pair production in association with a hard QCD
jet, for gaugino masses in the range of 100-150 GeV. The signal observation may
be statistically feasible with about 10 fb^-1, but systematically challenging
due to the lack of distinctive features for the signal distributions. By
exploiting gaugino pair production through weak boson fusion, signals of large
missing energy plus two forward-backward jets may be observable at a 4-6\sigma
level above the large SM backgrounds with an integrated luminosity of 100-300
fb^-1. Finally, we point out that searching for additional isolated soft muons
in the range p_T ~3-10 GeV in the data samples discussed above may help to
enrich the signal and to control the systematics. Significant efforts are made
to explore the connection between the signal kinematics and the relevant masses
for the gluino and gauginos, to probe the mass scales of the superpartners, in
particular the LSP dark matter.
