A subsemigroup $S$ of an inverse semigroup $Q$ is a left I-order in $Q$, if
every element in $Q$ can be written as $a^{-1}b$ where $a, b \in S$ and
$a^{-1}$ is the inverse of $a$ in the sense of inverse semigroup theory. We
study a characterisation of semigroups which have a primitive inverse semigroup
of left I-quotients.
