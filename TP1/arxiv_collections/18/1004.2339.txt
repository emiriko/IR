We use the coupled cluster method (CCM) to study the zero-temperature phase
diagram of a 2D frustrated spin-half antiferromagnet, the so-called Union Jack
model. It is defined on a square lattice such that all nearest-neighbor bonds
are present with a strength $J_{1} > 0$, but only half the
next-nearest-neighbor bonds are present with a strength $J_{2} \equiv \kappa
J_{1} > 0$. The bonds are arranged such that on the $2 \times 2$ unit cell they
form the pattern of the Union Jack flag. We find strong evidence for a first
phase transition between a N\'{e}el phase and a canted ferrimagnetic phase at a
critical coupling $\kappa_{c_{1}} = 0.66 \pm 0.02$. At the transition the
energy and its first derivative seem continuous, thus providing a typical
scenario of a second-order transition, although a weakly first-order transition
cannot be excluded. By contrast, the average on-site magnetization $M$
approaches a nonzero value $M_{c_{1}}=0.195 \pm 0.005$ on both sides of the
transition, which is more typical of a first-order transition. The slope
$dM/d\kappa$ also appears to be continuous, or very nearly so, at the critical
point $\kappa_{c_{1}}$. We find strong evidence that the canted phase becomes
unstable at large values of $\kappa$, and hence we have also used the CCM with
a model collinear semi-stripe-ordered ferrimagnetic state in which alternating
rows (and columns) are ferromagnetically and antiferromagnetically ordered. We
find tentative evidence, based on the relative energies of the two states, for
a second (first-order) phase transition between the canted and
semi-stripe-ordered states at a large value of the coupling parameter around
$\kappa_{c_{2}} \approx 125 \pm 5$. This prediction, however, is based on an
extrapolation of the CCM results for the canted state into regimes where the
CCM equations at any level of approximation beyond the lowest have no
solutions.
