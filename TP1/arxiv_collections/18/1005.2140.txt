The Vicsek model for the self-propelled particles is investigated with the
respect to the introduction of the stochastic perturbation of the dynamics. It
is shown that such a dependence can be thought in terms of the isomorphism of
the Vicsek model with the Kuramoto model of spontaneous synchronization. They
are isomorphic at least within the mean-field approach. The isomorphism between
two models allows to state the dependence of the type of the transition in
Vicsek model on the noise perturbation. Two types of noise the scalar and the
vector ones lead to qualitatively different behavior with continuous and the
discontinuous transition to ordered state correspondingly. New type of the
stochastic perturbation - ``mixed`` noise is proposed. It is the weighted
superposition of the scalar and vector noises. The corresponding phase diagram
``noise amplitude vs. interaction strength`` is obtained and the tricritical
behavior for Vicsek model is demonstrated.
