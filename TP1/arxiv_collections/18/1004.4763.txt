We compute the Betti numbers of the geometric spaces associated to
nonrational simple convex polytopes and find that they depend on the
combinatorial type of the polytope exactly as in the rational case. This shows
that the combinatorial features of the starting polytope are encoded in these
generalized toric spaces as they are in their rational counterparts.
