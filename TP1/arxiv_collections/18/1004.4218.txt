The observed hierarchy of fermion masses and mixings may be generated by
renormalization group flow if the Standard Model is coupled to a near-conformal
sector at high energies. If the conformal sector is supersymmetric, these
effects are rendered calculable by a combination of superconformal symmetry and
a-maximization. The viability of such models depends on whether they generate
the observed fermion mass hierarchy before the Standard Model gauge couplings
hit a Landau pole. Here we construct a variety of simple vector-like models of
superconformal flavor, including both ten-centered and democratic variations.
We discuss in detail the subtleties of applying the a-maximization procedure to
determine anomalous dimensions of Standard Model fields. We find that a wide
range of models based on SU(N) or Sp(2N) SQCD with fundamental and adjoint
matter are viable theories of superconformal flavor.
