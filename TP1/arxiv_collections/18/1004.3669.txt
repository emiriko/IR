We have demonstrated the effect of hydrostatic pressure on magnetic and
transport properties, and thermal transport properties in electron-doped
manganites CaMn$_{1-x}$Sb$_{x}$O$_{3}$. The substitution of Sb$^{5+}$ ion for
Mn $^{4+}$site of the parent matrix causes one-electron doping with the
chemical formula CaMn$^{4+}_{1-2x}$Mn$^{3+}_{x}$Sb$^{5+}_{x}$O$_{3}$
accompanied by a monotonous increase in unit cell volume as a function of $x$.
Upon increasing the doping level of Sb, the magnitudes of both electrical
resistivity and negative Seebeck coefficient are suppressed at high
temperatures, indicating the electron doping. Anomalous diamagnetic behaviors
at $x=0.05$ and 0.08 are clearly observed in field cooled dc magnetization. The
effect of hydrostatic pressure on dc magnetization is in contrast to the
chemical pressure effect due to Sb doping. The dynamical effect of ac magnetic
susceptibility measurement points to the formation of the magnetically
frustrated clusters such as FM clusters embedded in canted AFM matrix.
