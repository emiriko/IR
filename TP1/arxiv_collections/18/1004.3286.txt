We used spectral observations of Fe I line profiles with a 200 000 resolution
to determine micro and macroturbulent velocities in the atmospheres of the Sun
as a star, {\alpha} Cen A, Procyon ({\alpha} CMi), Arcturus ({\alpha} Boo), and
Canopus ({\alpha} Car). Isotropic microturturbulent velocities (V_mi) and
radial-tangential macroturbulent velocities (V_ma,RT) were found to be a quite
suitable approximation to the velocity field in the atmospheres of all stars
studied except Canopus. The average velocities V_mi and V_ma,RT are 0.8 +/- 0.1
and 2.6 +/- 0.3 km/s for the Sun as a star, 0.8 +/- 0.2 and 2.9 +/- 0.4 km/s
for {\alpha} Cen A, 0.8 +/- 0.3 and 5.9 +/- 0.2 km/s for Procyon, 1.0 +/- 0.2
and 4.6 +/- 0.3 km/s for Arcturus. The velocity field in the atmosphere of
Canopus can be described by an anisotropic radial-tangential distribution of
microturbulence with V_mi,RT = 2.1 km/s and anisotropic distribution of
macroturbulence with V_ma,rad = 17 +/- 2 km/s and V_ma,tan = 1.3 +/- 1.0 km/s.
From Fourier analysis of broadening and shapes of three spectral lines of Fe I,
we have derived the rotation velocity V_e sini = 3.5 +/- 0.2 km/s for Canopus.
