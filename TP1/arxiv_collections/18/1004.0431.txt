A zone of reactions is determined and then exploited as a tool in studying
the space-time structure of an interacting system formed in a collision of
relativistic nuclei. The time dependence of the reaction rates integrated over
spatial coordinates is also considered. Evaluations are made with the help of
the microscopic transport model UrQMD. The relation of the boundaries of
different zones of reactions and the hypersurfaces of sharp chemical and
kinetic freeze-outs is discussed.
