We present a method that offers perspectives to perform fully antisymmetrized
simulations for inhomogeneous bulk fermion matter. The technique bears
resemblance to classical periodic boundary conditions, using localized
single-particle states. Such localized states are an ideal tool to discuss
phenomena where spatial localization plays an important role. The
antisymmetrisation is obtained introducing a doubly-periodic structure in the
many-body fermion wave functions. This results in circulant matrices for the
evaluation of expectation values, leading to a computationally tractable
formalism to study fully antisymmetrized bulk fermion matter. We show that the
proposed technique is able to reproduce essential fermion features in an
elegant and computationally advantageous manner.
