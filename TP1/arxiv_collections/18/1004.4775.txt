It is explained why and how the fireball created in ultrarelativistic nuclear
collisions can fragment when passing the phase transition. It can happen at the
first-order phase transition but is not excluded even at high collision
energies where the smooth crossover is present. Two potential observables
sensitive to the appearance of fragmentation are reviewed: event-by-event
changes of rapidity distributions and proton correlation in relative rapidity.
