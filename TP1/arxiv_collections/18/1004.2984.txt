We study the asymptotic behavior of type A vacuum Bianchi spacetimes. It has
been conjectured that this behavior is driven by a certain circle map, called
the Kasner map. As a step towards this conjecture, we prove that some orbits of
the Kasner map do indeed attract some solutions of the system of ODEs which
describes the behavior of type A vacuum Bianchi spacetimes. The orbits of the
Kasner map for which we can prove such a result are those which are not
periodic and which do not accumulate on any periodic orbit. This shows the
existence of Bianchi spacetimes with a aperiodic oscillatory asymptotic
behavior.
