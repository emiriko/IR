The Low Latency Fault Tolerance (LLFT) system provides fault tolerance for
distributed applications, using the leader-follower replication technique. The
LLFT system provides application-transparent replication, with strong replica
consistency, for applications that involve multiple interacting processes or
threads. The LLFT system comprises a Low Latency Messaging Protocol, a
Leader-Determined Membership Protocol, and a Virtual Determinizer Framework.
The Low Latency Messaging Protocol provides reliable, totally ordered message
delivery by employing a direct group-to-group multicast, where the message
ordering is determined by the primary replica in the group. The
Leader-Determined Membership Protocol provides reconfiguration and recovery
when a replica becomes faulty and when a replica joins or leaves a group, where
the membership of the group is determined by the primary replica. The Virtual
Determinizer Framework captures the ordering information at the primary replica
and enforces the same ordering at the backup replicas for major sources of
non-determinism, including multi-threading, time-related operations and socket
communication. The LLFT system achieves low latency message delivery during
normal operation and low latency reconfiguration and recovery when a fault
occurs.
