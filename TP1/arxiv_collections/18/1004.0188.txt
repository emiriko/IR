Several inequalities are proved for the mixing time of discrete-time quantum
walks on finite graphs. The mixing time is defined differently than in
Aharonov, Ambainis, Kempe and Vazirani (2001) and it is found that for
particular examples of walks on a cycle, a hypercube and a complete graph,
quantum walks provide no speed-up in mixing over the classical counterparts. In
addition, non-unitary quantum walks (i.e., walks with decoherence) are
considered and a criterion for their convergence to the unique stationary
distribution is derived.
