The driven-damped Jaynes-Cummings model in the regime of strong coupling is
found to exhibit a coexistence between the quantum photon blockaded state and a
quasi-coherent bright state. We characterize the slow time scales and the basin
of attraction of these metastable states using full quantum simulations. This
form of bistability can be useful for implementing a qubit readout scheme that
does not require additional circuit elements. We propose a coherent control
sequence that makes use of a simple linear chirp of drive amplitude and
frequency as well as qubit frequency. By optimizing the parameters of the
system and the control pulse we demonstrate theoretically very high readout
fidelities (>98%) and high contrast, with experimentally realistic parameters
for qubits implemented in the circuit QED architecture.
