X-ray devices are far superior to optical ones for providing nanometre
spatial and attosecond temporal resolutions. Such resolution is indispensable
in biology, medicine, physics, material sciences, and their applications. A
bright ultrafast coherent X-ray source is highly desirable, for example, for
the diffractive imaging of individual large molecules, viruses, or cells. Here
we demonstrate experimentally a new compact X-ray source involving high-order
harmonics produced by a relativistic-irradiance femtosecond laser in a gas
target. In our first implementation using a 9 Terawatt laser, coherent soft
X-rays are emitted with a comb-like spectrum reaching the 'water window' range.
The generation mechanism is robust being based on phenomena inherent in
relativistic laser plasmas: self-focusing, nonlinear wave generation
accompanied by electron density singularities, and collective radiation by a
compact electric charge. The formation of singularities (electron density
spikes) is described by the elegant mathematical catastrophe theory, which
explains sudden changes in various complex systems, from physics to social
sciences. The new X-ray source has advantageous scalings, as the maximum
harmonic order is proportional to the cube of the laser amplitude enhanced by
relativistic self-focusing in plasma. This allows straightforward extension of
the coherent X-ray generation to the keV and tens of keV spectral regions. The
implemented X-ray source is remarkably easily accessible: the requirements for
the laser can be met in a university-scale laboratory, the gas jet is a
replenishable debris-free target, and the harmonics emanate directly from the
gas jet without additional devices. Our results open the way to a compact
coherent ultrashort brilliant X-ray source with single shot and high-repetition
rate capabilities, suitable for numerous applications and diagnostics in many
research fields.
