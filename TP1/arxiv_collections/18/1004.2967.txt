We present a core-collapse supernova model for the extremely luminous Type Ic
supernova 2007bi. By performing numerical calculations of hydrodynamics,
nucleosynthesis, and radiation transport, we find that SN 2007bi is consistent
with the core-collapse supernova explosion of a 43 Msun carbon and oxygen core
obtained from the evolution of a progenitor star with a main sequence mass of
100 Msun and metallicity of Z = Zsun/200, from which its hydrogen and helium
envelopes are artificially stripped. The ejecta mass and the ejecta kinetic
energy of the models are 40 Msun and 3.6*10^{52} erg. The ejected 56Ni mass is
as large as 6.1 Msun, which results from the explosive nucleosynthesis with
large explosion energy. We also confirm that SN 2007bi is consistent with a
pair-instability supernova model as has recently been claimed. We show that the
earlier light curve data can discriminate between the models for such luminous
supernovae.
