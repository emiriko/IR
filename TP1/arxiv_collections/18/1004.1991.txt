To determine the physical parameters of a transiting planet and its host star
from photometric and spectroscopic analysis, it is essential to independently
measure the stellar mass. This is often achieved by the use of evolutionary
tracks and isochrones, but the mass result is only as reliable as the models
used. The recent paper by Torres et al (2009) showed that accurate values for
stellar masses and radii could be obtained from a calibration using T_eff, log
g and [Fe/H]. We investigate whether a similarly good calibration can be
obtained by substituting log rho - the fundamental parameter measured for the
host star of a transiting planet - for log g, and apply this to star-exoplanet
systems. We perform a polynomial fit to stellar binary data provided in Torres
et al (2009) to obtain the stellar mass and radius as functions of T_eff, log
rho and [Fe/H], with uncertainties on the fit produced from a Monte Carlo
analysis. We apply the resulting equations to measurements for seventeen
SuperWASP host stars, and also demonstrate the application of the calibration
in a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis to obtain accurate system parameters
where spectroscopic estimates of effective stellar temperature and metallicity
are available. We show that the calibration using log rho produces accurate
values for the stellar masses and radii; we obtain masses and radii of the
SuperWASP stars in good agreement with isochrone analysis results. We ascertain
that the mass calibration is robust against uncertainties resulting from poor
photometry, although a good estimate of stellar radius requires good-quality
transit light curve to determine the duration of ingress and egress.
