We discuss the formation of supermassive black holes in the early universe,
and how to probe their subsequent evolution with the upcoming mm/sub-mm
telescope ALMA. We first focus on the chemical and radiative conditions for
black hole formation, in particular considering radiation trapping and
molecular dissociation effects. We then turn our attention towards the magnetic
properties in the halos where the first black holes form, and show that the
presence of turbulence may lead to a magnetic dynamo, which could support the
black hole formation process by providing an efficient means of transporting
the angular momentum. We finally focus on observable properties of
high-redshift black holes with respect to ALMA, and discuss how to distinguish
between chemistry driven by the starburst and chemistry driven by X-rays from
the black hole.
