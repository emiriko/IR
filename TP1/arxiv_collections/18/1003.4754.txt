We study theoretically proximity-induced superconductivity and ferromagnetism
on the surface of a topological insulator. In particular, we investigate how
the Andreev-bound states are influenced by the interplay between these
phenomena, taking also into account the possibility of unconventional pairing.
We find a qualitative difference in the excitation spectrum when comparing
spin-singlet and spin-triplet pairing, leading to non-gapped excitations in the
latter case. The formation of surface-states and their dependence on the
magnetization orientation is investigated, and it is found that these states
are Majorana fermions in the $d_{xy}$-wave case in stark contrast to the
topologically trivial high-$T_c$ cuprates. The signature of such states in the
conductance spectra is studied, and we also compute the supercurrent which
flows on the surface of the topological insulator when a Josephson junction is
deposited on top of it. It is found that the current exhibits an anomalous
current-phase relation when the region separating the superconducting banks is
ferromagnetic, and we also show that in contrast to the metallic case the
exchange field in such a scenario does not induce 0-$\pi$ oscillations in the
critical current. Similarly to the high-$T_c$ cuprates, the presence of
zero-energy surface states on the topological surface leads to a strong
low-temperature enhancement of the critical current.
