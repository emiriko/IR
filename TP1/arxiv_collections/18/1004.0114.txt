We search for signals of Weak Annihilation in inclusive semileptonic D
decays. We consider both the widths and the lepton energy moments, which are
quite sensitive probes. Our analysis of Cleo data shows no clear evidence of
Weak Annihilation, and allows us to put bounds on their relevance in charmless
B semileptonic decays.
