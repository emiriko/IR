We introduce a first principles approach to determine the strength of the
electronic correlations based on the fully self consistent GW approximation.
The approach provides a seamless interface with dynamical mean field theory,
and gives good results for well studied correlated materials such as NiO.
Applied to the recently discovered iron arsenide materials, it accounts for the
noticeable correlation features observed in optics and photoemission while
explaining the absence of visible satellites in X-ray absorption experiments
and other high energy spectroscopies.
