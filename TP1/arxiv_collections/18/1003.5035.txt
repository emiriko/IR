The objective of this investigation was to first examine the kinematics of
coronal mass ejections (CMEs) using EUV and coronagraph images, and then to
make a comparison with theoretical models in the hope to identify the driving
mechanisms of the CMEs. We have studied two CMEs which occurred on 2006 Dec. 17
(CME06) and 2007 Dec. 31 (CME07). The models studied in this work were
catastrophe, breakout, and toroidal instability models. We found that after the
eruption, the accelerations of both events exhibited a drop before increasing
again. Our comparisons with the theories suggested that CME06 can be best
described by a hybrid of the catastrophe and breakout models while CME07 is
most consistent with the breakout model.
