The dressed heavy quark mass \hat{m}_Q=m_Q+\bar{{\Lambda}} with
\bar{{\Lambda}} being the binding energy is introduced to characterize the
heavy hadrons containing a single heavy quark. A heavy quark expansion in terms
of the inverse of the dressed heavy quark mass 1/\hat{m}_Q is presented with a
complete decomposition of the full field and integrating out the small
components. The heavy quark-antiquark coupling effects are included in the
finite mass corrections. It is shown that the 1/\hat{m}_Q expansion is more
favorable in application. The extraction of |V_{cb}| from exclusive B decays is
studied by using such a new expansion approach.
