Given data drawn from a mixture of multivariate Gaussians, a basic problem is
to accurately estimate the mixture parameters. We give an algorithm for this
problem that has a running time, and data requirement polynomial in the
dimension and the inverse of the desired accuracy, with provably minimal
assumptions on the Gaussians. As simple consequences of our learning algorithm,
we can perform near-optimal clustering of the sample points and density
estimation for mixtures of k Gaussians, efficiently. The building blocks of our
algorithm are based on the work Kalai et al. [STOC 2010] that gives an
efficient algorithm for learning mixtures of two Gaussians by considering a
series of projections down to one dimension, and applying the method of moments
to each univariate projection. A major technical hurdle in Kalai et al. is
showing that one can efficiently learn univariate mixtures of two Gaussians. In
contrast, because pathological scenarios can arise when considering univariate
projections of mixtures of more than two Gaussians, the bulk of the work in
this paper concerns how to leverage an algorithm for learning univariate
mixtures (of many Gaussians) to yield an efficient algorithm for learning in
high dimensions. Our algorithm employs hierarchical clustering and rescaling,
together with delicate methods for backtracking and recovering from failures
that can occur in our univariate algorithm. Finally, while the running time and
data requirements of our algorithm depend exponentially on the number of
Gaussians in the mixture, we prove that such a dependence is necessary.
