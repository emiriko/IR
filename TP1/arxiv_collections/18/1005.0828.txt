We study the nature of the phase transition in the fully frustrated simple
cubic lattice with the XY spin model. This system is the Villain's model
generalized in three dimensions. The ground state is very particular with a
12-fold degeneracy. Previous studies have shown unusual critical properties.
With the powerful Wang-Landau flat-histogram Monte Carlo method, we carry out
in this work intensive simulations with very large lattice sizes. We show that
the phase transition is clearly of first order, putting an end to the
uncertainty which has lasted for more than twenty years.
