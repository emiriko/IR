This article provides a brief overview of some fundamental effects of quantum
fields under extreme conditions. For the Schwinger mechanism, Hawking
radiation, and the Unruh effect, analogies to quantum optics are discussed,
which might help to approach to these phenomena from an experimental point of
view.
