Few-photon induced breakup of helium is studied using a newly developed ab
initio numerical framework for solving the six-dimensional time-dependent
Schroedinger equation. We present details of the method and calculate
(generalized) cross sections for the process of two-photon nonsequential
(direct) double ionization at photon energies ranging from 39.4 to 54.4 eV, a
process that has been very much debated in recent years and is not yet fully
understood. In particular, we have studied the convergence property of the
total cross section in the vicinity of the upper threshold (54.4 eV), versus
the pulse duration of the applied laser field. We find that the cross section
exhibits an increasing trend near the threshold, as has also been observed by
others, and show that this rise cannot solely be attributed to an unintended
inclusion of the sequential two-photon double ionization process, caused by the
bandwidth of the applied field.
