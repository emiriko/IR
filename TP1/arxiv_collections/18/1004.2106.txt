The validity of an approximation formula for European option prices under a
general stochastic volatility model is proved in the light of the Edgeworth
expansion for ergodic diffusions. The asymptotic expansion is around the
Black-Scholes price and is uniform in bounded payoff func- tions. The result
provides a validation of an existing singular perturbation expansion formula
for the fast mean reverting stochastic volatility model.
