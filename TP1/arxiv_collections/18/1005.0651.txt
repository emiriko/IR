Using perturbation theory the first order dispersive correction to the
Casimir energy between two plates separated by a dielectric material is
calculated. It falls off with the plate separation as 1/L^6. The result is
derived both from evaluation of the zero-point energy and within the Lifshitz
formulation. It is pointed out that a possible surface term can be more
important, varying like 1/L^5.
