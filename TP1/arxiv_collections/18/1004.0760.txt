We present the numerical implementation of a clean solution to the outer
boundary and radiation extraction problems within the 3+1 formalism for
hyperbolic partial differential equations on a given background. Our approach
is based on compactification at null infinity in hyperboloidal scri fixing
coordinates. We report numerical tests for the particular example of a scalar
wave equation on Minkowski and Schwarzschild backgrounds. We address issues
related to the implementation of the hyperboloidal approach for the Einstein
equations, such as nonlinear source functions, matching, and evaluation of
formally singular terms at null infinity.
