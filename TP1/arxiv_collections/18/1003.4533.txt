We present a next-to-leading order QCD calculation of the cross section and
longitudinal spin asymmetry in single-inclusive charged-lepton production, pp
-> l X, at RHIC, where the lepton is produced in the decay of an electroweak
gauge boson. Our calculation is presented in terms of a multi-purpose
Monte-Carlo integration program that may be readily used to include
experimental spin asymmetry data in a global analysis of helicity parton
densities. We perform a toy global analysis, studying the impact of anticipated
RHIC data on our knowledge about the polarized anti-quark distributions.
