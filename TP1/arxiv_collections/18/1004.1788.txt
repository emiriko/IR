This paper intends to look deeper into finding an ideal mobile broadband
solution. Special stress has been put in the South Asian region through some
comparative analysis. Proving their competency in numerous aspects, WiMAX and
LTE already have already made a strong position in telecommunication industry.
Both WiMAX and LTE are 4G technologies designed to move data rather than voice
having IP networks based on OFDM technology. So, they aren't like typical
technological rivals as of GSM and CDMA. But still a gesture of hostility seems
to outburst long before the stable commercial launch of LTE. In this paper
various aspects of WiMAX and LTE for deployment have been analyzed. Again, we
tried to make every possible consideration with respect to south Asia i.e. how
mass people of this region may be benefited. As a result, it might be regarded
as a good source in case of making major BWA deployment decisions in this
region. Besides these, it also opens the path for further research and in depth
thinking in this issue.
