We study D0-D0 mixing in the presence of a fourth generation of quarks. In
particular, we calculate the size of the allowed CP violation which is found at
the observable level well beyond anything possible with CKM dynamics. We
calculate the semileptonic asymmetry a_SL and the mixing induced CP asymmetry
eta_fS_f which are correlated with each other. We also investigate the
correlation of eta_fS_f with a number of prominent observables in other mesonic
systems like epsilon'/epsilon, Br(K_L -> pi0 nu nu), Br(K+ -> pi+ nu nu),
Br(B_s ->mu+ mu-), Br(B_d -> mu+ mu-) and finally S_psi phi in the B_s system.
We identify a clear pattern of flavour and CP violation predicted by the SM4
model: While simultaneous large 4G effects in the K and D systems are possible,
accompanying large NP effects in the B_d system are disfavoured. However this
behaviour is not as pronounced as found for the LHT and RSc models. In contrast
to this, sizeable CP violating effects in the B_s system are possible unless
extreme effects in eta_fS_f are found, and Br(B_s ->mu+ mu-) can be strongly
enhanced regardless of the situation in the D system. We find that, on the
other hand, S_psi phi > 0.2 combined with the measured epsilon'/epsilon
significantly diminishes 4G effects within the D system.
