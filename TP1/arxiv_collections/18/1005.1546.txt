The rapid rotation of planets causes cyclonic thermal turbulence in their
cores which may generate the large-scale magnetic fields observed outside the
planets. We consider the model which enables us reproduce the typical features
of small-scale geostrophic flows in physical and wave spaces. We present
estimates of kinetic and magnetic energy fluxes as a function of the wave
number. The joint existence of forward and inverse cascades are demonstrated.
We also consider the mechanism of magnetic field saturation at the end of the
kinematic dynamo regime.
