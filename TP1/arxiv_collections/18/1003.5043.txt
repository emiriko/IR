Motivated by recent work of one of us [1], we generalize this work to
agegraphic tachyon models of dark energy with entropy correction terms arising
from loop quantum gravity. We establish a connection between the
entropy-corrected agegraphic dark energy and the tachyon scalar field in a
universe with spacial curvature and reconstruct the potential and the dynamics
of the tachyon scalar field which describe the tachyon cosmology. The
cosmological implications of the entropy-corrected agegraphic dark energy
models are also discussed.
