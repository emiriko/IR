We apply the resummed version of the L\"uscher formula to analyze finite
volume corrections to the mass of the nucleon and of heavy mesons. We show that
by applying the subthreshold expansion of the scattering amplitudes one can
express the finite volume corrections in terms of only a few physical
observables and the size of the box. In the case of the nucleon, the available
information about the quark mass dependence of these physical quantities is
discussed and used to assess the finite volume corrections to the nucleon mass
as a function of the quark mass including a detailed analysis of the remaining
uncertainties. For heavy mesons, the L\"uscher formula is derived both fully
relativistically and in a nonrelativistic approximation and a first attempt at
a numerical analysis is made.
