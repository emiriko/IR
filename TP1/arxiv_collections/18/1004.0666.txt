In this article, we study the problem of designing a Decoherence Control for
quantum systems with the help of a scalable ancillary quantum control and
techniques from geometric control theory, in order to successfully and
completely decouple an open quantum system from its environment. We
re-formulate the problem of decoherence control as a disturbance rejection
scheme which also leads us to the idea of Internal Model Principle for quantum
control systems which is first of its kind in the literature.
  It is shown that decoupling a quantum disturbance from an open quantum
system, is possible only with the help of a quantum controller which takes into
account the model of the environmental interaction. This is demonstrated for a
simple 2-qubit system wherein the effects of decoherence are completely
eliminated. The theory provides conditions to be imposed on the controller to
ensure perfect decoupling. Hence the problem of decoherence control naturally
gives rise to the quantum internal model principle which relates the
disturbance rejecting control to the model of the environmental interaction.
  Classical internal model principle and disturbance decoupling focus on
different aspects viz. perfect output tracking and complete decoupling of
output from external disturbances respectively. However for quantum systems,
the two problems come together and merge in order to produce an effective
platform for decoherence control. In this article we introduce a seminal
connection between disturbance decoupling and the corresponding analog for
internal model principle for quantum systems.
