We consider overdamped Brownian dynamics in a periodic potential with
temporally oscillating amplitude. We analyze the transport which shows
effective diffusion enhanced by the oscillations and derive approximate
expressions for the diffusion coefficient. Furthermore we analyze the effect of
the oscillating potential on the transport if additionally a constant force is
applied. We show the existence of synchronization regimes at which the
deterministic dynamics is in resonance with the potential oscillations giving
rise to transport with extremely low dispersion. We distinguish slow and fast
oscillatory driving and give analytical expressions for the mean velocity and
effective diffusion.
