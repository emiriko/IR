We construct an explicit K3 surface over the field of rational numbers that
has geometric Picard rank one, and for which there is a transcendental
Brauer-Manin obstruction to weak approximation. To do so, we exploit the
relationship between polarized K3 surfaces endowed with particular kinds of
Brauer classes and cubic fourfolds.
