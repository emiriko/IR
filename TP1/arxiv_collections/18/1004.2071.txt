The dynamics with an infrared stable fixed point in the conformal window in
QCD like theories with a relatively large number of fermion flavors is
reviewed. The emphasis is on the description of a clear signature for the
conformal window, which in particular can be useful for lattice computer
simulations of these gauge theories.
