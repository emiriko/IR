We present a quantitative analysis of the steady state electronic transport
in a resistive switching device. The device is composed of a thin film of
Ag$_{2}$S (solid electrolyte) contacted by a Pt nano-contact acting as
ion-blocking electrode, and a large area Ag reference electrode. When applying
a bias voltage both ionic and electronic transport occurs, and depending on the
polarity it causes an accumulation of ions around the nano-contact. At small
applied voltages (pre-switching) we observed this as a strongly nonlinear
current-voltage curve, which have been modeled using the Hebb-Wagner treatment
for polarization of a mixed conductor. This model correctly describes the
transport of the electrons within the polarized solid electrolyte in the steady
state up until the resistance switching, covering the entire range of
non-stoichiometries, and including the supersaturation range just before the
deposition of elemental silver. In this way, it is a step towards a
quantitative understanding of the processes that lead to resistance switching.
