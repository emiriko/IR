The formation of small but finite amplitude electrostatic shocks in the
propagation of quantum ion-acoustic waves (QIAWs) obliquely to an external
magnetic field is reported in a quantum electron-positron-ion (e-p-i) plasma.
Such shocks are seen to have double-layer (DL) structures composed of the
compressive and accompanying rarefactive slow-wave fronts. Existence of such DL
shocks depends critically on the quantum coupling parameter $H$ associated with
the Bohm potential and the positron to electron density ratio $\delta$. The
profiles may, however, steepen initially and reach a steady state with a number
of solitary waves in front of the shocks. Such novel DL shocks could be a good
candidate for particle acceleration in intense laser-solid density plasma
interaction experiments as well as in compact astrophysical objects, e.g.,
magnetized white dwarfs.
