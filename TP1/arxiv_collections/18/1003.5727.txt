We study the properties of an artificial electromagnetic black hole for
transverse magnetic modes rigorously. A multi-layered structure of such a black
hole is then proposed as a reduced variety for easy experimental realizations.
An actual design of composite materials based on the effective medium theory is
given eventually with only five kinds of real isotropic materials. The finite
element method confirms the functionality of such a simple design.
