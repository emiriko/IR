Recently, a new class of restricted gravitational wave search templates,
termed the TaylorEt template was proposed for the search of inspiralling
compact binaries. The TaylorEt approximant is different from the usual
time-domain post-Newtonian approximants in that it employs the orbital binding
energy rather than the orbital frequency or the closely related parameter "x".
We perform detailed studies to probe the fitting factors of TaylorEt at 3.5pN
for nonspinning comparable mass compact binaries vis-a-vis the TaylorT1,
TaylorT4, and TaylorF2 at 3.5pN approximants in LIGO, Advanced LIGO and Virgo
interferometers.
