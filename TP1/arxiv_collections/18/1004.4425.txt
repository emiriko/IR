We consider magnetic properties of the planar structure consisting of a
ferromagnetic metal, diluted magnetic semiconductor and the quantum well (by
the example of the hybrid heterostructure Fe--Ga(Mn)As--InGaAs). In the
framework of the mean-field theory, there is the significant amplification of
the ferromagnetism induced by the ferromagnetic metal (Fe) in the system of
magnetic impurities (Mn) due to their indirect interaction via the conductivity
channel in the quantum well. As a result, the high-temperature ferromagnetism
arises leading to the spin polarization of charge carriers (holes) localized in
the quantum well and preserving their high mobility.
