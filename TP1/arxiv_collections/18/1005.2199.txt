Thanks to the recent work of Bhupal, Stipsicz, Szabo, and the author, one has
a complete list of resolution graphs of weighted homogeneous complex surface
singularities admitting a rational homology disk ("QHD") smoothing, i.e., one
with Milnor number 0. They fall into several classes, the most interesting of
which are the three classes whose resolution dual graph has central vertex with
valency 4. We give a uniform "quotient construction" of the QHD smoothings for
these classes; it is an explicit Q-Gorenstein smoothing, yielding a precise
description of the Milnor fibre and its non-abelian fundamental group. This had
already been done for two of these classes in a previous paper; what is new
here is the construction of the third class, which is far more difficult. In
addition, we explain the existence of two different QHD smoothings for the
first class.
  We also prove a general formula for the dimension of a QHD smoothing
component for a rational surface singularity. A corollary is that for the
valency 4 cases, such a component has dimension 1 and is smooth. Another
corollary is that "most" H-shaped resolution graphs cannot be the graph of a
singularity with a QHD smoothing. This result, plus recent work of
Bhupal-Stipsicz, is evidence for a general
  Conjecture: The only complex surface singularities with a QHD smoothing are
the (known) weighted homogeneous examples.
