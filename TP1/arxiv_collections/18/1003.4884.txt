We study the distribution of exoplanets around main sequence (MS) stars and
apply our results to the binary model for the formation of extreme horizontal
branch (EHB; sdO; sdB; hot subdwarfs) stars. By Binary model we refer both to
stellar and substellar companions that enhance the mass loss rate, where
substellar companions stand for both massive planets and brown dwarfs. We
conclude that sdB (EHB) stars are prime targets for planet searches. We reach
this conclusion by noticing that the bimodal distribution of planets around
stars with respect to the parameter M_p*a^2, is most prominent for stars in the
mass range 1Mo < M < 1.5Mo; 'a' is the orbital separation, 'M' is the stellar
mass and 'M_p' the planet mass. This is also the mass range of the progenitors
of EHB stars that are formed through the interaction of their progenitors with
planets (assuming the EHB formation mechanism is the binary model). In the
binary model for the formation of EHB stars interaction with a binary companion
or a substellar object (a planet or a brown dwarf), causes the progenitor to
lose most of its envelope mass during its red giant branch (RGB) phase. As a
result of that the descendant HB star is hot, i.e., an EHB (sdB) star. The
bimodal distribution suggests that even if the close-in planet that formed the
EHB star did not survive its RGB common envelope evolution, one planet or more
might survive at a>1AU. Also, if a planet or more are observed at a>1AU, it is
possible that a closer massive planet did survive the common envelope phase,
and it is orbiting the EHB with an orbital period of hours to days.
