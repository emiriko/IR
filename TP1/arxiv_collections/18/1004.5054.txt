Resonance states of a two-electron quantum dot are studied using a
variational expansion with both real basis-set functions and complex scaling
methods. We present numerical evidence about the critical behavior of the
density of states in the region where there are resonances. The critical
behavior is signaled by a strong dependence of some features of the density of
states with the basis-set size used to calculate it. The resonance energy and
lifetime are obtained using the scaling properties of the density of states
