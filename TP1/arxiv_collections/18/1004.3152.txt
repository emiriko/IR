We show that inducing structural softness in regular magnetoelectric (ME)
multiferroics -- i.e., tuning the materials to make their structure strongly
reactive to applied fields -- makes it possible to obtain very large ME
effects. We present illustrative first-principles results for BiFeO3 thin
films.
