The fundamental sources of noise in a vacuum-tunneling probe used as an
electromechanical transducer to monitor the location of a test mass are
examined using a first-quantization formalism. We show that a tunneling
transducer enforces the Heisenberg uncertainty principle for the position and
momentum of a test mass monitored by the transducer through the presence of two
sources of noise: the shot noise of the tunneling current and the momentum
fluctuations transferred by the tunneling electrons to the test mass. We
analyze a number of cases including symmetric and asymmetric rectangular
potential barriers and a barrier in which there is a constant electric field.
Practical configurations for reaching the quantum limit in measurements of the
position of macroscopic bodies with such a class of transducers are studied.
