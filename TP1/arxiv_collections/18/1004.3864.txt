We report amplification of electromagnetic waves by a single artificial atom
in open 1D space. Our three-level artificial atom -- a superconducting quantum
circuit -- coupled to a transmission line presents an analog of a natural atom
in open space. The system is the most fundamental quantum amplifier whose gain
is limited by a spontaneous emission mechanism. The noise performance is
determined by the quantum noise revealed in the spectrum of spontaneous
emission, also characterized in our experiments.
