We derive the transport properties of a quantum dot subject to a source-drain
bias voltage at zero temperature and magnetic field. Using the Scattering Bethe
Anstaz, a generalization of the traditional Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz to open
systems out of equilibrium, we derive exact results for the quantum dot
occupation out of equilibrium and, by introducing phenomenological spin- and
charge-fluctuation distribution functions in the computation of the current,
obtain the differential conductance for large U/\Gamma. The Hamiltonian to
describe the quantum dot system is the Anderson impurity Hamiltonian and the
current and dot occupation as a function of voltage are obtained numerically.
We also vary the gate voltage and study the transition from the mixed valence
to the Kondo regime in the presence of a non-equilibrium current. We conclude
with the difficulty we encounter in this model and possible way to solve them
without resorting to a phenomenological method.
