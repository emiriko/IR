We consider the electromagnetic form factors of strange vector, axial vector
and pseudoscalar mesons in a holographic QCD model. We find the charge radius
of charged kaon agrees with the experiment, while the charge radius of charged
pion is a little bit smaller than the experimental value, as obtained in other
calculations in the hard-wall holographic QCD models. The charge radii of
charged rho and $K^\ast$ quantitatively agree with a recent Dyson-Schwinger
equation calculation. We also present the electric form factors of vector,
axial vector and pseudoscalar mesons in both space-like and time-like regions.
We find the charged kaon form factor is in agreement with the experiment data.
