This talk discusses the formation of primordial intermediate-mass black
holes, in a double-inflationary theory, of sufficient abundance possibly to
provide all of the cosmological dark matter. There follows my, hopefully
convincing, explanation of the dark energy problem, based on the observation
that the visible universe is well approximated by a black hole. Finally, I
discuss that Gell-Mann is among the five greatest theoreticians of the
twentieth century.
