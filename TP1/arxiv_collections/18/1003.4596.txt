We derive the generalized Markovian description for the non-equilibrium
Brownian motion of a heated particle in a simple solvent with a
temperature-dependent viscosity. Our analytical results for the generalized
fluctuation-dissipation and Stokes-Einstein relations compare favorably with
measurements of laser-heated gold nano-particles and provide a practical
rational basis for emerging photothermal technologies.
