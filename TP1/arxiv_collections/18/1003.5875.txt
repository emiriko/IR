Motivated by representation theory and geometry, we introduce and develop an
equivariant generalization of Ehrhart theory, the study of lattice points in
dilations of lattice polytopes. We prove representation-theoretic analogues of
numerous classical results, and give applications to the Ehrhart theory of
rational polytopes and centrally symmetric polytopes. We also recover a
character formula of Procesi, Dolgachev, Lunts and Stembridge for the action of
a Weyl group on the cohomology of a toric variety associated to a root system.
