The nonlinear behavior of the Hall resistivity at low magnetic fields in
single quantum well GaAs/In$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$As/GaAs heterostructures with
degenerated electron gas is studied. It has been found that this anomaly is
accompanied by the weaker temperature dependence of the conductivity as
compared with that predicted by the first-order theory of the quantum
corrections to the conductivity. We show that both effects in strongly
disordered systems stem from the second order quantum correction caused by the
effect of weak localization on the interaction correction and vice versa. This
correction contributes mainly to the diagonal component of the conductivity
tensor, it depends on the magnetic field like the weak localization correction
and on the temperature like the interaction contribution.
