The paradigm of measurement-based quantum computation opens new experimental
avenues to realize a quantum computer and deepens our understanding of quantum
physics. Measurement-based quantum computation starts from a highly entangled
universal resource state. For years, clusters states have been the only known
universal resources. Surprisingly, a novel framework namely quantum computation
in correlation space has opened new routes to implement measurement-based
quantum computation based on quantum states possessing entanglement properties
different from cluster states. Here we report an experimental demonstration of
every building block of such a model. With a four-qubit and a six-qubit state
as distinct from cluster states, we have realized a universal set of
single-qubit rotations, two-qubit entangling gates and further Deutsch's
algorithm. Besides being of fundamental interest, our experiment proves
in-principle the feasibility of universal measurement-based quantum computation
without using cluster states, which represents a new approach towards the
realization of a quantum computer.
