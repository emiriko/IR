Let m(i) be the mass of i-th planet and M be the Solar mass. From
astronomical data it is known that ratios r(i)=m(i)/(m(i)+M) are of order
10^(-3)-10^(-6) for all planets. The same is true for all satellites of heavy
planets. These results suggest that Einstein's treatment of Mercury dynamics
can be extended to almost any object in the Solar System. This fact does not
explain the existing order in the Solar System. Indeed, all planets lie in the
same (Sun's equatorial) plane and move in the same direction coinciding with
that for the rotating Sun.The same is true for regular satellites of heavy
planets and for planetary rings associated with these satellites.In addition to
regular satellites, there are irregular satellites (and at least one irregular
(Saturn) ring associated with such a satellite (Phoebe)) grouped in respective
planes (other than equatorial) in which they all move in "wrong" directions on
stable orbits. These are located strictly outside of those for regular
satellites. This filling pattern is reminiscent to that in atomic mechanics.
Based on the original Heisenberg's ideas, we develop quantum celestial
mechanics explaining this filling pattern and that for rings of heavy planets.
The formalism takes essentially into account that planets and satellites are
moving on geodesics.
