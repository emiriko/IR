The surface code is a powerful quantum error correcting code that can be
defined on a 2-D square lattice of qubits with only nearest neighbor
interactions. Syndrome and data qubits form a checkerboard pattern. Information
about errors is obtained by repeatedly measuring each syndrome qubit after
appropriate interaction with its four nearest neighbor data qubits. Changes in
the measurement value indicate the presence of chains of errors in space and
time. The standard method of determining operations likely to return the code
to its error-free state is to use the minimum weight matching algorithm to
connect pairs of measurement changes with chains of corrections such that the
minimum total number of corrections is used. Prior work has not taken into
account the propagation of errors in space and time by the two-qubit
interactions. We show that taking this into account leads to a quadratic
improvement of the logical error rate.
