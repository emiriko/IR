A theory of the anomalous Hall conductivity based on the properties of single
site orbitals is presented. Effect of the finite electron life time is modeled
by energy fluctuations of atomic-like orbitals. Transition from the ideal Bloch
system for which the conductivity is determined by the Berry phase curvatures
to the case of strong disorder for which the conductivity becomes dependent on
the relaxation time is analyzed. Presented tight-binding model gives by the
unified way experimentally observed qualitative features of the anomalous
conductivity in the so called good metal regime and that called as bad metal or
hopping regime.
