There is an increasing demand for controller design techniques capable of
addressing the complex requirements of todays embedded applications. This
demand has sparked the interest in symbolic control where lower complexity
models of control systems are used to cater for complex specifications given by
temporal logics, regular languages, or automata. These specification mechanisms
can be regarded as qualitative since they divide the trajectories of the plant
into bad trajectories (those that need to be avoided) and good trajectories.
However, many applications require also the optimization of quantitative
measures of the trajectories retained by the controller, as specified by a cost
or utility function. As a first step towards the synthesis of controllers
reconciling both qualitative and quantitative specifications, we investigate in
this paper the use of symbolic models for time-optimal controller synthesis. We
consider systems related by approximate (alternating) simulation relations and
show how such relations enable the transfer of time-optimality information
between the systems. We then use this insight to synthesize approximately
time-optimal controllers for a control system by working with a lower
complexity symbolic model. The resulting approximately time-optimal controllers
are equipped with upper and lower bounds for the time to reach a target,
describing the quality of the controller. The results described in this paper
were implemented in the Matlab Toolbox Pessoa which we used to workout several
illustrative examples reported in this paper.
