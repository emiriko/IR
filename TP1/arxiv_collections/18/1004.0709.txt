We show that a Dynamical AdS/QCD model is able to reproduce the linear Regge
trajectories for the light-flavor sector of mesons with high spin and also for
the scalar and pseudoscalar ones. In addition the model has confinement by the
Wilson loop criteria and a mass gap. We also calculate the decay amplitude of
scalars into two pion in good agreement to the available experimental data.
