We have discussed conditions under which probability of oscillation
($\nu_e\rightarrow \nu_{\mu}$) is independent of CP violating phase $\delta$.
The condition of magic baseline on its length is well-known. We have proposed
another condition which is on neutrino energy. We have shown that magic
baseline condition is not possible in general, for small $\theta_{13}$ with
non-standard interaction and for large $\theta_{13}$ with both standard and
non-standard interactions. However, neutrino energy condition is possible for
such cases as well as for cases where magic baseline condition is applicable.
We have discussed how one may resolve hierarchy problem for neutrino masses by
using such energy condition. For a baseline of length 650 Km, using this energy
condition we discuss the possible number of $\mu^-$ events at the detector for
a period of 5 years and also the sensitivity in measurement of $\cos^2
\theta_{13}$.
