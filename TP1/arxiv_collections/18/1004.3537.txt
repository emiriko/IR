Recently it was shown by Castro, Maloney and Strominger (CMS) that 4D Kerr
black holes have a "hidden" conformal symmetry. Using some old results of
Cvetic and Larsen, I show that this result is very likely to hold also for the
most general black holes in five dimensions arising from heterotic/type II
string theory. In particular, we show how the wave equation in these geometries
in the "near region" can be written in terms of SL(2,R) X SL(2,R) Casimirs. For
the special case when the black hole has two spins but no U(1) charges,
detailed matches for entropy and absorption cross sections between CFT and
geometry are found. The black holes we consider need not be close to
extremality.
