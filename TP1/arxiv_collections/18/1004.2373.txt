We report on refined experimental results concerning the low-temperature
specific heat of the frustrated spin tube material [(CuCl2tachH)3Cl]Cl2. This
substance turns out to be an unusually perfect spin tube system which allows to
study the physics of quasi-one dimensional antiferromagnetic structures in
rather general terms. An analysis of the specific heat data demonstrates that
at low enough temperatures the system exhibits a Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid
behavior corresponding to an effective spin-3/2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg
chain with short-range exchange interactions. On the other hand, at somewhat
elevated temperatures the composite spin structure of the chain is revealed
through a Schottky-type peak in the specific heat located around 2 K. We argue
that the dominating contribution to the peak originates from gapped magnon-type
excitations related to the internal degrees of freedom of the rung spins.
