We determine the drag and the momentum diffusion coefficients of heavy
fermion in dense plasma. It is seen that in degenerate matter drag coefficient
at the leading order mediated by transverse photon is proportional to
$(E-\mu)^2$ while for the longitudinal exchange this goes as $(E-\mu)^3$. We
also calculate the longitudinal diffusion coefficient to obtain the Einstein
relation in a relativistic degenerate plasma. Finally, finite temperature
corrections are included both for the drag and the diffusion coefficients.
