In analogy with quantum optics, short time correlations of the current
fluctuations are used to characterize an on-demand electron source consisting
of a quantum dot connected to a conductor via a tunable tunnel barrier. We
observe a new fundamental noise for electrons associated with the quantum
fluctuations of the electron emission time, which we call quantum jitter. In
optimum operating conditions of the source, the noise reduces to the quantum
jitter limit, which demonstrates single particle emission. Combined with the
coherent manipulations of single electrons in a quantum conductor, this
electron quantum optics experiment opens the way to explore new problems
including quantum statistics and interactions at the single electron level.
