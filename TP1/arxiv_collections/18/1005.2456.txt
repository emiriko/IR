Many proposals for fault tolerant quantum computation (FTQC) suffer
detectable loss processes. Here we show that topological FTQC schemes, which
are known to have high error thresholds, are also extremely robust against
losses. We demonstrate that these schemes tolerate loss rates up to 24.9%,
determined by bond percolation on a cubic lattice. Our numerical results show
that these schemes retain good performance when loss and computational errors
are simultaneously present.
