We investigated the magnetic phase of the perovskite CaCrO$_3$ by using the
muon spin relaxation technique accompanied by susceptibility measurements. A
thermal hysteresis loop is identified with a width of about 1 K at the
transition temperature. Within the time scale of the muon lifetime, a static
antiferromagnetic order is revealed with distinct multiple internal fields
which are experienced in the muon interstitial sites below the phase-transition
temperature, $T_N=90 K$. Above $T_N$, lattice deformations are indicated by
transverse-field muon-spin rotation and relaxation suggesting a magneto-elastic
mechanism.
