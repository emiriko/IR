As first observed by the NA48/2 experiment at the CERN SPS, the $\p0p0$
invariant mass (M00) distribution from $\kcnn$ decay shows a cusp-like anomaly
at M00=2m+, where m+ is the charged pion mass. An analysis to extract the pi pi
scattering lengths in the isospin I=0 and I=2 states, a0 and a2, respectively,
has been recently reported. In the present work the Dalitz plot of this decay
is fitted to a new empirical parameterization suitable for practical purposes,
such as Monte Carlo simulations of K+- -> pi+- pi0 pi0 decays.
