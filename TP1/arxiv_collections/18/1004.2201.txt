We have investigated a polymer growth process on the triangular lattice where
the configurations produced are self-avoiding trails. We show that the scaling
behaviour of this process is similar to the analogous process on the square
lattice. However, while the square lattice process maps to the collapse
transition of the canonical interacting self-avoiding trail model (ISAT) on
that lattice, the process on the triangular lattice model does not map to the
canonical equilibrium model. On the other hand, we show that the collapse
transition of the canonical ISAT model on the triangular lattice behaves in a
way reminiscent of the $\theta$-point of the interacting self-avoiding walk
model (ISAW), which is the standard model of polymer collapse. This implies an
unusual lattice dependency of the ISAT collapse transition in two dimensions.
  By studying an extended ISAT model, we demonstrate that the growth process
maps to a multi-critical point in a larger parameter space. In this extended
parameter space the collapse phase transition may be either $\theta$-point-like
(second-order) or first-order, and these two are separated by a multi-critical
point. It is this multi-critical point to which the growth process maps.
Furthermore, we provide evidence that in addition to the high-temperature
gas-like swollen polymer phase (coil) and the low-temperature liquid drop-like
collapse phase (globule) there is also a maximally dense crystal-like phase
(crystal) at low temperatures dependent on the parameter values. The
multi-critical point is the meeting point of these three phases. Our
hypothesised phase diagram resolves the mystery of the seemingly differing
behaviours of the ISAW and ISAT models in two dimensions as well as the
behaviour of the trail growth process.
