We report on spin dependent transport measurements in carbon nanotubes based
multi-terminal circuits. We observe a gate-controlled spin signal in non-local
voltages and an anomalous conductance spin signal, which reveal that both the
spin and the orbital phase can be conserved along carbon nanotubes with
multiple ferromagnetic contacts. This paves the way for spintronics devices
exploiting both these quantum mechanical degrees of freedom on the same
footing.
