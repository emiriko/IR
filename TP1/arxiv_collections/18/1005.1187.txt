We review recent progresses in the theoretical description of correlation and
quantum fluctuation phenomena in charge transport through single molecules,
quantum dots, and quantum wires. A variety of physical phenomena is addressed,
relating to co-tunneling, pair-tunneling, adiabatic quantum pumping, charge and
spin fluctuations, and inhomogeneous Luttinger liquids. We review theoretical
many-body methods to treat correlation effects, quantum fluctuations,
nonequilibrium physics, and the time evolution into the stationary state of
complex nanoelectronic systems.
