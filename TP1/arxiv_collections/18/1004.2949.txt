Electronic properties of two-dimensional allotropes of carbon, such as
graphene and its bilayer, multi-layer epitaxial graphene, few-layer
Bernal-stacked graphene, as well as of three-dimensional bulk graphite are
reviewed from the viewpoint of recent optical spectroscopy studies. Attention
is focused on relativistic-like character of quasi particles in these systems,
which are referred to as massless or massive Dirac fermions.
