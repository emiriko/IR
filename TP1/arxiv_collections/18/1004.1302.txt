The scientific community is presently witnessing an unprecedented growth in
the quality and quantity of data sets coming from simulations and real-world
experiments. To access effectively and extract the scientific content of such
large-scale data sets (often sizes are measured in hundreds or even millions of
Gigabytes) appropriate tools are needed. Visual data exploration and discovery
is a robust approach for rapidly and intuitively inspecting large-scale data
sets, e.g. for identifying new features and patterns or isolating small regions
of interest within which to apply time-consuming algorithms. This paper
presents a high performance parallelized implementation of Splotch, our
previously developed visual data exploration and discovery algorithm for
large-scale astrophysical data sets coming from particle-based simulations.
Splotch has been improved in order to exploit modern massively parallel
architectures, e.g. multicore CPUs and CUDA-enabled GPUs. We present
performance and scalability benchmarks on a number of test cases, demonstrating
the ability of our high performance parallelized Splotch to handle efficiently
large-scale data sets, such as the outputs of the Millennium II simulation, the
largest cosmological simulation ever performed.
