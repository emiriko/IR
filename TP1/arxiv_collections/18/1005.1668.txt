We show how two principles - strong coupling and discrete symmetry - can work
together to generate the flavour structure of the Standard Model. We propose
that in the UV the full theory has a discrete flavour symmetry, typically only
associated with tribimaximal mixing in the neutrino sector. Hierarchies in the
particle masses and mixing matrices then emerge from multiple strongly coupled
sectors that break this symmetry. This allows for a realistic flavour
structure, even in models built around an underlying grand unified theory. We
use two different techniques to understand the strongly coupled physics:
confinement in N=1 supersymmetry and the AdS/CFT correspondence. Both
approaches yield equivalent results and can be represented in a clear,
graphical way where the flavour symmetry is realised geometrically.
