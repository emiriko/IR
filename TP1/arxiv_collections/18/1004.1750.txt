Two-dimensional colloidal suspensions subject to laser interference patterns
with decagonal symmetry can form an Archimedean-like tiling phase where rows of
squares and triangles order aperiodically along one direction [J. Mikhael et
al., Nature 454, 501 (2008)]. In experiments as well as in Monte-Carlo and
Brownian dynamics simulations, we identify a similar phase when the laser field
possesses tetradecagonal symmetry. We characterize the structure of both
Archimedean-like tilings in detail and point out how the tilings differ from
each other. Furthermore, we also estimate specific particle densities where the
Archimedean-like tiling phases occur. Finally, using Brownian dynamics
simulations we demonstrate how phasonic distortions of the decagonal laser
field influence the Archimedean-like tiling. In particular, the domain size of
the tiling can be enlarged by phasonic drifts and constant gradients in the
phasonic displacement. We demonstrate that the latter occurs when the
interfering laser beams are not adjusted properly.
