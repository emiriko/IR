Approximate symmetries of geodesic equations on 2-spheres are studied. These
are the symmetries of the perturbed geodesic equations which represent
approximate path of a particle rather than exact path. After giving the exact
symmetries of the geodesic equations, two different approaches to study the
approximate symmetries of the approximate geodesic equations show that no
non-trivial approximate symmetry for these spaces exists.
