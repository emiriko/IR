The Helmholtz free energy density is parametrized as a function of
temperature and baryon density near the chiral critical point of QCD. The
parametrization incorporates the expected critical exponents and amplitudes. An
expansion away from equilibrium states is achieved with Landau theory. This is
used to calculate the probability that the system is found at a density other
than the equilibrium one. Such fluctuations are predicted to be very large in
heavy ion collisions.
