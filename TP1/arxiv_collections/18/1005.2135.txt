abs/1002.4294 ] broke through traditional results on Nash implementation with
three or more agents. In this paper, we will investigate two-agent Nash
implementation by virtue of Wu's quantum mechanism. The main result is: A
two-agent social choice rule that satisfies Condition $\mu2$ will no longer be
Nash implementable if an additional Condition $\lambda'$ is satisfied.
Moreover, according to a classical two-agent algorithm, this result holds not
only in the quantum world, but also in the macro world.
