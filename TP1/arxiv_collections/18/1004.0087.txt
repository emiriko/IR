The article is devoted to Bc->Bs+n pi, Bc->Bs*+n pi decays with n=1, 2, 3, 4.
In the framework of factorization theorem the branching fractions of these
processes can be written as convolution of hard part, describing Bc->Bs W,
Bc->Bs* W vertices, and spectral functions, that correspond to transition of
virtual $W$-boson into a final pi-meson system. These functions were obtained
from the fit of experimental data on $\tau$-lepton decay and electron-positron
annihilation. Using different sets of Bc->Bs decay form-factors we present
branching fractions and distributions over the invariant mass of the final
pi-meson system.
