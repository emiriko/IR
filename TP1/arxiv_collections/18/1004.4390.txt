The energy-dependence of charged particle mean multiplicity and
pseudorapidity density at midrapidity measured in nucleus-nucleus and
(anti)proton-proton collisions are studied in the entire available energy
range. The study is performed using a model, which considers the multiparticle
production process according to the dissipating energy of the participants and
their types, namely a combination of the constituent quark picture together
with Landau relativistic hydrodynamics. The model reveals interrelations
between the variables under study measured in nucleus-nucleus and
nucleon-nucleon collisions. Measurements in nuclear reactions are shown to be
well reproduced by the measurements in (anti)proton-proton interactions common
and the corresponding fits are presented. Different observations in other types
of collisions are discussed in the framework of the proposed model. Predictions
are made for measurements at the forthcoming LHC energies.
