Recently, cold atomic Fermi gases with the large magnetic dipolar interaction
have been laser cooled down to quantum degeneracy. Different from
electric-dipoles which are classic vectors, atomic magnetic dipoles are
quantum-mechanical matrix operators proportional to the hyperfine-spin of
atoms, thus provide rich opportunities to investigate exotic many-body physics.
Furthermore, unlike anisotropic electric dipolar gases, unpolarized magnetic
dipolar systems are isotropic under simultaneous spin-orbit rotation. These
features give rise to a robust mechanism for a novel pairing symmetry: orbital
p-wave (L=1) spin triplet (S=1) pairing with total angular momentum of the
Cooper pair J=1. This pairing is markedly different from both the $^3$He-B
phase in which J=0 and the $^3$He-$A$ phase in which $J$ is not conserved. It
is also different from the p-wave pairing in the single-component electric
dipolar systems in which the spin degree of freedom is frozen.
