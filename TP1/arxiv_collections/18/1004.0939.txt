Within the LAGUNA design study, seven candidate sites are being assessed for
their feasibility to host a next-generation, very large neutrino observatory.
Such a detector will be expected to feature within a future European
accelerator neutrino programme (Superbeam or Beta Beam), and hence the distance
from CERN is of critical importance. In this article, the focus is a $^{18}$Ne
and $^{6}$He Beta Beam sourced at CERN and directed towards a 50 kton Liquid
Argon detector located at the LAGUNA sites: Slanic (L=1570 km) and
Pyh\"{a}salmi (L=2300 km). To improve sensitivity to the neutrino mass
ordering, these baselines are then combined with a concurrent run with the same
flux directed towards a large Water \v{C}erenkov detector located at Canfranc
(L=650 km). This degeneracy breaking combination is shown to provide comparable
physics reach to the conservative Magic Baseline Beta Beam proposals. For
$^{18}$Ne ions boosted to $\gamma=570$ and $^{6}$He ions boosted to
$\gamma=350$, the correct mass ordering can be determined at Slanic for all
$\delta$ when $\sin^{2}2\theta_{13}>4\cdot 10^{-3}$ in this combination.
