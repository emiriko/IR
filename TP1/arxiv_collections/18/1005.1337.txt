Photosynthesis first step mechanism concerns the sunlight absorption and both
negative and positive charges separation. Recent and important photosynthesis
literature claims that this mechanism is quantum mechanics controlled, however
without presenting qualitative or quantitative scientifically based mechanism.
The present accepted and old-fashioned photosynthesis mechanism model suffers
from few drawbacks and an important issue is the absence of driving force for
negative and positive charges separation. This article presents a new
qualitative model for this first step mechanism in natural catalytic systems
such as photosynthesis in green leaves. The model uses a concept of
semiconductor band gap engineering, such as the staggered energy band gap
line-up in semiconductors. To explain the primary mechanism in natural
photosynthesis the proposal is the following: incident light is absorbed inside
the leaves causing charges separation. The only energetic configuration that
allows charges separation under illumination is the staggered one between two
materials or molecules. We explain why (e-, h+) interacting charges can be
separated by using an energy staggered configuration, under illumination.
Following this model, the green light of plants can be seen as related to the
spent energy for charges separation. Green colour being mostly an emission and
not a reflection as currently presented. The arguments mentioned below show why
we cannot explain the photosynthesis first step mechanism, based on the
presently accepted model, and therefore the alternative model is presented.
