At the LHC, the measurement of the W mass with a precision of \cal{O}(10)
MeV/c^2 is both mandatory and difficult. In the analysis strategies proposed so
far, shortcuts have been made that are justified for proton-antiproton
collisions at the Tevatron, but not for proton-proton collisions at the LHC.
The root of the problem lies in the inadequate knowledge of parton density
functions of the proton. It is argued that in order to reach a 10 MeV/c^2
precision for the W mass, more precise parton density functions of the proton
are needed, and an LHC-specific analysis strategy ought to be pursued.
Proposals are made on both issues.
