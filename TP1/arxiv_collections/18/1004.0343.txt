The Tevatron experiments have each accumulated about 6 \ifb good data since
the start of RUN II. This large dataset provided good opportunities for meson
spectroscopy studies at the Tevatron. This article will cover the recent new
$\Upsilon(nS)$ polarization studies as well as exotic meson spectroscopy
studies.
