We propose to consider non confluence with respect to implicit complexity. We
come back to some well known classes of first-order functional program, for
which we have a characterization of their intentional properties, namely the
class of cons-free programs, the class of programs with an interpretation, and
the class of programs with a quasi-interpretation together with a termination
proof by the product path ordering. They all correspond to PTIME. We prove that
adding non confluence to the rules leads to respectively PTIME, NPTIME and
PSPACE. Our thesis is that the separation of the classes is actually a witness
of the intentional properties of the initial classes of programs.
