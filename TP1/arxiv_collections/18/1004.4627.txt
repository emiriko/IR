We analyse the low temperature properties of a system of classical Heisenberg
spins on a hexagonal lattice with Kitaev couplings. For a lattice of 2N sites
with periodic boundary conditions, we show that the ground states form an (N+1)
dimensional manifold. We show that the ensemble of ground states is equivalent
to that of a solid-on-solid model with continuously variable heights and
nearest neighbour interactions, at a finite temperature. For temperature T
tending to zero, all ground states have equal weight, and there is no
order-by-disorder in this model. We argue that the bond-energy bond-energy
correlations at distance R decay as 1/R^2 at zero temperature. This is verified
by Monte Carlo simulations. We also discuss the relation to the quantum spin-S
Kitaev model for large S, and obtain lower and upper bounds on the ground state
energy of the quantum model.
