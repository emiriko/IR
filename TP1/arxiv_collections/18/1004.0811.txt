For liquid-scintillator neutrino detectors of kiloton scale, the transparency
of the organic solvent is of central importance. The present paper reports on
laboratory measurements of the optical scattering lengths of the organic
solvents PXE, LAB, and Dodecane which are under discussion for next-generation
experiments like SNO+, Hanohano, or LENA. Results comprise the wavelength range
from 415 to 440nm. The contributions from Rayleigh and Mie scattering as well
as from absorption/re-emission processes are discussed. Based on the present
results, LAB seems to be the preferred solvent for a large-volume detector.
