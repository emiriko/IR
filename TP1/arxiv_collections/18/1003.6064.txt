We analyze correlations between the first letter of the name of an author and
the number of citations their papers receive. We look at simple mean counts,
numbers of highly-cited papers, and normalized h-indices, by letter. To our
surprise, we conclude that orthographically senior authors produce a better
body of work than their colleagues, despite some evidence of discrimination
against them.
