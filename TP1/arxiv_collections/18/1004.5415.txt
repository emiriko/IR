We present a set of low resolution empirical SED templates for AGNs and
galaxies in the wavelength range from 0.03 to 30 microns. These templates form
a non-negative basis of the color space of such objects and have been derived
from a combination 14448 galaxies and 5347 likely AGNs in the NDWFS Bootes
field. We briefly describe how the templates are derived and discuss some
applications of them. In particular, we discuss biases in commonly used AGN
mid-IR color selection criteria and the expected distribution of sources in the
current WISE satellite mission.
