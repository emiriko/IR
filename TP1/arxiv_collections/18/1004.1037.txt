We study the fluid squeeze-out from the interface between an elastic solid
with a flat surface and a rigid solid with a randomly rough surface. As an
application we discuss fluid squeeze-out between a tire tread block and a road
surface. Some implications for the leakage of seals are discussed, and
experimental data are presented to test the theory.
