Autoplot is software developed for the Virtual Observatories in Heliophysics
to provide intelligent and automated plotting capabilities for many typical
data products that are stored in a variety of file formats or databases.
Autoplot has proven to be a flexible tool for exploring, accessing, and viewing
data resources as typically found on the web, usually in the form of a
directory containing data files with multiple parameters contained in each
file. Data from a data source is abstracted into a common internal data model
called QDataSet. Autoplot is built from individually useful components, and can
be extended and reused to create specialized data handling and analysis
applications and is being used in a variety of science visualization and
analysis applications. Although originally developed for viewing
heliophysics-related time series and spectrograms, its flexible and generic
data representation model makes it potentially useful for the Earth sciences.
