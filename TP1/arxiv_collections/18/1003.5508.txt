The drag and diffusion coefficients of charm and bottom quarks propagating
through quark gluon plasma (QGP) have been evaluated for conditions relevant to
nuclear collisions at Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The dead cone and
Landau-Pomeronchuk-Migdal (LPM) effects on radiative energy loss of heavy
quarks have been considered. Both radiative and collisional processes of energy
loss are included in the {\it effective} drag and diffusion coefficients. With
these effective transport coefficients we solve the Fokker Plank (FP) equation
for the heavy quarks executing Brownian motion in the QGP. The solution of the
FP equation has been used to evaluate the nuclear suppression factor,
$R_{\mathrm AA}$ for the non-photonic single electron spectra resulting from
the semi-leptonic decays of hadrons containing charm and bottom quarks. The
effects of mass on $R_{\mathrm AA}$ has also been highlighted.
