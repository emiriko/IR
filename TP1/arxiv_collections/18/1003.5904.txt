It has been known for some time that the well established LMA solution to the
observed solar neutrino deficit fails to predict a flat energy spectrum for
SuperKamiokande as opposed to what the data indicates. It also leads to a
Chlorine rate which appears to be too high as compared to the data. We
investigate the possible solution to these inconsistencies with non standard
neutrino interactions, assuming that they come as extra contributions to the
$\nu_{\alpha}\nu_{\beta}$ and $\nu_{\alpha}e$ vertices that affect both the
propagation of neutrinos through solar matter and their detection. We find
that, among the many possibilities for non standard couplings, only one of them
leads to a flat SuperKamiokande spectral rate in better agreement with the data
and predicts a Chlorine rate within 1$\sigma$ of the observed one, while
keeping all other predictions accurate.
