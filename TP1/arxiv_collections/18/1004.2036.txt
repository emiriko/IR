We analyze the recently published Fermi-LAT diffuse gamma-ray measurements in
the context of leptonically annihilating or decaying dark matter (DM) with the
aim to explain simultaneously the isotropic diffuse gamma-ray and the PAMELA,
Fermi and HESS (PFH) anomalous $e^\pm$ data. Five different DM
annihilation/decay channels $2e$, $2\mu$, $2\tau$, $4e$, or $4\mu$ (the latter
two via an intermediate light particle $\phi$) are generated with PYTHIA. We
calculate both the Galactic and extragalactic prompt and inverse Compton (IC)
contributions to the resulting gamma-ray spectra. To find the Galactic IC
spectra we use the interstellar radiation field model from the latest release
of GALPROP. For the extragalactic signal we show that the amplitude of the
prompt gamma-emission is very sensitive to the assumed model for the
extragalactic background light. For our Galaxy we use the Einasto, NFW and
Isothermal DM density profiles and include the effects of DM substructure
assuming a simple subhalo model. Our calculations show that for the
annihilating DM the extragalactic gamma-ray signal can dominate only if rather
extreme power-law concentration-mass relation $C(M)$ is used, while more
realistic $C(M)$ relations make the extragalactic component comparable or
subdominant to the Galactic signal. For the decaying DM the Galactic signal
always exceeds the extragalactic one. In the case of annihilating DM the PFH
favored parameters can be ruled out only if power-law $C(M)$ relation is
assumed. For DM decaying into $2\mu$ or $4\mu$ the PFH favored DM parameters
are not in conflict with the Fermi gamma-ray data. We find that, due to the
(almost) featureless Galactic IC spectrum and the DM halo substructure,
annihilating DM may give a good simultaneous fit to the isotropic diffuse
gamma-ray and to the PFH $e^\pm$ data without being in clear conflict with the
other Fermi-LAT gamma-ray measurements.
