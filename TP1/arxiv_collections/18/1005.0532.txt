Optical imaging relies on the ability to illuminate an object, collect and
analyze the light it scatters or transmits. Propagation through complex media
such as biological tissues was so far believed to degrade the attainable depth
as well as the resolution for imaging because of multiple scattering. This is
why such media are usually considered opaque. Very recently, we have proven
that it is possible to measure the complex mesoscopic optical transmission
channels that allows light to traverse through such an opaque medium. Here we
show that we can optimally exploit those channels to coherently transmit and
recover with a high fidelity an arbitrary image, independently of the
complexity of the propagation.
