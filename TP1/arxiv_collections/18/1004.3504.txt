In this paper, we present a very important primitive called Information
Checking Protocol (ICP) which plays an important role in constructing
statistical Verifiable Secret Sharing (VSS) and Weak Secret Sharing (WSS)
protocols. Informally, ICP is a tool for authenticating messages in the
presence of computationally unbounded corrupted parties. Here we extend the
basic bare-bone definition of ICP, introduced by Rabin et al. and then present
an ICP that attains the best communication complexity and round complexity
among all the existing ICPs in the literature. We also show that our ICP
satisfies several interesting properties such as linearity property which is an
important requirement in many applications of ICP. Though not presented in this
paper, we can design communication and round efficient statistical (i.e
involves negligible error probability in computation) VSS and Multiparty
Computation (MPC) protocol using our new ICP.
