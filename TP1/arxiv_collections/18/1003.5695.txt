Chiral perturbation theory predicts that in quantum chromodynamics (QCD),
light dynamical quarks suppress the gauge-field topological susceptibility of
the vacuum. The degree of suppression depends on quark multiplicity and masses.
It provides a strong consistency test for fermion formulations in lattice QCD.
Such tests are especially important for staggered fermion formulations that
lack a full chiral symmetry and use the "fourth-root" procedure to achieve the
desired number of sea quarks. Over the past few years we have measured the
topological susceptibility on a large database of 18 gauge field ensembles,
generated in the presence of 2+1 flavors of dynamical asqtad quarks with up and
down quark masses ranging from 0.05 to 1 in units of the strange quark mass and
lattice spacings ranging from 0.045 fm to 0.12 fm. Our study also includes
three quenched ensembles with lattice spacings ranging from 0.06 to 0.12 fm. We
construct the topological susceptibility from the integrated point-to-point
correlator of the discretized topological charge density F-Fdual. To reduce its
variance, we model the asymptotic tail of the correlator. The continuum
extrapolation of our results for the topological susceptibility agrees nicely
at small quark mass with the predictions of lowest-order SU(3) chiral
perturbation theory, thus lending support to the validity of the fourth-root
procedure.
