The utility of chiral effective field theory, constructed in a manner in
which loop contributions are suppressed as one moves outside the power-counting
regime, is explored for baryon magnetic moments. Opportunities for the study of
significant chiral curvature in valence and full QCD and the nontrivial
behavior of strange- and light-quark contributions to the magnetic moment of
the Lambda baryon are highlighted.
