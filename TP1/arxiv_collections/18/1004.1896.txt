Supergiant Fast X-ray Transients (SFXTs) are a new class of High Mass X-ray
Binaries, discovered by the INTEGRAL satellite, which display flares lasting
from minutes to hours, with peak luminosity of 1E36-1E37 erg/s. Outside the
bright outbursts, they show a frequent long-term flaring activity reaching an
X-ray luminosity level of 1E33-1E34 erg/s, as recently observed with the Swift
satellite. Since a few persistent High Mass X-ray Binaries (HMXBs) with
supergiant donors show flares with properties similar to those observed in
SFXTs, it has been suggested that the flaring activity in both classes could be
produced by the same mechanism, probably the accretion of clumps composing the
supergiant wind. We have developed a new clumpy wind model for OB supergiants
with both a spherical and a non spherical symmetry for the outflow. We have
investigated the effects of the accretion of a clumpy wind onto a neutron star
in both classes of persistent and transient HMXBs.
