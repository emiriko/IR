We present a new approach to obtaining the scaling behavior of the
entanglement entropy in fractional quantum Hall states from finite-size
wavefunctions. By employing the torus geometry and the fact that the torus
aspect ratio can be readily varied, we can extract the entanglement entropy of
a spatial block as a continuous function of the block boundary. This approach
allows us to extract the topological entanglement entropy with an accuracy
superior to what is possible on the spherical or disc geometry, where no
natural continuously variable parameter is available. Other than the
topological information, the study of entanglement scaling is also useful as an
indicator of the difficulty posed by fractional quantum Hall states for various
numerical techniques.
