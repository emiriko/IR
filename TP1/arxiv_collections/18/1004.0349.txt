We present a simple approach for purifying graphite surface and vacancy
states using an angle-resolved x-ray photoelectron residual spectroscopy (XPS).
Complementing the discoveries of Ugeda et al [Phys Rev Lett 104, 096804
(2010)], outcomes conform the BOLS theory [Sun, Prog Solid State Chem 35, 1-159
(2007)] expectation and the recent findings that the shorter and stronger bonds
between undercoordinated atoms induce local strain and quantum potential
depression with an association of local densification of energy and core
electrons. The shorter atomic distance and the densely and deeply trapped
bonding and core charges polarize in turn the unpaired pi-electrons nearby
vacancy, giving rise to the high protrusions and the Dirac EF states as
observed. The quantum trap depression and the screening due to the polarized EF
states split the crystal potential and hence the extra XPRS C 1s states.
