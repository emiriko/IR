Seals are extremely useful devices to prevent fluid leakage. We present
experimental result which show that the leak-rate of seals depend sensitively
on the skewness in the height probability distribution. The experimental data
are analyzed using the critical-junction theory. We show that using the
top-power spectrum result in good agreement between theory and experiment.
