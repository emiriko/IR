By using a high quality Tl2Ba2Ca2Cu3O10 (Tl-2223) single crystal as an
example, the magnetization vector was probed in the reversible region of highly
anisotropic cuprate superconductors. For that, we have measured its components
along and transverse to the applied magnetic field for different crystal
orientations. The analysis shows that the angular dependence of the
perpendicular component of the magnetization vector follows the one predicted
by a London-like approach which includes a contribution associated with the
thermal fluctuations of the 2D vortex positions. For the Tl-2223 crystal
studied here, a lower bound for the anisotropy factor was estimated to be about
190.
