We explain particular, unique, approximate solutions of the
Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi (DGLAP) evolution equations and also
solutions of DGLAP evolution equations by using regge behaviour of structure
functions and method of characteristic for t and x-evolutions of singlet and
non-singlet structure functions in leading order (LO) and next-to-leading order
(NLO). Hence t-evolution of deuteron, proton, neutron and difference of proton
and neutron and x-evolution of deuteron, proton and neutron structure functions
in LO and NLO at low-x from DGLAP evolution equations. The results of t and
x-evolutions are compared with experimental data and global parameterization in
different kinematics region. We also compare the solutions of DGLAP evolution
equations among themselves.
