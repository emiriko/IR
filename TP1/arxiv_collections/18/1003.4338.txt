Magnetic moments of the low lying and charmed spin 1/2^+ and spin 3/2^+
baryons have been calculated in the SU(4) chiral constituent quark model
(\chiCQM) by including the contribution from c \bar c fluctuations. Explicit
calculations have been carried out for the contribution coming from the valence
quarks, "quark sea" polarizations and their orbital angular momentum. The
implications of such a model have also been studied for magnetic moments of the
low lying spin 3/2^+ \to 1/2^+ and 1/2^+ \to 1/2^+ transitions as well as the
transitions involving charmed baryons. We are able to achieve an excellent
agreement with data for the case of low lying spin 1/2^+ baryons and spin 3/2^+
baryons. For the spin 1/2^+ and spin 3/2^+ charmed baryon magnetic moments, our
results are consistent with the predictions of the QCD sum rules, Light Cone
sum rules and Spectral sum rules. For the cases where "light" quarks dominate
in the valence structure, the sea and orbital contributions are found to be
fairly significant however, they cancel in the right direction to give the
correct magnitude of the total magnetic moment. On the other hand, when there
is an excess of "heavy" quarks, the contribution of the "quark sea" is almost
negligible. The effects of configuration mixing and quark masses have also been
investigated.
