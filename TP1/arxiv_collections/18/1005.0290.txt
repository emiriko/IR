We investigate the dynamics of two coupled vortices driven by spin transfer.
We are able to independently control with current and perpendicular field, and
to detect, the respective chiralities and polarities of the two vortices. For
current densities above $J=5.7*10^7 A/cm^2$, a highly coherent signal
(linewidth down to 46 kHz) can be observed, with a strong dependence on the
relative polarities of the vortices. It demonstrates the interest of using
coupled dynamics in order to increase the coherence of the microwave signal.
Emissions exhibit a linear frequency evolution with perpendicular field, with
coherence conserved even at zero magnetic field.
