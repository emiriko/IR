In a recent paper, we proposed a new class of supersymmetric SO(10) models
for neutrino masses where the TeV scale electroweak symmetry is SU(2)_L\times
SU(2)_R\times U(1)_{B-L} making the associated gauge bosons W_R and Z'
accessible at the Large Hadron Collider. We showed that there exists a domain
of Yukawa coupling parameters and symmetry breaking patterns which give an
excellent fit to all fermion masses including neutrinos. In this sequel, we
discuss an alternative Yukawa pattern which also gives good fermion mass fit
and then study the predictions of both models for proton lifetime. Consistency
with current experimental lower limits on proton life time require the squark
masses of first two generations to be larger than ~ 1.2 TeV. We also discuss
how one can have simultaneous breaking of both SU(2)_R\times U(1)_{B-L} and
standard electroweak symmetries via radiative corrections.
