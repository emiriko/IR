In the present work we study, both theoretically and experimentally, the
temperature increase in a bulk high-temperature superconductor subjected to
applied AC magnetic fields of large amplitude. We calculate analytically the
equilibrium temperatures of the bulk sample as a function of the experimental
parameters using a simple critical-state model for an infinitely long type-II
superconducting slab or cylinder. The results show the existence of a limit
heat transfer coefficient (AUlim) separating two thermal regimes with different
characteristics. The theoretical analysis predicts a "forbidden" temperature
window within which the temperature of the superconductor can never stabilize
when the heat transfer coefficient is small. In addition, we determine an
analytical expression of two threshold fields Htr1 and Htr2 characterizing the
importance of magneto-thermal effects and show that a thermal runaway always
occurs when the field amplitude is larger than Htr2. The theoretical
predictions of the temperature evolution of the bulk sample during a
self-heating process agree well with the experimental data. The simple
analytical study presented in this paper enables order of magnitude thermal
effects to be estimated for simple superconductor geometries under applied AC
magnetic fields and can be used to predict the influence of experimental
parameters on the self-heating characteristics of bulk type-II superconductors.
