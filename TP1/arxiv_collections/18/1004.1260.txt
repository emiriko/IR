Starting with an initial random network of oscillators with a heterogeneous
frequency distribution, its autonomous synchronization ability can be largely
improved by appropriately rewiring the links between the elements. Ensembles of
synchronization-optimized networks with different connectivities are generated
and their statistical properties are studied.
