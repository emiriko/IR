During the last years, through the combined effort of the insight, coming
from physical intuition and computer simulation, and the exploitation of
rigorous mathematical methods, the main features of the mean field
Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin glass model have been firmly established. In
particular, it has been possible to prove the existence and uniqueness of the
infinite volume limit for the free energy, and its Parisi expression, in terms
of a variational principle, involving a functional order parameter. Even the
expected property of ultrametricity, for the infinite volume states, seems to
be near to a complete proof. The main structural feature of this model, and
related models, is the deep phenomenon of spontaneous replica symmetry breaking
(RSB), discovered by Parisi many years ago. By expanding on our previous work,
the aim of this paper is to investigate a general frame, where replica symmetry
breaking is embedded in a kind of mechanical scheme of the Hamilton-Jacobi
type. Here, the analog of the "time" variable is a parameter characterizing the
strength of the interaction, while the "space" variables rule out
quantitatively the broken replica symmetry pattern. Starting from the simple
cases, where annealing is assumed, or replica symmetry, we build up a
progression of dynamical systems, with an increasing number of space variables,
which allow to weaken the effect of the potential in the Hamilton-Jacobi
equation, as the level of symmetry braking is increased. This new machinery
allows to work out mechanically the general K-step RSB solutions, in a
different interpretation with respect to the replica trick, and lightens easily
their properties as existence or uniqueness.
