Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) with five different C13/C12 isotope
compositions and well-separated Raman peaks have been synthesized and
conjugated to five targeting ligands in order to impart molecular specificity.
Multiplexed Raman imaging of live cells has been carried out by highly specific
staining of cells with a five-color mixture of SWNTs. Ex vivo multiplexed Raman
imaging of tumor samples uncovers a surprising up-regulation of epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR) on LS174T colon cancer cells from cell culture to
in vivo tumor growth. This is the first time five-color multiplexed molecular
imaging has been performed in the near-infrared (NIR) region under a single
laser excitation. Near zero interfering background of imaging is achieved due
to the sharp Raman peaks unique to nanotubes over the low, smooth
autofluorescence background of biological species.
