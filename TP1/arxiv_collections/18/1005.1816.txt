The epitaxial growth of germanium on silicon leads to the self-assembly of
SiGe nanocrystals via a process that allows the size, composition and position
of the nanocrystals to be controlled. This level of control, combined with an
inherent compatibility with silicon technology, could prove useful in
nanoelectronic applications. Here we report the confinement of holes in
quantum-dot devices made by directly contacting individual SiGe nanocrystals
with aluminium electrodes, and the production of hybrid
superconductorsemiconductor devices, such as resonant supercurrent transistors,
when the dot is strongly coupled to the electrodes. Charge transport
measurements on weakly coupled quantum dots reveal discrete energy spectra,
with the confined hole states displaying anisotropic gyromagnetic factors and
strong spin-orbit coupling strength with pronounced gate-voltage and
magnetic-field dependence.
