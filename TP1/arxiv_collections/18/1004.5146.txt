We prove fractional Hardy--Sobolev--Maz'ya inequality for balls and a
half-space, partially answering the open problem posed by Frank and Seiringer
[arXiv:0906.1561v1 [math.FA], 2009] We note that for half-spaces this
inequality has been recently obtained by Sloane [arXiv:1004.4828v1 [math.FA],
2010].
