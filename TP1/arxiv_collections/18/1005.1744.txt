We characterise the probability distributions that arise from quantum
circuits all of whose gates commute, and show when these distributions can be
classically simulated efficiently. We consider also marginal distributions and
the computation of correlation coefficients, and draw connections between the
simulation of stabiliser circuits and the combinatorics of representable
matroids, as developed in the 1990s.
