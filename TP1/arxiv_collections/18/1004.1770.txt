There has been a remarkable increase in the data exchange over web and the
widespread use of digital media. As a result, multimedia data transfers also
had a boost up. The mounting interest with reference to digital watermarking
throughout the last decade is certainly due to the increase in the need of
copyright protection of digital content. This is also enhanced due to
commercial prospective. Applications of video watermarking in copy control,
broadcast monitoring, fingerprinting, video authentication, copyright
protection etc is immensely rising. The main aspects of information hiding are
capacity, security and robustness. Capacity deals with the amount of
information that can be hidden. The skill of anyone detecting the information
is security and robustness refers to the resistance to modification of the
cover content before concealed information is destroyed. Video watermarking
algorithms normally prefers robustness. In a robust algorithm it is not
possible to eliminate the watermark without rigorous degradation of the cover
content. In this paper, we introduce the notion of Video Watermarking and the
features required to design a robust watermarked video for a valuable
application. We review several algorithms, and introduce frequently used key
techniques. The aim of this paper is to focus on the various domains of video
watermarking techniques. The majority of the reviewed methods based on video
watermarking emphasize on the notion of robustness of the algorithm.
