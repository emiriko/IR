We propose an interpolation expression using the difference moment
(Kolmogorov transient structural function) of the second order as the average
characteristic of displacements for identifying the anomalous diffusion in
complex processes when the stochastic dynamics of the system under study
reaches a steady state (large time intervals). Our procedure based on this
expression for identifying anomalous diffusion and calculating its parameters
in complex processes is applied to the analysis of the dynamics of blinking
fluorescence of quantum dots, X-ray emission from accreting objects, fluid
velocity in Rayleigh-B\'enard convection, and geoelectrical signal for a
seismic area. For all four examples, the proposed interpolation is able to
adequately describe the stochastic part of the experimental difference moment,
which implies that anomalous diffusion manifests itself in these complex
processes. The results of this study make it possible to broaden the range of
complex natural processes in which anomalous diffusion can be identified.
