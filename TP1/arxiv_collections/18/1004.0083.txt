We propose a hybrid (continuous-discrete variable) quantum repeater protocol
for distribution of entanglement over long distances. Starting from entangled
states created by means of single-photon detection, we show how entangled
coherent state superpositions, also known as `Schr\"odinger cat states', can be
generated by means of homodyne detection of light. We show that
near-deterministic entanglement swapping with such states is possible using
only linear optics and homodyne detectors, and we evaluate the performance of
our protocol combining these elements.
