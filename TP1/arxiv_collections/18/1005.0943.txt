We propose a new algorithm MARINLINGA for reverse line graph computation,
i.e., constructing the original graph from a given line graph. Based on the
completely new and simpler principle of link relabeling and endnode
recognition, MARINLINGA does not rely on Whitney's theorem while all previous
algorithms do. MARINLINGA has a worst case complexity of O(N^2), where N
denotes the number of nodes of the line graph. We demonstrate that MARINLINGA
is more time-efficient compared to Roussopoulos's algorithm, which is
well-known for its efficiency.
