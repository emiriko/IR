We study the problem of performing orthogonal qubit measurements
simultaneously. Since these measurements are incompatible, one has to accept
additional imprecision. An optimal joint measurement is the one with the least
possible imprecision. All earlier considerations of this problem have concerned
only joint measurability of observables, while in this work we also take into
account conditional state transformations (i.e., instruments). We characterize
the optimal joint instrument for two orthogonal von Neumann instruments as
being the Luders instrument of the optimal joint observable.
