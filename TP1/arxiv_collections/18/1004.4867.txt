The {\em instability of vacuum energy} in de Sitter space as discussed
recently by Polyakov is argued to be a generic feature when external
gravitational fields are present. It is related to the existence of {\em
forbidden} (by momentum conservation) decays derived in some detail by Bros,
Epstein and Moschella. Some calculations are discussed in a conformally
invariant setting, and a flat space model is presented.
