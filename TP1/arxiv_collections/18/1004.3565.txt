Association rule mining aims to explore large transaction databases for
association rules. Classical Association Rule Mining (ARM) model assumes that
all items have the same significance without taking their weight into account.
It also ignores the difference between the transactions and importance of each
and every itemsets. But, the Weighted Association Rule Mining (WARM) does not
work on databases with only binary attributes. It makes use of the importance
of each itemset and transaction. WARM requires each item to be given weight to
reflect their importance to the user. The weights may correspond to special
promotions on some products, or the profitability of different items. This
research work first focused on a weight assignment based on a directed graph
where nodes denote items and links represent association rules. A generalized
version of HITS is applied to the graph to rank the items, where all nodes and
links are allowed to have weights. This research then uses enhanced HITS
algorithm by developing an online eigenvector calculation method that can
compute the results of mutual reinforcement voting in case of frequent updates.
For Example in Share Market Shares price may go down or up. So we need to
carefully watch the market and our association rule mining has to produce the
items that have undergone frequent changes. These are done by estimating the
upper bound of perturbation and postponing of the updates whenever possible.
Next we prove that enhanced algorithm is more efficient than the original HITS
under the context of dynamic data.
