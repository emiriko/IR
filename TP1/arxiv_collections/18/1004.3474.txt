The large-volume liquid-scintillator detector LENA (Low Energy Neutrino
Astronomy) has been proposed as a next-generation experiment for low-energy
neutrinos. High-precision spectroscopy of solar, Supernova and geo-neutrinos
provides a new access to the otherwise unobservable interiors of Earth, Sun and
heavy stars. Due to the potent background discrimination, the detection of the
Diffuse Supernova Neutrino Background is expected for the first time in LENA.
The sensitivity of the proton lifetime for the decay into Kaon and antineutrino
will be increased by an order of magnitude over existing experimental limits.
Recent studies indicate that liquid-scintillator detectors are capable to
reconstruct neutrino events even at GeV energies, providing the opportunity to
use LENA as far detector in a long-baseline neutrino beam experiment.
