The QCDNUM program numerically solves the evolution equations for parton
densities and fragmentation functions in perturbative QCD. Un-polarised parton
densities can be evolved up to next-to-next-to-leading order in powers of the
strong coupling constant, while polarised densities or fragmentation functions
can be evolved up to next-to-leading order. Other types of evolution can be
accessed by feeding alternative sets of evolution kernels into the program. A
versatile convolution engine provides tools to compute parton luminosities,
cross-sections in hadron-hadron scattering, and deep inelastic structure
functions in the zero-mass scheme or in generalised mass schemes. Input to
these calculations are either the QCDNUM evolved densities, or those read in
from an external parton density repository. Included in the software
distribution are packages to calculate zero-mass structure functions in
un-polarised deep inelastic scattering, and heavy flavour contributions to
these structure functions in the fixed flavour number scheme.
