We treat the problem of the approach to thermal equilibrium by only resorting
to quantum dynamics of an isolated macroscopic system. Inspired by the two
important works in 2009 and in 1929, we have noted that a condition we call
"thermodynamic normality" for a macroscopic observable guarantees the approach
to equilibrium (in the sense that a measurement of the observable at time $t$
almost certainly yields a result close to the corresponding microcanonical
average for a sufficiently long and typical $t$). A crucial point is that we
make no assumptions on the initial state of the system, except that its energy
is distributed close to a certain macroscopic value. We also present three
(rather artificial) models in which the thermodynamic normality can be
established, thus providing concrete examples in which the approach to
equilibrium is rigorously justified. Note that this kind of results which hold
for ANY initial state are never possible in classical systems. We are thus
dealing with a mechanism which is peculiar to quantum systems. The present note
is written in a self-contained (and hopefully readable) manner. It only
requires basic knowledge in quantum physics and equilibrium statistical
mechanics.
