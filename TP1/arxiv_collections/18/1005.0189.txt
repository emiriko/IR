Transport properties of disordered electron system can be characterized by
the conductance, Lyapunov exponent, or level spacing. Two additional
parameters, $K_{11}$ and $\gamma $ were introduced recently which measure the
non-homogeneity of the spatial distribution of the electron inside the sample.
% [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 82}, 4272 (1999)]. For the orthogonal, unitary and
symplectic two dimensional disordered models, we investigate numerically the
system size dependence of these parameters in the diffusive and localized
regime. Obtained size and disorder dependence of $K_{11}$ and $\gamma$ is in
agreement with with single parameter transport theory. In the localized regime,
$\gamma\to 0$ independently on the physical symmetry of the model. In the
diffusive regime, $\gamma$ equals to the symmetry parameter $\beta$. For the
symplectic model we analyze the size dependence of $\gamma$ in the critical
region of the metal-insulator transition and found the non-universal critical
value $\gamma_c$.
