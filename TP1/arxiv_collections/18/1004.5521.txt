The cross sections for exclusive muon pair production in nucleus - nucleus
collisions are calculated and several differential distributions are shown.
Realistic (Fourier transform of charge density) charge form factors of nuclei
are used and the corresponding results are compared with the cross sections
calculated with monopole form factor often used in the literature and discussed
recently in the context of higher-order QED corrections. Absorption effects are
discussed and quantified. The cross sections obtained with realistic form
factors are significantly smaller than those obtained with the monopole form
factor. The effect is bigger for large muon rapidities and/or large muon
transverse momenta. The predictions for the STAR and PHENIX collaboration
measurements at RHIC as well as the ALICE and CMS collaborations at LHC are
presented.
