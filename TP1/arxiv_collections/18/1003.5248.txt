We introduce the concept of spherical (as distinguished from planar)
reflection positivity and use it to obtain a new proof of the sharp constants
in certain cases of the HLS and the logarithmic HLS inequality. Our proofs
relies on an extension of a work by Li and Zhu which characterizes the
minimizing functions of the type $(1+|x|^2)^{-p}$.
