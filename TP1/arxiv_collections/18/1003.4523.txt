The present work is a natural continuation of the previous paper
arXiv:0911.5597. In this work, within the scope of the Generalized Uncertainty
Principle, a model of the high energy deformation for a particular case of
Einstein's equations is developed. In the process a thermodynamic description
of General Relativity is used. And the deformation is understood as an
extension of a particular theory by inclusion of one or several additional
parameters in such a way that the initial theory appears in the limiting
transition. The possibility for the high energy deformation of Einstein's
equations within the scope of both equilibrium thermodynamics and
non-equilibrium thermodynamics is examined
