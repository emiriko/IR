Conventional photovoltaic machinery, including traditional silicone panels,
fails to address efficiency problems. Recent technological advances suggest
less metal-specific reliance, but plastic substrates are bound by
cost-inefficiency. Photovoltaic paint effectively dissociates from metal
dependency and relies on a combination p-n junction diode
principle/thermoelectric effect to generate electrical energy from solar
exposure. Replicating the junction is accomplished via multi-polymer layers of
crystalline-silica water-based paint with ionic solution concentration gradient
overlap, reconstructing the depletion zone and, in thermal respects, construes
the thermoelectric effect via replication of a heavily modified thermocouple.
Experimentation revealed the largest gradient (50%-10%) of ionic solution,
specifically, sodium-chloride solution, per paint solution liter generated the
largest electrical energy yield (Cf. control yielding none). Maintenance of a
functional electro-conductive gradient is achieved with specialized, non-acidic
solution, but the lifespan of the charge is virtually instantaneous. The
experimentation yielded possible exploits for multi-polymer conduction layer
advancement; however, the production of solar-receptive paints replicating the
capture and distribution scheme of solar panels, sans the inflexibility and
limited application. Prospective applications include electrical automobile
augmentation, solar-receptive buildings, and vast tracts of solar farms given
solid initial conditions. Weathering, life expectancy, and storage are
paint-specific. The intentions of sculpting the ideal alternative energy are in
efforts to propose novel mechanisms curbing fossil fuel dependence and arousing
intellectual curiosity and creativity on the many channels converging on
innovative environmental feats.
