While uniform temperature has no effect on equilibrium properties of
hard-core systems, its gradient might substantially change their behaviour. In
particular, in hard-disk system subject to temperature difference $\Delta T$
disks are repelled from the hot boundary of the system and accumulate at the
cold one. Using event-driven molecular dynamics simulations we show that for
sufficiently large $\Delta T$ or coverage ratio $\rho^*$, crystal forms at the
cold boundary. In this spatially inhomogeneous system a significant decrease of
diffusivity of disks clearly marks the stationary interface between liquid and
crystal. Such a behaviour is also supported through calculation of the radial
distribution function and the bond order parameter. Simulations show that for
this nonequilibrium system the equipartition of energy holds and velocity obeys
the Boltzmann distribution.
