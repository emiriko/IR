We compare recent lattice results on fluctuations and correlations of
strangeness, baryon number and electric charge obtained with p4 improved
staggered action with the prediction of hadron resonance gas model. We show
that hadron resonance gas can describe these fluctuations reasonably well if
the hadron properties are as calculated on the lattice.
