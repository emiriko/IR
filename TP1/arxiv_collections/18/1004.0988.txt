we were able to develop a novel method to synthesize Fe-based oxypnictide
superconductors. By using LnAs and FeO as the starting materials and a
ball-milling process prior to solid-state sintering, Tc as high as 50.7 K was
obtained with the sample of Sm 0.85Nd0.15FeAsO0.85F0.15 prepared by sintering
at temperatures as low as 1173 K for times as short as 20 min.
