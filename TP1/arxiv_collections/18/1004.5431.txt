We describe ground states of correlated electron systems in which the
electron fractionalizes into separate quasiparticles which carry its spin and
its charge, and into real Majorana fermions which carry its Fermi statistics.
Such parent states provide a unified theory of previously studied
fractionalized states: their descendants include insulating and conducting
states with neutral spin S=1/2 fermionic spinons, and states with spinless
fermionic charge carriers. We illustrate these ideas on the honeycomb lattice,
with field theories of such states and their phase transitions.
