We investigate the structural conditions for metamagnetism in MnP and related
materials using Density Functional Theory. A magnetic stability plot is
constructed taking into account the two shortest Mn-Mn distances. We find that
a particular Mn-Mn separation plays the dominant role in determining the change
from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic order in such systems. We establish a
good correlation between our calculations and structural and magnetic data from
the literature. Based on our approach it should be possible to find new
Mn-containing alloys that possess field-induced metamagnetism and associated
magnetocaloric effects.
