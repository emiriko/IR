We show how the path-integral formulation of quantum statistical mechanics
can be used to construct practical {\em ab initio} techniques for computing the
chemical potential of molecules adsorbed on surfaces, with full inclusion of
quantum nuclear effects. The techniques we describe are based on the
computation of the potential of mean force on a chosen molecule, and generalise
the techniques developed recently for classical nuclei. We present practical
calculations based on density functional theory with a generalised-gradient
exchange-correlation functional for the case of H$_2$O on the MgO~(001) surface
at low coverage. We note that the very high vibrational frequencies of the
H$_2$O molecule would normally require very large numbers of time slices
(beads) in path-integral calculations, but we show that this requirement can be
dramatically reduced by employing the idea of thermodynamic integration with
respect to the number of beads. The validity and correctness of our
path-integral calculations on the H$_2$O/MgO~(001) system are demonstrated by
supporting calculations on a set of simple model systems for which quantum
contributions to the free energy are known exactly from analytic arguments.
