Ultracapacitors are rapidly being adopted for use for a wide range of
electrical energy storage applications. While ultracapacitors are able to
deliver high rates of charge and discharge, they are limited in the amount of
energy stored. The capacity of ultracapacitors is largely determined by the
electrode material and as a result, research to improve the performance of
electrode materials has dramatically increased. While test methods for packaged
ultracapacitors are well developed, it is often not feasible for the materials
scientist to assemble full sized, packaged cells to test electrode materials.
Methodology to reliably measure a material's performance for ultracapacitor
electrode use is not well standardized with the different techniques currently
being used yielding widely varying results. In this manuscript, we review the
best practice test methods that accurately predict a materials performance, yet
are flexible and quick enough to accommodate a wide range of material sample
types and amounts.
