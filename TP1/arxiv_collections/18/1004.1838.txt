Anyon models can be symmetric under some permutations of their topological
charges. One can then conceive topological defects that, under monodromy,
transform anyons according to a symmetry. We study the realization of such
defects in the toric code model, showing that a process where defects are
braided and fused has the same outcome as if they were Ising anyons. These
ideas can also be applied in the context of topological codes.
