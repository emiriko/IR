Inflation predicts primordial scalar perturbations with a nearly
scale-invariant spectrum and a spectral index approximately unity (the
Harrison--Zel'dovich (HZ) spectrum). The first important step for inflationary
cosmology is to check the consistency of the HZ primordial spectrum with
current observations. Recent analyses have claimed that a HZ primordial
spectrum is excluded at more than 99% c.l.. Here we show that the HZ spectrum
is only marginally disfavored if one considers a more general reionization
scenario. Data from the Planck mission will settle the issue.
