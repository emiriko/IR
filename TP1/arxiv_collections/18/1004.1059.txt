Finite energy sum rules for vector and axial-vector currents are derived in a
thermal medium to provide constraints for the spectral behavior of rho and a1
mesons at nonvanishing temperature and hence to study the tendency toward
chiral symmetry restoration. The parity-mixing ansatz for the rho and a1
spectra, including finite widths, is investigated as a function of temperature.
Characteristic differences between vector and axial-vector channels are
discussed with regard to the implementation of the chiral-symmetry-breaking
scale, 4pi times the pion decay constant, in the sum rule approach.
