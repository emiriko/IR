We propose a new formulation of stochastic thermodynamics for systems
subjected to nonequilibrium constraints (i.e. broken detailed balance at steady
state) and furthermore driven by external time-dependent forces. A splitting of
the second law occurs in this description leading to three second law like
relations. The general results are illustrated on specific solvable models. The
present paper uses a master equation based approach.
