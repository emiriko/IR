We propose a scheme for full Bell state measurement of spin qubits in a
double quantum dot. Our scheme consists of Pauli spin-blockade measurements and
biaxial electron-spin resonance. In order to eliminate the average of the
Zeeman fields, the double quantum dot is designed so that the Land\'e g-factors
of first and second dots satisfy g1=g2 with the use of g-factor engineering.
Thus, we can swap one of the three spin-triplet states for the spin-singlet
state without disturbing the other states. Our study shows that the sequential
spin-to-charge conversions enable us to implement the full Bell state
measurement of electron-spin qubits.
