Eikonal, or ray tracing, methods are commonly used to estimate the
propagation of radio frequency fields in plasmas. While the information gained
from the rays is quite useful, an approximate solution for the fields would
also be valuable, e.g., for comparison to full wave simulations. Such
approximations are often difficult to perform numerically because of the
special care which must be taken to correctly reconstruct the fields near
reflection and focusing caustics. In this paper, we compare the standard
eikonal method for approximating fields to a method based on the dynamics of
wave packets. We compare the approximations resulting from these two methods to
the analytical solution for a lower hybrid wave reflecting from a cutoff. The
algorithm based on wave packets has the advantage that it can correctly deal
with caustics, without any special treatment.
