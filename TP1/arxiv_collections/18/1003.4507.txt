Direct-imaging searches for planets reveal wide orbit planets amenable to
spectroscopy, and their atmospheres represent an important comparison to the
irradiated atmospheres of Hot Jupiters. Using AO integral field spectroscopy of
2M1207 b, the shape of the continuum emission over the J, H, and K bands from
the atmosphere of this young, planetary mass companion is measured in order to
compare with atmospheric and evolutionary models, and objects of similar
temperature in young clusters and the field. The 2M1207 b spectrum has the
highest spectral resolution (R~300-1500) and largest wavelength coverage,
including the first J-band spectrum, for this benchmark object. The high
signal-to-noise of the data allow a clear identification of signatures of low
surface gravity, and comparison with a grid of AMES-Dusty models reveals a
best-fit effective temperature of Teff=1600 K with a preferred surface gravity
of log g=4.5. The J-band flux is depressed relative to nearly all L-type
objects, and the detailed shape of the absorption features across the H-band
exhibit differences from the model predictions. The possible origins of 2M1207
b and its low luminosity are examined with the new data and analysis which
suggest that extinction from a disk with large grains is a viable scenario and
is preferred over scatttering off an optically thick disk. The 2M1207 b
spectrum presents an important comparison for the types of features which may
be present in upcoming spectra of the atmospheres of planets imaged in orbit
around stellar primaries.
