We investigate the competition between spin-supersolidity and phase
separation in a frustrated spin-half model of weakly coupled dimers. We start
by considering systems of hard-core bosons on the square lattice, onto which
the low-energy physics of the herein investigated spin model can be mapped, and
devise a criterion for gauging the interplay between supersolid order and
domain wall formation based on strong coupling arguments. Effective bosonic
models for the spin model are derived via the contractor renormalization (CORE)
algorithm and we propose to combine a self-consistent cluster mean-field
solution with our criterion for the occurrence of phase separation to derive
the phase diagram as a function of frustration and magnetic field. In the limit
of strong frustration, the model is shown to be unstable toward phase
separation, in contradiction with recently published results. However, a region
of stable supersolidity is identified for intermediate frustration, in a
parameter range not investigated so far and of possible experimental relevance.
