An established body of literature shows that a student's affect can be linked
to her epistemological stance [1]. In this literature, the epistemology is
generally taken as a belief or stance toward a discipline, and the affective
stance applies broadly to a discipline or classroom culture. A second, emerging
line of research, however, shows that a student in a given discipline can shift
between multiple locally coherent epistemological stances [2]. To begin uniting
these two bodies of literature, toward the long-term goal of incorporating
affect into fine-grained models of in-the-moment cognitive dynamics, we present
a case study of "Judy", an undergraduate engineering major. We argue that a
fine-grained aspect of Judy's affect, her annoyance at a particular kind of
homework problem, stabilizes a context-dependent epistemological stance she
displays, about an unbridgeable gulf she perceives to exist between real and
ideal circuits.
