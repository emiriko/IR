Quantum Monte Carlo simulations of a two-component Bose mixture of trapped
dipolar atoms of identical masses and dipole moments, provide numerical
evidence of de-mixing at low finite temperatures. De-mixing occurs as a
consequence of quantum statistics, which results in an effective attraction
between like bosons. Spatial separation of two components takes place at low
temperature with the onset of long exchanges of identical particles, underlying
Bose-Einstein condensation of both components. Conversely, at higher
temperature the system is miscible due to the entropy of mixing. Exchanges are
also found to enhance de-mixing in the case of mixtures of non-identical and
distinguishable species.
