We report new cm-wave measurements at five frequencies between 15 and 18GHz
of the continuum emission from the reportedly anomalous "region 4" of the
nearby galaxy NGC6946. We find that the emission in this frequency range is
significantly in excess of that measured at 8.5GHz, but has a spectrum from
15-18GHz consistent with optically thin free-free emission from a compact HII
region. In combination with previously published data we fit four emission
models containing different continuum components using the Bayesian spectrum
analysis package radiospec. These fits show that, in combination with data at
other frequencies, a model with a spinning dust component is slightly preferred
to those that possess better-established emission mechanisms.
