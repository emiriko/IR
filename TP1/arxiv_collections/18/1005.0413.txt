We study the dynamical stability of planetary systems consisting of one
hypothetical terrestrial mass planet ($1 $ or $10 \mearth$) and one massive
planet ($10 \mearth - 10 \mjup$). We consider masses and orbits that cover the
range of observed planetary system architectures (including non-zero initial
eccentricities), determine the stability limit through N-body simulations, and
compare it to the analytic Hill stability boundary. We show that for given
masses and orbits of a two planet system, a single parameter, which can be
calculated analytically, describes the Lagrange stability boundary (no
ejections or exchanges) but which diverges significantly from the Hill
stability boundary. However, we do find that the actual boundary is fractal,
and therefore we also identify a second parameter which demarcates the
transition from stable to unstable evolution. We show the portions of the
habitable zones of $\rho$ CrB, HD 164922, GJ 674, and HD 7924 which can support
a terrestrial planet. These analyses clarify the stability boundaries in
exoplanetary systems and demonstrate that, for most exoplanetary systems,
numerical simulations of the stability of potentially habitable planets are
only necessary over a narrow region of parameter space. Finally we also
identify and provide a catalog of known systems which can host terrestrial
planets in their habitable zones.
