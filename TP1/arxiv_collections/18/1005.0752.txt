We construct a model for delayed electroweak symmetry breaking that takes
place in a cold Universe with T<<100 GeV and which proceeds by a fast quench
rather than by a conventional, slow, phase transition. This is achieved by
coupling the Standard Model Higgs to an additional scalar field. We show that
the quench transition can be made fast enough for successful Cold Electroweak
Baryogenesis, while leaving known electroweak physics unchanged.
