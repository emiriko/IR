We investigate the vector-current correlation Pi_{mu nu} (VCC) in the
presence of a strong external magnetic field (B_0 in the z direction) at low
temperature (T<T^chi_c) with C- and CP-violations, indicated by the nonzero
chiral-chemical potential (mu_chi>0), i.e. the chiral-magnetic effect (CME).
For this purpose, we employ the instanton-vacuum configuration at finite T with
nonzero topological charge (Q_t>0). From the numerical calculations, it turns
out that the longitudinal component of the connected VCC is liner in B_0 and
shows a bump, representing a corresponding vector meson at |Q|=(300~400) MeV
for T=0. The bump becomes enhanced as T increases and the bump position shifts
to a lager |Q| value. In the limit of |Q|->0, the transverse component of the
connected VCC disappears, whereas the longitudinal one remains finite and gets
insensitive to B_0 with respect to T, due to diluting instanton contributions.
Considering a simple collision geometry of HIC and some assumptions on the
induced magnetic field and screening effect, we can estimate the charge
separation (ChS) as a function of centrality using the present results for VCC.
The numerical results show a qualitative agreement with experiments for the
Au+Au and Cu+Cu collisions. These results are almost independent on the source
of CME, instanton or sphaleron, as long as the CME current is linear in B_0.
