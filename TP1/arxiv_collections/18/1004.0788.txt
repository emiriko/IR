Necessary and sufficient conditions for the nonclassicality of bosonic
quantum states are formulated by introducing nonclassicality filters and
nonclassicality quasiprobability distributions. Regular quasiprobabilities are
constructed from characteristic functions which can be directly sampled by
balanced homodyne detection. Their negativities uncover the nonclassical
effects of general quantum states. The method is illustrated by visualizing the
nonclassical nature of a squeezed state.
