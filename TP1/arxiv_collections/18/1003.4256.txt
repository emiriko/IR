We explore how radiative cooling, supernova feedback, cosmic rays and a new
model of the energetic feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) affect the
thermal and kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) power spectra. To do this, we use a
suite of hydrodynamical TreePM-SPH simulations of the cosmic web in large
periodic boxes and tailored higher resolution simulations of individual galaxy
clusters. Our AGN feedback simulations match the recent universal pressure
profile and cluster mass scaling relations of the REXCESS X-ray cluster sample
better than previous analytical or numerical approaches. For multipoles
$\ell\lesssim 2000$, our power spectra with and without enhanced feedback are
similar, suggesting theoretical uncertainties over that range are relatively
small, although current analytic and semi-analytic approaches overestimate this
SZ power. We find the power at high 2000-10000 multipoles which ACT and SPT
probe is sensitive to the feedback prescription, hence can constrain the theory
of intracluster gas, in particular for the highly uncertain redshifts $>0.8$.
The apparent tension between $\sigma_8$ from primary cosmic microwave
background power and from analytic SZ spectra inferred using ACT and SPT data
is lessened with our AGN feedback spectra.
