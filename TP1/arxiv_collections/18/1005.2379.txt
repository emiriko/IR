Recent blazar detections by HESS, MAGIC, and VERITAS suggest that
very-high-energy (VHE, E > 100 GeV) gamma-rays may be produced in most, if not
all, types of blazars, including those that possess intense circumnuclear
radiation fields. In this paper, we investigate the interaction of nuclear VHE
gamma-rays with the circumnuclear radiation fields through gamma-gamma
absorption and pair production, and the subsequent Compton-supported pair
cascades. We have developed a Monte-Carlo code to follow the spatial
development of the cascade in full 3-dimensional geometry, and calculate the
radiative output due to the cascade as a function of viewing angle with respect
to the primary VHE gamma-ray beam (presumably the jet axis of the blazar). We
show that even for relatively weak magnetic fields, the cascades can be
efficiently isotropized, leading to substantial off-axis cascade emission
peaking in the Fermi energy range at detectable levels for nearby radio
galaxies. We demonstrate that this scenario can explain the Fermi flux and
spectrum of the radio galaxy NGC 1275.
