Recently, Komargodski and Seiberg have proposed a new type of supercurrent
multiplet which contains the energy-momentum tensor and the supersymmetry
current consistently. In this paper we study quantum properties of the
supercurrent in renormalizable field theories. We point out that the new
supercurrent gives a quite simple resolution to the classic problem, called the
anomaly puzzle, that the Adler-Bardeen theorem applied to an R-symmetry current
is inconsistent with all order corrections to $\beta$ functions. We propose an
operator equation for the supercurrent in all orders of perturbation theory,
and then perform several consistency checks of the equation. The operator
equation we propose is consisitent with the one proposed by Shifman and
Vainshtein, if we take some care in interpreting the meaning of non-conserved
currents.
