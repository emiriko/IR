We consider a system composed of a stack of weakly Josephson coupled
superfluid layers with c-axis disorder in the form of random superfluid
stiffnesses and vortex fugacities in each layer as well as random inter-layer
coupling strengths. In the absence of disorder this system has a 3D XY type
superfluid-normal phase transition as a function of temperature. We develop a
functional renormalization group to treat the effects of disorder, and
demonstrate that the disorder results in the smearing of the superfluid normal
phase transition via the formation of a Griffiths phase. Remarkably, in the
Griffiths phase, the emergent power-law distribution of the inter-layer
couplings gives rise to sliding Griffiths superfluid, with an anisotropic
critical current, and with a finite stiffness in a-b direction along the
layers, and a vanishing stiffness perpendicular to it.
