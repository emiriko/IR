The zigzag edge graphene nanoribbon, which is an antiferromagnetic insulator,
is found from the density-function theory calculation to display a robust Dirac
point after N and B doping at the zigzag edge. More interestingly, we found
that the robust Dirac point is a common feature of the honeycomb structure
nanoribbon with appropriate edge sites. The zigzag edge honeycomb nanoribbon is
therefore expected to provide a very useful platform for material design and
development.
