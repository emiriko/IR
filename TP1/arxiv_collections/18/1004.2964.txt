We derive and study a spin one-half Hamiltonian on a honeycomb lattice
describing the exchange interactions between Ir$^{4+}$ ions in a family of
layered iridates $A_2$IrO$_3$ ($A$=Li,Na). Depending on the microscopic
parameters, the Hamiltonian interpolates between the Heisenberg and exactly
solvable Kitaev models. Exact diagonalization and a complementary spin-wave
analysis reveal the presence of an extended spin-liquid phase near the Kitaev
limit and a conventional N\'eel state close to the Heisenberg limit. The two
phases are separated by an unusual stripy antiferromagnetic state, which is the
exact ground state of the model at the midpoint between two limits.
