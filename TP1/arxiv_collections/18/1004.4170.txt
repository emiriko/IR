Metaheuristic algorithms such as particle swarm optimization, firefly
algorithm and harmony search are now becoming powerful methods for solving many
tough optimization problems. In this paper, we propose a new metaheuristic
method, the Bat Algorithm, based on the echolocation behaviour of bats. We also
intend to combine the advantages of existing algorithms into the new bat
algorithm. After a detailed formulation and explanation of its implementation,
we will then compare the proposed algorithm with other existing algorithms,
including genetic algorithms and particle swarm optimization. Simulations show
that the proposed algorithm seems much superior to other algorithms, and
further studies are also discussed.
