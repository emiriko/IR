This paper deals with the entanglement, as quantified by the negativity, of
pure quantum states chosen at random from the invariant Haar measure. We show
that it is a constant (0.72037) multiple of the maximum possible entanglement.
In line with the results based on the concentration of measure, we find
evidence that the convergence to the final value is exponentially fast. We
compare the analytically calculated mean and standard deviation with those
calculated numerically for pure states generated via pseudorandom unitary
matrices proposed by Emerson et. al. [Science, 302, 3098, (2003)]. Finally, we
draw some novel conclusions about the geometry of quantum states based on our
result.
