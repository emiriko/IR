By performing a series of two-dimensional, special relativistic
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations, we study signatures of gravitational
waves (GWs) in the magnetohydrodynamically-driven core-collapse supernovae. In
order to extract the gravitational waveforms, we present a stress formula
including contributions both from magnetic fields and special relativistic
corrections. By changing the precollapse magnetic fields and initial angular
momentum distributions parametrically, we compute twelve models. As for the
microphysics, a realistic equation of state is employed and the neutrino
cooling is taken into account via a multiflavor neutrino leakage scheme.
  With these computations, we find that the total GW amplitudes show a
monotonic increase after bounce for models with a strong precollapse magnetic
field ($10^{12}$G) also with a rapid rotation imposed.
  We show that this trend stems both from the kinetic contribution of MHD
outflows with large radial velocities and also from the magnetic contribution
dominated by the toroidal magnetic fields that predominantly trigger MHD
explosions. For models with weaker initial magnetic fields, the total GW
amplitudes after bounce stay almost zero, because the contribution from the
magnetic fields cancels with the one from the hydrodynamic counterpart.
  These features can be clearly understood with a careful analysis on the
explosion dynamics. We point out that the GW signals with the increasing trend,
possibly visible to the next-generation detectors for a Galactic supernova,
would be associated with MHD explosions with the explosion energies exceeding
$10^{51}$ erg.
