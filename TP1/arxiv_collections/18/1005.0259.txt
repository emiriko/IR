The electron mediated exchange interaction between local spins adsorbed on
two-dimensional surface is studied under non-equilibrium conditions. The
effective spin-spin interaction is found to depend both on the
spin-polarization of the substrate and the excitation spectrum of the local
spins. For spatially anisotropic spin-polarization of the substrate, the
spatial dependence of the interaction comprise components decaying as
sin(2k_FR)/(2k_FR) and sin(2k_FR)/(2k_FR)^2.
