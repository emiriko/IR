We report one of the most accurate measurements of the three-dimensional
large-scale galaxy power spectrum achieved to date, using 56,159 redshifts of
bright emission-line galaxies at effective redshift z=0.6 from the WiggleZ Dark
Energy Survey at the Anglo-Australian Telescope. We describe in detail how we
construct the survey selection function allowing for the varying target
completeness and redshift completeness. We measure the total power with an
accuracy of approximately 5% in wavenumber bands of dk=0.01 h/Mpc. A model
power spectrum including non-linear corrections, combined with a linear galaxy
bias factor and a simple model for redshift-space distortions, provides a good
fit to our data for scales k < 0.4 h/Mpc. The large-scale shape of the power
spectrum is consistent with the best-fitting matter and baryon densities
determined by observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation. By
splitting the power spectrum measurement as a function of tangential and radial
wavenumbers we delineate the characteristic imprint of peculiar velocities. We
use these to determine the growth rate of structure as a function of redshift
in the range 0.4 < z < 0.8, including a data point at z=0.78 with an accuracy
of 20%. Our growth rate measurements are a close match to the self-consistent
prediction of the LCDM model. The WiggleZ Survey data will allow a wide range
of investigations into the cosmological model, cosmic expansion and growth
history, topology of cosmic structure, and Gaussianity of the initial
conditions. Our calculation of the survey selection function will be released
at a future date via our website wigglez.swin.edu.au.
