Inspired by the AdS/CFT correspondence we propose a new duality that allow
the study of strongly coupled field theories living in a 2+1 conical
space-time. Solving the 4-d Einstein equations in the presence of an infinite
static string and negative cosmological constant we obtain a conical AdS4
space-time whose boundary is identified with the 2+1 cone found by Deser,
Jackiw and 't Hooft. Using the AdS4/CFT3 correspondence we calculate retarded
Green's functions of scalar operators living in the cone.
