The direct detection of exoplanets has been the subject of intensive research
in the recent years. Data obtained with future high-contrast imaging
instruments optimized for giant planets direct detection are strongly limited
by the speckle noise. Specific observing strategies and data analysis methods,
such as angular and spectral differential imaging, are required to attenuate
the noise level and possibly detect the faint planet flux. Even though these
methods are very efficient at suppressing the speckles, the photometry of the
faint planets is dominated by the speckle residuals. The determination of the
effective temperature and surface gravity of the detected planets from
photometric measurements in different bands is then limited by the photometric
error on the planet flux. In this work we investigate this photometric error
and the consequences on the determination of the physical parameters of the
detected planets. We perform detailed end-to-end simulation with the CAOS-based
Software Package for SPHERE to obtain realistic data representing typical
observing sequences in Y, J, H and Ks bands with a high contrast imager. The
simulated data are used to measure the photometric accuracy as a function of
contrast for planets detected with angular and spectral+angular differential
methods. We apply this empirical accuracy to study the characterization
capabilities of a high-contrast differential imager. We show that the expected
photometric performances will allow the detection and characterization of
exoplanets down to the Jupiter mass at angular separations of 1.0" and 0.2"
respectively around high mass and low mass stars with 2 observations in
different filter pairs. We also show that the determination of the planets
physical parameters from photometric measurements in different filter pairs is
essentialy limited by the error on the determination of the surface gravity.
