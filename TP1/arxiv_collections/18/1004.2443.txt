Intermediate between the prestellar and Class 0 protostellar phases, the
first core is a quasi-equilibrium hydrostatic object with a short lifetime and
an extremely low luminosity. Recent MHD simulations suggest that the first core
can even drive a molecular outflow before the formation of the second core
(i.e., protostar). Using the Submillimeter Array and the Spitzer Space
Telescope, we present high angular resolution observations towards the embedded
dense core IRS2E in L1448. We find that source L1448 IRS2E is not visible in
the sensitive Spitzer infrared images (at wavelengths from 3.6 to 70 um), and
has weak (sub-)millimeter dust continuum emission. Consequently, this source
has an extremely low bolometric luminosity (< 0.1 L_sun). Infrared and
(sub-)millimeter observations clearly show an outflow emanating from this
source; L1448 IRS2E represents thus far the lowest luminosity source known to
be driving a molecular outflow. Comparisons with prestellar cores and Class 0
protostars suggest that L1448 IRS2E is more evolved than prestellar cores but
less evolved than Class 0 protostars, i.e., at a stage intermediate between
prestellar cores and Class 0 protostars. All these results are consistent with
the theoretical predictions of the radiative/magneto hydrodynamical
simulations, making L1448 IRS2E the most promising candidate of the first
hydrostatic core revealed so far.
