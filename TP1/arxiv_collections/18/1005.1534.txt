A detailed observation of microglitch phenomenon in relatively slow radio
pulsars is presented. Our analyses for these small amplitude jumps in pulse
rotation frequency ($\nu$) and/or spin down rate ($\dot{\nu}$) combine the
traditional manual detection method (which hinges on careful visual inspections
of the residuals of pulse phase residuals) and a new, and perhaps more
objective, automated search technique (which exploits the power of the
computer, rather than the eyes, for resolving discrete events in pulsar spin
parameters). The results of the analyses of a sample of 26 radio pulsars reveal
that: (i) only 20 pulsars exhibit significant fluctuations in their arrival
times to be considered suitable for meaningful microglitch analyses; (ii) a
phenomenal 299 microglitch events were identified in $\nu$ and/or $\dot{\nu}$:
266 of these events were found to be simultaneously significant in $\nu$ and
$\dot{\nu}$, while 19 and 14 were noticeable only in $\nu$ and $\dot{\nu}$,
respectively; (iii) irrespective of sign, the microglitches have fractional
sizes which cover about 3 orders of magnitude in $\nu$ and $\dot{\nu}$
($10^{-11} < |\Delta{\nu}/\nu| < 2.0\times10^{-8}$ and $5.0\times10^{-5} <
|\Delta{\dot{\nu}}/\dot{\nu}| < 2.0\times10^{-2}$) with median values as
$0.78\times10^{-9}$ and $0.36\times10^{-3}$, respectively.
