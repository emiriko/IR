Arnold showed that the Euler equations of an ideal fluid describe geodesics
on the Lie algebra of incompressible vector fields. We generalize this to
fluids with dissipation and Gaussian random forcing. The dynamics is determined
by the structure constants of a Lie algebra, along with inner products defining
kinetic energy, Ohmic dissipation and the covariance of the forces. This allows
us to construct tractable toy models for fluid mechanics with a finite number
of degrees of freedom. We solve one of them to show how symmetries can be
broken spontaneously.In another direction, we derive a deterministic equation
that describes the most likely path connecting two points in the phase space of
a randomly forced system: this is a WKB approximation to the
Fokker-Plank-Kramer equation, analogous to the instantons of quantum theory.
Applied to hydrodynamics, we derive a PDE system for Navier-Stokes instantons.
