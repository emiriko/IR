We present results of meson and baryon spectroscopy using the Chirally
Improved Dirac operator on lattices of size 16**3 x 32 with two mass-degenerate
light sea quarks. Three ensembles with pion masses of 322(5), 470(4) and 525(7)
MeV and lattice spacings close to 0.15 fm are investigated. Results on ground
and excited states for several channels are given, including spin two mesons
and hadrons with strange valence quarks. The analysis of the states is done
with the variational method, including two kinds of Gaussian sources and
derivative sources. We obtain several ground states fairly precisely and find
radial excitations in various channels. Excited baryon results seem to suffer
from finite size effects, in particular at small pion masses. We discuss the
possible appearance of scattering states in various channels, considering
masses and eigenvectors. Partially quenched results in the scalar channel
suggest the presence of a 2-particle state, however, in most channels we cannot
identify them. Where available, we compare our results to results of quenched
simulations using the same action.
