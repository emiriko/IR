We analyze a simple asset transfer model in which the transfer amount is a
fixed fraction $f$ of the giver's wealth. The model is analyzed in a new way by
Laplace transforming the master equation, solving it analytically and
numerically for the steady-state distribution, and exploring the solutions for
various values of $f\in(0,1)$. The Laplace transform analysis is superior to
agent-based simulations as it does not depend on the number of agents, enabling
us to study entropy and inequality in regimes that are costly to address with
simulations. We demonstrate that Boltzmann entropy is not a suitable (e.g.
non-monotonic) measure of disorder in a multiplicative asset transfer system
and suggest an asymmetric stochastic process that is equivalent to the asset
transfer model.
