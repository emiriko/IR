We study small-amplitude steady water waves with multiple critical layers.
Those are rotational two-dimensional gravity-waves propagating over a perfect
fluid of finite depth. It is found that arbitrarily many critical layers with
cat's-eye vortices are possible, with different structure at different levels
within the fluid. The corresponding vorticity depends linearly on the stream
function.
