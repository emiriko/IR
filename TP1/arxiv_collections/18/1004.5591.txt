The theoretical description of strongly correlated quantum systems out of
equilibrium presents several challenges and a number of open questions persist.
In this paper we focus on nonlinear electronic transport through a quantum dot
maintained at finite bias using a concept introduced by Hershfield [Phys. Rev.
Lett. 70, 2134 (1993)] whereby one can express such nonequilibrium quantum
impurity models in terms of the system's Lippmann-Schwinger operators. These
scattering operators allow one to reformulate the nonequilibrium problem as an
effective equilibrium problem associated with a modified Hamiltonian, thus
facilitating the implementation of equilibrium many-body techniques. We provide
an alternative derivation of the effective Hamiltonian of Hershfield using the
concept of an "open system". Furthermore, we demonstrate the equivalence
between observables computed using the Schwinger-Keldysh framework and the
effective equilibrium approach. For the study of transport, the non-equilibrium
spectral function of the dot is identified as the quantity of principal
interest and we derive general expressions for the current (the Meir-Wingreen
formula) and the charge occupation of the dot. We introduce a finite
temperature formalism which is used as a tool for computing real time Green's
functions. In a companion paper we elucidate a generic scheme for perturbative
calculations of interacting models, with particular reference to the Anderson
model.
