The Kohn variational principle and the hyperspherical harmonic technique are
applied to study p-3He elastic scattering at low energies. Preliminary results
obtained using several interaction models are reported. The calculations are
compared to a recent phase shift analysis performed at the Triangle University
Nuclear Laboratory and to the available experimental data. Using a
three-nucleon interaction derived from chiral perturbation theory at N2LO, we
have found a noticeable reduction of the discrepancy observed for the A_y
observable.
