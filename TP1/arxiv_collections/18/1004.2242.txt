We present a new global optimization algorithm in which the influence of the
leaders in social groups is used as an inspiration for the evolutionary
technique which is designed into a group architecture. To demonstrate the
efficiency of the method, a standard suite of single and multidimensional
optimization functions along with the energies and the geometric structures of
Lennard-Jones clusters are given as well as the application of the algorithm on
quantum circuit design problems. We show that as an improvement over previous
methods, the algorithm scales as N^2.5 for the Lennard-Jones clusters of
N-particles. In addition, an efficient circuit design is shown for two qubit
Grover search algorithm which is a quantum algorithm providing quadratic
speed-up over the classical counterpart.
