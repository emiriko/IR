The ratio of males to females in a population is a meaningful characteristic
of sexual species. The reason for this biological property to be available to
the observers of nature seems to be a question never asked. Introducing the
notion of historically adapted populations as global minimizers of maintenance
cost functions, we propose a theoretical explanation for the reported stability
of this feature. This mathematical formulation suggests that sex ratio could be
considered as an indirect result shaped by the antagonism between the size of
the population and the finiteness of resources.
