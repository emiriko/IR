A phase $\Delta \Phi$ between amplitudes for $B^0 \to K^{*0} \pi^0$ and $B^0
\to K^{*+} \pi^-$ plays a crucial role in a method for constraining
Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) parameters. We present a general argument for
destructive interference between amplitudes for $B^0 \to K^{*+} \pi^-$ and $B^0
\to K^{*0} \pi^0$ forming together a smaller $I(K^* \pi) = 3/2$ amplitude.
Applying flavor SU(3) and allowing for conservative theoretical uncertainties,
we obtain lower limits on $|\Delta \Phi|$ and its charge-conjugate. Values of
these two phases favored by the BaBar Collaboration are in good agreement with
our bounds.
