The starting point for this work is an identity that relates the number of
minimal matrices with prescribed 1-marginals and coefficient sequence to a
linear combination of Kronecker coefficients. In this paper we provide a
bijection that realizes combinatorially this identity. As a consequence we
obtain an algorithm that to each minimal matrix associates a minimal component,
with respect to the dominance order, in a Kronecker product, and a
combinatorial description of the corresponding Kronecker coefficient in terms
of minimal matrices and tableau insertion. Our bijection follows from a
generalization of the dual RSK correspondence to 3-dimensional binary matrices,
which we state and prove. With the same tools we also obtain a generalization
of the RSK correspondence to 3-dimensional integer matrices.
