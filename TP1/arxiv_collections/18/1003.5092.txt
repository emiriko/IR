The universe has evolved to be a filamentary web of galaxies and large
inter-galactic zones of space without matter. The Euclidian nature of the
universe indicates that it is not a 3D manifold within space with an extra
spatial dimension. This justifies our assumption that the FRW space-time
evolves in the inter-galactic zones like separate FRW universes. Thus we do not
necessarily have to consider the entirety of the universe. Our assumption
enables us to prove that: -In the current epoch, space in the intergalactic
zones expands at a constant rate. -In and around galaxies, space expansion is
inhibited. With these results, and an extended Gauss Theorem for a deformed
space, we show that there is no need for the hypothetical Dark Energy (DE) and
Dark Matter (DM) to explain phenomena attributed to them.
