Strongly coupled gauge systems with many fermions are important in many
phenomenological models. I use the 2-lattice matching Monte Carlo
renormalization group method to study the fixed point structure and critical
indexes of SU(3) gauge models with 8 and 12 flavors of fundamental fermions.
With an improved renormalization group block transformation I am able to
connect the perturbative and confining regimes of the N_f=8 flavor system, thus
verifying its QCD-like nature. With N_f=12 flavors the data favor the existence
of an infrared fixed point and conformal phase, though the results are also
consistent with very slow walking. I measure the anomalous mass dimension in
both systems at several gauge couplings and find that they are barely different
from the free field value.
