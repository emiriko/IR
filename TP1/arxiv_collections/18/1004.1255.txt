We apply the tunneling process of charged massive particles through the
quantum horizon of a Reissner-Nordstrom black hole in a new noncommutative
gravity scenario. In this model, the tunneling amplitude on account of
noncommutativity influences in the context of coordinate coherent states is
modified. Our calculation points out that the emission rate satisfies the first
law of black hole thermodynamics and is consistent with an underlying unitary
theory.
