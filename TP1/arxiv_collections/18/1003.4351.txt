Cygnus X-3 is one of the brightest X-ray and radio sources in the Galaxy, and
is well known for its erratic behaviour in X-rays as well as in the radio,
occasionally producing major radio flares associated with relativistic
ejections. However, even after many years of observations in various wavelength
bands Cyg X-3 still eludes clear physical understanding. Studying different
emission bands simultaneously in microquasars has proved to be a fruitful
approach towards understanding these systems, especially by shedding light on
the accretion disc/jet connection. We continue this legacy by constructing a
hardness-intensity diagram (HID) from archival Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer data
and linking simultaneous radio observations to it. We find that surprisingly
Cyg X-3 sketches a similar shape in the HID to that seen in other transient
black hole X-ray binaries during outburst but with distinct differences.
Together with the results of this analysis and previous studies of Cyg X-3 we
conclude that the X-ray states can be assigned to six distinct states. This
categorization relies heavily on the simultaneous radio observations and we
identify one new X-ray state, the hypersoft state, similar to the ultrasoft
state, which is associated to the quenched radio state during which there is no
or very faint radio emission. Recent observations of GeV flux observed from Cyg
X-3 (Tavani et al. 2009; Fermi LAT Collaboration et al. 2009) during a soft
X-ray and/or radio quenched state at the onset of a major radio flare hint that
a very energetic process is at work during this time, which is also when the
hypersoft X-ray state is observed. In addition, Cyg X-3 shows flaring with a
wide range of hardness.
