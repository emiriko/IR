In 2003, Haglund's {\sf bounce} statistic gave the first combinatorial
interpretation of the $q,t$-Catalan numbers and the Hilbert series of diagonal
harmonics. In this paper we propose a new combinatorial interpretation in terms
of the affine Weyl group of type $A$. In particular, we define two statistics
on affine permutations; one in terms of the Shi hyperplane arrangement, and one
in terms of a new arrangement - which we call the Ish arrangement. We prove
that our statistics are equivalent to the {\sf area'} and {\sf bounce}
statistics of Haglund and Loehr. In this setting, we observe that {\sf bounce}
is naturally expressed as a statistic on the root lattice. We extend our
statistics in two directions: to "extended" Shi arrangements and to the bounded
chambers of these arrangements. This leads to a (conjectural) combinatorial
interpretation for all integral powers of the Bergeron-Garsia nabla operator
applied to the elementary symmetric functions.
