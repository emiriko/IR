The effect of leverage on liquidity is a tool for analysing the level of
liquidity for a given production process. It measures the sensitivity of the
level of liquidity that results from changes in the volume of production and
unit operating margin. A commercial activity is liquid at the moment when all
costs are covered by revenues. However, not all of the cash flows from
production influence liquidity levels. The estimated costs do not directly
influence the level of liquidity. Therefore, two indicators are to be taken
into consideration: the elasticity of ongoing liquidity - fixed costs include
estimated costs, and, the elasticity of immediate liquidity - fixed costs only
include costs that are payable. The coefficients of leverage of ongoing
liquidity and of leverage of immediate liquidity in relation to the operating
margin have a behaviour that is identical to that calculated in relation to
production. If the productive capacity remains unchanged, the regulation of the
change in elasticity of the costs and of its influence on the unitary operating
margin is the sole parameter available to the entrepreneur to maintain the
liquidity of the company at the desired level. But, if the productive capacity
is variable, the entrepreneur can use the volume of sales to control liquidity
but then the transformation of the production process must be analysed so as to
adjust the relevant elements to retain in the operating structure the degree of
liquidity wished for.
