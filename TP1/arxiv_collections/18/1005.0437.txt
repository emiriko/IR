Recent research on multiple kernel learning has lead to a number of
approaches for combining kernels in regularized risk minimization. The proposed
approaches include different formulations of objectives and varying
regularization strategies. In this paper we present a unifying general
optimization criterion for multiple kernel learning and show how existing
formulations are subsumed as special cases. We also derive the criterion's dual
representation, which is suitable for general smooth optimization algorithms.
Finally, we evaluate multiple kernel learning in this framework analytically
using a Rademacher complexity bound on the generalization error and empirically
in a set of experiments.
