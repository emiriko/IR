Secure quantum key distribution can be achieved with an imperfect
single-photon source through implementing the decoy-state method. However,
security of all those theoretical results of decoy-state method based on the
original framework raised by Hwang needs monitoring the source state very
carefully, because the elementary proposition that the counting rates of the
same state from different sources are equal does not hold in general when the
source is unstable. Source intensity monitoring greatly decreases the system
efficiency. Here without using Hwang's proposition for stable source, we
present a sufficient condition for a secure decoy-state protocol without
monitoring the source intensity. The passive 2-intensity protocol proposed by
Adachi, Yamamoto, Koashi, and Imoto(AYKI) (Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 180503 (2007)
satisfies the condition. Therefore, the protocol can always work securely
without monitoring the source state or switching the source intensity. We also
show that our result can greatly improve the key rate of the 3-intensity
protocol with a fluctuating coherent-state source.
