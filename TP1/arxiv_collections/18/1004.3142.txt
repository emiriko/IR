Some problems with theoretical foundations of bottom-up holographic models
are briefly discussed. It is pointed out that the spectroscopic aspects of
these models in principle do not require the AdS/CFT prescriptions and may be
interpreted as just an alternative language expressing the phenomenology of QCD
sum rules in the large-Nc limit. A general recipe for incorporation of the
chiral symmetry breaking scale into the soft-wall holographic models is
proposed.
