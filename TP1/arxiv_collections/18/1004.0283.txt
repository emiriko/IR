We prove a theorem that shows the degeneracy of many-body states depends on
total particle number and flux filling ratio, for particles in a periodic
lattice and under a uniform magnetic field. Non-interacting fermions and weakly
interacting bosons are given as two examples. For the later case, this
phenomena can also be understood in terms of destructive quantum interferences
of multiple symmetry related tunneling paths between classical energy minima,
which is reminiscent of the spin-parity effect discovered in magnetic molecular
cluster. We also show that the quantum ground state of a mesoscopic number of
bosons in this system is not a simple mean-field state but a fragmented state
even for very weak interactions.
