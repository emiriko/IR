Concentrations of matter, such as galaxies and galactic clusters, originated
as very small density fluctuations in the early universe. The existence of
galaxy clusters and super-clusters suggests that a natural scale for the matter
distribution may not exist. A point of controversy is whether the distribution
is fractal and, if so, over what range of scales. One-dimensional models
demonstrate that the important dynamics for cluster formation occur in the
position-velocity plane. Here the development of scaling behavior and
multifractal geometry is investigated for a family of one-dimensional models
for three different, scale-free, initial conditions. The methodology employed
includes: 1) The derivation of explicit solutions for the gravitational
potential and field for a one-dimensional system with periodic boundary
conditions (Ewald sums for one dimension); 2) The development of a procedure
for obtaining scale-free initial conditions for the growing mode in phase space
for an arbitrary power-law index; 3) The evaluation of power spectra,
correlation functions, and generalized fractal dimensions at different stages
of the system evolution. It is shown that a simple analytic representation of
the power spectra captures the main features of the evolution, including the
correct time dependence of the crossover from the linear to nonlinear regime
and the transition from regular to fractal geometry. A possible physical
mechanism for understanding the self-similar evolution is introduced. It is
shown that hierarchical cluster formation depends both on the model and the
initial power spectrum. Under special circumstances a simple relation between
the power spectrum, correlation function, and correlation dimension in the
highly nonlinear regime is confirmed.
