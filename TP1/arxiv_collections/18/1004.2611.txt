We present a calculation of spectroscopic factors within coupled-cluster
theory. Our derivation of algebraic equations for the one-body overlap
functions are based on coupled-cluster equation-of-motion solutions for the
ground and excited states of the doubly magic nucleus with mass number $A$ and
the odd-mass neighbor with mass $A-1$. As a proof-of-principle calculation, we
consider $^{16}$O and the odd neighbors $^{15}$O and $^{15}$N, and compute the
spectroscopic factor for nucleon removal from $^{16}$O. We employ a
renormalized low-momentum interaction of the $V_{\mathrm{low-}k}$ type derived
from a chiral interaction at next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order. We study
the sensitivity of our results by variation of the momentum cutoff, and then
discuss the treatment of the center of mass.
