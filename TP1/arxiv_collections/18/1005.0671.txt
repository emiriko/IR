We survey the numerical stability of some fast algorithms for solving systems
of linear equations and linear least squares problems with a low
displacement-rank structure. For example, the matrices involved may be Toeplitz
or Hankel. We consider algorithms which incorporate pivoting without destroying
the structure, and describe some recent results on the stability of these
algorithms. We also compare these results with the corresponding stability
results for the well known algorithms of Schur/Bareiss and Levinson, and for
algorithms based on the semi-normal equations.
