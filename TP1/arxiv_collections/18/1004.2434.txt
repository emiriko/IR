The multiuser communication channel, in which multiple users exchange
information with the help of a relay terminal, termed the multi-way relay
channel (mRC), is introduced. In this model, multiple interfering clusters of
users communicate simultaneously, where the users within the same cluster wish
to exchange messages among themselves. It is assumed that the users cannot
receive each other's signals directly, and hence the relay terminal in this
model is the enabler of communication. In particular, restricted encoders,
which ignore the received channel output and use only the corresponding
messages for generating the channel input, are considered. Achievable rate
regions and an outer bound are characterized for the Gaussian mRC, and their
comparison is presented in terms of exchange rates in a symmetric Gaussian
network scenario. It is shown that the compress-and-forward (CF) protocol
achieves exchange rates within a constant bit offset of the exchange capacity
independent of the power constraints of the terminals in the network. A finite
bit gap between the exchange rates achieved by the CF and the
amplify-and-forward (AF) protocols is also shown. The two special cases of the
mRC, the full data exchange model, in which every user wants to receive
messages of all other users, and the pairwise data exchange model which
consists of multiple two-way relay channels, are investigated in detail. In
particular for the pairwise data exchange model, in addition to the proposed
random coding based achievable schemes, a nested lattice coding based scheme is
also presented and is shown to achieve exchange rates within a constant bit gap
of the exchange capacity.
