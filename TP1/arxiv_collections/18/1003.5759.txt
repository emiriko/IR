We present new measurements of the energy spectra of cosmic-ray (CR) nuclei
from the second flight of the balloon-borne experiment CREAM (Cosmic Ray
Energetics And Mass). The instrument (CREAM-II) was comprised of detectors
based on different techniques (Cherenkov light, specific ionization in
scintillators and silicon sensors) to provide a redundant charge identification
and a thin ionization calorimeter capable of measuring the energy of cosmic
rays up to several hundreds of TeV. The data analysis is described and the
individual energy spectra of C, O, Ne, Mg, Si and Fe are reported up to ~ 10^14
eV. The spectral shape looks nearly the same for all the primary elements and
can be expressed as a power law in energy E^{-2.66+/-0.04}. The nitrogen
absolute intensity in the energy range 100-800 GeV/n is also measured.
