Measurements were made to determine the density of rubidium dimer vapor in
paraffin-coated cells. The number density of dimers and atoms in similar
paraffin-coated and uncoated cells was measured by optical spectroscopy. Due to
the relatively low melting point of paraffin, a limited temperature range of
43-80 deg C was explored, with the lower end corresponding to a dimer density
of less than 10^7 cm^(-3). With one-minute integration time, a sensitivity to
dimer number density of better than 10^6 cm^(-3) was achieved. No significant
difference in dimer density was observed between the cells.
