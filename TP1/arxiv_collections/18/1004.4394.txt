It has been reported that damage of genome in a living cell by ionizing
radiation is about one-third direct and two-thirds indirect. The former which
has been introduced in our last paper, concerns direct energy deposition and
ionizing reactions in the biomolecules; the latter results from radiation
induced reactive species (mainly radicals) in the medium (mainly water)
surrounding the biomolecules. In this review, a short description of ion
implantation induced radical formation in water is presented. Then we summarize
the aqueous radical reaction chemistry of DNA, protein and their components,
followed by a brief introduction of biomolecular damage induced by secondary
particles (ions and electron). Some downstream biological effects are also
discussed.
