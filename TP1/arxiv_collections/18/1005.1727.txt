The purpose of this paper is to enhance a correspondence between the dynamics
of the differential equations $\dot y(t)=g(y(t))$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$ and those
of the parabolic equations $\dot u=\Delta u +f(x,u,\nabla u)$ on a bounded
domain $\Omega$. We give details on the similarities of these dynamics in the
cases $d=1$, $d=2$ and $d\geq 3$ and in the corresponding cases $\Omega=(0,1)$,
$\Omega=\mathbb{T}^1$ and dim($\Omega$)$\geq 2$ respectively. In addition to
the beauty of such a correspondence, this could serve as a guideline for future
research on the dynamics of parabolic equations.
