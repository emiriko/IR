Recent observations of luminous Type IIn supernovae (SNe) provide compelling
evidence that massive circumstellar shells surround their progenitors. In this
paper we investigate how the properties of such shells influence the SN
lightcurve by conducting numerical simulations of the interaction between an
expanding SN and a circumstellar shell ejected a few years prior to core
collapse. Our parameter study explores how the emergent luminosity depends on a
range of circumstellar shell masses, velocities, geometries, and wind mass-loss
rates, as well as variations in the SN mass and energy. We find that the shell
mass is the most important parameter, in the sense that higher shell masses (or
higher ratios of M_shell/M_SN) lead to higher peak luminosities and higher
efficiencies in converting shock energy into visual light. Lower mass shells
can also cause high peak luminosities if the shell is slow or if the SN ejecta
are very fast, but only for a short time. Sustaining a high luminosity for
durations of more than 100 days requires massive circumstellar shells of order
10 M_sun or more. This reaffirms previous comparisons between pre-SN shells and
shells produced by giant eruptions of luminous blue variables (LBVs), although
the physical mechanism responsible for these outbursts remains uncertain. The
lightcurve shape and observed shell velocity can help diagnose the approximate
size and density of the circumstellar shell, and it may be possible to
distinguish between spherical and bipolar shells with multi-wavelength
lightcurves. These models are merely illustrative. One can, of course, achieve
even higher luminosities and longer duration light curves from interaction by
increasing the explosion energy and shell mass beyond values adopted here.
