It is shown that a bounded quiver algebra having a 2-truncated oriented cycle
is of infinite Hochschild homology dimension and global dimension, which
generalizes a result of Solotar and Vigu\'{e}-Poirrier to nonlocal ungraded
algebras having a 2-truncated oriented cycle of arbitrary length. Therefore, a
bounded quiver algebra of finite global dimension has no 2-truncated oriented
cycles. Note that the well-known "no loops conjecture", which has been proved
to be true already, says that a bounded quiver algebra of finite global
dimension has no loops, i.e., truncated oriented cycles of length 1. Moreover,
it is shown that a monomial algebra having a truncated oriented cycle is of
infinite Hochschild homology dimension and global dimension. Consequently, a
monomial algebra of finite global dimension has no truncated oriented cycles.
