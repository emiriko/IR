In this paper the existence of an absolute minimizer for a functional \[
F(u,\Omega) = \underset{x \in \Omega}{\text{ess sup}} \, f (x, u(x), Du(x)) \]
is proved by using Perron's method. The function is assumed to be quasiconvex
and uniformly coercive. This completes the result by Champion, De Pascale and
Prinari.
