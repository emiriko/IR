We study the production of a single charged slepton in association with a top
quark in a R-parity violating supersymmetric model with lepton number violating
interactions at the Large Hadron Collider. We find that the longitudinal
polarization asymmetry of the top quark in such a production mode is
significantly different from that in the production of a single top or a top
pair in the Standard Model for a wide range of slepton masses. Our signal
analysis shows that the top-slepton associate production leads to final states
with distinct kinematic signatures, which differ from the Standard Model
background.
