We undertake a comprehensive and rigorous analytic study of the evolution of
radial profiles of covariant scalars in regular Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi dust
models. We consider specifically the phenomenon of "profile inversions" in
which an initial clump profile of density, spatial curvature or the expansion
scalar, might evolve into a void profile (and vice versa). Previous work in the
literature on models with density void profiles and/or allowing for density
profile inversions is given full generalization, with some erroneous results
corrected. We prove rigorously that if an evolution without shell crossings is
assumed, then only the 'clump to void' inversion can occur in density profiles,
and only in hyperbolic models or regions with negative spatial curvature. The
profiles of spatial curvature follow similar patterns as those of the density,
with 'clump to void' inversions only possible for hyperbolic models or regions.
However, profiles of the expansion scalar are less restrictive, with profile
inversions necessarily taking place in elliptic models. We also examine radial
profiles in special LTB configurations: closed elliptic models, models with a
simultaneous big bang singularity, as well as a locally collapsing elliptic
region surrounded by an expanding hyperbolic background. The general analytic
statements that we obtain allow for setting up the right initial conditions to
construct fully regular LTB models with any specific qualitative requirements
for the profiles of all scalars and their time evolution. The results presented
can be very useful in guiding future numerical work on these models and in
revising previous analytic work on all their applications.
