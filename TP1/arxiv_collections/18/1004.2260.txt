We present two results on the recently proposed new spin foam models. First,
we show how a (slightly modified) restriction on representations in the EPRL
model leads to the appearance of the Ashtekar-Barbero connection, thus bringing
this model even closer to LQG. Second, we however argue that the quantization
procedure used to derive the new models is inconsistent since it relies on the
symplectic structure of the unconstraint BF theory.
