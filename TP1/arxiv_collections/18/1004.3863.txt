We study azimuthal gliding of the easy axis that occurs in nematic liquid
crystals brought in contact with the photoaligned azo-dye film under the action
of reorienting UV light combined with an in-plane electric field. For
irradiation with the linearly polarized light, dynamics of easy axis
reorientation is found to be faster as compared to the case of non-polarized
light. In addition, it slows down with the initial irradiation dose used to
prepare the azo-dye film. This effect is interpreted by using the previously
suggested phenomenological model. We present the theoretical results computed
by solving the torque balance equations of the model that agree very well with
the experimental data.
