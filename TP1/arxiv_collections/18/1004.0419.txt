Nova V2491 Cyg was discovered on April 10.72 UT 2008 (Nakano, 2008). Here we
present spectrophotometric premises that V2491 Cyg can be a good candidate for
recurrent nova (RNe). Its properties are compared to five well known RNe with
red dwarf secondaries (U Sco, V394 Cra, T Pyx, CI Aql, IM Nor) and recently
confirmed as recurrent nova V2487 Oph (Pagnotta et al.,2008). Photometric $U,
B, V, R_C, I_C$ and moderate resolution (R$\sim 1500$) spectral observations of
V2491 Cyg were carried out in the Torun Observatory (Poland) between April 14
and May 20 2008.
