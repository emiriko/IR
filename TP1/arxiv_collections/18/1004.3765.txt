The green mineral dioptase Cu6Si6O18(H2O)6 has been known since centuries and
plays an important role in esoteric doctrines. In particular, the green
dioptase is supposed to grant the skill to speak with trees and to understand
the language of birds. Armed with natural samples of dioptase, we were able to
unravel the magnetic nature of the mineral (presumably with hidden support from
birds and trees) and show that strong quantum fluctuations can be realized in
an essentially framework-type spin lattice of coupled chains, thus neither
frustration nor low-dimensionality are prerequisites. We present a microscopic
magnetic model for the green dioptase. Based on full-potential DFT
calculations, we find two relevant couplings in this system: an
antiferromagnetic coupling J_c, forming spiral chains along the hexagonal c
axis, and an inter-chain ferromagnetic coupling J_d within structural Cu2O6
dimers. To refine the J_c and J_d values and to confirm the proposed spin
model, we perform quantum Monte-Carlo simulations for the dioptase spin
lattice. The derived magnetic susceptibility, the magnetic ground state, and
the sublattice magnetization are in remarkably good agreement with the
experimental data. The refined model parameters are J_c = 78 K and J_d = -37 K
with J_d/J_c ~ -0.5. Despite the apparent three-dimensional features of the
spin lattice and the lack of frustration, strong quantum fluctuations in the
system are evidenced by a broad maximum in the magnetic susceptibility, a
reduced value of the Neel temperature T_N ~ 15 K >> J_c, and a low value of the
sublattice magnetization m = 0.55 Bohr magneton. All these features should be
ascribed to the low coordination number of 3 that outbalances the
three-dimensional nature of the spin lattice.
