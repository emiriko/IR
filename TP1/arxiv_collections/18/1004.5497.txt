We propose a simple model of classical open system consisting of two
subsystems all stationary states of which correspond to phase synchronization
between the subsystems. The model is generalized to quantum systems in a
finite-dimensional Hilbert space. The analysis of the simplest two qubit
version of the quantum model shows that all its stationary states are
nonseparable.
