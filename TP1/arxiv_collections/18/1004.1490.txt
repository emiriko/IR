We consider the evolution of cavities within spherically symmetric
relativistic fluids, under the assumption that proper radial distance between
neighboring fluid elements remains constant during their evolution (purely
areal evolution condition). The general formalism is deployed and solutions are
presented. Some of them satisfy Darmois conditions whereas others present
shells and must satisfy Israel conditions, on either one or both boundary
surfaces. Prospective applications of these results to some astrophysical
scenarios is suggested.
