We report interesting anomalies in the temperature dependent Raman spectra of
FeSe$_{0.82}$ measured from 3K to 300K in the spectral range from 60 to 1800
cm$^{-1}$ and determine their origin using complementary first-principles
density functional calculations. A phonon mode near 100 cm$^{-1}$ exhibits a
sharp increase by $\sim$ 5% in frequency below a temperature T$_s$ ($\sim$ 100
K) attributed to strong spin-phonon coupling and onset of short-range
antiferromagnetic order. In addition, two high frequency modes are observed at
1350 cm$^{-1}$ and 1600 cm$^{-1}$, attributed to electronic Raman scattering
from ($x^2-y^2$)to $xz$ / $yz$ $d$-orbitals of Fe.
