We present multiwavelength broadband photometry and V, I time resolved
photometry for two variable bright stars in the SMC, OGLE004336.91-732637.7
(SMC-SC3) and OGLE004633.76-731204.3 (SMC-SC4). The light curves span 12 years
and show long-term periodicities (SMC-SC3) and modulated eclipses (SMC-SC4)
that are discussed in terms of wide-orbit intermediate mass interacting
binaries and associated envelopes. SMC-SC3 shows a primary period of 238.1 days
along with a complicated waveform suggesting ellipsoidal variablity influenced
by an eccentric orbit. This star also shows a secondary variability with an
unstable periodicity that has a mean value of 15.3 days. We suggest this could
be associated with nonradial pulsations.
