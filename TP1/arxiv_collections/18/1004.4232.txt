In this paper we describe one setup employed for the recording of two types
of holographic screens that can be used in white-light applications. We show
how to obtain holographic screens with areas up to 1370 cm2 and diffraction
efficiency of 17%. We analyze the holographic screens in their relevant aspects
as to focal lengths, theoretical approach, sizes and diffraction efficiencies
specifying when each type is appropriate for particular applications.
