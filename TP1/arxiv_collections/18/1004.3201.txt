We probe spin transport in Cu_{2}O by measuring spin valve effect in
La_{0.7}Sr_{0.3}MnO_{3}/Cu_{2}O/Co and
La_{0.7}Sr_{0.3}MnO_{3}/Cu_{2}O/La_{0.7}Sr_{0.3}MnO_{3} epitaxial
heterostructures. In La_{0.7}Sr_{0.3}MnO_{3}/Cu_{2}O/Co systems we find that a
fraction of out-of-equilibrium spin polarized carrier actually travel across
the Cu_{2}O layer up to distances of almost 100 nm at low temperature. The
corresponding spin diffusion length dspin is estimated around 40 nm.
Furthermore, we find that the insertion of a SrTiO_{3} tunneling barrier does
not improve spin injection, likely due to the matching of resistances at the
interfaces. Our result on dspin may be likely improved, both in terms of
Cu_{2}O crystalline quality and sub-micrometric morphology and in terms of
device geometry, indicating that Cu_{2}O is a potential material for efficient
spin transport in devices based on crystalline oxides.
