Marengo and the second author have developed in the last years a geometric
model of social choice when this takes place among bundles of interdependent
elements, showing that by bundling and unbundling the same set of constituent
elements an authority has the power of determining the social outcome. In this
paper we will tie the model above to tournament theory, solving some of the
mathematical problems arising in their work and opening new questions which are
interesting not only from a mathematical and a social choice point of view, but
also from an economic and a genetic one. In particular, we will introduce the
notion of u-local optima and we will study it from both a theoretical and a
numerical/probabilistic point of view; we will also describe an algorithm that
computes the universal basin of attraction of a social outcome in O(M^3 logM)
time (where M is the number of social outcomes).
