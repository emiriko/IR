The molasses tail in dense hard core fluids is investigated by extensive
event-driven molecular dynamics simulation through the orientational
autocorrelation functions. Near the fluid-solid phase transition, there exist
three regimes in the relaxation of the pair orientational autocorrelation
function, namely the kinetic, molasses (stretched exponential), and diffusional
power decay. The density dependence of both the molasses and diffusional power
regimes are evaluated and the latter compares with theoretical predictions in
three dimensions. The largest cluster at the freezing density of only a few
sphere diameter in size persist for only about 30 picoseconds (~ 2.8 x
10^{-11}[s]). The most striking observation through the bond orientatinal order
parameter is the dramatic increase of the cluster size as the freezing density
is approached.
