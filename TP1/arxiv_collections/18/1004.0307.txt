The structure and magnetic properties of nanocrystalline PrCo$_3$ prepared by
high-energy milling technique have been investigated by means of X-ray
diffraction using the Rietveld method coupled to Curie temperature and magnetic
measurements. The as-milled samples were subsequently annealed in temperature
range from 750 to 1050 {\deg}C for 30 min to optimize the extrinsic properties.
From x-ray studies of magnetic aligned samples, the magnetic anisotropy of this
compounds is found uniaxial. The Curie temperature is 349 {\deg}K and no
saturation reached at room temperature for applied field of 90 kOe. The
coercive field of 55 kOe and 12 kOe measured at 10 and 293 K respectively is
obtained after annealing at 750 {\deg}C for 30 min suggests that
nanocrystalline PrCo$_3$ are interesting candidates in the field of permanent
magnets. We have completed this experimental study by simulations in the
micromagnetic framework in order to get a qualitative picture of the
microstructure effect on the macroscopic magnetization curve. From this simple
model calculation, we can suggest that the after annealing the system behaves
as magnetically hard crystallites embedded in a weakly magnetized amorphous
matrix. PACS : 75.50.Bb, 75.50.Tt, 76.80.+y
