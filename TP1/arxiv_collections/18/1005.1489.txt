In previous papers we have introduced a natural nonequilibrium free energy by
considering the functional describing the large fluctuations of stationary
nonequilibrium states. While in equilibrium this functional is always convex,
in nonequilibrium this is not necessarily the case. We show that in
nonequilibrium a new type of singularities can appear that are interpreted as
phase transitions. In particular, this phenomenon occurs for the
one-dimensional boundary driven weakly asymmetric exclusion process when the
drift due to the external field is opposite to the one due to the external
reservoirs, and strong enough.
