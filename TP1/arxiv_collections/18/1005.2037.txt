In a heterogeneous, dynamic environment, like Grid, post-mortem analysis is
of no use and data needs to be collected and analysed in real time. Novel
techniques are also required for dynamically tuning the application's
performance and resource brokering in order to maintain the desired QoS. The
objective of this paper is to propose an integrated framework for performance
analysis and tuning of the application, and rescheduling the application, if
necessary, to some other resources in order to adapt to the changing resource
usage scenario in a dynamic environment.
