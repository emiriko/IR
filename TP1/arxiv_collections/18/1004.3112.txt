We investigate the entanglement entropy of a block of L sites in quasifree
translation-invariant spin chains concentrating on the effect of reflection
symmetry breaking. The majorana two-point functions corresponding to the
Jordan-Wigner transformed fermionic modes are determined in the most general
case; from these it follows that reflection symmetry in the ground state can
only be broken if the model is quantum critical. The large L asymptotics of the
entropy is calculated analytically for general gauge-invariant models, which
has, until now, been done only for the reflection symmetric sector. Analytical
results are also derived for certain non-gauge-invariant models, e.g., for the
Ising model with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. We also study numerically
finite chains of length N with a non-reflection-symmetric Hamiltonian and
report that the reflection symmetry of the entropy of the first L spins is
violated but the reflection-symmetric Calabrese-Cardy formula is recovered
asymptotically. Furthermore, for non-critical reflection-symmetry-breaking
Hamiltonians, we find an anomaly in the behavior of the "saturation entropy" as
we approach the critical line. The paper also provides a concise but extensive
review of the block entropy asymptotics in translation invariant quasifree spin
chains with an analysis of the nearest neighbor case and the enumeration of the
yet unsolved parts of the quasifree landscape.
