Combined climate mitigation/geoengineering approach has better economic
utility, less emission control rate and temperature increase than mitigation
alone. If setting the 50% reduction rate and 2^\circC temperature increase as
constrains, we find there is no a feasible solution for emission control, but
combined design is still available.
