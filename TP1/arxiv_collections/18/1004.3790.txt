We construct a countable family of open intervals contained in (0,1] whose
endpoints are quadratic surds and such that their union is a full measure set.
We then show that these intervals are precisely the monotonicity intervals of
the entropy of alpha-continued fractions, thus proving a conjecture of Nakada
and Natsui.
