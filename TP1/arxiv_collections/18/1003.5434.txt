In this communication we present our response to the recent comment of A.
Engel regarding our paper on FIB- fabricated Nb nanowires (see Vol. 20 (2009)
Pag. 465302). After further analysis and additional experimental evidence, we
conclude that our interpretation of the experimental results in light of QPS
theory is still valid when compared with the alternative proximity-based model
as proposed by A. Engel.
