A School on Loop Quantum Gravity was held at the IMSc during Sept 8 -- 18,
2009. In the first week a basic introduction to LQG was provided while in the
second week the focus was on the two main application, to cosmology (LQC) and
to the black hole entropy. These notes are an expanded written account of the
lectures that I gave. These are primarily meant for beginning researchers.
