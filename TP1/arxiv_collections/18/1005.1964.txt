We performed direct calculations of carrier hopping rates in strongly
disordered conjugated polymers based on the atomic structure of the system, the
corresponding electronic states and their coupling to all phonon modes. We
found that the dependence of hopping rates on distance and the dependence of
the mobility on temperature are significantly different than the ones stemming
from the simple Miller-Abrahams model, regardless of the choice of the
parameters in the model. A new model that satisfactorily describes the hopping
rates in the system and avoids the explicit calculation of electron-phonon
coupling constants was then proposed and verified. Our results indicate that,
in addition to electronic density of states, the phonon density of states and
the spatial overlap of the wavefunctions are the quantities necessary to
properly describe carrier hopping in disordered conjugated polymers.
