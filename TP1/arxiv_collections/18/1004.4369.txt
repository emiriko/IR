Call a semistar operation $\ast$ on the polynomial domain $D[X]$ an extension
(respectively, a strict extension) of a semistar operation $\star$ defined on
an integral domain $D$, with quotient field $K$, if $E^\star =
(E[X])^{\ast}\cap K$ (respectively, $E^\star [X]= (E[X])^{\ast}$) for all
nonzero $D$-submodules $E$ of $K$. In this paper, we study the general
properties of the above defined extensions and link our work with earlier
efforts, centered on the stable semistar operation case, at defining semistar
operations on $D[X]$ that are "canonical" extensions (or, "canonical" strict
extensions) of semistar operations on $D$.
