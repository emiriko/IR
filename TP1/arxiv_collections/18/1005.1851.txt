A model of soft frictionless disks in two dimensions at zero temperature is
simulated with a shearing dynamics to study various kinds of asymmetries in
sheared systems. We examine both single particle properties, the spatial
velocity correlation function, and a correlation function designed to separate
clockwise and counter-clockwise rotational fields from one another. Among the
rich and interesting behaviors we find that the velocity correlation along the
two different diagonals corresponding to compression and dilation,
respectively, are almost identical and, furthermore, that a feature in one of
the correlation functions is directly related to irreversible plastic events.
