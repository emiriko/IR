Using spatial domain techniques developed by the authors and Myunghyun Oh in
the context of parabolic conservation laws, we establish under a natural set of
spectral stability conditions nonlinear asymptotic stability with decay at
Gaussian rate of spatially periodic traveling-waves of systems of reaction
diffusion equations. In the case that wave-speed is identically zero for all
periodic solutions, we recover and slightly sharpen a well-known result of
Schneider obtained by renormalization/Bloch transform techniques; by the same
arguments, we are able to treat the open case of nonzero wave-speeds to which
Schneider's renormalization techniques do not appear to apply
