We report on the first demonstration of time-delay interferometry (TDI) for
LISA, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna. TDI was implemented in a
laboratory experiment designed to mimic the noise couplings that will occur in
LISA. TDI suppressed laser frequency noise by approximately 10^9 and clock
phase noise by 6x10^4, recovering the intrinsic displacement noise floor of our
laboratory test bed. This removal of laser frequency noise and clock phase
noise in post-processing marks the first experimental validation of the LISA
measurement scheme.
