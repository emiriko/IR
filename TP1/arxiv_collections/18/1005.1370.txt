Which graphs admit an integer value harmonic function which is injective and
surjective onto $\Z$? Such a function, which we call harmonic labeling, is
constructed when the graph is the $\Z^2$ square grid. It is shown that for any
finite graph $G$ containing at least one edge, there is no harmonic labeling of
$ G \times \Z$.
