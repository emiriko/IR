We propose a mathematical model of \textit{quantum} transistor in which
bandgap engineering corresponds to the tuning of Dirac potential in the complex
four-vector form. The transistor consists of $n$-relativistic spin qubits
moving in \textit{classical} external electromagnetic fields. It is shown that
the tuning of the direction of the external electromagnetic fields generates
perturbation on the potential temporally and spatially, determining the type of
quantum logic gates. The theory underlying of this scheme is on the proposal of
the intertwining operator for Darboux transfomations on one-dimensional Dirac
equation amalgamating the \textit{vector-quantum gates duality} of Pauli
matrices. Simultaneous transformation of qubit and energy can be accomplished
by setting the $\{\textit{control, cyclic}\}$-operators attached on the
coupling between one-qubit quantum gate: the chose of \textit{cyclic}-operator
swaps the qubit and energy simultaneously, while \textit{control}-operator
ensures the energy conservation.
