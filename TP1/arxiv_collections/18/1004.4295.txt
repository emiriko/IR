The paper continues a series of publications devoted to the 3D nonlinear
localized coherent structures on the surface of vertically falling liquid
films. The work is primarily focussed on experimental investigations. We study:
(i) instabilities and transitions leading to 3D coherent structures; (ii)
characteristics of these structures. Some nonstationary effects are also
studied numerically. Our experimental results, as well as the results of other
investigators, are in a good agreement with our theoretical and numerical
predictions.
