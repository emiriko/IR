Context: Part of the very high energy $\gamma$-ray radiation coming from
extragalactic sources is absorbed through the pair production process on the
extragalactic background light photons. Extragalactic magnetic fields alter the
trajectories of these cascade pairs and, in turn, convert cosmic background
photons to gamma-ray energies by inverse Compton scattering. These secondary
photons can form an extended halo around bright VHE sources.
  Aims: We searched for an extended emission around the bright blazars Mrk 421
and Mrk 501 using the MAGIC telescope data.
  Methods: If extended emission is present, the angular distribution of
reconstructed gamma-ray arrival directions around the source is broader than
for a point-like source. In the analysis of a few tens of hours of
observational data taken from Mrk 421 and Mrk 501 we used a newly developed
method that provides better angular resolution. This method is based on the
usage of multidimensional decision trees. Comparing the measured shapes of
angular distributions with those expected from a point-like source one can
detect or constrain possible extended emission around the source. We also
studied the influence of different types of systematic errors on the shape of
the distribution of reconstructed gamma-ray arrival directions for a point
source.
  Results: We present upper limits for an extended emission calculated for both
sources for various source extensions and emission profiles. We discuss
possible constraints on the extragalactic magnetic fields strength. We obtain
upper limits on the extended emission around the Mrk~421 (Mrk~501) on the level
of < 5% (< 4%) of the Crab Nebula flux above the energy threshold of 300 GeV.
Using these results we discuss possible constraints on the extragalactic
magnetic fields strength around a few times $10^{-15}$~G.
