In this report a lumped transfer function model for High Pressure Natural Gas
Pipelines is derived. Starting with a partial nonlinear differential equation
(PDE) model a high order continuous state space (SS) linear model is obtained
using a finite difference method. Next, from the SS representation an infinite
order transfer function (TF) model is calculated. In the end, this TF is
approximated by a compact non-rational function.
