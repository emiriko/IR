We present uniform CFHT Megacam g and r photometry for 34 X-ray selected
galaxy clusters drawn from the X-ray Multi-Mirror (XMM) Large Scale Structure
(LSS) survey and the Canadian Cluster Comparison Project (CCCP). The clusters
possess well determined X-ray temperatures spanning the range 1<kT(keV)<12. In
addition, the clusters occupy a relatively narrow redshift interval
(0.15<z<0.41) in order to minimize any redshift dependent photometric effects.
We investigate the colour bimodality of the cluster galaxy populations and
compute blue fractions using criteria derived from Butcher and Oemler (1984).
We identify a trend to observe increasing blue fraction versus redshift in
common with numerous previous studies of cluster galaxy populations. However,
in addition we identify an environmental dependence of cluster blue fraction in
that cool (low mass) clusters display higher blue fractions than hotter (higher
mass) clusters. Finally, we tentatively identify a small excess population of
extremely blue galaxies in the coolest X-ray clusters (essentially massive
groups) and note that these may be the signature of actively star bursting
galaxies driven by galaxy-galaxy interactions in the group environment.
