Heavy hadrons containing heavy quarks (for example, Upsilon-mesons) feature a
scale separation between the heavy quark mass (about 4.5 GeV for the b-quark)
and the QCD scale (about 0.3 GeV}) that controls effective masses of lighter
constituents. Therefore, as in ordinary molecules, the de-excitation of the
lighter, faster degrees of freedom leaves the velocity distribution of the
heavy quarks unchanged, populating the available decay channels in
qualitatively predictable ways. Automatically an application of the
Franck-Condon principle of molecular physics explains several puzzling results
of Upsilon(5S) decays as measured by the Belle collaboration, such as the high
rate of Bs*-anti Bs* versus Bs*-anti Bs production, the strength of three-body
B-anti B + pion decays, or the dip in B momentum shown in these decays. We
argue that the data is showing the first Sturm-Liouville zero of the
Upsilon(5S) quantum mechanical squared wavefunction, and providing evidence for
a largely b-anti b composition of this meson.
