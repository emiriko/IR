The branching ratio and other observables for the rare flavour-changing
neutral current decay \bar B_d^0 -> \bar K*0 (-> K- pi+) e+ e- are studied
below the \bar{c} c threshold. The total amplitude for this decay includes the
term coming from the standard model effective Hamiltonian and the term
generated by the processes \bar B_d^0 -> \bar K*0 (-> K- pi+) V with
intermediate low-lying vector resonances V = rho(770), omega(782), phi(1020)
decaying into the e+ e- pair. The resonance contribution to the branching
ratio, polarization fractions of the K* meson and coefficients in the angular
distribution is calculated. The influence of the resonances on the integrated
observables in the region of electron-positron invariant mass up to 1 GeV is
studied in view of the planned measurements of the photon polarization at the
LHCb.
