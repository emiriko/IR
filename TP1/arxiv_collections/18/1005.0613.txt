In this letter we calculate the Inverse Cotton-Mouton Effect (ICME) for the
vacuum following the predictions of Quantum ElectroDynamics. We compare the
value of this effect for the vacuum with the one expected for atomic systems.
We finally show that ICME could be measured for the first time for noble gases
using state-of-the-art laser systems and for the quantum vacuum with
near-future laser facilities like ELI and HiPER, providing in particular a test
of the nonlinear behaviour of quantum vacuum at intensities below the Schwinger
limit of 4.5x10^33 W/m^2.
