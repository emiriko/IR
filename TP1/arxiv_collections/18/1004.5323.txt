Following our joint work arXiv:1003.4578 with Robert Langlands, we make the
first steps toward developing geometric methods for analyzing trace formulas in
the case of the function field of a curve defined over a finite field. We also
suggest a conjectural framework of geometric trace formulas for curves defined
over the complex field, which exploits the categorical version of the geometric
Langlands correspondence.
