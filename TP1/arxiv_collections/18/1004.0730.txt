Extensive body of work has shown that for the model of a non-interacting
electron in a random potential there is a quantum critical point for dimensions
greater than two---a metal-insulator transition. This model also plays an
important role in the plateau-to-plateu transition in the integer quantum Hall
effect, which is also correctly captured by a scaling theory. Yet, in neither
of these cases the ground state energy shows any non-analyticity as a function
of a suitable tuning parameter, typically considered to be a hallmark of a
quantum phase transition, similar to the non-analyticity of the free energy in
a classical phase transition. Here we show that von Neumann entropy
(entanglement entropy) is non-analytic at these phase transitions and can track
the fundamental changes in the internal correlations of the ground state wave
function. In particular, it summarizes the spatially wildly fluctuating
intensities of the wave function close to the criticality of the Anderson
transition. It is likely that all quantum phase transitions can be similarly
described.
