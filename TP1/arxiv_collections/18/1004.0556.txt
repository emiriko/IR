We demonstrate that mu/e slepton mixing is significantly more restricted than
previously thought within the already remarkably flavor-safe R-symmetric
supersymmetric standard model. We calculate bounds from mu to e gamma, mu to 3e
and, most importantly, mu to e conversion. The process mu to e conversion is
significantly more restrictive in R-symmetric models since this process can
occur through operators that do not require a chirality-flip. We delineate the
allowed parameter space, demonstrating that maximal mixing is rarely possible
with weak scale superpartners, while O(0.1) mixing is permitted within most of
the space. The best approach to find or rule out mu/e mixing in R-symmetric
supersymmetric models is a multi-pronged attack looking at both mu to e
conversion as well as mu to e gamma. The redundancy eliminates much of the
parameter space where one process, but not both processes, contain amplitudes
that accidentally destructively interfere. We briefly discuss implications for
searches of slepton flavor violation at the LHC.
