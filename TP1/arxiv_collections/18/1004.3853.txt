During the evolution of rotating first stars, which initially consisted of
only hydrogen and helium, CNO elements may emerge to their surface. These stars
may therefore have winds that are driven only by CNO elements. We study weak
wind effects (Gayley-Owocki heating and multicomponent effects) in stellar
winds of first generation stars driven purely by CNO elements. We apply our
NLTE multicomponent models and hydrodynamical simulations. The multicomponent
effects (frictional heating and decoupling) are important particularly for low
metallicity winds, but they influence mass loss rate only if they cause
decoupling for velocities lower than the escape velocity. The multicomponent
effects also modify the feedback from first stars. As a result of the
decoupling of radiatively accelerated metals from hydrogen and helium, the
first low-energy cosmic ray particles are generated. We study the interaction
of these particles with the interstellar medium concluding that these particles
easily penetrate the interstellar medium of a given minihalo. We discuss the
charging of the first stars by means of their winds. Gayley-Owocki heating,
frictional heating, and the decoupling of wind components occur in the winds of
evolved low-metallicity stars and the solar metallicity main-sequence stars.
