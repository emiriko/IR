We have investigated the motion of a single optically trapped colloidal
particle close to a limiting wall at time scales where the inertia of the
surrounding fluid plays a significant role. The velocity autocorrelation
function exhibits a complex interplay due to the momentum relaxation of the
particle, the vortex diffusion in the fluid, the obstruction of flow close to
the interface, and the harmonic restoring forces due to the optical trap. We
show that already a weak trapping force has a significant impact on the
velocity autocorrelation function C(t)=<v(t)v(0)> at times where the
hydrodynamic memory leads to an algebraic decay. The long-time behavior for the
motion parallel and perpendicular to the wall is derived analytically and
compared to numerical results. Then, we discuss the power spectral densities of
the displacement and provide simple interpolation formulas. The theoretical
predictions are finally compared to recent experimental observations.
