New algorithms are proposed for the Tucker approximation of a 3-tensor, that
access it using only the tensor-by-vector-by-vector multiplication subroutine.
In the matrix case, Krylov methods are methods of choice to approximate the
dominant column and row subspaces of a sparse or structured matrix given
through the matrix-by-vector multiplication subroutine. Using the Wedderburn
rank reduction formula, we propose an algorithm of matrix approximation that
computes Krylov subspaces and allows generalization to the tensor case. Several
variants of proposed tensor algorithms differ by pivoting strategies, overall
cost and quality of approximation. By convincing numerical experiments we show
that the proposed methods are faster and more accurate than the minimal Krylov
recursion, proposed recently by Elden and Savas.
