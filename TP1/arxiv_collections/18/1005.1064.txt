We propose a novel optical and electrical hybrid scheme for the measurement
of nuclear spin qubits in silicon. By combining the environmental insensitivity
of the integer quantum Hall effect with the optically distinguishable hyperfine
states of phosphorus impurities in silicon, our system can simultaneously offer
nuclear spin measurement and robustness against environmental defects. 31P
donor spins in isotopically purified 28Si are often discussed as very promising
quantum memory qubits due to their extremely long decoherence times, and our
proposed device offers an effective implementation for such a quantum memory
system.
