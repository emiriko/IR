I discuss conceptual issues associated with the presence of metastable AdS
vacua in the string landscape. The geometry of the decay from one AdS to
another is presented in detail, and various subtleties that are not present for
flat or dS vacua are demonstrated and analyzed. I use mostly semiclassical
gravity, but I will consider the implications for recent attempts to construct
field theory duals of metastable AdS vacua and also possible relevance to the
study of eternal inflation.
