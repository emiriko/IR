The part of results obtained on multichannel installation created for
researches of various processes, including alpha and beta decays, in a
combination to recording of environment parameters, is represented. The
installation works more than 13 years practically continuously. At the count
rate measurements of the Co-60 and Sr-90 Y-90 beta sources the rhythmic changes
with amplitude 0.3 % from average magnitude and period 1 year, and up to 0.02 %
with period about one month are detected. Count rate rhythmic changes of alpha
sources Pu-239 are not detected. The results obtained by us are compared to
similar results of other researchers. The argumentation of critics is analyzed.
