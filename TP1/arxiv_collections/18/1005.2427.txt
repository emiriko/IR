We introduce a real-space exact renormalization group method to find exactly
solvable quantum spin chains and their ground states. This method allows us to
provide a complete list for exact solutions within SU(2) symmetric quantum spin
chains with $S\leq 4$ and nearest-neighbor interactions, as well as examples
with S=5. We obtain two classes of solutions: One of them converges to the
fixed points of renormalization group and the ground states are matrix product
states. Another one does not have renormalization fixed points and the ground
states are partially ferromagnetic states.
