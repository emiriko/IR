In this paper, a finite-state mean-reverting model for the short-rate, based
on the continuous time Ehrenfest process, will be examined. Two explicit
pricing formulae for zero-coupon bonds will be derived in the general and the
special symmetric cases. Its limiting relationship to the Vasicek model will be
examined with some numerical results.
