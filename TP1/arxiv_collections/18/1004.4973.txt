For multitype branching processes with immigration evolving in a random
environment and producing a final product we find the tail distribution of the
size of the final product accumulated in the system for a life period. Using
this result we investigate the tail distribution of the busy periods of the
branching type polling systems with random service disciplines and random
positive switch-over times
