Fermilab's Tevatron accelerator is recently performing at record luminosities
that enables a program systematically addressing the physics of top quarks. The
CDF and D0 collaborations have analyzed up to 5/fb of proton anti-proton
collisions from the Tevatron at a center of mass energy of 1.96 TeV. The large
datasets available allow to push top quark measurements to higher and higher
precision and enabled the recent observation of electroweak single top quark
production at the Tevatron. This article reviews recent results on top quark
physics at the Tevatron and provides a brief outlook on early top quark
measurements at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, scheduled to restart in
November 2009.
