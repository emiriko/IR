We investigate the properties of three component BEC systems with spin
exchange interactions. We consider different coupling constants from those
leading to exact solutions known in the literature. When two solitons collide,
an oscillation of the emerging entities is observed. This behavior seems to be
generic. A mathematical model is derived for the emerging solitons. It
describes the new oscillatory phenomenon extremely well. Surprisingly, the
model is exact as a solution to the initial equations. This comes as a bonus.
