Standard definitions of the density exhibit large fluctuations when the size
of the measurement area is comparable with the size of a pedestrian. An
alternative measurement method exists where a personal space, calculated
through the Voronoi diagram, is assigned to each pedestrian. In this
contribution this method is applied to an experiment studying motion through a
bottleneck and the reduced fluctuations demonstrated. The integrated density
also permits examination on much smaller spatial scales than the standard
definition, the insights into the pedestrian motion this provides are
discussed.
