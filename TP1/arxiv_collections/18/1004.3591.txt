The classical $abc$ theorem for polynomials (often called Mason's theorem)
deals with nontrivial polynomial solutions to the equation $a+b=c$. It provides
a lower bound for the number of distinct zeros of the polynomial $abc$ in terms
of $\deg{a}$, $\deg{b}$, and $\deg{c}$. We prove some "local" $abc$-type
theorems for general analytic functions living on a reasonable bounded domain
$\Omega\subset\mathbb C$, rather than on the whole of $\mathbb C$. The
estimates obtained are sharp, for any $\Omega$, and they imply (a
generalization of) the original "global" $abc$ theorem by a limiting argument.
