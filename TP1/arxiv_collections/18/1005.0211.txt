We consider fractional Black-Scholes market with proportional transaction
costs. When transaction costs are present, one trades periodically i.e. we have
the discrete trading with equidistance $n^{-1}$ between trading times. We
derive a non trivial hedging error for a class of European options with convex
payoff in the case when the transaction costs coefficients decrease as
$n^{-(1-H)}$. We study the expected hedging error and asymptotic behavior of
the hedge as $H \to 1/2$
