We report the evolution of superconducting properties with disorder, in
3-dimensional homogeneously disordered epitaxial NbN thin films. The effective
disorder in NbN is controlled from moderately clean limit down to Anderson
metal-insulator transition by changing the deposition conditions. We propose a
phase diagram for NbN in temperature-disorder plane. With increasing disorder
we observe that as kFl-->1 the superconducting transition temperature (Tc) and
minimum conductivity (sigma_0) go to zero. The phase diagram shows that in
homogeneously disordered 3-D NbN films, the metal-insulator transition and the
superconductor-insulator transition occur at a single quantum critical point at
kFl~1.
