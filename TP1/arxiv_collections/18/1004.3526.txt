We clarify the relation between the ergodicity breaking transition predicted
by mode-coupling theory and the so-called dynamic transition predicted by the
static replica approach. Following Franz and Parisi [Phys. Rev. Lett. 79, 2486
(1997)], we consider a system of particles in a metastable state characterized
by non-trivial correlations with a quenched configuration. We show that the
assumption that in a metastable state particle currents vanish leads to an
expression for the replica off-diagonal direct correlation function in terms of
a replica off-diagonal static four-point correlation function. A factorization
approximation for this function results in an approximate closure for the
replica off-diagonal direct correlation function. The replica off-diagonal
Ornstein-Zernicke equation combined with this closure coincides with the
equation for the non-ergodicity parameter derived using the mode-coupling
theory.
