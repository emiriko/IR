Quantum theory is a tremendously successful physical theory, but nevertheless
suffers from two serious problems: the measurement problem and the problem of
interpretational underdetermination. The latter, however, is largely overlooked
as a genuine problem of its own. Both problems concern the doctrine of realism,
but pull, quite curiously, into opposite directions. The measurement problem
can be captured such that due to scientific realism about quantum theory common
sense anti-realism follows, while theory underdetermination usually counts as
an argument against scientific realism. I will also consider the more refined
distinctions of ontic and epistemic realism and demonstrate that quantum theory
in its most viable interpretations conflicts with at least one of the various
realism claims. A way out of the conundrum is to come to the bold conclusion
that quantum theory is, possibly, wrong (in the realist sense).
