ALICE is well suited for strange particles production studies since it has
very good reconstruction capabilities in the low transverse momentum ($p_{t}$)
region and it also allows to extend the identification up to quite high
$p_{t}$. Charged strange mesons ($\kp$, $\km$,) are reconstructed via energy
loss measurements whereas neutral strange mesons ($\ks$) and strange hyperons
($\lam$, $\Xi$, $\Omega$) are identified via vertex reconstruction. All these
particles carry important information: first, the measurement of production
yields and the particle ratio within the statistical models can help to
understand the medium created and secondly the dynamics at intermediate $p_{t}$
investigated via the baryon over meson ratio ($\lam / \ks$) allows a better
understanding of the hadronization mechanisms and of the underlying event
processes. We present these two aspects of the strange particles analysis in pp
collisions using simulated data.
