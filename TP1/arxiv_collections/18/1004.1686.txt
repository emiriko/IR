The paper presents new clustering algorithm. The proposed algorithm gives
less distortion as compared to well known Linde Buzo Gray (LBG) algorithm and
Kekre's Proportionate Error (KPE) Algorithm. Constant error is added every time
to split the clusters in LBG, resulting in formation of cluster in one
direction which is 1350 in 2-dimensional case. Because of this reason
clustering is inefficient resulting in high MSE in LBG. To overcome this
drawback of LBG proportionate error is added to change the cluster orientation
in KPE. Though the cluster orientation in KPE is changed its variation is
limited to +/- 450 over 1350. The proposed algorithm takes care of this problem
by introducing new orientation every time to split the clusters. The proposed
method reduces PSNR by 2db to 5db for codebook size 128 to 1024 with respect to
LBG.
