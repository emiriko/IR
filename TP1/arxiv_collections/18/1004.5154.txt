We discuss the reconstruction of neutrino flavor neutrino at a distant source
in the very high en- ergy regime. This reconstruction procedure is relevant to
the confirmation of detecting cosmogenic neutrinos, for example. To facilitate
such a reconstruction, it is imperative to achieve effective flavor
discriminations in terrestrial neutrino telescopes. We note that, for energies
beyond few tens of PeV, a tau-lepton behaves like a track similar to a muon.
Hence, while it is rather challenging to separate {\nu}{\mu} from {\nu}{\tau}
in this case, one can expect to isolate {\nu}e from the rest by a distinctive
shower signature. We present the result of flavor ratio reconstruction given
the anticipated accuracies of flavor measurement in neutrino telescopes and
current uncertainties of neutrino mixing parame- ters. It is shown that the
further separation between {\nu}{\mu} and {\nu}{\tau} events does not improve
the flavor reconstruction due to the approximate {\nu}{\mu} - {\nu}{\tau}
symmetry.
