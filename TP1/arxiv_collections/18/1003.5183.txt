In these proceedings we report on HiZELS, the High-z Emission Line Survey,
our successful panoramic narrow-band Campaign Survey using WFCAM on UKIRT to
detect and study emission line galaxies at z~1-9. HiZELS employs the H2(S1)
narrow-band filter together with custom-made narrow-band filters in the J and
H-bands, with the primary aim of delivering large, identically-selected samples
of H-alpha emitting galaxies at redshifts of 0.84, 1.47 and 2.23. Comparisons
between the luminosity function, the host galaxy properties, the clustering,
and the variation with environment of these H-alpha-selected samples are
yielding unique constraints on the nature and evolution of star-forming
galaxies, across the peak epoch of star-formation activity in the Universe. We
provide a summary of the project status, and detail the main scientific results
obtained so far: the measurement of the evolution of the cosmic star-formation
rate density out to z > 2 using a single star-formation indicator,
determination of the morphologies, environments and dust-content of the
star-forming galaxies, and a detailed investigation of the evolution of their
clustering properties. We also summarise the on-going work and future goals of
the project.
