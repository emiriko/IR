The excited-state properties in a series of coumarin solar cell dyes are
investigated with a long-range-corrected (LC) functional which asymptotically
incorporates Hartree-Fock exchange. Using time-dependent density functional
theory (TDDFT), we calculate excitation energies, oscillator strengths, and
excited-state dipole moments in each of the dyes as a function of the
range-separation paramenter, mu. To investigate the acceptable range of mu and
assess the quality of the LC-TDDFT formalism, an extensive comparison is made
between LC-BLYP excitation energies and approximate coupled cluster singles and
doubles (CC2) calculations. When using a properly-optimized value of mu, we
find that the LC technique provides a consistent picture of charge-transfer
excitations as a function of molecular size. In contrast, we find that the
widely-used B3LYP hybrid functional severely overestimates excited-state dipole
moments and underestimates vertical excitations energies, especially for larger
dye molecules. The results of the present study emphasize the importance of
long-range exchange corrections in TDDFT for investigating the excited-state
properties in solar cell dyes.
