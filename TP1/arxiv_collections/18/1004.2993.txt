Over the last decade, internet has seen an exponential increase in its
growth.With more and more people using it, efficient data delivery over the
internet has become a key issue. Peer-to-peer (P2P)/seed sharing based networks
have several desirable features for content distribution, such as low costs,
scalability, and fault tolerance. While the invention of each of such
specialized systems has improved the user experience, some fundamental
shortcomings of these systems have often been neglected. These shortcomings of
content distribution systems have become severe bottlenecks in scalability of
the internet.In order to combine the desired features of classical Content
Distribution Networks (CDNs) and P2P/seed sharing based networks, we propose a
hybrid CDN structure with a P2P/seed sharing based streaming protocol in the
access network . In this work, we focus on the problem of data redundancy (at
each node) and show how severely it impacts the network economics and the
experience of end-user and hence leads to low traffic load and redundancy
