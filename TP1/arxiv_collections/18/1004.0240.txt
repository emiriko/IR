We present measurements of B-meson decays to the final states eta'rho,
eta'f0, and eta'K*, where K* stands for a vector, scalar, or tensor strange
meson. We observe a significant signal or evidence for eta'rho+ and all the
eta'K* channels. We also measure, where applicable, the charge asymmetries,
finding results consistent with no direct CP-violation in all cases. The
measurements are performed on a data sample consisting of 467 x 10^6 B-Bbar
pairs, collected with the BaBar detector at the PEP-II e+e- collider at the
SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory. Our results favor the theoretical
predictions from perturbative QCD and QCD Factorization and we observe an
enhancement of the tensor K_2*(1430) with respect to the vector K*(892)
component.
