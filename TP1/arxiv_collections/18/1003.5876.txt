We present spectrophotometric data from 0.4 to 4.2 microns for bright,
northern sky, Be stars and several other types of massive stars. Our goal is to
use these data with ongoing, high angular resolution, interferometric
observations to model the density structure and sky orientation of the gas
surrounding these stars. We also present a montage of the H-alpha and
near-infrared emission lines that form in Be star disks. We find that a
simplified measurement of the IR excess flux appears to be correlated with the
strength of emission lines from high level transitions of hydrogen. This
suggests that the near-IR continuum and upper level line fluxes both form in
the inner part of the disk, close to the star.
