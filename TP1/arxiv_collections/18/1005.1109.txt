Preliminary results are presented for the kinetics of phase separation in
three distinct models of protein aggregation. The first is a model of the
formation of spherical microcrystals of insulin via an initial formation of
fractal clusters of insulin. The results of our Brownian dynamics study of this
model are in qualitative agreement with a recent experimental study (Biophys.
Jour. 89 (2005) 3424-3433) of microcrystal formation from aqueous mixtures of
insulin. A second work involves a theory for the formation of metastable
bundles of sickle hemoglobin from fibers, based on a recent generic theory of
bundle formation (Phy. Rev. Lett. 99 (2007) 098101). We also discuss a model
for the microscopic formation of these fibers. Finally, we discuss preliminary
results for the kinetics of cluster formation for a six patch model of protein
crystallization.
