From the principle of relativity with two universal invariant parameters $c$
and $l$, 24 possible kinematical (including geometrical and static) algebras
can be obtained. Each algebra is of 10 dimensional, generating the symmetry of
a 4 dimensional homogeneous space-time or a pure space. In addition to the
ordinary Poincar\'e algebra, there is another Poincar\'e algebra among the 24
algebras. New 4d geometries with the new Poincar\'e symmetry are presented. The
motion of free particles on one of the new space-times is discussed.
