We have systematically investigated the doping and the directional dependence
of the gap structure in the 122-type iron pnictide superconductors by point
contact Andreev reflection spectroscopy. The studies were performed on single
crystals of Ba1-xKxFe2As2 (x = 0.29, 0.49, and 0.77) and SrFe1.74Co0.26As2 with
a sharp tip of Pb or Au pressed along the c-axis or the ab-plane direction. The
conductance spectra obtained on highly transparent contacts clearly show
evidence of a robust superconducting gap. The normalized curves can be well
described by the Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk model with a lifetime broadening. The
determined gap value scales very well with the transition temperature, giving
the 2{\Delta}/kBTC value of ~ 3.1. The results suggest the presence of a
universal coupling behavior in this class of iron pnictides over a broad doping
range and independent of the sign of the doping. Moreover, conductance spectra
obtained on c-axis junctions and ab-plane junctions indicate that the observed
gap is isotropic in these superconductors.
