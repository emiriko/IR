The cosmological model of dark energy interacting with cold dark matter
without coupling to the baryonic matter, is studied in the background of both
classical Einstein and loop quantum cosmology. We consider two types of
interacting models. In the former model, the interaction is a linear
combination of the densities of two dark sectors, while in the latter model,
the interaction with a constant transfer rate depends only on the density of
cold dark matter. It is shown that the dynamical results in loop quantum
cosmology are different from those in classical Einstein cosmology for both two
kinds of interacting models. Moreover, the form of the interaction affects
significantly the dynamical results in both kinds of cosmology.
