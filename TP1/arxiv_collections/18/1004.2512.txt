We study the thermal escape problem in the low damping limit. We find that
finiteness of the barrier is crucial for explaining the thermal activation
results. In this regime low barrier non-equilibrium corrections to the usual
theories become necessary. We propose a simple theoretical extension accounting
for these non-equilibrium processes which agrees numerical results. We apply
our theory to the understanding of switching current curves in underdamped
Josephson junctions.
