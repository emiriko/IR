By means of a binary visibility graph, we present a novel method to study
random binary sequences. The behavior of the some topological properties of the
binary visibility graph, such as the degree distribution, the clustering
coefficient, and the mean path length have been investigated. Several examples
are then provided to show that the numerical simulations confirm the accuracy
of the theorems for finite random binary sequences. Finally, in this paper we
propose, for the first time, three topological properties of the binary
visibility graph as a randomness criteria.
