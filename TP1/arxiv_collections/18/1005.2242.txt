This paper first reviews quantum measure and integration theory. A new
representation of the quantum integral is presented. This representation is
illustrated by computing some quantum (Lebesgue)${}^2$ integrals. The rest of
the paper only considers finite spaces. Anhomomorphic logics are discussed and
the classical domain of a coevent is studied. Pure quantum measures and
coevents are considered and it is shown that pure quantum measures are strictly
contained in the extremal elements for the set of quantum measures bounded
above by one. Moreover, we prove that any quantum measure on a finite event
space $\ascript$ can be transferred to an ordinary measure on an anhomomorphic
logic $\ascript ^*$. In this way, the quantum dynamics on $\ascript$ can be
described by a classical dynamics on the larger space $\ascript ^*$.
