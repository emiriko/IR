We introduce generalised orbit algebras. The purpose here is to measure how
some combinatorial properties can characterize the action of a group of
permutations on the subsets. The similarity with orbit algebras is such that it
took the author a long time to find a generalised orbit algebra not arising
from a permutation group.
