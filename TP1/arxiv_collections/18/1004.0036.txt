In this paper, we study the asymptotic stability of rarefaction waves for the
compressible isentropic Navier-Stokes equations with density-dependent
viscosity. First, a weak solution around a rarefaction wave to the Cauchy
problem is constructed by approximating the system and regularizing the initial
values which may contain vacuum state. Then some global in time estimates on
the weak solution are obtained. Based on these uniform estimates, the vacuum
states are shown to vanish in finite time and the weak solution we constructed
becomes a unique strong one. Consequently, the stability of the rarefaction
wave is proved in a weak sense. The theory holds for large-amplitudes
rarefaction waves and arbitrary initial perturbations.
