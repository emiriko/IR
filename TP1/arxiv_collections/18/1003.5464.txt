We provide security bounds against coherent attacks for two families of
quantum key distribution protocols that use $d$-dimensional quantum systems. In
the asymptotic regime, both the secret key rate for fixed noise and the
robustness to noise increase with $d$. The finite-key corrections are found to
be almost insensitive to $d\lesssim 20$.
