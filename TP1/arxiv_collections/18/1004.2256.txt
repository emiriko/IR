Taking a bottom-up point of view and focussing on the lack of signals so far
in the Higgs and in the flavour sectors, we argue in favour of giving
consideration to supersymmetric extensions of the Standard Model where the
lightest Higgs boson has a mass between 200 and 300 GeV and the first two
generations of s-fermions are above 20 TeV. After examining the simplest
extensions of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model that allow this in a
natural way, we summarize the main consequences of this pattern of masses at
the LHC and we analyze the consequences of a heavier than normal Higgs boson
for Dark Matter.
