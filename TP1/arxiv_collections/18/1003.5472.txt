Mode-coupling theory (MCT) is conjectured to be a mean-field description of
dynamics of the structural glass transition and the replica theory to be its
thermodynamic counterpart. However, the relationship between the two theories
remains controversial and quantitative comparison is lacking. In this Letter,
we investigate MCT for monatomic hard sphere fluids at arbitrary dimensions
above three and compare the results with replica theory. We find grave
discrepancies between the predictions of two theories. While MCT describes the
nonergodic parameter quantitatively better than the replica theory in three
dimension, it predicts a completely different dimension dependence of the
dynamical transition point. We find it to be due to the pathological behavior
of the nonergodic parameters derived from MCT, which exhibit negative tails in
real space at high dimensions.
