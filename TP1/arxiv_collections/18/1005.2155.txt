The motion of micro- and nanomechanical resonators can be coupled to
electromagnetic fields. This allows to explore the mutual interaction and
introduces new means to manipulate and control both light and mechanical
motion. Such optomechanical systems have recently been implemented in
nanoelectromechanical systems involving a nanomechanical beam coupled to a
superconducting microwave resonator. Here, we propose optomechanical systems
that involve multiple, coupled microwave resonators. In contrast to similar
systems in the optical realm, the coupling frequency governing photon exchange
between microwave modes is naturally comparable to typical mechanical
frequencies. For instance this enables new ways to manipulate the microwave
field, such as mechanically driving coherent photon dynamics between different
modes. In particular we investigate two setups where the electromagnetic field
is coupled either linearly or quadratically to the displacement of a
nanomechanical beam. The latter scheme allows to perform QND Fock state
detection. For experimentally realistic parameters we predict the possibility
to measure an individual quantum jump from the mechanical ground state to the
first excited state.
