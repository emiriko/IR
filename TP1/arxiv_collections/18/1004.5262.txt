In this paper the approach to solving several combinatorial optimization
problems using the local search and the genetic algorithm techniques is
proposed. Initially this approach was developed in purpose to overcome some
difficulties inhibiting the application of above mentioned techniques to the
problems of the Questionnaire Theory. But when the algorithms were developed it
became clear that them could be successfully applied also to the Minimum Set
Cover, the 0-1-Knapsack and probably to other combinatorial optimization
problems.
