We investigate experimentally the transmission properties of single
sub-wavelength coaxial apertures in thin metal films (t = 110 nm). Enhanced
transmission through a single sub-wavelength coaxial aperture illuminated with
a strongly focused radially polarized light beam is reported. In our
experiments we achieved up to four times enhanced transmission through a single
coaxial aperture as compared to a (hollow) circular aperture with the same
outer diameter.We attribute this enhancement of transmission to the excitation
of a TEM-mode for illumination with radially polarized light inside the single
coaxial aperture. A strong polarization contrast is observed between the
transmission for radially and azimuthally polarized illumination. Furthermore,
the observed transmission through a single coaxial aperture can be strongly
reduced if surface plasmons are excited. The experimental results are in good
agreement with finite difference time domain (FDTD) simulations.
