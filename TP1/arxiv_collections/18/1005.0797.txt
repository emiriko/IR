Precision electroweak physics can provide fertile ground for uncovering new
physics beyond the Standard Model (SM). One area in which new physics can
appear is in so-called "oblique corrections", i.e., next-to-leading order
expansions of bosonic propagators corresponding to vacuum polarization. One may
parametrize their effects in terms of quantities $S$ and $T$ that discriminate
between conservation and non-conservation of isospin. This provides a means of
comparing the relative contributions of precision electroweak experiments to
constraints on new physics. Given the prevalence of strongly $T$-sensitive
experiments, there is an acute need for further constraints on $S$, such as
provided by atomic parity-violating experiments on heavy atoms. We evaluate
constraints on $S$ arising from recently improved calculations in the Cs atom.
We show that the top quark mass $m_t$ provides stringent constraints on $S$
within the context of the Standard Model. We also consider the potential
contributions of next-generation neutrino scattering experiments to improved
$(S,T)$ constraints.
