Type-flaw attacks and multi-protocol attacks on security protocols have been
frequently reported in the literature. Heather et al. and Guttman et al. have
proven that these could be prevented by tagging encrypted components with
distinct constants in a standard protocol model with free message algebra and
perfect encryption. However, most "real-world" protocols such as SSL 3.0 are
designed with the Exclusive-OR (XOR) operator that possesses algebraic
properties, breaking the free algebra assumption. These algebraic properties
induce equational theories that need to be considered when analyzing protocols
that use the operator. This is the problem we consider in this paper: We prove
that, under certain assumptions, tagging encrypted components still prevents
type-flaw and multi-protocol attacks even in the presence of the XOR operator
and its algebraic properties.
