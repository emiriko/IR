We develop a reformulation of the functional integral for bosons in terms of
bilocal fields. Correlation functions correspond to quantum probabilities
instead of probability amplitudes. Discrete and continuous global symmetries
can be treated similar to the usual formalism. Situations where the formalism
can be interpreted in terms of a statistical field theory in Minkowski space
are characterized by violations of unitarity at very large momentum scales.
Renormalization group equations suggest that unitarity can be essentially
restored by strong fluctuation effects.
