The advances in new technologies have prompted the need for functional
systems smaller than the gyration radius of polymer chains. Thus, understanding
how nanoconfinement affects polymer properties has been the focus of a lot of
research for over a decade. Polystyrene in particular has been reported to be
strongly affected when nanoconfined as a thin film and specifically its glass
transition temperature (Tg) is reported to decrease with decreasing film
thickness. Tremendous effort has been dedicated to developing methods for
quantifying the large-scale dynamic of nanoconfined polymers: film dewetting,
film contraction, nanobubble inflation, nanoparticle imbedding and healing of
deformed surfaces etc. In this work we describe a novel method to study the
large scale dynamic and nanomechanical properties of nanoconfined polymers in
nanoparticles in nanoblends. Nanoblends of dPS/PBMA were prepared from a
mixture of colloidal suspensions of cross-linked PBMA and traces of dPS
nanoparticles via water evaporation. The polymer blends were prepared at
temperatures well below the glass transition of PS (TgPS) and above the Tg of
cross-linked PBMA particles (TgPBMA). In these conditions we expect the PBMA
particles to deform under capillary pressure to fill the interstices between
them and the glassy PS nanoparticles to remain spherical. During the
preparation of the nanoblends the elastic energy is stored within the deformed
cross-linked PBMA nanoparticles. Upon annealing the films above TgPS, the PBMA
nanoparticles regain their spherical shape and release the stored elastic
energy, which induces the deformation of the PS nanoparticles. Small angle
neutron scattering is then used to monitor the shape evolution of the PS
nanoparticles and to quantify the relaxation dynamics of the polystyrene
nanoparticles.
