Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) based Medium Access Control (MAC)
protocols have received a good deal of attention as researchers look to enhance
overall performance of Ad Hoc networks by leveraging multi antenna enabled
nodes. To date such MAC protocols have been evaluated through comparative
simulation based studies that report on the number of concurrent links the
protocol can support. However, a bound on the maximum number of concurrent
links (MNCL) that a MIMO based MAC protocol should strive to achieve has
hitherto been unavailable. In this paper we present a theoretical formulation
for calculating the bound on the MNCL in a Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) where
the nodes have multiple antenna capability, while guaranteeing a minimum
Quality of Service (QoS). In an attempt to make our findings as practical and
realistic as possible, the study incorporates models for the following PHY
layer and channel dependent elements: (a) path loss and fast fading effects, in
order to accurately model adjacent link interference; (b) a Minimum Mean
Squared Error (MMSE) based detector in the receiver which provides a balance
between completely nulling of neighboring interference and hardware complexity.
In calculating the bound on the MNCL our work also delivers the optimal power
control solution for the network as well as the optimal link selection. The
results are readily applicable to MIMO systems using Receive Diversity, Space
Time Block Coding (STBC), and Transmit Beamforming and show that with a 4
element antenna system, as much as 3x improvement in the total number of
concurrent links can be achieved relative to a SISO based network. The results
also show diminishing improvement as the number of antennas is increased beyond
4, and the maximum allowable transmit power is increased beyond 10 dBm (for the
simulated parameters).
