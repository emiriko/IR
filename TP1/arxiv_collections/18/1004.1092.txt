We present a new module of micrOMEGAs devoted to the computation of indirect
signals from dark matter annihilation in any new model with a stable weakly
interacting particle. The code provides the mass spectrum, cross-sections,
relic density and exotic fluxes of gamma rays, positrons and antiprotons. The
propagation of charged particles in the Galactic halo is handled with a new
module that allows to easily modify the propagation parameters.
