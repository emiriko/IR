The effects of coherently enhanced radiation reaction on the motion of
subwavelength electron bunches in interaction with intense laser pulses are
analyzed. The radiation reaction force behaves as a radiation pressure in the
laser beam direction, combined with a viscous force in the perpendicular
direction. Due to Coulomb expansion of the electron bunch, coherent radiation
reaction effects only occur in the initial stage of the laser-bunch interaction
while the bunch is still smaller than the wavelength. It is shown that this
initial stage can have observable effects on the trajectory of the bunch. By
scaling the system to larger bunch charges, these effects may be increased to
such an extent that they can suppress the radial instability normally found in
ponderomotive acceleration schemes, thereby enabling the full potential of
laser-vacuum electron bunch acceleration to GeV energies.
