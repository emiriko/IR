We announce the identification of a new cataclysmic variable star in the
field of the Kepler Mission, KIC J192410.81+445934.9. This system was
identified during a search for compact pulsators in the Kepler field.
High-speed photometry reveals coherent large-amplitude variability with a
period of 2.94 h. Rapid, large-amplitude quasi-periodic variations are also
detected on time scales of ~1200 s and ~650 s. Time-resolved spectroscopy
covering one half photometric period shows shallow, broad Balmer and He I
absorption lines with bright emission cores as well as strong He II and Bowen
blend emission. Radial velocity variations are also observed in the Balmer and
He I emission lines that are consistent with the photometric period. We
therefore conclude that KIC J192410.81+445934.9 is a nova-like variable of the
UX UMa class in or near the period gap, and it may belong to the rapidly
growing subclass of SW Sex systems. Based on 2MASS photometry and companion
star models, we place a lower limit on the distance to the system of ~500 pc.
Due to limitations of our discovery data, additional observations including
spectroscopy and polarimetry are needed to confirm the nature of this object.
Such data will help to further understanding of the behavior of nova-like
variables in the critical period range of 3-4 h, where standard cataclysmic
variable evolutionary theory finds major problems. The presence of this system
in the Kepler mission field-of-view also presents a unique opportunity to
obtain a continuous photometric data stream of unparalleled length and
precision on a cataclysmic variable system.
