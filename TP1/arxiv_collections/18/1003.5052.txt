The correlation between distant Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) and foreground galaxy
clusters is re-examined by using the well localized (with an accuracy down to a
few arcseconds) Swift/XRT GRBs. The galaxy clusters are compiled from both
X-ray selected ROSAT brightest cluster sample (BCS) and BCS extension by
requiring $\delta \geq0\degr$ and $b\geq20\degr$. The Swift/XRT GRBs fulfilling
the above selection criteria are cross-correlated with the clusters. Both
Nearest-Neighbor Analysis and angular two-point cross-correlation function show
that there is no enough evidence supporting the correlation between the GRBs
and foreground clusters. We suggest that the non-correlation is probably
related to the GRB number-flux relation slope.
