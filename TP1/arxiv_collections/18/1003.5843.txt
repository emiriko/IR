To understand the formation of a magnetically dominated molecular cloud from
an atomic cloud, we study the interaction of a weak, radiative shock with a
magnetised cloud. The thermally stable warm atomic cloud is initially in static
equilibrium with the surrounding hot ionised gas. A shock propagating through
the hot medium then interacts with the cloud. We follow the dynamical evolution
of the shocked cloud with a time-dependent ideal magnetohydrodynamic code. By
performing the simulations in 3D, we investigate the effect of different
magnetic field orientations including parallel, perpendicular and oblique to
the shock normal. We find that the angle between the shock normal and the
magnetic field must be small to produce clouds with properties similar to
observed molecular clouds.
