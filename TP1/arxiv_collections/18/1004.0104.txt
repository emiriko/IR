We analyze the scattering of the surface plasmon incident at a planar
interface between two dielectrics. By using the scattering matrix technique,
developed by Oulton et al. [Phys. Rev. B 76, 035408 (2007)], we calculate the
transmission, reflection coefficients and radiative losses for oblique incident
angles. We found that the transmission of a surface wave through a single
interface between two dielectrics may be accompanied with radiation losses of
10-40 per cent of the plasmon energy.
