We present a new method for nanoscale atom lithography. We propose the use of
a supersonic atomic beam, which provides an extremely high-brightness and cold
source of fast atoms. The atoms are to be focused onto a substrate using a thin
magnetic film, into which apertures with widths on the order of 100 nm have
been etched. Focused spot sizes near or below 10 nm, with focal lengths on the
order of 10 microns, are predicted. This scheme is applicable both to precision
patterning of surfaces with metastable atomic beams and to direct deposition of
material.
