We consider pairs (X,A), where X is a variety with klt singularities and A is
a formal product of ideals on X with exponents in a fixed set that satisfies
the Descending Chain Condition. We also assume that X has (formally) bounded
singularities, in the sense that it is, formally locally, a subvariety in a
fixed affine space defined by equations of bounded degree. We prove in this
context a conjecture of Shokurov, predicting that the set of log canonical
thresholds for such pairs satisfies the Ascending Chain Condition.
