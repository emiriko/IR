High-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy measurements have been
carried out on an optimally doped cuprate Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+{\delta}. The
momentum-dependent linewidth and the dispersion of an A1 optical phonon are
obtained. Based on these data as well as the detailed knowledge of the
electronic structure from angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we develop
a scheme to determine the full structure of electron-phonon coupling for a
specific phonon mode, thus providing a general method for directly resolving
the EPC matrix element in systems with anisotropic electronic structures.
