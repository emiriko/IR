Long-lived >100 MeV emission has been a common feature of most Fermi-LAT
detected gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), e.g., detected up to ~10^3s in long GRBs
080916C and 090902B and ~10^2s in short GRB 090510. This emission is consistent
with being produced by synchrotron emission of electrons accelerated to high
energy by the relativistic collisionless shock propagating into the weakly
magnetized medium. Here we show that this high-energy afterglow emission
constrains the preshock magnetic field to satisfy 1(n/1cc)^{9/8}
mG<B<10^2(n/1cc)^{3/8}mG, where n is the preshock density, more stringent than
the previous constraint by X-ray afterglow observations on day scale. This
suggests that the preshock magnetic field is strongly amplified, most likely by
the streaming of high energy shock accelerated particles.
