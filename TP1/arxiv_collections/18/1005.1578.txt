Based on the recently introduced model of arXiv:0912.2634 for non-commutative
U(1) gauge fields, a generalized version of that action for U(N) gauge fields
is put forward. In this approach to non-commutative gauge field theories, UV/IR
mixing effects are circumvented by introducing additional 'soft breaking' terms
in the action which implement an IR damping mechanism. The techniques used are
similar to those of the well-known Gribov-Zwanziger approach to QCD.
