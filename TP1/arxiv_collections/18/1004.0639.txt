There are many industrial situations where rods are used to stir a fluid, or
where rods repeatedly stretch a material such as bread dough or taffy. The goal
in these applications is to stretch either material lines (in a fluid) or the
material itself (for dough or taffy) as rapidly as possible. The growth rate of
material lines is conveniently given by the topological entropy of the rod
motion. We discuss the problem of optimising such rod devices from a
topological viewpoint. We express rod motions in terms of generators of the
braid group, and assign a cost based on the minimum number of generators needed
to write the braid. We show that for one cost function -- the topological
entropy per generator -- the optimal growth rate is the logarithm of the golden
ratio. For a more realistic cost function,involving the topological entropy per
operation where rods are allowed to move together, the optimal growth rate is
the logarithm of the silver ratio, $1+\sqrt{2}$. We show how to construct
devices that realise this optimal growth, which we call silver mixers.
