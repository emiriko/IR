The solar chromosphere is a vigorously dynamic region of the sun, where waves
and magnetic fields play an important role. To improve chromospheric
diagnostics, we present new observations in Ca II 8542 carried out with the
SST/CRISP on La Palma, working in full-Stokes mode. We measured Stokes line
profiles in active regions. The line profiles observed close to the solar limb
show signals in all four Stokes parameters, while profiles observed close to
disk center only show signals above the noise level in Stokes I and V. We used
the LTE inversion code 'NICOLE' to derive atmospheric parameters in umbral
flashes present in a small round sunspot without penumbra.
