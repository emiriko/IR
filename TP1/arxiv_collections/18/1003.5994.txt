A new q-deformed logistic map is proposed and it is found to have concavity
in parts of the x-space. Its one-cycle and two-cycle non-trivial fixed points
are obtained which are found to be qualitatively and quantitatively different
from those of the usual logistic map. The stability of the proposed q-logistic
map is studied using Lyapunov exponent and with a change in the value of the
deformation parameter q, one is able to go from the chaotic to regular
dynamical regime. The implications of this q-logistic map on Parrondo's paradox
are examined.
