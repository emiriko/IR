We investigate the qubit geometric phase and its properties in dependence on
the mechanism for decoherence of a qubit weakly coupled to its environment. We
consider two sources of decoherence: dephasing coupling (without exchange of
energy with environment) and dissipative coupling (with exchange of energy).
Reduced dynamics of the qubit is studied in terms of the rigorous Davies
Markovian quantum master equation, both at zero and non--zero temperature. For
pure dephasing coupling, the geometric phase varies monotonically with respect
to the polar angle (in the Bloch sphere representation) parameterizing an
initial state of the qubit. Moreover, it is antisymmetric about some points on
the geometric phase-polar angle plane. This is in distinct contrast to the case
of dissipative coupling for which the variation of the geometric phase with
respect to the polar angle typically is non-monotonic, displaying local extrema
and is not antisymmetric. Sensitivity of the geometric phase to details of the
decoherence source can make it a tool for testing the nature of the
qubit--environment interaction.
