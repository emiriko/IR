Three different topics in phase-field modelling of solidification are
discussed, with particular emphasis on the limitations of the currently
available modelling approaches. First, thin-interface limits of two-sided
phase-field models are examined, and it is shown that the antitrapping current
is in general not sufficient to remove all thin-interface effects. Second,
orientation-field models for polycrystalline solidification are analysed, and
it is shown that the standard relaxational equation of motion for the
orientation field is incorrect in coherent polycrystalline matter. Third, it is
pointed out that the standard procedure to incorporate fluctuations into the
phase-field approach cannot be used in a straightforward way for a quantitative
description of nucleation.
