We report a photon number resolving detector using two-dimensional electron
gas (2DEG) based transistors. When the photon pulses impinge on the absorption
region, the generated phonons dissipate ballistically in the 2DEG toward the
trench isolated nanowire transistors near the surface. The phonon-electron
interaction induces a positive conductance in the transistors, resulting in a
current increase. With this principle, we obtain an internal quantum efficiency
for this type of detector of up to 85%.
