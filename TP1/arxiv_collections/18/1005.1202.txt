Emphasis is given on the observation of a convergence to a critical value of
the effective mass of a heavy fermion compound by tuning it through a quantum
instability either by applying pressure or magnetic field from an
antiferromagnetic (AF) to a paramagnetic (PM) ground state. Macroscopic and
microscopic results are discussed and the main message is to rush to the
discovery of an ideal material whose Fermi surface could be fully observed on
both sides of each quantum phase transition.
