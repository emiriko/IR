We investigate the evolution of solitary waves in a nonlocal medium in the
presence of disorder. By using a perturbational approach, we show that an
increasing degree of nonlocality may largely hamper the Brownian motion of
self-trapped wave-packets. The result is valid for any kind of nonlocality and
in the presence of non-paraxial effects. Analytical predictions are compared
with numerical simulations based on stochastic partial differential equation
