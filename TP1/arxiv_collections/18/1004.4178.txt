Numerical time evolution of transport states using time dependent Density
Matrix Renormalization Group (td-DMRG) methods has turned out to be a powerful
tool to calculate the linear and finite bias conductance of interacting
impurity systems coupled to non-interacting one-dimensional leads. Several
models, including the Interacting Resonant Level Model (IRLM), the Single
Impurity Anderson Model (SIAM), as well as models with different multi site
structures, have been subject of investigations in this context. In this work
we give an overview of the different numerical approaches that have been
successfully applied to the problem and go into considerable detail when we
comment on the techniques that have been used to obtain the full
I--V-characteristics for the IRLM. Using a model of spinless fermions
consisting of an extended interacting nanostructure attached to non-interacting
leads, we explain the method we use to obtain the current--voltage
characteristics and discuss the finite size effects that have to be taken into
account. We report results for the linear and finite bias conductance through a
seven site structure with weak and strong nearest-neighbor interactions.
Comparison with exact diagonalisation results in the non-interacting limit
serve as a verification of the accuracy of our approach. Finally we discuss the
possibility of effectively enlarging the finite system by applying damped
boundaries and give an estimate of the effective system size and accuracy that
can be expected in this case.
