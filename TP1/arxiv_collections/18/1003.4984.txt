We describe a accurate and fast pixel-based statistical method to interpolate
fields of arbitrary spin on the sphere. We call this method Fast and Lean
Interpolation on the Sphere (FLINTS). The method predicts the optimal
interpolated values based on the theory of isotropic Gaussian random fields and
provides an accurate error estimate at no additional cost. We use this method
to compute lensed Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) maps precisely and quickly,
achieving a relative precision of 0.02% at a HEALPix resolution of Nside=4096,
for a bandlimit of l_max=4096 in the same time it takes to simulate the
original, unlensed CMB map. The method is suitable for efficient, distributed
memory parallelization. The power spectra of our lensed maps are accurate to
better than 0.5% at l=3000 for the temperature, the E and B mode of the
polarization. As expected theoretically, we demonstrate that, on realistic
cases, this method is between two to three orders of magnitude more precise
than other known interpolation methods for the same computational cost.
