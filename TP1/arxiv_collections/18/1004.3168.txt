One of the most remarkable results of quantum mechanics is the fact that
many-body quantum systems may exhibit phase transitions even at zero
temperature. Quantum fluctuations, deeply rooted in Heisenberg's uncertainty
principle, and not thermal fluctuations, drive the system from one phase to
another. Typically, the relative strength of two competing terms in the
system's Hamiltonian is changed across a finite critical value. A well-known
example is the Mott-Hubbard quantum phase transition from a superfluid to an
insulating phase, which has been observed for weakly interacting bosonic atomic
gases. However, for strongly interacting quantum systems confined to
lower-dimensional geometry a novel type of quantum phase transition may be
induced for which an arbitrarily weak perturbation to the Hamiltonian is
sufficient to drive the transition. Here, for a one-dimensional (1D) quantum
gas of bosonic caesium atoms with tunable interactions, we observe the
commensurate-incommensurate quantum phase transition from a superfluid
Luttinger liquid to a Mott-insulator. For sufficiently strong interactions, the
transition is induced by adding an arbitrarily weak optical lattice
commensurate with the atomic granularity, which leads to immediate pinning of
the atoms. We map out the phase diagram and find that our measurements in the
strongly interacting regime agree well with a quantum field description based
on the exactly solvable sine-Gordon model. We trace the phase boundary all the
way to the weakly interacting regime where we find good agreement with the
predictions of the 1D Bose-Hubbard model. Our results open up the experimental
study of quantum phase transitions, criticality, and transport phenomena beyond
Hubbard-type models in the context of ultracold gases.
