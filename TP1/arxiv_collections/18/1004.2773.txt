In this paper, we propose a systematic design of space-time block codes
(STBC) which can achieve high rate and full diversity when the partial
interference cancellation (PIC) group decoding is used at receivers. The
proposed codes can be applied to any number of transmit antennas and admit a
low decoding complexity while achieving full diversity. For M transmit
antennas, in each codeword real and imaginary parts of PM complex information
symbols are parsed into P diagonal layers and then encoded, respectively. With
PIC group decoding, it is shown that the decoding complexity can be reduced to
a joint decoding of M/2 real symbols. In particular, for 4 transmit antennas,
the code has real symbol pairwise (i.e., single complex symbol) decoding that
achieves full diversity and the code rate is 4/3. Simulation results
demonstrate that the full diversity is offered by the newly proposed STBC with
the PIC group decoding.
