We report on a strategy to maximize the number of chromium atoms transferred
from a magneto-optical trap into an optical trap through accumulation in
metastable states via strong optical pumping. We analyse how the number of
atoms in a chromium Bose Einstein condensate can be raised by a proper handling
of the metastable state populations. Four laser diodes have been implemented to
address the four levels that are populated during the MOT phase. The individual
importance of each state is specified. To stabilize two of our laser diode, we
have developed a simple ultrastable passive reference cavity whose long term
stability is better than 1 MHz.
