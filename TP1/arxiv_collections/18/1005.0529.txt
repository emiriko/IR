Using first-principles calculations we analyze the electronic transport
properties of a recently proposed anthraquinone based electrochemical switch.
Robust conductance on/off ratios of several orders of magnitude are observed
due to destructive quantum interference present in the anthraquinone, but
absent in the hydroquinone molecular bridge. A simple explanation of the
interference effect is achieved by transforming the frontier molecular orbitals
into localized molecular orbitals thereby obtaining a minimal tight-binding
model describing the transport in the relevant energy range in terms of hopping
via the localized orbitals. The topology of the tight-binding model, which is
dictated by the symmetries of the molecular orbitals, determines the amount of
quantum interference.
