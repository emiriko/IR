We find a new charged black hole in three-dimensional anti-de Sitter space
using an anisotropic perfect fluid inspired by the noncommutative black hole as
the source of matter and a gaussian distribution of electric charge. We deduce
the thermodynamical quantities of this black hole and compare them with those
of a charged BTZ solution.
