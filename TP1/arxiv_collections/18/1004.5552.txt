In this work we attempt to elucidate the nature of conductivity in polymers
by taking the acid-base doped polyaniline (PAni) polymer. We evaluate the PAni
conductance by using realistic ab initio parameters and including decoherent
processes within the minimal parametrization model of D'Amato-Pastawski. In
contrast to general wisdom, which associates the conducting state with coherent
propagation in a periodic polaronic lattice, we show that decoherence can
account for high conductance in the strongly disordered bipolaronic lattice.
Hence, according to our results, there is no need of considering a mix model of
"conducting" polaronic lattice islands separated by "insulating" bipolaronic
lattice strands as is usually assumed for PAni. We find that without dephasing
events, even very short strands of bipolaronic lattices are not able to sustain
electronic transport. We also include a discussion of specific mechanisms that
should be involved in decoherence rates of PAni and relate them with
Marcus-Hush theory of electron transfer.
