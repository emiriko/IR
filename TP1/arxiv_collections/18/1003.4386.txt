We perform kinetic simulations of diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) in Type
Ia supernova remnants (SNRs) expanding into a uniform interstellar medium
(ISM). Bohm-like diffusion assumed, and simple models for Alfvenic drift and
dissipation are adopted. Phenomenological models for thermal leakage injection
are considered as well. We find that the preshock gas temperature is the
primary parameter that governs the cosmic ray (CR) acceleration efficiency and
energy spectrum, while the CR injection rate is a secondary parameter. For SNRs
in the warm ISM, if the injection fraction is larger than 10^{-4}, the DSA is
efficient enough to convert more than 20 % of the SN explosion energy into CRs
and the accelerated CR spectrum exhibits a concave curvature flattening to
E^{-1.6}. Such a flat source spectrum near the knee energy, however, may not be
reconciled with the CR spectrum observed at Earth. On the other hand, SNRs in
the hot ISM, with an injection fraction smaller than 10^{-4}, are inefficient
accelerators with less than 10 % of the explosion energy getting converted to
CRs. Also the shock structure is almost test-particle like and the ensuing CR
spectrum can be steeper than E^{-2}. With amplified magnetic field strength of
order of 30 microG, Alfven waves generated by the streaming instability may
drift upstream fast enough to make the modified test-particle power-law as
steep as E^{-2.3}, which is more consistent with the observed CR spectrum.
