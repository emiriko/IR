This paper describes irreducible representations in category O of the
rational Cherednik algebra H_c(H_3,h) associated to the exceptional Coxeter
group H_3 and any complex parameter c. We compute the characters of all these
representations explicitly. As a consequence, we classify all the finite
dimensional irreducible representations of H_c(H_3,h).
