An optical resonator is often called fully tunable if its tunable range
exceeds the spectral interval that contains the resonances at all the
characteristic modes of this resonator. For the high Q-factor spheroidal and
toroidal microresonators, this interval coincides with the azimuthal free
spectral range. In this Letter, we demonstrate the first mechanically fully
tunable spheroidal microresonator created of a silica microbubble having a 100
micron order radius and a micron order wall thickness. The tunable bandwidth of
this resonator is more than two times greater than its azimuthal free spectral
range.
