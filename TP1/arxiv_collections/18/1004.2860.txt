In the past few years, IRC bots, malicious programs which are remotely
controlled by the attacker through IRC servers, have become a major threat to
the Internet and users. These bots can be used in different malicious ways such
as issuing distributed denial of services attacks to shutdown other networks
and services, keystrokes logging, spamming, traffic sniffing cause serious
disruption on networks and users. New bots use peer to peer (P2P) protocols
start to appear as the upcoming threat to Internet security due to the fact
that P2P bots do not have a centralized point to shutdown or traceback, thus
making the detection of P2P bots is a real challenge. In response to these
threats, we present an algorithm to detect an individual P2P bot running on a
system by correlating its activities. Our evaluation shows that correlating
different activities generated by P2P bots within a specified time period can
detect these kind of bots.
