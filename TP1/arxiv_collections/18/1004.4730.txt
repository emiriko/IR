Dynamical properties of the classical Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the
triangular lattice are investigated by means of a spin-dynamics simulation and
an analytical calculation. While the model was suggested to exhibit a
topological transition driven by the Z_2-vortex binding-unbinding, weakness of
the associated thermodynamic singularity has made it difficult to observe the
evidence of the Z_2 vortex experimentally so far, only some indirect support.
Here, we show that the signature of the Z_2-vortex excitation and the
vortex-induced topological transition can be captured from the dynamical spin
correlations. In particular, the dynamical spin structure factor exhibits a
characteristic central peak around the Z_2-vortex transition, and this central
peak will be a fingerprint of the Z_2-vortex excitation.
