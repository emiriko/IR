Magnetism of $UGe_2$ is due to the magnetic ordered moments of $5f$ uranium
electrons. The strong spin-orbit coupling splits them into two groups. The
magnetization is investigated in terms of two vector fields ${\bf M}_{1i}$ and
${\bf M}_{2i}$ which identify the local orientation of the magnetization of the
two groups of $f$ electrons. Renormalized spin-wave theory, which accounts for
the magnon-magnon interaction, and its extension are developed to describe two
ferromagnetic phases in the system: low temperature large moment phase
$0<T<T^{*}$ (FM2), where all $5f$ electrons contribute the ordered
ferromagnetic moment, and high temperature low-moment phase $T^{*}<T<T_C$
(FM1), where $f$ electrons are partially ordered. Both phases are strictly
ferromagnetic in accordance with experiment. The magnetization as a function of
temperature is calculated. The anomalous temperature dependence of the ordered
moment, known from the experiments with $UGe_2$, is very well reproduced
theoretically. Below $T_x$ ($T^*$ in the present paper) the ferromagnetic
moment increases in an anomalous way. The new understanding of the anomalous
$FM2\to FM1$ transition, as a result of the magnetic order of two well
separated groups of $f$ electrons, yields the key to an understanding of the
ferromagnetism and transport properties in these compounds.
