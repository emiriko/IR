Previous observational studies of the infrared (IR)-radio relation out to
high redshift employed any detectable star forming systems at a given redshift
within the restricted area of cosmological survey fields. Consequently, the
evolution inferred relies on a comparison between the average IR/radio
properties of (i) very IR-luminous high-z sources and (ii) more heterogeneous
low(er)-z samples that often lack the strongest IR emitters. In this report we
consider populations of objects with comparable luminosities over the last 10
Gyr by taking advantage of deep IR (esp. Spitzer 24 micron) and VLA 1.4 GHz
observations of the COSMOS field. Consistent with recent model predictions,
both Ultra Luminous Infrared Galaxies (ULIRGs) and galaxies on the bright end
of the evolving IR luminosity function do not display any change in their
average IR/radio ratios out to z~2 when corrected for bias. Uncorrected data
suggested ~0.3 dex of positive evolution.
