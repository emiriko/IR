We apply the GiBUU model to questions relevant for current and future
neutrino long-baseline experiments, we address in particular the relevance of
charged-current reactions for neutrino disappearance experiments. A correct
identification of charged-current quasielastic (CCQE) events - which is the
signal channel in oscillation experiments - is relevant for the neutrino energy
reconstruction and thus for the oscillation result. We show that about 20% of
the quasielastic cross section is misidentified in present-day experiments and
has to be corrected for by means of event generators. Furthermore, we show that
also a significant part of 1pi+ (> 40%) events is misidentified as CCQE mainly
caused by the pion absorption in the nucleus. We also discuss the dependence of
both of these numbers on experimental detection thresholds. We further
investigate the influence of final-state interactions on the neutrino energy
reconstruction.
