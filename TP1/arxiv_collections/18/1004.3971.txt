The uncertainty in the absolute value of the fluorescence yield is still one
of the main contributions to the total error in the reconstruction of the
primary energy of ultra-energetic air showers using the fluorescence technique.
A significant number of experimental values of the fluorescence yield have been
published in the last years, however reported results are given very often in
different units (photons/MeV or photons/m) and for different wavelength
intervals. In this work we present a comparison of available results normalized
to its value in photons/MeV for the 337 nm band at 800 hPa and 293 K. The
conversion of photons/m to photons/MeV requires an accurate determination of
the energy deposited by the electrons in the field of view of the experimental
setup. We have calculated the energy deposition for each experiment by means of
a detailed Monte Carlo simulation including when possible the geometrical
details of the particular setup. Our predictions on deposited energy, as well
as on some geometrical factors, have been compared with those reported by the
authors of the corresponding experiments and possible corrections to the
fluorescence yields are proposed.
