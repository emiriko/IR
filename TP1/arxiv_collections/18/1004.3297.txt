Supersymmetric models based on anomaly-mediated SUSY breaking (AMSB)
generally give rise to a neutral wino as a WIMP cold dark matter (CDM)
candidate, whose thermal abundance is well below measured values. Here, we
investigate four scenarios to reconcile AMSB dark matter with the measured
abundance: 1. non-thermal wino production due to decays of scalar fields ({\it
e.g} moduli), 2. non-thermal wino production due to decays of gravitinos, 3.
non-thermal wino production due to heavy axino decays, and 4. the case of an
axino LSP, where the bulk of CDM is made up of axions and thermally produced
axinos. In cases 1 and 2, we expect wino CDM to constitute the entire measured
DM abundance, and we investigate wino-like WIMP direct and indirect detection
rates. Wino direct detection rates can be large, and more importantly, are
bounded from below, so that ton-scale noble liquid detectors should access all
of parameter space for m_{\tz_1}\alt 500 GeV. Indirect wino detection rates via
neutrino telescopes and space-based cosmic ray detectors can also be large. In
case 3, the DM would consist of an axion plus wino admixture, whose exact
proportions are very model dependent. In this case, it is possible that both an
axion and a wino-like WIMP could be detected experimentally. In case 4., we
calculate the re-heat temperature of the universe after inflation. In this
case, no direct or indirect WIMP signals should be seen, although direct
detection of relic axions may be possible. For each DM scenario, we show
results for the minimal AMSB model, as well as for the hypercharged and gaugino
AMSB models.
