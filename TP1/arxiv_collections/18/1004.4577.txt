In a regular, flexible chain of Rydberg atoms, a single electronic excitation
localizes on two atoms that are in closer mutual proximity than all others. We
show how the interplay between excitonic and atomic motion causes electronic
excitation and diatomic proximity to propagate through the Rydberg chain as a
combined pulse. In this manner entanglement is transferred adiabatically along
the chain, reminiscent of momentum transfer in Newton's cradle.
