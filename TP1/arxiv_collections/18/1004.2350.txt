We investigate the impact of charm mixing on the model-independent gamma
measurement using Dalitz plot analysis of the three-body D decay from B+->DK+
process, and show that ignoring the mixing at all stages of the analysis is
safe up to a sub-degree level of precision. We also find that in the coherent
production of D0-D0* system in e+e- collisions, the effect of charm mixing is
enhanced, and propose a model-independent method to measure charm mixing
parameters in the time-integrated Dalitz analysis at charm factories.
