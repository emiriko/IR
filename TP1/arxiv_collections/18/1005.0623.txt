We show, using density matrix renormalization group calculations complemented
by field theoretic arguments, that the spin gapped phase of the one dimensional
Kondo-Heisenberg model exhibits quasi-long range superconducting correlations
{\it only} at a non-zero momentum. The local correlations in this phase
resemble those of the pair density wave state which was recently proposed to
describe the phenomenology of the striped ordered high temperature
superconductor {La$_{2-x}$Ba$_x$% CuO$_4$}, in which the spin, charge, and
superconducting orders are strongly intertwined.
