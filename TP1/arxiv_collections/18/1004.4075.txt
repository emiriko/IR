We propose the notion of secrecy gain as a code design criterion for wiretap
lattice codes to be used over an additive white Gaussian noise channel. Our
analysis relies on the error probabilites of both the legitimate user and the
eavesdropper. We focus on geometrical properties of lattices, described by
their theta series, to characterize good wiretap codes.
