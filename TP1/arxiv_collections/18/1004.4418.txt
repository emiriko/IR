The nonnegative viscosity solutions to the infinite heat equation with
homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions are shown to converge as time
increases to infinity to a uniquely determined limit after a suitable time
rescaling. The proof relies on the half-relaxed limits technique as well as
interior positivity estimates and boundary estimates. The expansion of the
support is also studied.
