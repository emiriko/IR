We study time-dependent discrete-time quantum walks on the one-dimensional
lattice. We compute the limit distribution of a two-period quantum walk defined
by two orthogonal matrices. For the symmetric case, the distribution is
determined by one of two matrices. Moreover, limit theorems for two special
cases are presented.
