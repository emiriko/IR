Using photometry of NGC 1097 from the Herschel PACS (Photodetector Array
Camera and Spectrometer) instrument, we study the resolved properties of
thermal dust continuum emission from a circumnuclear starburst ring with a
radius ~ 900 pc. These observations are the first to resolve the structure of a
circumnuclear ring at wavelengths that probe the peak (i.e. lambda ~ 100
micron) of the dust spectral energy distribution. The ring dominates the
far-infrared (far-IR) emission from the galaxy - the high angular resolution of
PACS allows us to isolate the ring's contribution and we find it is responsible
for 75, 60 and 55% of the total flux of NGC 1097 at 70, 100 and 160 micron,
respectively. We compare the far-IR structure of the ring to what is seen at
other wavelengths and identify a sequence of far-IR bright knots that
correspond to those seen in radio and mid-IR images. The mid- and far-IR band
ratios in the ring vary by less than +/- 20% azimuthally, indicating modest
variation in the radiation field heating the dust on ~ 600 pc scales. We
explore various explanations for the azimuthal uniformity in the far-IR colors
of the ring including a lack of well-defined age gradients in the young stellar
cluster population, a dominant contribution to the far-IR emission from dust
heated by older (> 10 Myr) stars and/or a quick smoothing of local enhancements
in dust temperature due to the short orbital period of the ring. Finally, we
improve previous limits on the far-IR flux from the inner ~ 600 pc of NGC 1097
by an order of magnitude, providing a better estimate of the total bolometric
emission arising from the active galactic nucleus and its associated central
starburst.
