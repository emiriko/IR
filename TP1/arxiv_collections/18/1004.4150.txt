We compare our Monte Carlo reaction rates (see Paper II of this series) to
previous results that were obtained by using the classical method of computing
thermonuclear reaction rates. For each reaction, the comparison is presented
using two types of graphs: the first shows the change in reaction rate
uncertainties, while the second displays our new results normalized to the
previously recommended reaction rate. We find that the rates have changed
significantly for almost all reactions considered here. The changes are caused
by (i) our new Monte Carlo method of computing reaction rates (see Paper I of
this series), and (ii) newly available nuclear physics information (see Paper
III of this series).
