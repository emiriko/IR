In addition to the Larmor radiation known from classical electrodynamics,
electrons in a laser field may emit pairs of entangled photons -- which is a
pure quantum effect. We investigate this quantum effect and discuss why it is
suppressed in comparison with the classical Larmor radiation (which is just
Thomson backscattering of the laser photons). Further, we provide an intuitive
explanation of this process (in a simplified setting) in terms of the Unruh
effect.
