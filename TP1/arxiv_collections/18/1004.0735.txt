We consider the possibility of identifying nuclei exhibiting the SU(3)
dynamical symmetry as those having excitation energy ratio R4/2 >= 3.25. For
this purpose, we consider the level statistics of some of these nuclei and
perform interacting boson model (IBM) calculation of level schemes, and
electromagnetic transition rates. We show that only some of these nuclei may be
considered as good examples of the SU(3) dynamical symmetry.
