The ionization dynamics of a two-electron atom in an attosecond XUV-infrared
pump-probe experiment is simulated by solving the time-dependent two-electron
Schr\"odinger equation. A dramatic change of the double ionization (DI) yield
with variation of the pump-probe delay is reported and the governing role of
electron-electron correlations is shown. The results allow for a direct control
of the DI yield and of the relative strength of double and single ionization.
