We study the entanglement dynamics of two qubits, each of which is embedded
into its local amplitude-damping reservoir, and the entanglement distribution
among all the bipartite subsystems including qubit-qubit, qubit-reservoir, and
reservoir-reservoir. It is found that the entanglement can be stably
distributed among all components, which is much different to the result
obtained under the Born-Markovian approximation by C. E. L\'{o}pez {\it et al.}
[Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{101}, 080503 (2008)], and particularly it also
satisfies an identity. Our unified treatment includes the previous results as
special cases. The result may give help to understand the physical nature of
entanglement under decoherence.
