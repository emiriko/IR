Consider the random walk on the permutation group obtained when the step
distribution is uniform on a given conjugacy class. It is shown that there is a
critical time at which two phase transitions occur simultaneously. On the one
hand, the random walk slows down abruptly (i.e., the acceleration drops from 0
to -\infty at this time as n tends to \infty). On the other hand, the largest
cycle size changes from microscopic to giant. The proof of this last result is
both considerably simpler and more general than in a previous result of Oded
Schramm (2005) for random transpositions. It turns out that in the case of
random k-cycles, this critical time is proportional to 1/[k(k-1)], whereas the
mixing time is known to be proportional to 1/k.
