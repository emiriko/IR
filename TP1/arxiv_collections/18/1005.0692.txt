We have measured the complex dynamical conductivity, $\sigma = \sigma_{1} +
i\sigma_{2}$, of superconducting Ba(Fe$_{0.9}$Co$_{0.1}$)$_{2}$As$_{2}$ ($T_{c}
= 22$ K) at terahertz frequencies and temperatures 2 - 30 K. In the frequency
dependence of $\sigma_{1}$ below $T_{c}$, we observe clear signatures of the
superconducting energy gap opening. The temperature dependence of $\sigma_{1}$
demonstrates a pronounced coherence peak at frequencies below 15 cm$^{-1}$ (1.8
meV). The temperature dependence of the penetration depth, calculated from
$\sigma_{2}$, shows power-law behavior at the lowest temperatures. Analysis of
the conductivity data with a two-gap model, gives the smaller isotropic s-wave
gap of $\Delta_{A} = 3$ meV, while the larger gap is highly anisotropic with
possible nodes and its rms amplitude is $\Delta_{0} = 8$ meV. Overall, our
results are consistent with a two-band superconductor with an $s_{\pm}$ gap
symmetry.
