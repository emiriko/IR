A spatially homogeneous and anisotropic Bianchi Type I universe has been
studied with {\omega} <-1 without Big Smash. It is demonstrated that if cosmic
dark energy behaves like a fluid with equation of state p = {\omega}{\rho} (p
and {\rho} being pressure and energy density respectively) as well as
generalized chaplygin gas simultaneously, Big Rip or Big Smash problem does not
arise even for equation of state parameter {\omega} <-1 unlike other phantom
models, here, the scale factor for Bianchi Type I universe is found regular for
all time. The present model is derived by using law of variation of Hubble's
parameter from Bianchi Type I space-time and also the effective role of GCG
behaviour is discussed.
