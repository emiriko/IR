In this paper, we study a quantum anti-Zeno effect (QAZE) purely induced by
repetitive measurements for an artificial atom interacting with a structured
bath. This bath can be artificially realized with coupled resonators in one
dimension and possesses photonic band structure like Bloch electron in a
periodic potential. In the presence of repetitive measurements, the pure QAZE
is discovered as the observable decay is not negligible even for the atomic
energy level spacing outside of the energy band of the artificial bath. If
there were no measurements, the decay would not happen outside of the band. In
this sense, the enhanced decay is completely induced by measurements through
the relaxation channels provided by the bath. Besides, we also discuss the
controversial golden rule decay rates originated from the van Hove's
singularities and the effects of the counter-rotating terms.
