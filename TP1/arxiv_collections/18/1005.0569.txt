We present a hitherto unknown fundamental limitation to a basic measurement:
that of the position of a quantum object when the total momentum of the object
and apparatus is conserved. This result extends the famous Wigner-Araki-Yanase
(WAY) theorem, and shows that accurate position measurements are only
practically feasible if there is a large momentum uncertainty in the apparatus.
