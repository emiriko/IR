We show that controlled dissipation can be used as a tool for exploring
fundamental phenomena and managing mesoscopic systems of cold atoms and
Bose-Einstein condensates. Even the simplest boson-Josephson junction, that is,
a Bose-Einstein condensate in a double-well trap, subjected to removal of atoms
from one of the two potential minima allows one to observe such phenomena as
the suppression of losses and the nonlinear Zeno effect. In such a system the
controlled dissipation can be used to create desired macroscopic states and
implement controlled switching among different quantum regimes.
