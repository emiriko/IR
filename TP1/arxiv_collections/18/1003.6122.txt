This paper analyzes coherent backscattering of intense laser light by two
randomly placed distant atoms. Starting from the general two-atom master
equation, we analytically derive the elastic and inelastic background and
interference components of the double scattering spectrum. By expressing the
final results in terms of single-atom observables, the two-atom problem is
shown to be equivalent to a description in terms of single atoms under
bichromatic driving.
