Let f be a modular eigenform of even weight k>0 and new at a prime p dividing
exactly the level, with respect to an indefinite quaternion algebra. The theory
of Fontaine-Mazur allows to attach to f a monodromy module D_FM(f) and an
L-invariant L_FM(f). The first goal of this paper is building a suitable p-adic
integration theory that allows us to construct a monodromy module D(f) and an
L-invariant L(f) in the spirit of Darmon. We conjecture both monodromy modules
are isomorphic, and in particular the two L-invariants are equal. For the
second goal of this note we assume the conjecture is true. Let K be a real
quadratic field and assume the sign of the functional equation of the L-series
of f over K is -1. The Bloch-Beilinson conjectures suggest that there should be
a supply of elements in the Mordell-Weil group of the motive attached to f over
the tower of narrow ring class fields of K. Generalizing work of Darmon for
k=2, we give a construction of local cohomology classes which we expect to
arise from global classes and satisfy an explicit reciprocity law, accounting
for the above prediction.
