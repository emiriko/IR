We discuss the existence of a non-abelian gauge structure associated with
flavor mixing. In the specific case of two flavor mixing of Dirac neutrino
fields, we show that this reformulation allows to define flavor neutrino states
which preserve the Poincar\'e structure. Phenomenological consequences of our
analysis are explored.
