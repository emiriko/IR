We present a detailed temperature-dependent Raman light scattering study of
optical phonons in molecular-beam-epitaxy-grown films of the electron-doped
superconductor La_{2-x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4} close to optimal doping (x ~ 0.08, T_c =
29 K and x ~ 0.1, T_c = 27 K). The main focus of this work is a detailed
characterization and microstructural analysis of the films. Based on
micro-Raman spectroscopy in combination with x-ray diffraction,
energy-dispersive x-ray analysis, and scanning electron microscopy, some of the
observed phonon modes can be attributed to micron-sized inclusions of Cu_{2}O.
In the slightly underdoped film (x ~ 0.08), both the Cu_{2}O modes and others
that can be assigned to the La_{2-x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4} matrix show pronounced
softening and narrowing upon cooling below T ~ T_c. Based on control
measurements on commercial Cu_{2}O powders and on a comparison to prior Raman
scattering studies of other high-temperature superconductors, we speculate that
proximity effects at La_{2-x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4}/Cu_{2}O interfaces may be
responsible for these anomalies. Experiments on the slightly overdoped
La_{2-x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4} film (x ~ 0.1) did not reveal comparable phonon
anomalies.
