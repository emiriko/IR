The present work performs an asteroseismic study of a gamma Doradus star
member of the open cluster NGC 2506. This work conjugates the observational
information of the star and the strong constraints imposed by the cluster
membership, with the latest developed theoretical asteroseismic tools for the
modelling of this type of objects, in particular the Frequency Ratio Method
(FRM) and Time-Dependent Convection (TDC), to study the gamma Dor stars found
in the NGC 2506 stellar cluster. The use of both techniques gives us the
opportunity of constructing a self-consistent procedure, allowing the mode
identification and improving the modelling of the gamma Dor members of the
cluster. In this work we present the result of the analysis of the first target
of our project, showing the advantadge of modelling cluster member's gamma Dor
stars. This is the first step in a more ambitious project. In the near future,
we plan to expand the study to other variable members of the NGC 2506 cluster.
This will improve our knowledge of gamma Dor pulsators and probe the
self-consistency of our procedures.
