This paper presents a spatial encryption technique for secured transmission
of data in networks. The algorithm is designed to break the ciphered data
packets into multiple data which are to be packaged into a spatial template. A
secure and efficient mechanism is provided to convey the information that is
necessary for obtaining the original data at the receiver-end from its parts in
the packets. An authentication code (MAC) is also used to ensure authenticity
of every packet.
