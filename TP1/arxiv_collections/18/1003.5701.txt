We numerically calculate the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate (Rs) in the
superconducting state in terms of anisotropic s-wave gaps. By taking into
account electron-phonon coupling, our calculated Rs for a conventional s-wave
superconductor, indium, is in quantitative agreement with the experimental data
with a clear Hebel-Slichter peak. In contrast, by using the highly anisotropic
s-wave gaps inferred from the magnetic penetration depth and scanning tunneling
microscopy, our calculated Rs curves for electron-doped
Pr_{0.91}LaCe_{0.09}CuO_{4-y} show no Hebel-Slichter peak, in agreement with
the experimental data. Finally, the observed weak nonmagnetic pair-breaking
effect provides unambiguous evidence for a highly anisotropic s-wave gap in
this underdoped cuprate.
