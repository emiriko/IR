Multi-layer graphene on the carbon face of silicon carbide is an intriguing
electronic system which typically consists of a stack of ten or more layers.
Rotational stacking faults in this system dramatically reduce inter-layer
coherence. In this article we report on the influence of inter-layer
interactions, which remain strong even when coherence is negligible, on the
Fermi liquid properties of charged graphene layers. We find that inter-layer
interactions increase the magnitudes of correlation energies and decrease
quasiparticle velocities, even when remote-layer carrier densities are small,
and that they lessen the influence of exchange and correlation on the
distribution of carriers across layers.
