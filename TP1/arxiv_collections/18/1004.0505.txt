The role of system size and momentum dependent effects are analyzed in
multifragmenation by simulating symmetric reactions of Ca+Ca, Ni+Ni, Nb+Nb,
Xe+Xe, Er+Er, Au+Au, and U+U at incident energies between 50 MeV/nucleon and
1000 MeV/nucleon and over full impact parameter zones. Our detailed study
reveals that there exist a system size dependence when reaction is simulated
with momentum dependent interactions. This dependence exhibits a mass power law
behavior.
