Motivated by a recent experiment on the superfluid 3He A-phase with a chiral
p-wave pairing confined in a thin slab, we propose designing a concrete
experimental setup for observing the Majorana edge modes that appear around the
circumference edge region. We solve the quasi-classical Eilenberger equation,
which is quantitatively reliable, to evaluate several observables. To derive
the property inherent to the Majorana edge state, the full quantum mechanical
Bogoliubov-de Gennes equation is solved in this setting. On the basis of the
results obtained, we perform decisive experiments to check the Majorana nature.
