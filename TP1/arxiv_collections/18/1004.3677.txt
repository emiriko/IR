We study the competition between an instantaneous local Coulomb repulsion and
a boson mediated retarded attraction, as described by the Hubbard-Holstein
model. Restricting to the case of half filling, the ground-state phase diagram
and the transitions from antiferromagnetically ordered states to charge ordered
states are analyzed. The calculations are based on the model in large
dimensions, so that dynamical mean field theory can be applied, and the
associated impurity problem is solved using the numerical renormalization group
method. The transition is found to occur when electron-electron coupling
strength $U$ and the induced interaction $\lambda$ due to electron-phonon
coupling approximately coincide, $U\simeq \lambda$. We find a continuous
transition for small coupling and large $\omega_0$, and a discontinuous one for
large coupling and/or small $\omega_0$. We present results for the order
parameters, the static expectation values for the electrons and phonons, and
the corresponding spectral functions. They illustrate the different types of
behavior to be seen near the transitions. Additionally, the quasiparticle
properties are calculated in the normal state, which leads to a consistent
interpretation of the low energy excitations.
