The generalization of the factorization method performed by Mielnik [J. Math.
Phys. {\bf 25}, 3387 (1984)] opened new ways to generate exactly solvable
potentials in quantum mechanics. We present an application of Mielnik's method
to hypergeometric type operators. It is based on some solvable Riccati
equations and leads to a unitary description of the quantum systems exactly
solvable in terms of orthogonal polynomials or associated special functions.
