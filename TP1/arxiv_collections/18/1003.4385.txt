In the present paper we provide new examples of marginally trapped surfaces
and tubes in FLRW spacetimes by using a basic relation between these objects
and CMC surfaces in 3-manifolds. We also provide a new method to construct
marginally trapped surfaces in closed FLRW spacetimes, which is based on the
classical Hopf map. The utility of this method is illustrated by providing
marginally trapped surfaces crossing expanding and collapsing regions of a
closed FLRW spacetime. The approach introduced in this paper is also extended
to twisted spaces.
