An alternative derivation is presented of the infinitely many exceptional
Wilson and Askey-Wilson polynomials, which were introduced by the present
authors in 2009. Darboux-Crum transformations intertwining the discrete quantum
mechanical systems of the original and the exceptional polynomials play an
important role. Infinitely many continuous Hahn polynomials are derived in the
same manner. The present method provides a simple proof of the shape invariance
of these systems as in the corresponding cases of the exceptional Laguerre and
Jacobi polynomials.
