In this work we establish a correspondence between the tachyon, K-essence and
dilaton scalar field models with the interacting entropy-corrected holographic
dark (ECHD) model in non-flat FRW universe. The reconstruction of potentials
and dynamics of these scalar fields according to the evolutionary behavior of
the interacting ECHDE model are be done. It has been shown that the phantom
divide can not be crossed in ECHDE tachyon model while it is achieved for ECHDE
K-essence and ECHDE dilaton scenarios. At last we calculate the limiting case
of interacting ECHDE model, without entropy-correction.
