A new catalog of isolated galaxies from The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (DR5) is
presented. 1520 isolated galaxies were found in 1.4 steradians of sky. The
selection criteria in this so called UNAM-KIAS catalog was implemented from a
variation on the criteria developed by Karachentseva 1973 including full
redshift information. Through an image processing pipeline that takes advantage
from the high resolution (~ 0.4 ''/pix) and high dynamic range of the SDSS
images, a uniform g band morphological classification for all these galaxies is
presented. We identify 80% (SaSm) spirals (50% later than Sbc types) on one
hand, and a scarce population of early-type E(6.5%) and S0(8%) galaxies
amounting to 14.5% on the other hand. This magnitude-limited catalog is ~ 80%
complete at 16.5, 15.6, 15.0, 14.6 and 14.4 magnitudes in the ugriz bands
respectively. Some representative physical properties including SDSS magnitudes
and color distributions, color-color diagrams, absolute magnitude-color, and
concentration-color diagrams as a function of morphological type are presented.
The UNAM-KIAS Morphological Atlas is also released along with this paper. For
each galaxy of type later than Sa, a mosaic is presented that includes: (1) a
g-band logarithmic image, (2) a g band filtered-enhanced image where a Gaussian
kernel of various sizes was applied and (3) an RGB color image from the SDSS
database. For E/S0/Sa galaxies, in addition to the images in (1), (2) and (3),
plots of r band surface brightness and geometric profiles (ellipticity,
Position Angle PA and A4/B4 coefficients of the Fourier series expansions of
deviations of a pure ellipse) are provided...
