The existence of a semiconjugate relation permits the transformation of a
higher order difference equation on a group into an equivalent triangular
system of two difference equations of lower orders. Introducing time-dependent
form symmetries in this paper enables us to identify the semiconjugate property
in a larger set of non-autonomous difference equations than previously
considered. We show that there is a substantial class of equations having this
feature that includes the general (non-autonomous, non-homogeneous) linear
equation with variable coefficients in an arbitrary algebraic field.
