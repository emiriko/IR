This pedagogical review of galaxy cluster simulations is based on three
lectures given at the 2008 Enrico Fermi Summer School entitled "Astrophysics of
Galaxy Clusters". It covers the standard cosmological framework, growth of
perturbations in the linear regime, analytic models for nonlinear perturbation
growth, statistics of galaxy cluster populations, virial scaling relations,
overview of numerical methods, simulating gas in galaxy clusters, basic results
on adiabatic clusters (Santa Barbara cluster comparison project), effect of
additional physics, recent progress in galaxy clustering modeling (Galcons,
turbulence, AGN jets, cluster-wide B-fields), simulating statistical samples
and lightcones, and simulated SZE surveys.
