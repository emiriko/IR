Co-variance matrix formalism gives powerful entanglement criteria for
continuous as well as finite dimensional systems. We use this formalism to
study a mixed channel spin-1 system which is well known in nuclear reactions. A
spin-j state can be visualized as being made up of 2j spinors which are
represented by a constellation of 2j points on a Bloch sphere using Majorana
construction. We extend this formalism to visualize an entangled mixed spin-1
system.
