Do extrasolar planets affect the activity of their host stars? Indications
for chromospheric activity enhancement have been found for a handful of
targets, but in the X-ray regime, conclusive observational evidence is still
missing. We want to establish a sound observational basis to confirm or reject
major effects of Star-Planet Interactions (SPI) in stellar X-ray emissions. We
therefore conduct a statistical analysis of stellar X-ray activity of all known
planet-bearing stars within 30pc distance for dependencies on planetary
parameters such as mass and semimajor axis. We find that in our sample, there
are no significant correlations of X-ray luminosity or the activity indicator
L_X/L_bol with planetary parameters which cannot be explained by selection
effects. Coronal SPI seems to be a phenomenon which might only manifest itself
as a strong effect for a few individual targets, but not to have a major effect
on planet-bearing stars in general.
