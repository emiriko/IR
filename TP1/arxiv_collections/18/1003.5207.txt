We discuss a physical mechanism of a non-BCS nature which can stabilize a
superconducting state in a {\it strongly repulsive} electronic system. By
considering the two-dimensional Hubbard model with spatially modulated electron
hoppings, we demonstrate how kinetic-energy frustration can lead to robust
d-wave superconductivity at {\it arbitrarily} large on-site repulsion. This
phenomenon should be observable in experiments using fermionic atoms, e.g.
${}^{40}K$, in specially prepared optical lattices.
