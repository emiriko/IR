Gravitational waves from the final stages of inspiralling binary neutron
stars are expected to be one of the most important sources for ground-based
gravitational wave detectors. The masses of the components are determinable
from the orbital and chirp frequencies during the early part of the evolution
during which tidal effects provide small correction; however, during this phase
the signal is relatively clean. The accumulated phase shift due to tidal
corrections is characterized by a single quantity, the Love number, which is
sensitive to the compactness parameter M/R and the star's internal structure,
and its determination could constrain the star's radius. We show that the Love
number of normal neutron stars are much different from those of self-bound
strange quark matter stars and could therefore provide an important way to
distinguish between these two classes of stars.
