We use recent observations of the He I $\lambda10830 \AA$ absorption line and
3D hydrodynamical numerical simulations of the winds collision, to strengthen
the case for an orientation of the semimajor axis of the massive binary system
Eta Carinae where the secondary star is toward us at periastron passage. Those
observations show that the fast blue absorption component exists for only
several weeks prior to the periastron passage. We show that the transient
nature of the fast blue absorption component supports a geometry where the fast
secondary wind, both pre and post-shock material, passes in front of the
primary star near periastron passage.
