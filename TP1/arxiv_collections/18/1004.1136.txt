In terms of the stock exchange returns, we compute the analytic expression of
the probability distributions F{DAX,+} and F{DAX,-} of the normalized positive
and negative DAX (Germany) index daily returns r(t). Furthermore, we define the
alpha re-scaled DAX daily index positive returns r(t)^alpha and negative
returns (-r(t))^alpha that we call, after normalization, the alpha positive
fluctuations and alpha negative fluctuations. We use the Kolmogorov-Smirnov
statistical test, as a method, to find the values of alpha that optimize the
data collapse of the histogram of the alpha fluctuations with the
Bramwell-Holdsworth-Pinton (BHP) probability density function. The optimal
parameters that we found are alpha+=0.50 and alpha-=0.48. Since the BHP
probability density function appears in several other dissimilar phenomena, our
results reveal universality in the stock exchange markets.
