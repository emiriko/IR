Scott's information systems provide a categorically equivalent, intensional
description of Scott domains and continuous functions. Following a well
established pattern in denotational semantics, we define a linear version of
information systems, providing a model of intuitionistic linear logic (a
new-Seely category), with a "set-theoretic" interpretation of exponentials that
recovers Scott continuous functions via the co-Kleisli construction. From a
domain theoretic point of view, linear information systems are equivalent to
prime algebraic Scott domains, which in turn generalize prime algebraic
lattices, already known to provide a model of classical linear logic.
