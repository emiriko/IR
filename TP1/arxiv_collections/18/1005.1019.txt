In this Letter, we propose a new type of lossless metamaterial whose
effective permittivity is tunable from negative to positive values. Its optical
response is studied analytically and numerically. We further demonstrate that
this tunable metamaterial can significantly modulate the phase of an incident
pulse with negligible reflection loss, functioning as an efficient phase
shifter.
