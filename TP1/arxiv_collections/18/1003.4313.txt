We present a spectroscopic analysis of white dwarfs found in the Kiso survey.
Spectroscopic observations at high signal-to-noise ratio have been obtained for
all DA and DB stars in the Kiso Schmidt ultraviolet excess survey (KUV stars).
These observations led to the reclassification of several KUV objects,
including the discovery of three unresolved DA+DB double degenerate binaries.
The atmospheric parameters (Teff and log g) are obtained from detailed model
atmosphere fits to optical spectroscopic data. The mass distribution of our
sample is characterized by a mean value of 0.606 Msun and a dispersion of 0.135
Msun for DA stars, and 0.758 Msun and a dispersion of 0.192 Msun for DB stars.
Absolute visual magnitudes obtained from our spectroscopic fits allow us to
derive an improved luminosity function for the DA and DB stars identified in
the Kiso survey. Our luminosity function is found to be significantly different
from earlier estimates based on empirical photometric calibrations of Mv for
the same sample. The results for the DA stars now appear entirely consistent
with those obtained for the PG survey using the same spectroscopic approach.
The space density for DA stars with Mv<12.75 is 2.80X10^-4 pc^-3 in the Kiso
survey, which is 9.6% smaller than the value found in the PG survey. The
completeness of both surveys is briefly discussed.
