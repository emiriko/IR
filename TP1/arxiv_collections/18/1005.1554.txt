In addition to electronic polarization or charge redistribution, the shape of
neutral conjugated molecules yields position-dependent ionization potentials
and electron affinities in organic thin films. Self-consistent I(n) and A(n)
are computed in each layer n of 10-layer films of prototypical organics on a
metal. The depth dependence of I(n) is discussed at surfaces of anthracene, C60
and PTCDA. The shape contribution can be substantial, up to 0.5 eV, and comes
primarily from charge-quadrupole interactions.
