We consider quantum computations comprising only commuting gates, known as
IQP computations, and provide compelling evidence that the task of sampling
their output probability distributions is unlikely to be achievable by any
efficient classical means. More specifically we introduce the class post-IQP of
languages decided with bounded error by uniform families of IQP circuits with
post-selection, and prove first that post-IQP equals the classical class PP.
Using this result we show that if the output distributions of uniform IQP
circuit families could be classically efficiently sampled, even up to 41%
multiplicative error in the probabilities, then the infinite tower of classical
complexity classes known as the polynomial hierarchy, would collapse to its
third level. We mention some further results on the classical simulation
properties of IQP circuit families, in particular showing that if the output
distribution results from measurements on only O(log n) lines then it may in
fact be classically efficiently sampled.
