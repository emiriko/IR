Excited states in 212Po have been populated by alpha transfer using the
208Pb(18O,14C) reaction at 85MeV beam energy and studied with the EUROBALL IV
gamma multidetector array. The level scheme has been extended up to ~ 3.2 MeV
excitation energy from the triple gamma coincidence data. Spin and parity
values of most of the observed states have been assigned from the gamma angular
distributions and gamma -gamma angular correlations. Several gamma lines with
E(gamma) < 1 MeV have been found to be shifted by the Doppler effect, allowing
for the measurements of the associated lifetimes by the DSAM method. The
values, found in the range [0.1-0.6] ps, lead to very enhanced E1 transitions.
All the emitting states, which have non-natural parity values, are discussed in
terms of alpha-208Pb structure. They are in the same excitation-energy range as
the states issued from shell-model configurations.
