These proceedings are a summary of four lectures given at the Theoretical
Advanced Study Institute in Elementary Particle Physics (TASI) in 2009. These
lectures provide a basic introduction to experimental particle physics and the
Large Hadron Collider experiments at CERN, with many general examples from the
(still running) Fermilab Tevatron.
