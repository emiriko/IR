Hom-alternative and Hom-Jordan algebras are shown to give rise to Hom-Nambu
algebras of arities 2^{k+1} + 1. The class of n-ary Hom-Maltsev algebras is
studied. Multiplicative n-ary Hom-Nambu-Lie algebras are shown to be n-ary
Hom-Maltsev algebras. Examples of ternary Hom-Maltsev algebras that are not
ternary Hom-Nambu-Lie algebras are given. Ternary Hom-Maltsev algebras are
shown to arise from composition algebras.
