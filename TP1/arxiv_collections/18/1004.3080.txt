$\Theta$ function is defined based upon Kronecher symbol. In light of the
principle of inclusion-exclusion, $\Theta$ function of sine function is used to
denote the distribution of composites and primes. The structure of Goldbach
Conjecture has been analyzed, and $\Xi$ function is brought forward by the
linear diophantine equation; by relating to $\Theta$ function, the interval
distribution of composite pairs and prime pairs (i.e. the Goldbach Conjecture)
is thus obtained. In the end, Abel's Theorem (Multiplication of Series) is used
to discuss the lower limit of the distribution of the interval prime pairs.
