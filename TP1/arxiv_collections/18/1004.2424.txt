In this paper we study the L\'evy Ornstein- Uhlenbeck equation $\partial_t
X_t=-m\,X_t+\eta$. The transition kernel of the L\'evy Ornstein- Uhlenbeck
process is given by a series which is not convergent in general, a large
diffusion expansion of the transition kernel of the L\'evy Ornstein- Uhlenbeck
process will be given as well. The obtained series can be re-expressed in terms
of generalized Feynman graphs and Feynman rules.
