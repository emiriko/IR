Switched-Capacitor Converters (SCC) suffer from a fundamental power loss
deficiency which make their use in some applications prohibitive. The power
loss is due to the inherent energy dissipation when SCC operate between or
outside their output target voltages. This drawback was alleviated in this work
by developing two new classes of SCC providing binary and arbitrary resolution
of closely spaced target voltages. Special attention is paid to SCC topologies
of binary resolution. Namely, SCC systems that can be configured to have a
no-load output to input voltage ratio that is equal to any binary fraction for
a given number of bits. To this end, we define a new number system and develop
rules to translate these numbers into SCC hardware that follows the algebraic
behavior. According to this approach, the flying capacitors are automatically
kept charged to binary weighted voltages and consequently the resolution of the
target voltages follows a binary number representation and can be made higher
by increasing the number of capacitors (bits). The ability to increase the
number of target voltages reduces the spacing between them and, consequently,
increases the efficiency when the input varies over a large voltage range. The
thesis presents the underlining theory of the binary SCC and its extension to
the general radix case. Although the major application is in step-down SCC, a
simple method to utilize these SCC for step-up conversion is also described, as
well as a method to reduce the output voltage ripple. In addition, the generic
and unified model is strictly applied to derive the SCC equivalent resistor,
which is a measure of the power loss. The theoretical predictions are verified
by simulation and experimental results.
