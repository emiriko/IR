This paper studies self-injective algebras of polynomial growth. We prove
that the derived equivalence classification of weakly symmetric algebras of
domestic type coincides with the classification up to stable equivalences (of
Morita type). As for weakly symmetric non-domestic algebras of polynomial
growth, up to some scalar problems, the derived equivalence classification
coincides with the classification up to stable equivalences of Morita type. As
a consequence, we get the validity of the Auslander-Reiten conjecture for
stable equivalences of Morita type between weakly symmetric algebras of
polynomial growth.
