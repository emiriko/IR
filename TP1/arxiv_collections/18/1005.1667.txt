We present the sensitivity of the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array to gravitational
waves emitted by individual super-massive black-hole binary systems in the
early phases of coalescing at the cores of merged galaxies. Our analysis
includes a detailed study of the effects of fitting a pulsar timing model to
non-white timing residuals. Pulsar timing is sensitive at nanoHertz frequencies
and hence complementary to LIGO and LISA. We place a sky-averaged constraint on
the merger rate of nearby ($z < 0.6$) black-hole binaries in the early phases
of coalescence with a chirp mass of $10^{10}\,\rmn{M}_\odot$ of less than one
merger every seven years. The prospects for future gravitational-wave astronomy
of this type with the proposed Square Kilometre Array telescope are discussed.
