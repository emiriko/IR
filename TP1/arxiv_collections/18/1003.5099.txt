The gauge invariant quark Green's function with a path-ordered phase factor
along a straight-line is studied in two-dimensional QCD in the large-Nc limit
by means of an exact integrodifferential equation. Its spectral functions are
analytically determined. They are infra-red finite and lie on the positive real
axis of the complex plane of the momentum squared variable, corresponding to
momenta in the forward light cone. Their singularities are represented by an
infinite number of threshold type branch points with power-law -3/2, starting
at positive mass values, characterized by an integer number n and increasing
with n. The analytic expression of the Green's function for all momenta is
presented. The appearance of strong threshold singularities is suggestive of
the fact that quarks could not be observed as asymptotic states.
