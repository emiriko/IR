In this paper, we investigate an equivariant homeomorphism of the boundaries
$\partial X$ and $\partial Y$ of two proper CAT(0) spaces $X$ and $Y$ on which
a CAT(0) group $G$ acts geometrically. We provide a sufficient condition to
obtain a $G$-equivariant homeomorphism of the two boundaries $\partial X$ and
$\partial Y$ as a continuous extension of the quasi-isometry $\phi:Gx_0\to
Gy_0$ defined by $\phi(gx_0)=gy_0$, where $x_0\in X$ and $y_0\in Y$.
