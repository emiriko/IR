We study the SU(3) linear sigma model for the pseudoscalar mesons in the
Gaussian Functional Approximation (GFA). We use the SU(3) linear sigma model
Lagrangian with nonet scalar and pseudo-scalar mesons including symmetry
breaking terms. In the GFA, we take the Gaussian Ansatz for the ground state
wave function and apply the variational method to minimize the ground state
energy. We derive the gap equations for the dressed meson masses, which are
actually just variational parameters in the GFA method. We use the
Bethe-Salpeter equation for meson-meson scattering which provides the masses of
the physical nonet mesons. We construct the projection operators for the flavor
SU(3) in order to work out the scattering T-matrix in an efficient way. In this
paper, we discuss the properties of the Nambu-Goldstone bosons in various
limits of the chiral $U_L(3)\times U_R(3)$ symmetry.
