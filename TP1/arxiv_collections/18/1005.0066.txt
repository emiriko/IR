The discrepancy between the PQCD calculation and the CLEO data for
$\chi_{c1}\to \gamma V$ ($V=\rho^0,\,\omega,\,\phi$) stimulates our interest in
exploring extra mechanism of $\chi_{c1}$ decay. In this work, we apply an
important non-perturbative QCD effect, i.e., hadronic loop mechanism, to study
$\chi_{c1}\to \gamma V$ radiative decay. Our numerical result shows that the
theoretical results including the hadronic loop contribution and the PQCD
calculation of $\chi_{c1}\to \gamma V$ are consistent with the corresponding
CLEO data of $\chi_{c1}\to \gamma V$. We expect further experimental
measurement of $\chi_{c1}\to \gamma V$ at BES-III, which will be helpful to
test the hadronic loop effect on $\chi_{c1}$ decay.
