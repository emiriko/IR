We explore the dynamics of two atoms interacting with a cavity field via
deformed operators. Properties of the asymptotic regularization of entanglement
measures proving, for example, purity cost, regularized fidelity and accuracy
of information transfer are analyzed. We show that the robustness of a
bipartite system having a finite number of quantum states vanishes at finite
photon numbers, for arbitrary interactions between its constituents and with
cavity field. Finally it is shown that the stability of the purity and the
fidelity is improved in the absence of the deformation parameters.
