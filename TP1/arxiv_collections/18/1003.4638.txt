The analysis of the first solar-like targets done by CoRoT has shown that the
oscillation amplitudes are about 25% below the theoretical amplitudes while the
convective backgrounds are up to three times higher than in the solar case
(Michel et al. 2008). In such conditions, the comb-like structure of the
acoustic modes has smaller signal-to-noise ratios than initially expected
complicating the characterization of individual modes. In the present work we
apply the curvelet filtering to the solar-like targets already observed by
CoRoT as well as a partial reconstruction of the signal from the obtained
spacing of the comb-like structure of the acoustic modes. It enables us to
enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of the ridges in the Echelle diagrams.
Finally, we study how the analysis of the p modes can be improved.
