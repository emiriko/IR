The MINOS long-baseline experiment is using the NuMI neutrino beam to make
precise measurements of neutrino flavor oscillations in the "atmospheric"
neutrino sector. MINOS observes the $\nu_\mu$ disappearance oscillations seen
in atmospheric neutrinos, tests possible disappearance to sterile $\nu$ by
measuring the neutral current flux, and extends our reach towards the so far
unseen $\theta_{13}$ by looking for $\nu_e$ appearance in this $\nu_\mu$ beam.
The magnetized MINOS detectors also allow tests of CPT conservation by
discriminating between neutrinos and anti-neutrinos on an event-by-event basis.
The intense, well-understood NuMI neutrino beam created at Fermilab is observed
735km away at the Soudan Mine in Northeast Minnesota. High-statistics studies
of the neutrino interactions themselves and the cosmic rays seen by the MINOS
detectors have also been made. MINOS started taking beam data in May of 2005
and is now nearing the end of it's five-year run. This paper reviews results
published based on the first several years of data.
