We calculated the effects of spin-orbit interaction (SOI) on the energy
bands, ballistic conductance and the electron-diffusion thermoelectric power of
a nanowire by varying the temperature, electron density and width of the wire.
The potential barriers at the edges of the wire are assumed to be very high. A
consequence of the boundary conditions used in this model is determined by the
energy band structure, resulting in wider plateaus when the electron density is
increased due to larger energy-level separation as the higher subbands are
occupied by electrons. The nonlinear dependence of the transverse confinement
on position with respect to the well center excludes the "pole-like feature" in
the conductance which is obtained when a harmonic potential is employed for
confinement. At low temperature, the electron diffusion thermoelectric power
increases linearly with T but deviates from the linear behavior for large
values of T.
