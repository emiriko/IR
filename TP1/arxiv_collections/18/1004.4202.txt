A computation scheme for solving elliptic boundary value problems with
axially symmetric confining potentials using different sets of one-parameter
basis functions is presented. The efficiency of the proposed symbolic-numerical
algorithms implemented in Maple is shown by examples of spheroidal quantum dot
models, for which energy spectra and eigenfunctions versus the spheroid aspect
ratio were calculated within the conventional effective mass approximation.
Critical values of the aspect ratio, at which the discrete spectrum of models
with finite-wall potentials is transformed into a continuous one in strong
dimensional quantization regime, were revealed using the exact and adiabatic
classifications.
