The thermoelectric properties of strongly correlated quantum dots, described
by a single level Anderson model coupled to conduction electron leads, is
investigated using Wilson's numerical renormalization group method. We
calculate the electronic contribution, $K_{\rm e}$, to the thermal conductance,
the thermopower, $S$, and the electrical conductance, $G$, of a quantum dot as
a function of both temperature, $T$, and gate voltage, ${\rm v}_g$, for strong,
intermediate and weak Coulomb correlations, $U$, on the dot. For strong
correlations and in the Kondo regime, we find that the thermopower exhibits two
sign changes, at temperatures $T_{1}({\rm v}_g)$ and $T_{2}({\rm v}_g)$ with
$T_{1}< T_{2}$. Such sign changes in $S(T)$ are particularly sensitive
signatures of strong correlations and Kondo physics. The relevance of this to
recent thermopower measurements of Kondo correlated quantum dots is discussed.
We discuss the figure of merit, power factor and the degree of violation of the
Wiedemann-Franz law in quantum dots. The extent of temperature scaling in the
thermopower and thermal conductance of quantum dots in the Kondo regime is also
assessed.
