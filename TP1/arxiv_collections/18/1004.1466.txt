In this paper, we consider massless Dirac fields propagating in the outer
region of de Sitter-Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes. We show that the metric
of such black holes is uniquely determined by the partial knowledge of the
corresponding scattering matrix $S(\lambda)$ at a fixed energy $\lambda \ne 0$.
More precisely, we consider the partial wave scattering matrices $S(\lambda,n)$
(here $\lambda \ne 0$ is the fixed energy and $n \in \N^*$ denotes the angular
momentum) defined as the restrictions of the full scattering matrix on a well
chosen basis of spin-weighted spherical harmonics. We prove that the mass $M$,
the square of the charge $Q^2$ and the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ of a
dS-RN black hole (and thus its metric) can be uniquely determined from the
knowledge of either the transmission coefficients $T(\lambda, n)$, or the
reflexion coefficients $R(\lambda, n)$ (resp. $L(\lambda, n)$), for all $n \in
{\mathcal{L}}$ where $\mathcal{L}$ is a subset of $\N^*$ that satisfies the
M\"untz condition $\sum_{n \in {\mathcal{L}}} \frac{1}{n} = +\infty$. Our main
tool consists in complexifying the angular momentum $n$ and in studying the
analytic properties of the "unphysical" scattering matrix $S(\lambda,z)$ in the
complex variable $z$. We show in particular that the quantities
$\frac{1}{T(\lambda,z)}$, $\frac{R(\lambda,z)}{T(\lambda,z)}$ and
$\frac{L(\lambda,z)}{T(\lambda,z)}$ belong to the Nevanlinna class in the
region $\{z \in \C, \ Re(z) >0 \}$ for which we have analytic uniqueness
theorems at our disposal. Eventually, as a by-product of our method, we obtain
reconstrution formulae for the surface gravities of the event and cosmological
horizons of the black hole which have an important physical meaning in the
Hawking effect.
