We consider the transport of electrons passing through a mesoscopic device
possessing internal dynamical quantum degrees of freedom. The mutual
interaction between the system and the conduction electrons contributes to the
current fluctuations, which we describe in terms of full counting statistics.
We identify conditions where this discriminates coherent from incoherent
internal dynamics, and also identify and illustrate conditions under which the
device acts to dynamically bunch transmitted or reflected electrons, thereby
generating super-Poissonian noise.
