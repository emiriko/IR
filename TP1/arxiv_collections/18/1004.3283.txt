We propose an operational degree of polarization in terms of the variance of
the projected Stokes vector minimized over all the directions of the Poincar\'e
sphere. We examine the properties of this degree and show that some problems
associated with the standard definition are avoided. The new degree of
polarization is experimentally determined using two examples: a bright squeezed
state and a quadrature squeezed vacuum.
