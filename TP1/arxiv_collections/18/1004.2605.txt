The enumeration of normal surfaces is a key bottleneck in computational
three-dimensional topology. The underlying procedure is the enumeration of
admissible vertices of a high-dimensional polytope, where admissibility is a
powerful but non-linear and non-convex constraint. The main results of this
paper are significant improvements upon the best known asymptotic bounds on the
number of admissible vertices, using polytopes in both the standard normal
surface coordinate system and the streamlined quadrilateral coordinate system.
  To achieve these results we examine the layout of admissible points within
these polytopes. We show that these points correspond to well-behaved
substructures of the face lattice, and we study properties of the corresponding
"admissible faces". Key lemmata include upper bounds on the number of maximal
admissible faces of each dimension, and a bijection between the maximal
admissible faces in the two coordinate systems mentioned above.
