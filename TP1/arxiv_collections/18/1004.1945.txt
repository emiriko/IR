We performed the conductance and the shot noise measurements in an electronic
Mach-Zehnder interferometer. The visibility of the interference is investigated
as a function of the electron temperature that is derived from the thermal
noise of the interferometer. The non-equilibrium noise displays both h/e and
h/2e oscillations vs. the modulation gate voltage.
