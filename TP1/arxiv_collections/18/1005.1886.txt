Over the past decade, astronomers have been using an increasingly larger
number of web-based applications and archives to conduct their research.
However, despite the early success in creating links across projects and data
centers, the promise of a single integrated digital library environment
supporting e-science in astronomy has proven elusive. While some of the issues
hampering progress in this area are of technical nature, others are rooted in
existing policies which should be re-analyzed if further rapid progress is to
be made in this area. This paper describes a proposal that the NASA
Astrophysics Data System project has put forth in order to improve its role as
one of the primary discovery portals for astronomers, focusing on those aspects
which could benefit from an increased level of involvement from the community,
namely the effort to expose astronomy resources as linked data, and the
harvesting of observational metadata.
