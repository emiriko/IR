In this paper, we prove existence and uniqueness of solutions to the Fermi
Pasta Ulam lattice equation that converge to a sum of co-propagating $N$
solitary waves as $t\to\infty$ using linear stability property of multi-soliton
like solutions in an exponentially weighted space proved by [Mizumachi,
arXiv:0906.1320]. Counter-propagating two soliton states have been studied by
[Hoffman and Wayne, Asymptotic two-soliton solutions in the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam
model, J. Dynam. Differential Equations 21 (2009), 343-351].
