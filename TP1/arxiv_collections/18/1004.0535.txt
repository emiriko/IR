One of the primary goals of the Large Hadron Collider is to understand the
electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism. In the Standard Model, electroweak
symmetry breaking is described by the Higgs mechanism which includes a scalar
Higgs boson. Electroweak measurements constrain the Standard Model Higgs boson
mass to be in the 114.4 to 157 GeV/c^2 range. Within this mass window, the
Higgs predominantly decays into two b-quarks. As such, we investigate the
prospect of observing the Standard Model Higgs decaying to b\bar{b} produced in
weak-boson-fusion with an associated central photon. An isolated, high pt,
central photon trigger is expected to be available at the ATLAS and CMS
experiments. In this study, we investigated the effects originating from
showering, hadronization, the underlying event model, and jet performance
including b-jet calibration on the sensitivity of this channel. We found that
the choice of Monte Carlo and Monte Carlo tune has a large effect on the
efficacy of the central jet veto and consequently the signal significance. A
signal significance of about 1.86 can be achieved for m(Higgs)=115 GeV/c^2 with
100 1/fb of integrated luminosity which correspond to one year at design
luminosity at 14 TeV pp collisions.
