The authors report on electron transport studies on
superconductor-semiconductor hybrid structures of indium and n-type lead
telluride, either in the form of quantum wells or bulk crystals. In-PbTe
contacts form by spontaneous alloying, which occurs already at room
temperature. The alloyed phase penetrates deeply into PbTe and forms metallic
contacts even in the presence of depletion layers at the semiconductor surface.
Although the detailed structure of this phase is unknown, we observe that it
exhibits a superconducting transition at temperatures below 10 K. This causes
such substantial reduction of the contact resistances that they even become
comparable to those predicted for ideal superconductor-normal conductor
contacts. Most importantly, this result indicates that the interface phase in
the superconducting state becomes nearly homogeneous - in contrast to the
structure expected for alloyed contacts. We suggest that the unusual interface
superconductivity is linked to the unique properties of PbTe, namely, its huge
static dielectric constant. Apparently the alloyed interface phase contains
superconducting precipitates randomly distributed within the depletion layers,
and their Coulomb charging energies are extremely small. According to the
existing models of the granular superconductivity, even very weak Josephson
coupling between the neighboring precipitates gives rise to the formation of a
global superconducting phase which explains our observations.
