The fundamentals of precessing ball solitons (PBS) arising as a result of the
energy fluctuations at the first-order phase transition induced by a magnetic
field in ferromagnets with uniaxial anisotropy are presented. When external
magnetic field is anti-parallel to the magnetization direction of the crystal,
PBS states are possible in a wide range of amplitudes and energies, including
the positive and negative energy relative to an initial condition. PBS are born
with the greatest probability at near-zero energy, i.e. near the bifurcation
point. Evolution of the PBS, at which they transform into macroscopic domains
of a new magnetic phase or into quasi-equilibrium solitonic state, is analyzed.
