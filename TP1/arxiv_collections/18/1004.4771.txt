We consider soliton dynamics and stability in a nonlinear lattice formed by
alternating domains with focusing cubic and saturable nonlinearities. We find
that in such lattices solitons centered on cubic domains may be stabilized even
in two-dimensional geometries, in spite of their intrinsic catastrophic
instability in the absence of the lattice. Solitons centered on saturable
domains are always unstable.
