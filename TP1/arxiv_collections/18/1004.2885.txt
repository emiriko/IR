We compute maps of CMB temperature fluctuations seeded by cosmic strings
using high resolution simulations of cosmic strings in a
Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe. We create full-sky, 18-degree and 3-degree
CMB maps, including the relevant string contribution at each resolution from
before recombination to today. We extract the angular power spectrum from these
maps, demonstrating the importance of recombination effects. We briefly discuss
the probability density function of the pixel temperatures, their skewness and
kurtosis.
