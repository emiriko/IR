We develop a self-consistent version of perturbation theory in Liouville
space which seeks to combine the advantages of master equation approaches in
quantum transport with the nonperturbative features that a self-consistent
treatment brings. We describe how counting fields may be included in a
self-consistent manner in this formalism such that the full counting statistics
can be calculated. NonMarkovian effects are also incorporated. Several
different self-consistent approximations are introduced and we discuss their
relative strengths with a simple example.
