I briefly review the theory of Holographic Space-time and its relation to the
cosmological constant problem, and the breaking of supersymmetry (SUSY). When
combined with some simple phenomenological requirements, these ideas lead to a
fairly unique model for Tera-scale physics, which implies direct gauge
mediation of SUSY breaking and a model for dark matter as a hidden sector
baryon, with nonzero magnetic dipole moment.
