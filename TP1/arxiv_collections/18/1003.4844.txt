We propose and numerically demonstrate an efficient cleaning of spatial
structure (spatial filtering) of sound beams by propagating them through at
least twodimensional sonic crystals, i.e. through acoustic structures
periodically modulated in longitudinal and in transversal direction with
respect to the sound propagation direction. We show the spatial filtering in
two configurations: with- and without the angular band-gap. We also show that
besides the spatial filtering the beams can be additionally focalized at a
particular distance behind the sonic crystal in both configurations.
