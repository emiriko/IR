We show anisotropy of the dipole interaction between magnetic atoms or polar
molecules can stabilize new quantum phases in an optical lattice. Using a well
controlled numerical method based on the tensor network algorithm, we calculate
phase diagram of the resultant effective Hamiltonian in a two-dimensional
square lattice - an anisotropic Hubbard model of hard-core bosons with
attractive interaction in one direction and repulsive interaction in the other
direction. Besides the conventional superfluid and the Mott insulator states,
we find the striped and the checkerboard charge density wave states and the
supersolid phase that interconnect the superfluid and the striped solid states.
The transition to the supersolid phase has a mechanism different from the case
of the soft-core Bose Hubbard model.
