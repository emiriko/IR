Quantum Portfolios of quantum algorithms encoded on qbits have recently been
reported. In this paper a discussion of the continuous variables version of
quantum portfolios is presented. A risk neutral valuation model for options
dependent on the measured values of the observables, analogous to the
traditional Black-Scholes valuation model, is obtained from the underlying
stochastic equations. The quantum algorithms are here encoded on simple
harmonic oscillator (SHO) states, and a Fokker-Planck equation for the Glauber
P-representation is obtained as a starting point for the analysis. A discussion
of the observation of the polarization of a portfolio of qbits is also obtained
and the resultant Fokker-Planck equation is used to obtain the risk neutral
valuation of the qbit polarization portfolio.
