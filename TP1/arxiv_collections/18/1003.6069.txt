This note examines the question of randomness in a sequence based on the
continued fraction (CF) representation of its corresponding representation as a
number, or as D sequence. We propose a randomness measure that is directly
equal to the number of components of the CF representation. This provides a
means of quantifying the randomness of the popular PN sequences as well. A
comparison is made of representation as a fraction and as a continued fraction.
