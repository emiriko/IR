Dispersionless bands, such as Landau levels, serve as a good starting point
for obtaining interesting correlated states when interactions are added. With
this motivation in mind, we study a variety of dispersionless ("flat") band
structures that arise in tight-binding Hamiltonians defined on hexagonal and
kagome lattices with staggered fluxes. The flat bands and their neighboring
dispersing bands have several notable features: (a) Flat bands can be isolated
from other bands by breaking time reversal symmetry, allowing for an extensive
degeneracy when these bands are partially filled; (b) An isolated flat band
corresponds to a critical point between regimes where the band is electron-like
or hole-like, with an anomalous Hall conductance that changes sign across the
transition; (c) When the gap between a flat band and two neighboring bands
closes, the system is described by a single spin-1 conical-like spectrum,
extending to higher angular momentum the spin-1/2 Dirac-like spectra in
topological insulators and graphene; and (d) some configurations of parameters
admit two isolated parallel flat bands, raising the possibility of exotic
"heavy excitons"; (e) We find that the Chern number of the flat bands, in all
instances that we study here, is zero.
