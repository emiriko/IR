We consider a gas of quasi-free quantum particles confined to a finite box,
subjected to singular magnetic and electric fields. We prove in great
generality that the finite volume grand-canonical pressure is jointly analytic
in the chemical potential ant the intensity of the external magnetic field. We
also discuss the thermodynamic limit.
