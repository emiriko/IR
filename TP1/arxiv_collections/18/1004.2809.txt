We present a new approach to the question of properly defining energy and
momenta for non asymptotically Minkowskian spaces in general relativity, in the
case where these energy and momenta are conserved. In order to do this, we
first prove that there always exist some special Gauss coordinates for which
the conserved linear and angular three-momenta vanish. This allows us to
consider the case of creatable universes (the universes whose proper 4-momenta
vanish) in a consistent way, which is the main interest of the paper. When
applied to the Friedmann-Lema{\^{\i}}tre-Robertson-Walker case, perturbed or
not, our formalism leads to previous results, according to most literature on
the subject. Some future work that should be done is mentioned.
