We consider the four fragments FO2, the intersection of Sigma2 and FO2, the
intersection of Pi2 and FO2, and Delta2 of first-order logic FO[<] over finite
and infinite words. For all four fragments, we give characterizations in terms
of rankers. In particular, we generalize the notion of a ranker to infinite
words in two possible ways. Both extensions are natural in the sense that over
finite words, they coincide with classical rankers and over infinite words,
they both have the full expressive power of FO2. Moreover, the first extension
of rankers admits a characterization of the intersection of Sigma2 and FO2
while the other leads to a characterization of the intersection of Pi2 and FO2.
Both versions of rankers yield characterizations of the fragment Delta2. As a
byproduct, we also obtain characterizations based on unambiguous temporal logic
and unambiguous interval temporal logic.
