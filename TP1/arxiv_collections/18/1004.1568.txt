The temporal and spectral analysis of 9 bright X-ray flares out of a sample
of 113 flares observed by Swift reveals that the flare phenomenology is
strictly analogous to the prompt gamma-ray emission: high energy flare profiles
rise faster, decay faster and peak before the low energy emission. However,
flares and prompt pulses differ in one crucial aspect: flares evolve with time.
As time proceeds flares become wider, with larger peak lag, lower luminosities
and softer emission. The flare spectral peak energy E_{p,i} evolves to lower
values following an exponential decay which tracks the decay of the flare flux.
The two flares with best statistics show higher than expected isotropic energy
E_{iso} and peak luminosity L_{p,iso} when compared to the E_{p,i}-E_{iso} and
E_{p,i}-L_{iso} prompt correlations. E_{p,i} is found to correlate with L_{iso}
within single flares, giving rise to a time resolved E_{p,i}(t)-L_{iso}(t).
Like prompt pulses, flares define a lag-luminosity relation: L_{p,iso}^{0.3-10
keV} t_{lag}^{-0.95+/-0.23}. The lag-luminosity is proven to be a fundamental
law extending 5 decades in time and 5 in energy. Moreover, this is direct
evidence that GRB X-ray flares and prompt gamma-ray pulses are produced by the
same mechanism. Finally we establish a flare-afterglow morphology connection:
flares are preferentially detected superimposed to one-break or canonical X-ray
afterglows.
