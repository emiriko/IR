We have recently confirmed the planetary nebula (PN)nature of PM1-242,
PM1-318 and PM1-322. Here we present high-resolution long-slit spectra of these
three PNe in order to analyze their internal kinematics and to investigate
their physical structure. PM1-242 is a tilted ring and not an elliptical PN as
suggested by direct images. The object is probably related to ring-like PNe and
shows an unusual point-symmetric brightness distribution in the ring. PM1-318
is a pole-on elliptical PN, instead of a circular one as suggested by direct
images. PM1-322 is spatially unresolved and its spectrum shows large
differences between the forbidden lines and H$\alpha$ profiles, with the latter
showing a double-peaked profile and relatively extended wings (FWZI $\sim$ 325
km\,s$^{-1}$). These properties are found in other PNe that are suspected to
host a symbiotic central star.
