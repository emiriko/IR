We present explicit formulae for Weber-Schafheitlin type integrals and give
them an interpretation as the kernel of a physically relevant operator related
to the hamiltonian of Aharanov and Bohm. In particular, we derive explicit
formulae for Weber-Schafheitlin type integrals with exponent larger or equal 1,
which are distributions on R_+. We discuss several special cases.
