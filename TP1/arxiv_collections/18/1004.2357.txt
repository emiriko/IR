The muon and anti-muon neutrino energy spectrum is determined from 2000-2003
AMANDA telescope data using regularised unfolding. This is the first
measurement of atmospheric neutrinos in the energy range 2 - 200 TeV. The
result is compared to different atmospheric neutrino models and it is
compatible with the atmospheric neutrinos from pion and kaon decays. No
significant contribution from charm hadron decays or extraterrestrial neutrinos
is detected. The capabilities to improve the measurement of the neutrino
spectrum with the successor experiment IceCube are discussed.
