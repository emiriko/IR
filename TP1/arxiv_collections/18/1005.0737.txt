Reasoning about the knowledge of an attacker is a necessary step in many
formal analyses of security protocols. In the framework of the applied pi
calculus, as in similar languages based on equational logics, knowledge is
typically expressed by two relations: deducibility and static equivalence.
Several decision procedures have been proposed for these relations under a
variety of equational theories. However, each theory has its particular
algorithm, and none has been implemented so far. We provide a generic procedure
for deducibility and static equivalence that takes as input any convergent
rewrite system. We show that our algorithm covers most of the existing decision
procedures for convergent theories. We also provide an efficient
implementation, and compare it briefly with the tools ProVerif and KiSs.
