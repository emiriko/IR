We consider a magnetic Laplacian $-\Delta_A=(id+A)^\star (id+A)$ on a
noncompact hyperbolic surface $\mM $ with finite area. $A$ is a real one-form
and the magnetic field $dA$ is constant in each cusp. When the harmonic
component of $A$ satifies some quantified condition, the spectrum of
$-\Delta_A$ is discrete. In this case we prove that the counting function of
the eigenvalues of $-\Delta_{A}$ satisfies the classical Weyl formula, even
when $dA=0. $
