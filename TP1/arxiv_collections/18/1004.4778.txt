Dynamical scaling analysis is theoretically performed for the ac (optical)
Hall conductivity $\sigma_{xy}(\varepsilon_F,\omega)$ as a function of Fermi
energy $\varepsilon_F$ and frequency $\omega$ for the two-dimensional electron
gas and for graphene. In both systems, results based on exact diagonalization
show that $\sigma_{xy}(\varepsilon_F,\omega)$ displays a well-defined dynamical
scaling, for which the dynamical critical exponent as well as the localization
exponent are fitted and plugged in. A crossover from the dc-like bahavior to
the ac regime is identified. The dynamical scaling analysis has enabled us to
quantify the plateau in the ac Hall conductivity previously obtained, and to
predict that the plateaux structure in ac is robust enough to be observed in
the THz regime.
