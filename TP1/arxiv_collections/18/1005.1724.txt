The binding of a cationic surfactant (hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide,
CTAB) to a negatively charged natural polysaccharide (pectin) at air-solution
interfaces, was investigated on single interfaces and in foams, versus the
linear charge densities of the polysaccharide. Beside classical methods to
investigate polymer/surfactant systems, we applied, for the first time
concerning these systems, the analogy between the small angle neutron
scattering by foams and the neutron reflectivity of films to measure in situ
film thicknesses of foams. CTAB/pectin foam films are much thicker than that of
the pure surfactant foam film but similar for highly and lowly charged
pectin/CTAB systems despite the difference in structure of complexes at
interfaces. The improvement of the foam properties of CTAB bound to pectin is
shown to be directly related to the formation of pectin-CTAB complexes at the
air-water interface. However, in opposition to surface activity, there is no
specific behavior for the highly charged pectin: foam properties depend mainly
upon the bulk charge concentration, while the interfacial behavior is mainly
governed by the charge density of pectin. For the highly charged pectin,
specific cooperative effects between neighboring charged sites along the chain
are thought to be involved in the higher surface activity of pectin/CTAB
complexes. A more general behavior can be obtained at lower charge density
either by using a lowly charged pectin or by neutralizing the highly charged
pectin in decreasing pH. .
