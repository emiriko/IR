New data from GSI on the production-cross-section for fragmentation of the
systems 56Fe+p and 56Fe+Ti at 1 A GeV revealed the appearance of even-odd
staggering in the cross-section distribution for chains of isotopes with given
N-Z. The staggering is strongly enhanced for the chain N=Z, it reduces as the
production moves away from the N=Z chain, and it reverses for the most
neutron-rich odd-A residues. These phenomena, observed in the residues of
rather violent reactions, are related to structural effects in the
level-densities below the particle-emission threshold.
