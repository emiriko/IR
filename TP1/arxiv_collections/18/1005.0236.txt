We report on the fabrication and characterization of a scannable Fabry-Perot
microcavity, consisting of a curved micromirror at the end of an optical fiber
and a planar distributed Bragg reflector. Furthermore, we demonstrate the
coupling of single organic molecules embedded in a thin film to well-defined
resonator modes. We discuss the choice of cavity parameters that will allow
sufficiently high Purcell factors for enhancing the zero-phonon transition
between the vibrational ground levels of the electronic excited and ground
states.
