The asymptotic behavior of solutions to Schr\"odinger equations with singular
homogeneous potentials is investigated. Through an Almgren type monotonicity
formula and separation of variables, we describe the exact asymptotics near the
singularity of solutions to at most critical semilinear elliptic equations with
cylindrical and quantum multi-body singular potentials. Furthermore, by an
iterative Brezis-Kato procedure, point-wise upper estimate are derived.
