A local approximation for dynamic polarizability leads to a nonlocal
functional for the long-range dispersion interaction energy via an
imaginary-frequency integral. We analyze several local polarizability
approximations and argue that the form underlying the construction of our
recent van der Waals functional [O. A. Vydrov and T. Van Voorhis, Phys. Rev.
Lett. 103, 063004 (2009)] is particularly well physically justified. Using this
improved formula, we compute dynamic dipole polarizabilities and van der Waals
C_6 coefficients for a set of atoms and molecules. Good agreement with the
benchmark values is obtained in most cases.
