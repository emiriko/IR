Short-time dynamics technique is used to study the relaxation process for the
(2+1)-dimensional critical gluodynamics of the SU(2) lattice gauge theory. A
generalized class of heat-bath-inspired updating algorithms was employed during
the short-time regime of the dynamic evolution for performance comparison. The
static and dynamic critical exponents of the theory were measured, serving as a
dynamic benchmark for algorithmic efficiency. Our results are in agreement with
predictions from universality hypothesis and suggest that there is an
underlying universal dynamics shared by the analyzed algorithms.
