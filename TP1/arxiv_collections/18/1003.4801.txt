The Virtual Observatory is a new technology of the astronomical research
allowing the seamless processing and analysis of a heterogeneous data obtained
from a number of distributed data archives. It may also provide astronomical
community with powerful computational and data processing on-line services
replacing the custom scientific code run on user's computers. Despite its
benefits the VO technology has been still little exploited in stellar
spectroscopy. As an example of possible evolution in this field we present an
experimental web-based service for disentangling of spectra based on code
KOREL. This code developed by P. Hadrava enables Fourier disentangling and
line-strength photometry, i.e. simultaneous decomposition of spectra of
multiple stars and solving for orbital parameters, line-profile variability or
other physical parameters of observed objects. We discuss the benefits of the
service-oriented approach from the point of view of both developers and users
and give examples of possible user-friendly implementation of spectra
disentangling methods as a standard tools of Virtual Observatory.
