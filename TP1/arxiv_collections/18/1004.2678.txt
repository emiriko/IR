We develop cycle index generating functions for orthogonal groups in even
characteristic, and give some enumerative applications. A key step is the
determination of the values of the complex linear-Weil characters of the finite
symplectic group, and their inductions to the general linear group, at
unipotent elements. We also define and study several natural probability
measures on integer partitions.
