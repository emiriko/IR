The majority of linear-optical nondestructive implementations of universal
quantum gates are based on single-photon resolving detectors. We propose two
implementations, which are nondestructive (i.e., destroying only ancilla
states) and work with conventional detectors (i.e., which do not resolve number
of photons). Moreover, we analyze a recently proposed scheme of Wang et al. [J.
Opt. Soc. Am. B \textbf{27}, 27 (2010)] of an optical iSWAP gate based on two
ancillae in Bell's states, classical feedforward, and conventional detectors
with the total probability of success equal to $\eta^4/32$, where $\eta$ is
detector's efficiency. By observing that the iSWAP gate can be replaced by the
controlled NOT (CNOT) gate with additional deterministic gates, we list various
possible linear-optical implementations of the iSWAP gate: (i) assuming various
ancilla states (unentangled, two-photon and multiphoton-entangled states) or no
ancillae at all, (ii) with or without classical feedforward, (iii) destructive
or nondestructive schemes, and (iv) using conventional or single-photon
detectors. In particular, we show how the nondestructive iSWAP gate can be
implemented with the success probability of $\eta^4/8$ assuming the same
ancillae, classical feedforward, and fewer number of conventional detectors
than those in the scheme of Wang {\em et al.} We discuss other schemes of the
nondestructive universal gates using conventional detectors and entangled
ancillae in a cluster state, Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger and Bell's states
giving the success probability of $\eta^4/4$, $\eta^6/8$, and $\eta^4/8$,
respectively. In the latter scheme, we analyze how detector imperfections (dark
counts in addition to finite efficiency and no photon-number resolution) and
imperfect sources of ancilla states deteriorate the quantum gate operation.
