Several X-ray pulsars have been observed to experience torque reversals,
which provide important observational clues to the interaction between the
neutron star magnetic field and the accretion disk. We review the current
models proposed for the torque reversals and discuss their viability based on
the observations of the quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in 4U 1626-67. Most
of these models seem to be incompatible with the evolution of the QPO
frequencies if they are interpreted in terms of the beat frequency model. We
suggest that winds or outflows from the neutron star and the accretion disk may
play an important role in accounting for the spin-down in disk-fed neutron
stars.
