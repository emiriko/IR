The Galileo probe showed that Jupiter's atmosphere is severely depleted in
neon compared to protosolar values. We show, via ab initio simulations of the
partitioning of neon between hydrogen and helium phases, that the observed
depletion can be explained by the sequestration of neon into helium-rich
droplets within the postulated hydrogen-helium immiscibility layer of the
planet's interior. We also demonstrate that this mechanism will not affect
argon, explaining the observed lack of depletion of this gas. This provides
strong indirect evidence for hydrogen-helium immiscibility in Jupiter.
