We perform a high-temperature expansion of scalar quantum field theory on
fuzzy CP^n to third order in the inverse temperature. Using group theoretical
methods, we rewrite the result as a multitrace matrix model. The partition
function of this matrix model is evaluated via the saddle point method and the
phase diagram is analyzed for various n. Our results confirm the findings of a
previous numerical study of this phase diagram for CP^1.
