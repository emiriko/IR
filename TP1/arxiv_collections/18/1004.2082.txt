Quantum discord (QD) reveals the nonclassical nature of correlations in
bipartite quantum states, going beyond the entanglement-separability paradigm.
In this article we discuss the suitability of QD in what concern its possible
asymmetry with relation to the bipartition we choose to compute it. We obtain
an analytical formula for a symmetrized version of QD (SQD) in Bell-diagonal
states. We observe that if correlation is regarded as a shared property, then
the SQD could be a convenient quantifier for asymmetric states.
