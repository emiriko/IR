We derive exact analytical solutions of the Klein-Gordon equation for Makarov
potential by means of the asymptotic iteration method. The energy eigenvalues
are given in a closed form and the corresponding normalized eigenfunctions are
obtained in terms of the generalized Laguerre polynomials and hypergeometrical
functions.
