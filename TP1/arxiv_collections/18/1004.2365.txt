Directional detection of galactic Dark Matter is a promising search strategy
for discriminating genuine WIMP events from background ones. However, to take
full advantage of this powerful detection method, one need to be able to
extract information from an observed recoil map to identify a WIMP signal. We
present a comprehensive formalism, using a map-based likelihood method allowing
to recover the main incoming direction of the signal, thus proving its galactic
origin, and the corresponding significance. Constraints are then deduced in the
(sigma_n, m_chi) plane.
