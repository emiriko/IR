We present an efficient method to find minimum energy structures using energy
estimates from accurate quantum Monte Carlo calculations. This method involves
a stochastic process formed from the stochastic energy estimates from Monte
Carlo that can be averaged to find precise structural minima while using
inexpensive calculations with moderate statistical uncertainty. We demonstrate
the applicability of the algorithm by minimizing the energy of the H2O-OH-
complex and showing that the structural minima from quantum Monte Carlo
calculations affect the qualitative behavior of the potential energy surface
substantially.
