We present an efficient and economic scheme for five-party quantum state
sharing of an arbitrary m-qubit state with $2m$ three-particle
Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states and three-particle GHZ-state
measurements. It is more convenient than other schemes as it only resorts to
three-particle GHZ states and three-particle joint measurement, not
five-particle entanglements and five-particle joint measurements. Moreover,
this symmetric scheme is in principle secure even though the number of the
dishonest agents is more than one. Its total efficiency approaches the maximal
value.
