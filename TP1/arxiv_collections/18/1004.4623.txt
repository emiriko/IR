In this paper we initiate the study of products and sums divisible by central
binomial coefficients. We show that 2(2n+1)binom(2n,n)| binom(6n,3n)binom(3n,n)
for every n=1,2,3,... Also, for any nonnegative integers $k$ and $n$ we have
$$\binom {2k}k | \binom{4n+2k+2}{2n+k+1}\binom{2n+k+1}{2k}\binom{2n-k+1}n$$ and
$$\binom{2k}k | (2n+1)\binom{2n}nC_{n+k}\binom{n+k+1}{2k},$$ where $C_m$
denotes the Catalan number $\binom{2m}m/(m+1)=\binom{2m}m-\binom{2m}{m+1}$.
Applying this result we obtain two sums divisible by central binomial
coefficients.
