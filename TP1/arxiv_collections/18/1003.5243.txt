We report simulations of submonolayer epitaxial growth using a continuum
phase field model. The island density and the island size distribution both
show scaling behavior. When the capillary length is small, the island size
distribution is consistent with irreversible aggregation kinetics. As the
capillary length increases, the island size distribution reflects the effects
of reversible aggregation. These results are in quantitative agreement with
other simulation methods and with experiments. However, the scaling of the
island total density does not agree with known results. The reasons are traced
to the mechanisms of island nucleation and aggregation in the phase field
model.
