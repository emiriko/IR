In the present work we introduce a novel multi-agent model with the aim to
reproduce the dynamics of a double auction market at microscopic time scale
through a faithful simulation of the matching mechanics in the limit order
book. The agents follow a noise decision making process where their actions are
related to a stochastic variable, "the market sentiment", which we define as a
mixture of public and private information. The model, despite making just few
basic assumptions over the trading strategies of the agents, is able to
reproduce several empirical features of the high-frequency dynamics of the
market microstructure not only related to the price movements but also to the
deposition of the orders in the book.
