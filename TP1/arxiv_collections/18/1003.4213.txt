We have developed an ultra-stable source in the deep ultraviolet, suitable to
fulfill the interrogation requirements of a future fully-operational lattice
clock based on neutral mercury. At the core of the system is a Fabry-P\'erot
cavity which is highly impervious to temperature and vibrational perturbations.
The mirror substrate is made of fused silica in order to exploit the
comparatively low thermal noise limits associated with this material. By
stabilizing the frequency of a 1062.6 nm Yb-doped fiber laser to the cavity,
and including an additional link to LNE-SYRTE's fountain primary frequency
standards via an optical frequency comb, we produce a signal which is both
stable at the 1E-15 level in fractional terms and referenced to primary
frequency standards. The signal is subsequently amplified and frequency-doubled
twice to produce several milliwatts of interrogation signal at 265.6 nm in the
deep ultraviolet.
