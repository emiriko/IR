The M-tree is a paged, dynamically balanced metric access method that
responds gracefully to the insertion of new objects. To date, no algorithm has
been published for the corresponding Delete operation. We believe this to be
non-trivial because of the design of the M-tree's Insert algorithm. We propose
a modification to Insert that overcomes this problem and give the corresponding
Delete algorithm. The performance of the tree is comparable to the M-tree and
offers additional benefits in terms of supported operations, which we briefly
discuss.
