We have investigated the atomically-resolved substrate and homoepitaxial thin
film surfaces of SrTiO3(001) using low-temperature scanning tunneling
microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS) combined with pulsed laser deposition (PLD).
It was found that annealing at 1000 oC in an oxygen partial pressure of 1*10-6
Torr, which is a typical annealing treatment for the preparation of SrTiO3
substrates, unexpectedly resulted in a disordered surface on an atomic scale.
In contrast, homoepitaxial SrTiO3 thin films grown on this disordered substrate
exhibited (2*2) surface reconstructions. The differential conductance spectra,
dI/dV in STS measurements, revealed a number of surface defects in a
10-unit-cell-thick SrTiO3 film, but much fewer in a 50-unit-cell-thick film.
These results indicate that the defect density in the film strongly depends on
the film thickness, suggesting non-uniform stoichiometry along the growth
direction.
