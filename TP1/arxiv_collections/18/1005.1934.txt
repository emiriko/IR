Probabilistic databases play a crucial role in the management and
understanding of uncertain data. However, incorporating probabilities into the
semantics of incomplete databases has posed many challenges, forcing systems to
sacrifice modeling power, scalability, or restrict the class of relational
algebra formula under which they are closed. We propose an alternative approach
where the underlying relational database always represents a single world, and
an external factor graph encodes a distribution over possible worlds; Markov
chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) inference is then used to recover this uncertainty to
a desired level of fidelity. Our approach allows the efficient evaluation of
arbitrary queries over probabilistic databases with arbitrary dependencies
expressed by graphical models with structure that changes during inference.
MCMC sampling provides efficiency by hypothesizing {\em modifications} to
possible worlds rather than generating entire worlds from scratch. Queries are
then run over the portions of the world that change, avoiding the onerous cost
of running full queries over each sampled world. A significant innovation of
this work is the connection between MCMC sampling and materialized view
maintenance techniques: we find empirically that using view maintenance
techniques is several orders of magnitude faster than naively querying each
sampled world. We also demonstrate our system's ability to answer relational
queries with aggregation, and demonstrate additional scalability through the
use of parallelization.
