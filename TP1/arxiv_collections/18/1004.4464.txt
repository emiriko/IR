The proposed system aims at the retrieval of the summarized information from
the documents collected from web based search engine as per the user query
related to cricket and hockey domain. The system is designed in a manner that
it takes the voice commands as keywords for search. The parts of speech in the
query are extracted using the natural language extractor for English. Based on
the keywords the search is categorized into 2 types: - 1.Concept wise -
information retrieved to the query is retrieved based on the keywords and the
concept words related to it. The retrieved information is summarized using the
probabilistic approach and weighted means algorithm.2.Keyword search - extracts
the result relevant to the query from the highly ranked document retrieved from
the search by the search engine. The relevant search results are retrieved and
then keywords are used for summarizing part. During summarization it follows
the weighted and probabilistic approaches in order to identify the data
comparable to the keywords extracted. The extracted information is then refined
repeatedly through the aggregation process to reduce redundancy. Finally the
resultant data is submitted to the user in the form of audio output.
