We give a complete topological classification of germs of holomorphic
foliations in the plane under rather generic conditions. The key point is the
introduction of a new topological invariant called monodromy representation.
This monodromy contains all the relevant dynamical information, in particular
the projective holonomy representation whose topological invariance was
conjectured in the eighties by Cerveau and Sad and proved here under mild
hypotheses.
