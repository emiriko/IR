The unbound nucleus $^{12}$Li is evaluated by using the multistep shell model
in the complex energy plane assuming that the spectrum is determined by the
motion of three neutrons outside the $^9$Li core. It is found that the ground
state of this system consists of an antibound $1/2^+$ state and that only this
and a $1/2^-$ and a $5/2^+$ excited states are physically meaningful
resonances.
