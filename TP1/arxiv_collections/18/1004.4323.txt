We demonstrate a qubit readout scheme that exploits the Jaynes-Cummings
nonlinearity of a superconducting cavity coupled to transmon qubits. We find
that in the strongly-driven dispersive regime of this system, there is the
unexpected onset of a high-transmission "bright" state at a critical power
which depends sensitively on the initial qubit state. A simple and robust
measurement protocol exploiting this effect achieves a single-shot fidelity of
87% using a conventional sample design and experimental setup, and at least 61%
fidelity to joint correlations of three qubits.
