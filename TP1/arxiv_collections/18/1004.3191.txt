When Brans-Dicke Theory is formulated in terms of the Jordan scalar field
\phi, dark energy is related to the mass of this field. We show that if \phi is
taken to be a complex scalar field then an exact solution of the vacuum
equations shows that Friedmann equation possesses a term, proportional to the
inverse sixth power of the scale factor, as well as a constant term. Possible
interpretations and phenomenological implications of this result are discussed.
