We present the first ultraviolet (UV) and multi-epoch optical spectroscopy of
30 Dor 016, a massive O2-type star on the periphery of 30 Doradus in the Large
Magellanic Cloud. The UV data were obtained with the Cosmic Origins
Spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope as part of the Servicing Mission
Observatory Verification program after Servicing Mission 4, and reveal #016 to
have one of the fastest stellar winds known. From analysis of the CIV 1548-51
doublet we find a terminal velocity, v_infty=3450 +/- 50km/s. Optical
spectroscopy is from the VLT-FLAMES Tarantula Survey, from which we rule out a
massive companion (with 2d<P<1yr) to a confidence of 98%. The radial velocity
of #016 is offset from the systemic value by -85km/s, suggesting that the star
has traveled the 120pc from the core of 30 Doradus as a runaway, ejected via
dynamical interactions.
