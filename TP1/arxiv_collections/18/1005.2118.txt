Using grand-canonical Monte Carlo simulations we investigate the impact of
charged walls on the crystallization properties of charged colloidal
suspensions confined between these walls. The investigations are based on an
effective model focussing on the colloids alone. Our results demonstrate that
the fluid-wall interaction stemming from charged walls has a crucial impact on
the fluid's high-density behavior as compared to the case of uncharged walls.
In particular, based on an analysis of in-plane bond order parameters we find
surface-charge-induced freezing and melting transitions.
