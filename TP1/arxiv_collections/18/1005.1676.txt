Six major frameworks have emerged attempting to describe particle physics
beyond the Standard Model. Despite their different theoretical genera, these
frameworks have a number of common phenomenological features and problems.
While it will be possible (and desirable) to conduct model-independent searches
for new physics at the LHC, it is equally important to develop robust methods
to discriminate between BSM 'look-alikes'.
