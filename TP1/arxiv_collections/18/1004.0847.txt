For the study of Planck-scale modifications of the energy-momentum dispersion
relation, which had been previously focused on the implications for
ultrarelativistic (ultrafast) particles, we consider the possible role of
experiments involving nonrelativistic particles, and particularly atoms. We
extend a recent result establishing that measurements of "atom-recoil
frequency" can provide insight that is valuable for some theoretical models.
And from a broader perspective we analyze the complementarity of the
nonrelativistic and the ultrarelativistic regimes in this research area.
