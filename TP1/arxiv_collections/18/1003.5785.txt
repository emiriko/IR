We propose a phenomenological model that describes counterflow and drag
experiments with quantum Hall bilayers in a \nu_T=1 state. We consider the
system consisting of statistically distributed areas with local total filling
factors \nu_{T1}>1 and \nu_{T2}<1. The excess or deficit of electrons in a
given area results in an appearance of vortex excitations. The vortices in
quantum Hall bilayers are charged. They are responsible for a decay of the
exciton supercurrent, and, at the same time, contribute to the conductivity
directly. The experimental temperature dependence of the counterflow and drive
resistivities is described under accounting viscous forces applied to vortices
that are the exponentially increase functions of the inverse temperature. The
presence of defect areas where the interlayer phase coherence is destroyed
completely can result in an essential negative longitudinal drag resistivity as
well as in a counterflow Hall resistivity.
