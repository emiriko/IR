We numerically solve the Boltzmann equation for trapped fermions in the
normal phase using the test-particle method. After discussing a couple of tests
in order to estimate the reliability of the method, we apply it to the
description of collective modes in a spherical harmonic trap. The numerical
results are compared with those obtained previously by taking moments of the
Boltzmann equation. We find that the general shape of the response function is
very similar in both methods, but the relaxation time obtained from the
simulation is significantly longer than that predicted by the method of
moments. It is shown that the result of the method of moments can be corrected
by including fourth-order moments in addition to the usual second-order ones
and that this method agrees very well with our numerical simulations.
