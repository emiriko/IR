We consider 2d Maxwell system defined on the Rindler space with metric
ds^2=\exp(2a\xi)\cdot(d\eta^2-d\xi^2) with the goal to study the dynamics of
the ghosts. We find an extra contribution to the vacuum energy in comparison
with Minkowski space time with metric ds^2= dt^2-dx^2. This extra contribution
can be traced to the unphysical degrees of freedom (in Minkowski space). The
technical reason for this effect to occur is the property of Bogolubov's
coefficients which mix the positive and negative frequencies modes. The
corresponding mixture can not be avoided because the projections to positive
-frequency modes with respect to Minkowski time t and positive -frequency modes
with respect to the Rindler observer's proper time \eta are not equivalent. The
exact cancellation of unphysical degrees of freedom which is maintained in
Minkowski space can not hold in the Rindler space. In BRST approach this effect
manifests itself as the presence of BRST charge density in L and R parts. An
inertial observer in Minkowski vacuum |0> observes a universe with no net BRST
charge only as a result of cancellation between the two. However, the Rindler
observers who do not ever have access to the entire space time would see a net
BRST charge. In this respect the effect resembles the Unruh effect. The effect
is infrared (IR) in nature, and sensitive to the horizon and/or boundaries. We
interpret the extra energy as the formation of the "ghost condensate" when the
ghost degrees of freedom can not propagate, but nevertheless do contribute to
the vacuum energy. Exact computations in this simple 2d model support the claim
made in [1] that the ghost contribution might be responsible for the observed
dark energy in 4d FLRW universe.
