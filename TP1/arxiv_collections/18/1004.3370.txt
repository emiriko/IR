In this paper, the properties of dark energy are investigated according to
the parameterized deceleration parameter $q(z)$, which is used to describe the
extent of the accelerating expansion of the universe. The potential of dark
energy $V(\phi)$ and the cosmological parameters, such as the dimensionless
energy density $\Omega_{\phi}$, $\Omega_{m}$, and the state parameter $w_\phi$,
are connected to it. Concretely, by giving two kinds of parameterized
deceleration parameters $q(z)=a+\frac{bz}{1+z}$ and
$q(z)=1/2+\frac{az+b}{(1+z)^2}$, the evolution of these parameters and the
reconstructed potentials $V(\phi)$ are plotted and analyzed. It's found that
the potentials run away with the evolution of universe.
