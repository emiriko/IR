This thesis is mainly about extensions of the first-order logic
axiomatization of special relativity introduced by Andr\'eka, Madar\'asz and
N\'emeti. These extensions include extension to accelerated observers,
relativistic dynamics and general relativity; however, its main subject is the
extension to accelerated observers (AccRel). One surprising result is that
natural extension to accelerated observers is not enough if we want our theory
to imply certain experimental facts, such as the twin paradox. Even if we add
the whole first-order theory of real numbers to this natural extension, it is
still not enough to imply the twin paradox. Nevertheless, that does not mean
that this task cannot be carried out within first-order logic since by
approximating a second-order logic axiom of real numbers, we introduce a
first-order axiom schema that solves the problem. Our theory AccRel nicely
fills the gap between special and general relativity theories, and only one
natural generalization step is needed to achieve a first-order logic
axiomatization of general relativity from it. We also show that AccRel is
strong enough to make predictions about the gravitational effect slowing down
time. Our general aims are to axiomatize relativity theories within pure
first-order logic using simple, comprehensible and transparent basic
assumptions (axioms); to prove the surprising predictions (theorems) of
relativity theories from a few convincing axioms; to eliminate tacit
assumptions from relativity by replacing them with explicit axioms formulated
in first-order logic (in the spirit of the first-order logic foundation of
mathematics and Tarski's axiomatization of geometry); and to investigate the
relationship between the axioms and the theorems.
