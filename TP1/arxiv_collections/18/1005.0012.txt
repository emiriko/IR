We investigate the application of the singular value decomposition to
compact-binary, gravitational-wave data-analysis. We find that the truncated
singular value decomposition reduces the number of filters required to analyze
a given region of parameter space of compact binary coalescence waveforms by an
order of magnitude with high reconstruction accuracy. We also compute an
analytic expression for the expected signal-loss due to the singular value
decomposition truncation.
