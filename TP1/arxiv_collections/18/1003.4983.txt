The Cosmic Ray Energetics And Mass (CREAM) is a balloon-borne experiment
designed to measure the composition and energy spectra of cosmic rays of charge
Z = 1 to 26 up to an energy of ~ 10^15 eV. CREAM had two successful flights on
long-duration balloons (LDB) launched from Mc- Murdo Station, Antarctica, in
December 2004 and December 2005. CREAM-I achieves a substantial measurement
redundancy by employing multiple detector systems, namely a Timing Charge
Detector and a Silicon Charge Detector (SCD) for particle identification, and a
Transition Radiation Detector and a sampling tungsten/scintillating-fiber
ionization calorimeter (CAL) for energy measurement. In this paper, preliminary
energy spectra of various elements measured with CAL/SCD during the first
42-day flight are presented.
