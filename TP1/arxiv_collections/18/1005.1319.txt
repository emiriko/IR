In this work we have derived a class of geometries which describe black holes
and wormholes in Randall-Sundrum-type brane models, focusing mainly on
asymptotically anti-de Sitter backgrounds. We show that by continuously
deforming the usual four dimensional vacuum background, a specific family of
solutions is obtained. Maximal extensions of the solutions are presented, and
their causal structures are discussed.
