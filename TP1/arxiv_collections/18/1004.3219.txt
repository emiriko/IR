In this paper we prove a multiplicity result concerning the critical points
of a class of functionals involving local and nonlocal nonlinearities. We apply
our result to the nonlinear Schrodinger-Maxwell system and to the nonlinear
elliptic Kirchhoff equation assuming on the local nonlinearity the general
hypotheses introduced by Berestycki and Lions.
