Analytical description of propagation phenomena on random networks has
flourished in recent years, yet more complex systems have mainly been studied
through numerical means. In this paper, a mean-field description is used to
coherently couple the dynamics of the network elements (nodes, vertices,
individuals...) on the one hand and their recurrent topological patterns
(subgraphs, groups...) on the other hand. In a SIS model of epidemic spread on
social networks with community structure, this approach yields a set of ODEs
for the time evolution of the system, as well as analytical solutions for the
epidemic threshold and equilibria. The results obtained are in good agreement
with numerical simulations and reproduce random networks behavior in the
appropriate limits which highlights the influence of topology on the processes.
Finally, it is demonstrated that our model predicts higher epidemic thresholds
for clustered structures than for equivalent random topologies in the case of
networks with zero degree correlation.
