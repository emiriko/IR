A method for implementing cylindrical coordinates in the Athena
magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) code is described. The extension follows the
approach of Athena's original developers and has been designed to alter the
existing Cartesian-coordinates code as minimally and transparently as possible.
The numerical equations in cylindrical coordinates are formulated to maintain
consistency with constrained transport, a central feature of the Athena
algorithm, while making use of previously implemented code modules such as the
Riemann solvers. Angular-momentum transport, which is critical in astrophysical
disk systems dominated by rotation, is treated carefully. We describe
modifications for cylindrical coordinates of the higher-order spatial
reconstruction and characteristic evolution steps as well as the finite-volume
and constrained transport updates. Finally, we present a test suite of standard
and novel problems in one-, two-, and three-dimensions designed to validate our
algorithms and implementation and to be of use to other code developers. The
code is suitable for use in a wide variety of astrophysical applications and is
freely available for download on the web.
