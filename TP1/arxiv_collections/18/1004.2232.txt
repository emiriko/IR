Two identical finite quantum systems prepared initially at different
temperatures, isolated from the environment, and subsequently brought into
contact are demonstrated to relax towards Gibbs-like quasi-equilibrium states
with a common temperature and small fluctuations around the time-averaged
expectation values of generic observables. The temporal thermalization process
proceeds via a chain of intermediate Gibbs-like states. We specify the
conditions under which this scenario occurs and corroborate the quantum
equilibration with two different models.
