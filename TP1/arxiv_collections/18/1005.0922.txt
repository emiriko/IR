We investigated the nature of the magnetic phase transition in the
Ge/1-x-y/Sn/x/Mn/y/Te mixed crystals with chemical composition changing in the
range of 0.083 < x < 0.142 and 0.012 < y < 0.119. The DC magnetization
measurements performed in the magnetic field up to 90 kOe and temperature range
2-200 K showed that the magnetic ordering at temperatures below T = 50 K
exhibits features characteristic for both spin-glass and ferromagnetic phases.
The modified Sherrington - Southern model was applied to explain the observed
transition temperatures. The calculations showed that the spin-glass state is
preferred in the range of the experimental carrier concentrations and Mn
content. The value of the Mn hole exchange integral was estimated to be J/pd/ =
0.45+/-0.05 eV. The experimental magnetization vs temperature curves were
reproduced satisfactory using the non-interacting spin-wave theory with the
exchange constant J/pd/ values consistent with those calculated using modified
Sherrington - Southern model. The magnetization vs magnetic field curves showed
nonsaturating behavior at magnetic fields B < 90 kOe indicating the presence of
strong magnetic frustration in the system. The experimental results were
reproduced theoretically with good accuracy using the molecular field
approximation-based model of a disordered ferromagnet with long-range RKKY
interaction.
