We study the influence of boundary conditions on the finite-size corrections
of a one-dimensional (1D) quantum spin model by exact and perturbative
theoretic calculations. We obtain two new infinite sets of universal amplitude
ratios for the finite-size correction terms of the 1D quantum spin model of $N$
sites with free and antiperiodic boundary conditions. The results for the
lowest two orders are in perfect agreement with a perturbative conformal field
theory scenario proposed by Cardy [Nucl. Phys. B {\bf 270}, 186 (1986)].
