We have performed low-temperature transport measurements on a disordered
two-dimensional electron system (2DES). Features of the strong localization
leading to the quantum Hall effect are observed after the 2DES undergoes a
direct insulator-quantum Hall transition with increasing the perpendicular
magnetic field. However, such a transition does not correspond to the onset of
strong localization. The temperature dependences of the Hall resistivity and
Hall conductivity reveal the importance of the electron-electron interaction
effects to the observed transition in our study.
