We theoretically predict the occurrence of multiple hydrodynamical-like shock
phenomena in the propagation of ultrashort intense pulses in a suitably
engineered photonic crystal fiber. The shocks are due to the Raman effect,
which acts as a nonlocal term favoring their generation in the focusing regime.
It is shown that the problem is mapped to shock formation in the presence of a
slope and a gravity-like potential. The signature of multiple shocks in XFROG
signals is unveiled.
