The huge datasets collected at the two B factories, Belle and BaBar, have
made it possible to explore the radiative penguin process b --> s gamma, the
electroweak penguin process b --> s l+ l- and the suppressed radiative process
b --> d gamma in detail, all in exclusive channels and inclusive measurements.
Theoretical tools have also advanced to meet or surpass the experimental
precision, especially in inclusive calculations and the various ratios of
exclusive channels. In this article, we review the theoretical and experimental
progress over the past decade in the radiative and electroweak penguin decays
of B mesons.
