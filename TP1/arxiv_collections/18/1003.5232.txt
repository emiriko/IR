We present a model for the decay $D^+\to K^-\pi^+\pi^+$. The weak interaction
part of this reaction is described using the effective weak Hamiltonian in the
factorisation approach. Hadronic final state interactions are taken into
account through the $K\pi$ scalar and vector form factors fulfilling
analyticity, unitarity and chiral symmetry constraints. Allowing for a global
phase difference between the $S$ and $P$ waves of $-65^\circ$, the Dalitz plot
of the $D^+\to K^-\pi^+\pi^+$ decay, the $K\pi$ invariant mass spectra and the
total branching ratio due to $S$-wave interactions are well reproduced.
