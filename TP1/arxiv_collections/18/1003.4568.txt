Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) play an important role in the study of cosmic
evolution, especially in cosmology. There are several progenitor models for SNe
Ia proposed in the past years. In this paper, by considering the effect of
accretion disk instability on the evolution of white dwarf (WD) binaries, we
performed detailed binary evolution calculations for the WD + red-giant (RG)
channel of SNe Ia, in which a carbon-oxygen WD accretes material from a RG star
to increase its mass to the Chandrasekhar mass limit. According to these
calculations, we mapped out the initial and final parameters for SNe Ia in the
orbital period--secondary mass plane for various WD masses for this channel. We
discussed the influence of the variation of the duty cycle value on the regions
for producing SNe Ia. Similar to previous studies, this work also indicates
that the long-period dwarf novae offer a possible ways for producing SNe Ia.
Meanwhile, we find that the surviving companion stars from this channel have a
low mass after SN explosion, which may provide a means for the formation of the
population of single low-mass WDs (<0.45Msun).
