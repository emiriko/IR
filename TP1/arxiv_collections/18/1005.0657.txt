The secure "pairing" of wireless devices based on auxiliary or out-of-band
(OOB) communication, such as audio, visual, or tactile channels, is a
well-established research direction. However, prior work shows that this
approach to pairing can be prone to human errors of different forms that may
directly or indirectly translate into man-in-the-middle attacks. To address
this problem, we propose a general direction of the use of computer games for
pairing. Since games are a popular means of entertainment, our hypothesis is
that they may serve as an incentive to users and make the pairing process
enjoyable for them, thus improving the usability, as well as the security, of
the pairing process. We consider an emerging use case of pairing whereby two
different users are involved, each in possession of his or her own device
(e.g., Alice and Bob pairing their smartphones for social interactions). We
develop "Alice Says," a pairing game based on a popular memory game called
Simon (Says), and discuss the underlying design challenges. We also present a
preliminary evaluation of Alice Says via a usability study and demonstrate its
feasibility in terms of usability and security. Our results indicate that
overall Alice Says was deemed as a fun and an enjoyable way to pair devices,
confirming our hypothesis. However, contrary to our intuition, the relatively
slower speed of Alice Says pairing was found to be a cause of concern and
prompts the need for the design of faster pairing games. We put forth several
ways in which this issue can be ameliorated. In addition, we also discuss
several other security problems which are lacking optimal solutions and suggest
ideas on how entertainment can be used to improve the current state of the art
solutions that have been developed to address them.
