We report on the non-trivial nanoscale kinetics of the deposition of novel
complex oxide heterostructures composed of a unit-cell thick correlated metal
LaNiO3 and dielectric LaAlO3. The multilayers demonstrate exceptionally good
crystallinity and surface morphology maintained over the large number of
layers, as confirmed by AFM, RHEED, and synchrotron X-ray diffraction. To
elucidate the physics behind the growth, the temperature of the substrate and
the deposition rate were varied over a wide range and the results were treated
in the framework of a two-layer model. These results are of fundamental
importance for synthesis of new phases of complex oxide heterostructures.
