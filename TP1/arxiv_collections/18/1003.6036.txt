The correct computation of orbits of discrete dynamical systems on the
interval is considered. Therefore, an arbitrary-precision floating-point
approach based on automatic error analysis is chosen and a general algorithm is
presented. The correctness of the algorithm is shown and the computational
complexity is analyzed. There are two main results. First, the computational
complexity measure considered here is related to the Lyapunov exponent of the
dynamical system under consideration. Second, the presented algorithm is
optimal with regard to that complexity measure.
