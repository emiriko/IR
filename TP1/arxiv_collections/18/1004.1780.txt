I describe a possible perspective on the current state of loop quantum
gravity, at the light of the developments of the last years. I point out that a
theory is now available, having a well-defined background-independent
kinematics and a dynamics allowing transition amplitudes to be computed
explicitly in different regimes. I underline the fact that the dynamics can be
given in terms of a simple vertex function, largely determined by locality,
diffeomorphism invariance and local Lorentz invariance. I emphasize the
importance of approximations. I list open problems.
