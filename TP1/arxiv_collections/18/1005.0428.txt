We investigate the strongly correlated effect of cold atoms in triangular
optical lattice by dynamical cluster approximation combining with the
continuous time quantum Monte Carlo method proposed recently. It is found the
double occupancy is suppressed as the atomic interaction increases. By
calculating the density of states, we show how the system evolves from Fermi
liquid with an obvious quasi-particle peak into Mott insulator with an opened
gap for increasing interaction. The transition between Fermi liquid and
pseudogap shows a reentrant behavior due to the Kondo effect. At low
temperature, a Kondo peak appears before the splitting of the Fermi-liquid-like
peak. The Fermi surface evolves from a circular ring with high amplitude into a
{\deg}at elliptical ring with low amplitude for the increasing interaction. We
give an experimental protocol to observe these phenomena by varying the lattice
depth and the atomic interaction via Feshbach resonance in future experiments.
