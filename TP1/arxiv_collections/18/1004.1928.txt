In this paper, we investigate phenomenologically two-body weak decays of the
bottom mesons emitting pseudoscalar and tensor mesons. Decay amplitudes are
obtained using the factorization scheme in the improved ISGW II model.
Branching ratios for the CKM-favored and CKM-suppressed decays are calculated.
