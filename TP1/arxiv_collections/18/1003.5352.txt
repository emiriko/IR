We present some gauge conditions to eliminate all second time derivative
terms in the vierbein forms of the ten Einstein equations of general
relativity; at the same time, we present the corresponding Lagrangian in which
there is not any quadratic term of first time derivative that can leads to
those vierbein forms of the Einstein equations without second time derivative
term by the corresponding Euler-Lagrange equations. General relativity thus
becomes a fully singular Lagrange system.
