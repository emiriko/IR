We investigate the recently quantified misalignment of $\alpha_{mis} \approx
20^\circ-40^\circ$ between the 3-D geometry of stereoscopically triangulated
coronal loops observed with STEREO/EUVI (in four active regions) and
theoretical (potential or nonlinear force-free) magnetic field models
extrapolated from photospheric magnetograms. We develop an efficient method of
bootstrapping the coronal magnetic field by forward-fitting a parameterized
potential field model to the STEREO-observed loops. The potential field model
consists of a number of unipolar magnetic charges that are parameterized by
decomposing a photospheric magnetogram from MDI. The forward-fitting method
yields a best-fit magnetic field model with a reduced misalignment of
$\alpha_{PF} \approx 13^\circ-20^\circ$. We evaluate also stereoscopic
measurement errors and find a contribution of $\alpha_{SE}\approx
7^\circ-12^\circ$, which constrains the residual misalignment to
$\alpha_{NP}=\alpha_{PF}-\alpha_{SE}\approx 5^\circ -9^\circ$, which is likely
due to the nonpotentiality of the active regions. The residual misalignment
angle $\alpha_{NP}$ of the potential field due to nonpotentiality is found to
correlate with the soft X-ray flux of the active region, which implies a
relationship between electric currents and plasma heating.
