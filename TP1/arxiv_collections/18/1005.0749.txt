We present in this paper an evolution of a tool from a user interface for a
concrete Computer Algebra system for Algebraic Topology (the Kenzo system), to
a front-end allowing the interoperability among different sources for
computation and deduction. The architecture allows the system not only to
interface several systems, but also to make them cooperate in shared
calculations.
