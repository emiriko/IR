In this paper we consider the normalized lengths of the factors of some
factorizations of random words. First, for the \emph{Lyndon factorization} of
finite random words with $n$ independent letters drawn from a finite or
infinite totally ordered alphabet according to a general probability
distribution, we prove that the limit law of the normalized lengths of the
smallest Lyndon factors is a variant of the stickbreaking process. Convergence
of the distribution of the lengths of the longest factors to a
Poisson-Dirichlet distribution follows. Secondly we consider the \emph{standard
factorization} of random \emph{Lyndon word} : we prove that the distribution of
the normalized length of the standard right factor of a random $n$-letters long
Lyndon word, derived from such an alphabet, converges, when $n$ is large, to:
$$\mu(dx)=p_1 \delta_{1}(dx) + (1-p_1) \mathbf{1}_{[0,1)}(x)dx,$$ in which
$p_1$ denotes the probability of the smallest letter of the alphabet.
