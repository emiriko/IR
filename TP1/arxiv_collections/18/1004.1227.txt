This paper present a novel off-line signature recognition method based on
multi scale Fourier Descriptor and wavelet transform . The main steps of
constructing a signature recognition system are discussed and experiments on
real data sets show that the average error rate can reach 1%. Finally we
compare 8 distance measures between feature vectors with respect to the
recognition performance.
