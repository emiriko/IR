In experiments with trapped atoms, atomic energy levels are shifted by the
trapping optical and magnetic fields. Regardless of this strong perturbation,
precision spectroscopy may be still carried out using specially crafted,
"magic" trapping fields. Finding these conditions for particularly valuable
microwave clock transitions in alkalis has so far remained an open challenge.
Here I demonstrate that the microwave clock transitions for alkalis may be
indeed made impervious to both trapping laser intensity and fluctuations of
magnetic fields. I consider driving multiphoton transitions between the clock
levels and show that these "doubly-magic" conditions are realized at special
values of trapping laser wavelengths and fixed values of relatively weak
magnetic fields. This finding has implications for precision measurements and
quantum information processing with qubits stored in hyperfine manifolds.
