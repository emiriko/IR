The magnetic, electric and thermal properties of the
($Ln_{1-y}$Y$_{y}$)$_{0.7}$Ca$_{0.3}$CoO$_3$ perovskites ($Ln$~=~Pr, Nd) were
investigated down to very low temperatures. The main attention was given to a
peculiar metal-insulator transition, which is observed in the praseodymium
based samples with $y=0.075$ and 0.15 at $T_{M-I}=64$ and 132~K, respectively.
The study suggests that the transition, reported originally in
Pr$_{0.5}$Ca$_{0.5}$CoO$_3$, is not due to a mere change of cobalt ions from
the intermediate- to the low-spin states, but is associated also with a
significant electron transfer between Pr$^{3+}$ and Co$^{3+}$/Co$^{4+}$ sites,
so that the praseodymium ions occur below $T_{M-I}$ in a mixed
Pr$^{3+}$/Pr$^{4+}$ valence. The presence of Pr$^{4+}$ ions in the insulating
phase of the yttrium doped samples (Pr$_{1-y}$Y$_{y}$)$_{0.7}$Ca$_{0.3}$CoO$_3$
is evidenced by Schottky peak originating in Zeeman splitting of the ground
state Kramers doublet. The peak is absent in pure Pr$_{0.7}$Ca$_{0.3}$CoO$_3$
in which metallic phase, based solely on non-Kramers Pr$^{3+}$ ions, is
retained down to the lowest temperature.
