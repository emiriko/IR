We present a model for the rotational evolution of a young, solar mass star
interacting with an accretion disk. The model incorporates a description of the
angular momentum transfer between the star and disk due to a magnetic
connection, and includes changes in the star's mass and radius and a decreasing
accretion rate. The model also includes, for the first time in a spin evolution
model, the opening of the stellar magnetic field lines, as expected to arise
from twisting via star-disk differential rotation. In order to isolate the
effect that this has on the star-disk interaction torques, we neglect the
influence of torques that may arise from open field regions connected to the
star or disk. For a range of magnetic field strengths, accretion rates, and
initial spin rates, we compute the stellar spin rates of pre-main-sequence
stars as they evolve on the Hayashi track to an age of 3~Myr. How much the
field opening affects the spin depends on the strength of the coupling of the
magnetic field to the disk. For the relatively strong coupling (i.e., high
magnetic Reynolds number) expected in real systems, all models predict spin
periods of less than $\sim3$ days, in the age range of 1--3~Myr. Furthermore,
these systems typically do not reach an equilibrium spin rate within 3~Myr, so
that the spin at any given time depends upon the choice of initial spin rate.
This corroborates earlier suggestions that, in order to explain the full range
of observed rotation periods of approximately $1$--$10$ days, additional
processes, such as the angular momentum loss from powerful stellar winds, are
necessary.
