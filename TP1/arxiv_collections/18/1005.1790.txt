We show how a single flux quantum can be effectively manipulated in a
superconducting film with a matrix of blind holes. Such a sample can serve as a
basic memory element, where the position of the vortex in a [k x l] matrix of
pinning sites defines the desired combination of n bits of information
(2^n=k*l). Vortex placement is achieved by strategically applied current and
the resulting position is read-out via generated voltage between metallic
contacts on the sample. Such a device can also act as a controllable source of
a nanoengineered local magnetic field for e.g. spintronics applications.
