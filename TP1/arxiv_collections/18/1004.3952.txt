This study aimed to develop a contamination free porous titanium scaffold by
a plasma activated sintering within an originally developed TiN coated graphite
mold. The surface of porous titanium sheet with or without a coated graphite
mold was characterized. The cell adhesion property of porous titanium sheet was
also evaluated in this study. The peak of TiC was detected on the titanium
sheet processed with the graphite mold without a TiN coating. Since the
titanium fiber elements were directly in contact with the carbon graphite mold
during processing, surface contamination was unavoidable event in this
condition. The TiC peak was not detectable on the titanium sheet processed
within the TiN coated carbon graphite mold. This modified plasma activated
sintering with the TiN coated graphite mold would be useful to fabricate a
contamination free titanium sheet. The number of adherent cells on the modified
titanium sheet was greater than that of the bare titanium plate. Stress fiber
formation and the extension of the cells were observed on the titanium sheets.
This modified titanium sheet is expected to be a new tissue engineering
material in orthopedic bone repair.
