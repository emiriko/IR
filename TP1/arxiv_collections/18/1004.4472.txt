Electronic structure calculations were performed on the compound CoS$_2$, an
itinerant ferromagnet whose magnetic properties can be understood in terms of
spin fluctuation theory. We have identified nesting features in the Fermi
surface of the compound, active for long wavelength spin fluctuations. The
electronic structure of the material is close to a half-metal. We show the
importance of introducing spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in the calculations, that
partially destroys the half-metallicity of the material. By means of transport
properties calculations, we have quantified the influence of SOC in the
conductivity at room temperature, with an important decrease comparing to the
GGA alone conductivity. SOC also helps to understand the negative 0 of the
material, whose conductivity varies by a few percent with the introduction of
small perturbations in the states around the Fermi level.
