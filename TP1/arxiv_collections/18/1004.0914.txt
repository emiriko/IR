In this paper, collaborative use of relays to form a beamforming system with
the aid of perfect channel state information (CSI) and to provide communication
in physicallayer security between a transmitter and two receivers is
investigated. In particular, we describe decode-and-forward based null space
beamforming schemes and optimize the relay weights jointly to obtain the
largest secrecy rate region. Furthermore, the optimality of the proposed
schemes is investigated by comparing them with the outer bound secrecy rate
region
