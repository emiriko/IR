We investigate theoretically the linear and nonlinear conductance through a
nanostructure with two-fold degenerate single levels, corresponding to the
transport through nanostructures such as a carbon nanotube, or double dot
systems with capacitive interaction. It is shown that the presence of the
interaction asymmetry between orbits/dots affects significantly the profile of
the linear conductance at finite temperature, and, of the nonlinear
conductance, particularly around half-filling, where the two-particle Kondo
effect occurs. Within the range of experimentally feasible parameters, the
SU(4) universal behavior is suggested, and comparison with relevant experiments
is made.
