We study the underlying relationship between Painleve equations and
infinite-dimensional integrable systems, such as the KP and UC hierarchies. We
show that a certain reduction of these hierarchies by requiring homogeneity and
periodicity yields Painleve equations, including their higher order
generalization. This result allows us to clearly understand various aspects of
the equations, e.g., Lax formalism, Hirota bilinear relations for
tau-functions, Weyl group symmetry, and algebraic solutions in terms of the
character polynomials, i.e., the Schur function and the universal character.
