We discuss five-dimensional Standard Model in a slice of adS space-time with
the Higgs field residing near or on the UV brane. Allowing fermion fields to
propagate in the bulk, we obtain the hierarchy of their masses and quark
mixings without introducing large or small Yukawa couplings. However, the
interaction of fermions with the Higgs and gauge boson KK excitations gives
rise to FCNC with no built-in suppression mechanism. This strongly constrains
the scale of KK masses. We also discuss neutrino mass generation via KK
excitations of the Higgs field. We find that this mechanism is subdominant in
the scenarios of spontaneous symmetry breaking we consider.
