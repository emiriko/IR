In this manuscript we study the vector - vector interaction within the hidden
gauge formalism in a coupled channel unitary approach. In the sector
$C=1,S=1,J=2$ we get a pole in the T-matrix around $2572$ MeV that we identify
with the $D^*_{s2}(2573)$, coupling strongly to the
$D^*K^*$($D^*_s\phi$($\omega$)) channels. In addition we obtain resonances in
other exotic sectors which have not been studied before such as $C=1,S=-1$,
$C=2,S=0$ and $C=2,S=1$. This 'flavor-exotic' states are interpreted as
$D^*\bar{K^*}$, $D^*D^*$ and $D^*_sD^*$ molecular states but have not been
observed yet. In total we obtain nine states with different spin, isospin,
charm and strangeness of non $C=0,S=0$ and $C=1,S=0$ character, which have been
reported before.
