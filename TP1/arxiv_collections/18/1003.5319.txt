The relation connecting the emitted isotropic energy and the rest-frame peak
energy of the \nuF\nu spectra of Gamma-Ray Bursts (the Amati relation),
strictly depends on the cosmological model, so we need a method to obtain an
independent calibration of it. Using the Union Supernovae Ia catalog, we obtain
a cosmographic luminosity distance in the y-redshift and demonstrate that this
parametrization approximates very well the fiducial standard comsomlogical
model \LambdaCDM. Furthermore, by this cosmographic luminosity distance dl, it
is possible to achieve the Amati relation independent on the cosmological
model. The cosmographic Amati relation that we obtain agrees, in the errors,
with other cosmological-independent calibrations proposed in the literature.
This could be considered a good indication in view to obtain standard candles
