The propagation of waves in highly inhomogeneous media is a problem of
interest in multiple fields including seismology, acoustics and
electromagnetism. It is also relevant for technological applications such as
the design of sound absorbing materials or the fabrication of optically devices
for multi-wavelength operation. A paradigmatic example of a highly
inhomogeneous media is one in which the density or stiffness has fractal or
multifractal properties. We investigate wave propagation in one dimensional
media with these features. We have found that, for weak disorder, localization
effects do not arrest wave propagation provided that the box fractal dimension
D of the density profile is D < 3/2. This result holds for both fractal and
multifractal media providing thus a simple universal characterization for the
existence of localization in these systems. Moreover we show that our model
verifies the scaling theory of localization and discuss practical applications
of our results.
