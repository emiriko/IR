The amplitude for $\gamma p \to \phi p$ is calculated in a pQCD $k_{T}$ -
factorization approach. The total cross section for this process is compared
with HERA data. Total cross section, as a function of photon-proton energy and
photon virtuality, is calculated. We also discuss the ratio of $\sigma_{L}$ /
$\sigma_{T}$ and the dependence on the mass of the strange quark. The amplitude
for $\gamma p \to \phi p$ is used to predict the cross section for exclusive
photoproduction of $\phi$ meson in proton-proton collisions. Absorption effects
are included. The results for RHIC, Tevatron and LHC energies are presented.
