In order to classify the charmed-strange mesons, including puzzling
D_{s0}^{*}(2317) and D_{s1}(2460), and recently observed D_{s1}^{*}(2710) and
D_{sJ}^{*}(2860), we employ the U~(12)*O(3,1) level-classification scheme of
hadrons proposed and developed by us in recent years. The scheme has a new
degree of freedom, SU(2)_{\rho}, which leads to a number of extra states out of
conventional SU(6)-scheme, named chiralons. Applying this novel classification
scheme, we investigate the strong decays of S- and P-wave c\bar{s} mesons with
one pseudoscalar emission by using the covariant oscillator quark model. As a
result it is shown that D_{s0}^{*}(2317) and D_{s1}(2460) are described as
{}^{1}S_{0}^{\chi} and {}^{3}S_{1}^{\chi} chiralons, forming the SU(2)_{\rho}
doublet with the ground-state D_{s}^{} and D_{s}^{*}, respectively.
Furthermore, the observed decay properties of D_{s1}^{*}(2710) is consistently
explained as the vector chiralon {}^{1}P_{1}^{\chi}. On the other hand, it is
also found that the controversial narrow state, D_{sJ}^{*}(2860), does not fit
as predicted properties of our P-wave vector chiralon.
