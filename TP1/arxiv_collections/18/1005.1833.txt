We present the results of spectroscopic, narrow-band and X-ray observations
of a z=2.30 protocluster in the field of the QSO HS 1700+643. Using a sample of
BX/MD galaxies, which are selected to be at z~2.2-2.7 by their rest-frame
ultraviolet colours, we find that there are 5 protocluster AGN which have been
identified by characteristic emission-lines in their optical/near-IR spectra;
this represents an enhancement over the field significant at ~98.5 per cent
confidence. Using a ~200 ks Chandra/ACIS-I observation of this field we detect
a total of 161 X-ray point sources to a Poissonian false-probability limit of
4x10^{-6} and identify 8 of these with BX/MD galaxies. Two of these are
spectroscopically confirmed protocluster members and are also classified as
emission-line AGN. When compared to a similarly selected field sample the
analysis indicates this is also evidence for an enhancement of X-ray selected
BX/MD AGN over the field, significant at ~99 per cent confidence. Deep Lya
narrow-band imaging reveals that a total of 4/123 Lya emitters (LAEs) are found
to be associated with X-ray sources, with two of these confirmed protocluster
members and one highly likely member. We do not find a significant enhancement
of AGN activity in this LAE sample over that of the field (result significant
at only 87 per cent confidence). The X-ray emitting AGN fractions for the BX/MD
and LAE samples are found to be 6.9_{-4.4}^{+9.2} and 2.9_{-1.6}^{+2.9} per
cent, respectively, for protocluster AGN with L_{2-10 keV}>4.6x10^{43} erg
s^{-1} at z=2.30. These findings are similar to results from the z=3.09
protocluster in the SSA 22 field found by Lehmer et al. (2009), in that both
suggest AGN activity is favoured in dense environments at z>2.
