As Lie algebras of compact connected Lie groups, semisimple Lie algebras have
wide applications in the description of continuous symmetries of physical
systems. Mathematically, semisimple Lie algebra admits a Cartan-Weyl basis of
generators which consists of a Cartan subalgebra of mutually commuting
generators H_I and a number of step generators E^\alpha that are characterized
by a root space of non-degenerate one-forms \alpha. This simple decomposition
in terms of the root space allows for a complete classification of semisimple
Lie algebras. In this paper, we introduce the analogous concept of a
Cartan-Weyl Lie 3-algebra. We analyze their structure and obtain a complete
classification of them. Many known examples of metric Lie 3-algebras (e.g. the
Lorentzian 3-algebras) are special cases of the Cartan-Weyl 3-algebras. Due to
their elegant and simple structure, we speculate that Cartan-Weyl 3-algebras
may be useful for describing some kinds of generalized symmetries. As an
application, we consider their use in the Bagger-Lambert-Gustavsson (BLG)
theory.
