The lattice dynamics of the ferromagnetic spinel CuCr2Se4 (Tc = 430K) was
studied experimentally by measuring the Raman spectra and theoretically by
calculation of zone center phonon frequencies within a shell model. All Raman
allowed modes (A1g + E_g + 3F2g) were identified and assigned to specific
atomic motions. The relative intensity of the Raman lines varies strongly with
excitation photon energy between 1.58 and 2.71 eV, but no significant phonon
anomalies are observed near Tc.
