The X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) at the Mn K-edge in the
(Ga,Mn)As magnetic semiconductor was simulated using the full potential
linearized augmented plane wave (FLAPW) method including the core-hole effect.
The calculations were performed in the supercell scheme for a substitutional
and two tetrahedral interstitial Mn sites. The resulting pre-edge absorption
structures show sharp distinction between the spectra simulated for the
substitutional and interstitial Mn defects which is determined mainly by the
second nearest neighbor ligands. A single feature is obtained for the
substitutional Mn impurity, whereas two peaks appear for both types of
interstitial defects. An interpretation of the pre-edge features was proposed.
