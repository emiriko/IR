The dependence of the interwall conductance on distance between walls and
relative positions of walls are calculated at the low voltage by Bardeen method
for (n,n)@(2n,2n) double-walled carbon nanotubes (DWCNTs) with n = 5, 6, ...,
10. The calculations show that interwall conductance does not depend on
temperature (for T < 500 K) and current-voltage characteristic is linear. The
conductance decreases by 6 orders of magnitude when the interwall distance is
doubled. Thus, depending on the interwall distance, DWCNTs can be used as
temperature stable nanoresistors or nanocapacitors.
