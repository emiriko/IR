This note deals with the five-dimensional pure SU(2) AGT conjecture proposed
by Awata and Yamada. We give a conjecture on a recursive formula for the inner
product of the deformed Gaiotto state. We also show that the K-theoretic pure
SU(2) Nekrasov partition function satisfies the same recursion relation.
Therefore the five-dimensional AGT conjecture is reduced to our conjectural
recursive formula.
