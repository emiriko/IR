It is shown that the four-parameter family of elliptic functions
$$u_D(z)=m_0(m_0+1)\wp(z)+\sum_{i=1}^3 m_i(m_i+1)\wp(z-\omega_i)$$ introduced
by Darboux and rediscovered a hundred years later by Treibich and Verdier, is
the most general meromorphic family containing infinitely many finite-gap
potentials.
