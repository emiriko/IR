In this paper we describe the structure of extremal stationary spherically
symmetric black hole solutions in the STU model of D=4, N=2 supergravity in
terms of four-qubit systems. Our analysis extends the results of previous
investigations based on three qubits. The basic idea facilitating this
four-qubit interpretation is the fact that stationary solutions in D=4
supergravity can be described by dimensional reduction along the time
direction. In this D=3 picture the global symmetry group $SL(2,R)^{\times 3}$
of the model is extended by the Ehlers SL(2,R) accounting for the fourth qubit.
We introduce a four qubit state depending on the charges (electric, magnetic
and NUT) the moduli and the warp factor. We relate the entanglement properties
of this state to different classes of black hole solutions in the STU model. In
the terminology of four qubit entanglement extremal black hole solutions
correspond to nilpotent, and nonextremal ones to semisimple states. In arriving
at this entanglement based scenario the role of the four algebraically
independent four qubit SL(2,C) invariants is emphasized.
