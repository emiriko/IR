We study a manifestly gauge invariant set of Schwinger-Dyson equations to
determine the nonperturbative dynamics of the gluon and ghost propagators in
$d=3$ Yang-Mills. The use of the well-known Schwinger mechanism, in the Landau
gauge, leads to the dynamical generation of a mass for the gauge boson (gluon
in $d=3$), which, in turn, gives rise to an infrared finite gluon propagator
and ghost dressing function. The propagators obtained from the numerical
solution of these nonperturbative equations are in very good agreement with the
results of $SU(2)$ lattice simulations.
