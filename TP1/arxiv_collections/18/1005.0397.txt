We present predictions for relevant LHC observables obtained with the
NNPDF2.0 set. We compute the combined PDFs uncertainties on these observables,
and show that combining errors in quadrature yields an excellent approximation
to exact error propagation. We then compare the NNPDF2.0 results to the other
global PDF fits using a common value of $\alpha_s$. At LHC 7 TeV, reasonable
agreement, both in central values and in uncertainties, is found for NNPDF2.0,
CTEQ6.6 and MSTW08.
