We study the formation and dynamics of the bound pair (BP) and bound triple
(BT) in strongly correlated extended Hubbard model for both Bose and Fermi
systems. We find that the bandwidths of the BP and BT gain significantly when
the on-site and nearest-neighbor interaction strengths reach the corresponding
resonant points. This allows the fast transfer and efficient coherent
separation of the BP and BT. The exact result shows that the success
probability of the coherent separation is unity in the optimal system. In Fermi
system, this finding can be applied to create distant entanglement without the
need of temporal control and measurement process.
