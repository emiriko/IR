Ambipolar charge carrier transport in Copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) is studied
experimentally in field-effect transistors and metal-insulator-semiconductor
diodes at various temperatures. The electronic structure and the transport
properties of CuPc attached to leads are calculated using density functional
theory and scattering theory at the non-equilibrium Green's function level. We
discuss, in particular, the electronic structure of CuPc molecules attached to
gold chains in different geometries to mimic the different experimental setups.
The combined experimental and theoretical analysis explains the dependence of
the mobilityand the transmission coefficient on the charge carrier type
(electrons or holes) and on the contact geometry. We demonstrate the
correspondence between our experimental results on thick films and our
theoretical studies of single molecule contacts. Preliminary results for
fluorinated CuPc are discussed.
