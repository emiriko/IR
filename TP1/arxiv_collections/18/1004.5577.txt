We analyze a number of proposed explanations for spectroscopic anomalies
observed in atomic hydrogen defects embedded in a solid molecular hydrogen
matrix. In particular, we critically evaluate the possibility that these
anomalies are related to Bose-Einstein condensation (both global and local).
For each proposed mechanism we discuss which aspects of the experiment can be
explained, and make predictions for future experiments.
