We study the issue of the spin-chirality decoupling/coupling in the ordering
of the Heisenberg spin glass by performing large-scale Monte Carlo simulations
on a one-dimensional Heisenberg spin-glass model with a long-range power-law
interaction up to large system sizes. We find that the spin-chirality
decoupling occurs for an intermediate range of the power-law exponent.
Implications to the corresponding $d$-dimensional short-range model is
discussed.
