We study the transport properties of an overdamped Brownian particle which is
simultaneously in contact with two thermal baths. The first bath is modeled by
an additive thermal noise at temperature $T_A$. The second bath is associated
with a multiplicative thermal noise at temperature $T_B$. The analytical
expressions for the particle velocity and diffusion constant are derived for
this system, and the reliability or coherence of transport is analyzed by means
of their ratio in terms of a dimensionless P\'{e}clet number. We find that the
transport is not very coherent, though one can get significantly higher
currents.
