We present a new proof of global existence and long range scattering, from
small initial data, for the one-dimensional cubic gauge invariant nonlinear
Schr\"odinger equation, and for Hartree equations in dimension $n \geq 2$. The
proof relies on an analysis in Fourier space, related to the recent works of
Germain, Masmoudi and Shatah on space-time resonances. An interesting feature
of our approach is that we are able to identify the long range phase correction
term through a very natural stationary phase argument.
