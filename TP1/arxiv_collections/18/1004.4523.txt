An abrupt change in $\alpha$ decay systematics around the N=126 neutron shell
closure is discussed. It is explained as a sudden hindrance of the clustering
of the nucleons that eventually form the $\alpha$ particle. This is because the
clustering induced by the pairing mode acting upon the four nucleons is
inhibited if the configuration space does not allow a proper manifestation of
the pairing collectivity.
