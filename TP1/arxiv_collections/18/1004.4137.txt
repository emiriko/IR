Planet migration is the process by which a planet's orbital radius changes in
time. The main agent for causing gas giant planet migration is the
gravitational interaction of the young planet with the gaseous disk from which
it forms. We describe the migration rates resulting from these interactions
based on a simple model for disk properties. These migration rates are higher
than is reasonable for planet survival. We discuss some proposed models for
which the migration rates are lower. There are major uncertainties in migration
rates due to a lack of knowledge about the detailed physical properties of
disks. We also describe some additional forms of migration.
