The metallicity in galaxy clusters is expected to originate from the stars in
galaxies, with a population dominated by high mass stars likely being the most
important stellar component, especially in rich clusters. We examine the
relationship between the metallicity and the prominence of galaxies as measured
by the star to baryon ratio, M$_*$/M$_{bary}$. Counter to expectations, we rule
out a metallicity that is proportional to M$_*$/M$_{bary}$, where the best fit
has the gas phase metallicity decreasing with M$_*$/M$_{bary}$, or the
metallicity of the gas plus the stars being independent of M$_*$/M$_{bary}$.
This implies that the population of stars responsible for the metals is largely
proportional to the total baryonic mass of the cluster, not to the galaxy mass
within the cluster. If generally applicable, most of the heavy elements in the
universe were not produced within galaxies.
