The dendritic cell algorithm is an immune-inspired technique for processing
time-dependant data. Here we propose it as a possible solution for a robotic
classification problem. The dendritic cell algorithm is implemented on a real
robot and an investigation is performed into the effects of varying the
migration threshold median for the cell population. The algorithm performs well
on a classification task with very little tuning. Ways of extending the
implementation to allow it to be used as a classifier within the field of
robotic security are suggested.
