We study the coherent temperature and polarization patterns produced in
homogeneous but anisotropic cosmological models. We show results for all
Bianchi types with a Friedman-Robertson-Walker limit (i.e. Types I, V,
VII$_{0}$, VII$_{h}$ and IX) to illustrate the range of possible behaviour. We
discuss the role of spatial curvature, shear and rotation in the geodesic
equations for each model and establish some basic results concerning the
symmetries of the patterns produced. We also give examples of the
time-evolution of these patterns in terms of the Stokes parameters $I$, $Q$ and
$U$.
