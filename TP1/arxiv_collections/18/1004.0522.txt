We investigate a quantum parametric amplifier with dynamical pump mode,
viewed as a zero-dimensional model of Hawking radiation from an evaporating
black hole. The conditions are derived under which the spectrum of particles
generated from vacuum fluctuations deviates from the thermal spectrum predicted
for the conventional parametric amplifier. We find that significant deviations
arise when the pump mode (black hole) has emitted nearly half of its initial
energy into the signal (Hawking radiation) and idler (in-falling particle)
modes. As a model of black hole dynamics, this finding lends support to the
view that late-time Hawking radiation contains information about the quantum
state of the black hole and is entangled with the black hole's quantum
gravitational degrees of freedom.
