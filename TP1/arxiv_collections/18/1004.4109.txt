We present a new programming paradigm which can be useful, in particular, for
implementing window interfaces and parallel algorithms. This paradigm allows a
user to define operators which can contain nested operators. The new paradigm
is called operator-oriented. One of the goals of this paradigm is to escape the
complexity of objects definitions inherent in many object-oriented languages
and to move to transparent algorithms definitions.
