A conjectural recursive relation for the Poincar\'e polynomial of the Hitchin
moduli space is derived from wallcrossing in the refined local Donaldson-Thomas
theory of a curve. A doubly refined generalization of this theory is also
conjectured and shown to similarly determine the Hodge polynomial of the same
moduli space.
