We consider the so-called "eV seesaw" scenario, with right-handed Majorana
mass $M_R$ at eV order, extended to four lepton generations. The fourth
generation gives a heavy pseudo-Dirac neutral lepton, which largely decouples
from other generations and is relatively stable. The framework naturally gives
3 active and 3 sterile neutrinos. We update a previous numerical analysis of a
3+3 study of the LSND anomaly, taking into account the more recent results from
the MiniBooNE experiment. In particular, we study the implications for the
third mixing angle $\mathrm{sin}^2\theta_{13}$, as well as CP violation. We
find that current data do not seriously constrain more than one sterile
neutrinos.
