An initial state for the observable universe consisting of a finite region
with a large vacuum energy will break-up due to near horizon quantum critical
fluctuations. This will lead to a Friedmann-like early universe consisting of
an expanding cloud of dark energy stars and radiation. In this note we point
out that this scenario provides a simple explanation for the present day
density of dark matter as well as the level of CMB temperature flucuations. It
is also predicted that all dark matter will be clumped on mass scales ~ 10E3
solar masses.
