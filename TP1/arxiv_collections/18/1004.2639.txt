We prove that the Tutte polynomial of a coloopless paving matroid is convex
along the portions of the line segments x+y=p lying in the positive quadrant.
Every coloopless paving matroids is in the class of matroids which contain two
disjoint bases or whose ground set is the union of two bases of M*. For this
latter class we give a proof that T_M(a,a) <= max {T_M(2a,0), T_M(0,2a)} for a
>= 2. We conjecture that T_M(1,1) <= max {T_M(2,0), T_M(0,2)} for the same
class of matroids. We also prove this conjecture for some families of graphs
and matroids.
