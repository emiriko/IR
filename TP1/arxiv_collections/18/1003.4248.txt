A conjecture by Hod states that for the black hole horizon the spacing of its
area spectrum is determined by the asymptotic value of its quasinormal
frequencies. Recently to overcome some difficulties, Maggiore proposes some
changes to the original Hod's conjecture. Taking into account the modifications
proposed by Maggiore we calculate the area spectrum of the d-dimensional
Reissner-Nordstrom black hole in the small charge limit.
