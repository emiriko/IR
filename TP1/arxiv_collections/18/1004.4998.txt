Computational content encoded into constructive type theory proofs can be
used to make computing experiments over concrete data structures. In this
paper, we explore this possibility when working in Coq with chain complexes of
infinite type (that is to say, generated by infinite sets) as a part of the
formalization of a hierarchy of homological algebra structures.
