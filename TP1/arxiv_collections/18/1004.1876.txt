We give an expository review of applications of computational algebraic
statistics to design and analysis of fractional factorial experiments based on
our recent works. For the purpose of design, the techniques of Gr\"obner bases
and indicator functions allow us to treat fractional factorial designs without
distinction between regular designs and non-regular designs. For the purpose of
analysis of data from fractional factorial designs, the techniques of Markov
bases allow us to handle discrete observations. Thus the approach of
computational algebraic statistics greatly enlarges the scope of fractional
factorial designs.
