We revisit Schnorr's lattice-based integer factorization algorithm, now with
an effective point of view. We present effective versions of Theorem 2 of
Schnorr's "Factoring integers and computing discrete logarithms via diophantine
approximation" paper, as well as new elementary properties of the Prime Number
Lattice bases of Schnorr and Adleman.
