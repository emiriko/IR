The elliptical flow of fragments is studied for different systems at incident
energies between 50 and 1000 MeV/nucleon using the isospin-dependent quantum
molecular dynamics (IQMD) model. Our findings reveal that elliptical flow shows
a transition from positive (in-plane) to negative (out-of-plane) values in the
midrapidity region at a certain incident energy known as the transition energy.
This transition energy is found to depend on the model ingredients, size of the
fragments, and composite mass of the reacting system as well as on the impact
parameter of the reaction. A reasonable agreement is observed for the
excitation function of elliptical flow between the data and our calculations.
Interestingly, the transition energy is found to exhibit a power-law mass
dependence.
