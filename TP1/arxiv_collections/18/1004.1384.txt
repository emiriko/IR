In the recent years, MRI-driven turbulent transport has been found to depend
in a significant way on fluid viscosity $\nu$ and resistivity $\eta$ through
the magnetic Prandtl number $Pm=\nu/\eta$. In particular, the transport
decreases with decreasing $Pm$; if persistent at very large Reynolds numbers,
this trend may lead to question the role of MRI-turbulence in YSO disks, whose
Prandtl number is usually very small. In this context, the principle objective
of the present investigation is to characterize in a refined way the role of
dissipation. Another objective is to characterize the effect of linear (channel
modes) and quasi-linear (parasitic modes) physics in the behavior of the
transport. These objectives are addressed with the help of a number of
incompressible numerical simulations. The horizontal extent of the box size has
been increased in order to capture all relevant (fastest growing) linear and
secondary parasitic unstable modes. The major results are the following: i- The
increased accuracy in the computation of transport averages shows that the
dependence of transport on physical dissipation exhibits two different regimes:
for $Pm \lesssim 1$, the transport has a power-law dependence on the magnetic
Reynolds number rather than on the Prandtl number; for $Pm > 1$, the data are
consistent with a primary dependence on $Pm$ for large enough ($\sim 10^3$)
Reynolds numbers. ii- The transport-dissipation correlation is not clearly or
simply related to variations of the linear modes growth rates. iii- The
existence of the transport-dissipation correlation depends neither on the
number of linear modes captured in the simulations, nor on the effect of the
parasitic modes on the saturation of the linear modes growth. iv- The transport
is usually not dominated by axisymmetric (channel) modes
