We present an analytical inversion technique which can be used to recover
ionization probabilities from spatially averaged data in an N-dimensional
detection scheme. The solution is given as a power series in intensity. For
this reason, we call this technique a multiphoton expansion (MPE). The MPE
formalism was verified with an exactly solvable inversion problem in 2D, and
probabilities in the postsaturation region, where the intensity-selective
scanning approach breaks down, were recovered. In 3D, ionization probabilities
of Xe were successfully recovered with MPE from simulated (using the ADK
tunneling theory) ion yields. Finally, we tested our approach with
intensity-resolved benzene ion yields showing a resonant multiphoton ionization
process. By applying MPE to this data (which was artificially averaged) the
resonant structure was recovered-suggesting that the resonance in benzene may
have been observable in spatially averaged data taken elsewhere.
