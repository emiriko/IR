In this paper we investigate the entanglement of multi-qubit fermionic
coherent states described by anticommutative Grassmann numbers. Choosing an
appropriate weight function, we show that it is possible to construct some
entangled pure states, consisting of {\bf{GHZ}}, {\bf{W}}, Bell and biseparable
states, by tensor product of fermion coherent states. Moreover a comparison
with maximal entangled bosonic coherent states is presented and it is shown
that in some cases they have fermionic counterpart which are maximal entangled
after integration with suitable weight functions.
