In these lecture notes we present some connections between random matrices,
the asymmetric exclusion process, random tilings. These three apparently
unrelated objects have (sometimes) a similar mathematical structure, an
interlacing structure, and the correlation functions are given in terms of a
kernel. In the basic examples, the kernel is expressed in terms of orthogonal
polynomials.
