In this article we briefly review the current state of the experimental
research on spin polarized transport in organic semiconductors. These systems,
which include small molecular weight compounds and polymers, are central in the
rapidly maturing area of organic electronics. A great deal of effort has been
invested in the last eight years toward understanding spin injection and
transport in organics. These developments have opened up the possibility of
realizing a new family of organic spintronic devices which will blend the
chemical versatility of organic materials with spintronic functionalities.
