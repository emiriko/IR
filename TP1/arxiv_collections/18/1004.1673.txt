Specifying QoS properties can limit the selection of some good web services
that the user will have considered; this is because the algorithm used strictly
ensures that there is a match between QoS properties of the consumer with that
of the available services. This is to say that, a situation may arise that some
services might not have all that the user specifies but are rated high in those
they have. With some tradeoffs specified in form of weight, these services will
be made available to the user for consideration. This assertion is from the
fact that, the user's requirements for the specified QoS properties are of
varying degree i.e. he will always prefer one ahead of the other. This can be
captured in form of weight i.e. the one preferred most will have the highest
weight. If a consumer specifies light weight for those QoS properties that a
web service is deficient in and high weight for those it has, this will
minimize the difference between them. Hence the service can be returned.
