In Helio- and asteroseismology, it is important to have continuous,
uninterrupted, data sets. However, seismic observations usually contain gaps
and we need to take them into account. In particular, if the gaps are not
randomly distributed, they will produce a peak and a series of harmonics in the
periodogram that will destroy the stellar information. An interpolation of the
data can be good solution for this problem. In this paper we have studied an
interpolation method based on the so-called 'inpainting' algorithms. To check
the algorithm, we used both VIRGO and CoRoT satellite data to which we applied
a realistic artificial window of a real CoRoT observing run to introduce gaps.
Next we compared the results with the original, non-windowed data. Therefore,
we were able to optimize the algorithm by minimizing the difference between the
power spectrum density of the data with gaps and the complete time series. In
general, we find that the power spectrum of the inpainted time series is very
similar to the original, unperturbed one. Seismic inferences obtained after
interpolating the data are the same as in the original case.
