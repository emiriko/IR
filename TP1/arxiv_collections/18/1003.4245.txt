As early as 1972, Penrose - in a purely formal way - introduced a
"discontinuous coordinate transformation", which relates a continuous
representation of the metric of impulsive pp-waves to a discontinuous one. On
the basis of the invertibility concept for generalized functions developed
recently by the first author, we show that this discontinuous coordinate
transformation indeed represents an invertible generalized function in the
appropriate sense.
