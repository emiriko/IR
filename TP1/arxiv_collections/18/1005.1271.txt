We calculate a nonequilibrium steady state of a quantum XX chain in the
presence of dephasing and driving due to baths at chain ends. The obtained
state is exact in the limit of weak driving while the expressions for one- and
two-point correlations are exact for an arbitrary driving strength. In the
steady state the magnetization profile and the spin current display diffusive
behavior. Spin-spin correlation function on the other hand has long-range
correlations which though decay to zero in either the thermodynamical limit or
for equilibrium driving. At zero dephasing a nonequilibrium phase transition
occurs from a ballistic transport having short-range correlations to a
diffusive transport with long-range correlations.
