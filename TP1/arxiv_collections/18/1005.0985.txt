We present results of our 5-years-long program of ground-based spectroscopic
and photometric observations of individual Kepler asteroseismic targets and the
open clusters NGC6866 and NGC6811 from the Kepler field of view.We determined
the effective temperature, surface gravity, metallicity, the projected
rotational velocity and the radial velocity of 119 Kepler asteroseismic targets
for which we acquired high-resolution spectra. For many of these stars the
derived atmospheric parameters agree with Teff, log g, and [Fe/H] from the
Kepler Input Catalog (KIC) to within their error bars. Only for stars hotter
than 7000K we notice significant differences between the effective temperature
derived from spectroscopy and Teff given in the KIC. For 19 stars which we
observed photoelectrically, we measured the interstellar reddening and we found
it to be negligible. Finally, our discovery of the delta Sct and gamma Dor
pulsating stars in the open cluster NGC6866 allowed us to discuss the frequency
of the occurrence of gamma Dor stars in the open clusters of different age and
metallicity and show that there are no correlations between these parameters.
