We present in detail a method we recently introduced (PRL. 103, 176404
(2009)) to describe finite systems in and out of equilibrium, where the
evolution in time is performed via the Kadanoff-Baym Equations (KBE) within
Many-Body Perturbation Theory (MBPT). The main property we analyze is the
time-dependent density. We also study is the exchange-correlation potential of
TDDFT, obtained via reverse engineering from the time-dependent density. Our
systems consist of small, strongly correlated clusters, described by a Hubbard
Hamiltonian within the Hartree-Fock, second Born, GW and T-matrix
approximations. We compare the results from the KBE dynamics to those from
exact numerical solutions. The outcome of our comparisons is that, among the
many-body schemes considered, the T-matrix approximation is overall superior at
all electron densities. Such comparisons permit a general assessment of the
whole idea of applying MBPT, in the KBE sense, to finite systems. A striking
outcome of our analysis is that when the system evolves under a strong external
field, the KBE develop a steady-state solution as a consequence of a
correlation-induced damping. This damping is present both in isolated (finite)
systems, where it is purely artificial, as well as in clusters contacted to
(infinite) macroscopic leads. To illustrate this point we present selected
results for a system coupled to contacts within the T-matrix and second Born
approximation. The extensive characterization we performed indicates that this
behavior is present whenever approximate self energies, based upon infinite
partial summations, are used. A second important result is that, for isolated
clusters, the steady state reached is not unique but depends on how one
switches on the external field. This may also true for clusters connected to
leads.
