A new achievability scheme for the compound channel with discrete memoryless
(DM) state noncausally available at the encoder is established. Achievability
is proved using superposition coding, Marton coding, joint typicality encoding,
and indirect decoding. The scheme is shown to achieve strictly higher rate than
the straightforward extension of the Gelfand-Pinsker coding scheme for a single
DMC with DM state, and is optimal for some classes of channels.
