A number of studies showed association of mental status with heart rate
variability. This work discovered a feature of frequency structure of heart
rate variability that is associated with mental readiness. In three independent
groups of 64, 39, and 19 volunteers by the factor analysis of heart rate
periodograms, it has been discovered that there are at least two other heart
rate oscillation phenomena apart from the well known low frequency oscillations
and respiratory arrhythmia. They have periods of 3 and 4 heart beats.
Association of amplitude of 3-beats oscillation with level of mental readiness
was shown due to further observation in two independent groups of 12 and 7.
Moreover, possibility of assessment of mental readiness by the mathematical
model based on heart rate periodogram was suggested.
