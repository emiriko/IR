The role of superfluidity in the incompressibility and in the symmetry energy
is studied in nuclear matter and finite nuclei. Several pairing interactions
are used: surface, mixed and isovector dependent. Pairing has a small effect on
the nuclear matter incompressibility at saturation density, but the effects are
significant at lower densities. The pairing effect on the centroid energy of
the isoscalar Giant Monopole Resonance (GMR) is also evaluated for Pb and Sn
isotopes by using a microscopic constrained-HFB approach, and found to change
at most by 10% the nucleus incompressibility $K_A$. It is shown by using the
Local Density Approximation (LDA) that most of the pairing effect on the GMR
centroid come from the low-density nuclear surface.
