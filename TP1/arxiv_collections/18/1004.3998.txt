A generic prediction in the paradigm of weakly interacting dark matter is the
production of relativistic particles from dark matter pair-annihilation in
regions of high dark matter density. Ultra-relativistic electrons and positrons
produced in the center of the Galaxy by dark matter annihilation should produce
a diffuse synchrotron emission. While the spectral shape of the synchrotron
dark matter haze depends on the particle model (and secondarily on the galactic
magnetic fields), the morphology of the haze depends primarily on (1) the dark
matter density distribution, (2) the galactic magnetic field morphology, and
(3) the diffusion model for high-energy cosmic-ray leptons. Interestingly, an
unidentified excess of microwave radiation with characteristics similar to
those predicted by dark matter models has been claimed to exist near the
galactic center region in the data reported by the WMAP satellite, and dubbed
the "WMAP haze". In this study, we carry out a self-consistent treatment of the
variables enumerated above, enforcing constraints from the available data on
cosmic rays, radio surveys and diffuse gamma rays. We outline and make
predictions for the general morphology and spectral features of a "dark matter
haze" and we compare them to the WMAP haze data. We also characterize and study
the spectrum and spatial distribution of the inverse Compton emission resulting
from the same population of energetic electrons and positrons. We point out
that the spectrum and morphology of the radio emission at different frequencies
is a powerful diagnostics to test whether a galactic synchrotron haze indeed
originates from dark matter annihilation.
