The existence of Gribov copies is a central feature of the field
configuration space of confining gauge theories. In particular a transition
between two Gribov copies with relative winding number implies a space-time
configuration with topological charge. We explicitly demonstrate the
proliferation of Gribov copies with relative winding number, where our focus is
on localized (finite norm) configurations in Coulomb gauge. We then discuss the
likelihood that some pairs of such copies are connected by Minkowski space
solutions. We also comment on the relative importance of instantons and the
connection to confinement.
