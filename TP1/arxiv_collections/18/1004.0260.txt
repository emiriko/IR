Measurements of quantum oscillations in the cuprate superconductors afford a
new opportunity to assess the extent to which the electronic properties of
these materials yield to a description rooted in Fermi liquid theory. However,
such an analysis is hampered by the small number of oscillatory periods
observed. Here we employ a genetic algorithm to globally model the field,
angular, and temperature dependence of the quantum oscillations observed in the
resistivity of YBa2Cu3O6.59. This approach successfully fits an entire data set
to a Fermi surface comprised of two small, quasi-2-dimensional cylinders. A key
feature of the data is the first identification of the effect of Zeeman
splitting, which separates spin-up and spin-down contributions, indicating that
the quasiparticles in the cuprates behave as nearly free spins, constraining
the source of the Fermi surface reconstruction to something other than a
conventional spin density wave with moments parallel to the CuO2 planes.
