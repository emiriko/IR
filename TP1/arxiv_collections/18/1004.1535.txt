The plane-symmetric inhomogeneous cosmological models of perfect fluid
distribution with electro-magnetic field is obtained in the framework of Lyra's
geometry. To get the deterministic solution, I have considered $ A=f(x)\nu(t)
$, $ B=g(x)\mu(t) $ and $ C=h(x)\mu(t) $, where A, B and C are metric
coefficients. It has been found that the solutions generalize the solution
obtained by Pradhan, Yadav and Singh (2007) and are consistent with the recent
observations of type Ia supernovae. A detailed study of physical and
kinematical properties of the models have been carried out.
