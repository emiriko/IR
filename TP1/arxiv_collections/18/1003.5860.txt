Angular Distributions for the target spin-dependent observables A$_{0y}$,
A$_{xx}$, and A$_{yy}$ have been measured using polarized proton beams at
several energies between 2 and 6 MeV and a spin-exchange optical pumping
polarized $^3$He target. These measurements have been included in a global
phase-shift analysis following that of George and Knutson, who reported two
best-fit phase-shift solutions to the previous global p+$^3$He elastic
scattering database below 12 MeV. These new measurements, along with
measurements of cross-section and beam-analyzing power made over a similar
energy range by Fisher \textit{et al.}, allowed a single, unique solution to be
obtained. The new measurements and phase-shifts are compared with theoretical
calculations using realistic nucleon-nucleon potential models.
