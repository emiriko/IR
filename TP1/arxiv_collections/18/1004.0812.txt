Iron-chalcogenide single crystals with the nominal composition
FeSe$_{0.5}$Te$_{0.5}$ and a transition temperature of $T_{c}\simeq14.6$ K were
synthesized by the Bridgman method. The structural and anisotropic
superconducting properties of those crystals were investigated by means of
single crystal X-ray and neutron powder diffraction, SQUID and torque
magnetometry, and muon-spin rotation. Room temperature neutron powder
diffraction reveals that 95% of the crystal volume is of the same tetragonal
structure as PbO. The structure refinement yields a stoichiometry of
Fe_1.045Se_0.406Te_0.594. Additionally, a minor hexagonal Fe_7Se_8 impurity
phase was identified. The magnetic penetration depth \lambda at zero
temperature was found to be 491(8) nm in the ab-plane and 1320(14) nm along the
c-axis. The zero-temperature value of the superfluid density \rho_s(0)
\lambda^-2(0) obeys the empirical Uemura relation observed for various
unconventional superconductors, including cuprates and iron-pnictides. The
temperature dependences of both \lambda_ab and \lambda_c are well described by
a two-gap s+s-wave model with the zero-temperature gap values of
\Delta_S(0)=0.51(3) meV and \Delta_L(0)=2.61(9) meV for the small and the large
gap, respectively. The magnetic penetration depth anisotropy parameter
\gamma_\lambda(T)=\lambda_c(T)/\lambda_{ab}(T) increases with decreasing
temperature, in agreement with \gamma_\lambda(T) observed in the iron-pnictide
superconductors.
