We derive a regularized formula for the common randomness assisted
entanglement transmission capacity of finite arbitrarily varying quantum
channels (AVQC's). For finite AVQC's with positive capacity for classical
message transmission we show, by derandomization through classical forward
communication, that the random capacity for entanglement transmission equals
the deterministic capacity for entanglement transmission. This is a quantum
version of the famous Ahlswede dichotomy. In the infinite case, we derive a
similar result for certain classes of AVQC's. At last, we give two possible
definitions of symmetrizability of an AVQC.
