The spin density wave and its temperature dependence in oxypnictide are
studied in a three-band model. The spin susceptibilities with various
interactions are calculated in the random phase approximation(PPA). It is found
that the spin susceptibility peaks around the M point show a spin density
wave(SDW) with momentum (0, $\pi$) and a clear stripe-like spin configuration.
The intra-band Coulomb repulsion enhances remarkably the SDW but the Hund's
coupling weakens it. It is shown that a new resonance appears at higher
temperatures at the $\Gamma$ point indicating the formation of a paramagnetic
phase. There is a clear transition from the SDW phase to the paramagnetic
phase.
