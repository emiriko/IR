We develop a minimal model to calculate point-contact spectra between a
metallic tip and a superconducting heavy-fermion system. We apply our tunneling
model to the heavy fermion CeCoIn5, both in the normal and superconducting
state. In point-contact and scanning tunneling spectroscopy many heavy-fermion
materials, like CeCoIn5, exhibit an asymmetric differential conductance, dI/dV,
combined with a strongly suppressed Andreev reflection signal in the
superconducting state. We argue that both features may be explained in terms of
a multichannel tunneling model in the presence of localized states near the
interface. We find that it is not sufficient to tunnel into two itinerant bands
of light and heavy electrons to explain the Fano line shape of the differential
conductance. Localized states in the bulk or near the interface are an
essential component for quantum interference to occur when an electron tunnels
from the metallic tip of the point contact into the heavy-fermion system.
