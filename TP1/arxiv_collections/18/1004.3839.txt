We present our recently developed {\em galcon} approach to hydrodynamical
cosmological simulations of galaxy clusters - a subgrid model added to the {\em
Enzo} adaptive mesh refinement code - which is capable of tracking galaxies
within the cluster potential and following the feedback of their main baryonic
processes. Galcons are physically extended galactic constructs within which
baryonic processes are modeled analytically. By identifying galaxy halos and
initializing galcons at high redshift ($z \sim 3$, well before most clusters
virialize), we are able to follow the evolution of star formation, galactic
winds, and ram-pressure stripping of interstellar media, along with their
associated mass, metals and energy feedback into intracluster (IC) gas, which
are deposited through a well-resolved spherical interface layer. Our approach
is fully described and all results from initial simulations with the enhanced
{\em Enzo-Galcon} code are presented. With a galactic star formation rate
derived from the observed cosmic star formation density, our galcon simulation
better reproduces the observed properties of IC gas, including the density,
temperature, metallicity, and entropy profiles. By following the impact of a
large number of galaxies on IC gas we explicitly demonstrate the advantages of
this approach in producing a lower stellar fraction, a larger gas core radius,
an isothermal temperature profile in the central cluster region, and a flatter
metallicity gradient than in a standard simulation.
