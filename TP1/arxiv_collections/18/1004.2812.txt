We present a new semi-empirical model for calculating electron transport in
atomic-scale devices. The model is an extension of the Extended H\"uckel method
with a self-consistent Hartree potential. This potential models the effect of
an external bias and corresponding charge re-arrangements in the device. It is
also possible to include the effect of external gate potentials and continuum
dielectric regions in the device. The model is used to study the electron
transport through an organic molecule between gold surfaces, and it is
demonstrated that the results are in closer agreement with experiments than ab
initio approaches provide. In another example, we study the transition from
tunneling to thermionic emission in a transistor structure based on graphene
nanoribbons.
