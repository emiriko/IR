present a theoretical study of transport properties of a liquid comprised of
particles interacting via Gaussian Core pair potential. Shear viscosity and
self-diffusion coefficient are computed on the basis of the mode-coupling
theory, with required structural input obtained from integral equation theory.
Both self-diffusion coefficient and viscosity display anomalous density
dependence, with diffusivity increasing and viscosity decreasing with density
within a particular density range along several isotherms below a certain
temperature. Our theoretical results for both transport coefficients are in
good agreement with the simulation data.
