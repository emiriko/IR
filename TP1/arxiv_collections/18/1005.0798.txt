We consider the dynamics of a quantum directional reference frame undergoing
repeated interactions. We first describe how a precise sequence of measurement
outcomes affects the reference frame, looking at both the case that the
measurement record is averaged over and the case wherein it is retained. We
find, in particular, that there is interesting dynamics in the latter situation
which cannot be revealed by considering the averaged case. We then consider in
detail how a sequence of rotationally invariant unitary interactions affects
the reference frame, a situation which leads to quite different dynamics than
the case of repeated measurements. We then consider strategies for correcting
reference frame drift if we are given a set of particles with polarization
opposite to the direction of drift. In particular, we find that by implementing
a suitably chosen unitary interaction after every two measurements we can
eliminate the rotational drift of the reference frame.
