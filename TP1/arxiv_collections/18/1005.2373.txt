It is shown that every n-ary totally Hom-associative algebra with equal
twisting maps yields an n-ary Hom-Nambu algebra via an n-ary version of the
commutator bracket. The class of n-ary totally Hom-associative algebras is
shown to be closed under twisting by self-weak morphisms. Every multiplicative
n-ary totally Hom-associative algebra yields a sequence of multiplicative
totally Hom-associative algebras of exponentially higher arities. Under
suitable conditions, an n-ary totally Hom-associative algebra gives an
(n-k)-ary totally Hom-associative algebra.
