Probing techniques with spatial resolution have the potential to lead to a
better understanding of the microscopic physical processes and to novel routes
for manipulating nanostructures. We present scanning-gate images of a graphene
quantum dot which is coupled to source and drain via two constrictions. We
image and locate conductance resonances of the quantum dot in the
Coulomb-blockade regime as well as resonances of localized states in the
constrictions in real space.
