The famous F5 algorithm for computing Gr\"obner basis was presented by
Faug\`ere in 2002 without complete proofs for its correctness. The current
authors have simplified the original F5 algorithm into an F5 algorithm in
Buchberger's style (F5B algorithm), which is equivalent to original F5
algorithm and may deduce some F5-like versions. In this paper, the F5B
algorithm is briefly revisited and a new complete proof for the correctness of
F5B algorithm is proposed. This new proof is not limited to homogeneous systems
and does not depend on the strategy of selecting critical pairs (i.e. the
strategy deciding which critical pair is computed first) such that any strategy
could be utilized in F5B (F5) algorithm. From this new proof, we find that the
special reduction procedure (F5-reduction) is the key of F5 algorithm, so
maintaining this special reduction, various variation algorithms become
available. A natural variation of F5 algorithm, which transforms original F5
algorithm to a non-incremental algorithm, is presented and proved in this paper
as well. This natural variation has been implemented over the Boolean ring. The
two revised criteria in this natural variation are also able to reject almost
all unnecessary computations and few polynomials reduce to 0 in most examples.
