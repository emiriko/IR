We establish a connection between oriented matroid theory and loop quantum
gravity in (2+2) (two time and two space dimensions) and 8-dimensions. We start
by observing that supersymmetry implies that the structure constants of the
real numbers, complex numbers, quaternions and octonions can be identified with
the chirotope concept. This means, among other things, that normed divisions
algebras, which are only possible in 1,2, 4 or 8-dimensions, are linked to
oriented matroid theory. Therefore, we argue that the possibility for
developing loop quantum gravity in 8-dimensions must be taken as important
alternative. Moreover, we show that in 4-dimensions, loop quantum gravity
theories in the (1+3) or (0+4) signatures are not the only possibilities. In
fact, we show that loop quantum gravity associated with the (2+2)-signature may
also be an interesting physical structure.
