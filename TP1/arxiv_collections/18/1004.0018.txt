We define local Hardy spaces of differential forms $h^p_{\mathcal D}(\wedge
T^*M)$ for all $p\in[1,\infty]$ that are adapted to a class of first order
differential operators $\mathcal D$ on a complete Riemannian manifold $M$ with
at most exponential volume growth. In particular, if $D$ is the Hodge--Dirac
operator on $M$ and $\Delta=D^2$ is the Hodge--Laplacian, then the local
geometric Riesz transform ${D(\Delta+aI)^{-{1}/{2}}}$ has a bounded extension
to $h^p_D$ for all $p\in[1,\infty]$, provided that $a>0$ is large enough
compared to the exponential growth of $M$. A characterisation of $h^1_{\mathcal
D}$ in terms of local molecules is also obtained. These results can be viewed
as the localisation of those for the Hardy spaces of differential forms
$H^p_D(\wedge T^*M)$ introduced by Auscher, McIntosh and Russ.
