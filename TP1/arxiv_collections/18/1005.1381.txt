We formulate a mathematical model for daily activities of a cow (eating,
lying down, and standing) in terms of a piecewise affine dynamical system. We
analyze the properties of this bovine dynamical system representing the single
animal and develop an exact integrative form as a discrete-time mapping. We
then couple multiple cow "oscillators" together to study synchrony and
cooperation in cattle herds. We comment on the relevant biology and discuss
extensions of our model. With this abstract approach, we not only investigate
equations with interesting dynamics but also develop interesting biological
predictions. In particular, our model illustrates that it is possible for cows
to synchronize \emph{less} when the coupling is increased.
