We present a renormalization group (RG) approach to explain universal
features of extreme statistics, applied here to independent, identically
distributed variables. The outlines of the theory have been described in a
previous Letter, the main result being that finite-size shape corrections to
the limit distribution can be obtained from a linearization of the RG
transformation near a fixed point, leading to the computation of stable
perturbations as eigenfunctions. Here we show details of the RG theory which
exhibit remarkable similarities to the RG known in statistical physics. Besides
the fixed points explaining universality, and the least stable eigendirections
accounting for convergence rates and shape corrections, the similarities
include marginally stable perturbations which turn out to be generic for the
Fisher-Tippett-Gumbel class. Distribution functions containing unstable
perturbations are also considered. We find that, after a transitory divergence,
they return to the universal fixed line at the same or at a different point
depending on the type of perturbation.
