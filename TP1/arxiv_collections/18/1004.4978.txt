The classical model that describes the motion of an atom in a magnetic trap
is solved in order to investigate the relationship between the failure of the
usual adiabatic approximation assumption and the physical parameters of the
trap. This allows to evaluate the effect that reversing of the bias field
rotation produces on the vertical position of the atomic orbit, a displacement
that is closely related to the adiabatic character of the trap motion. The
present investigation has been motivated by a similar experimental test
previously carried out in the actual magnetic time orbiting potential trap. We
find that the non-adiabatic effects provided by the classical model are
extremely small. Thus, we conclude that the theoretical explanation of the
experimental measures, requires a quantum description of the dynamics in
magnetic traps.
