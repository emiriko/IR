We study the mesoscopic Kondo box, consisting of a quantum spin 1/2
interacting with a chaotic electronic bath as can be realized by a magnetic
impurity coupled to electrons on a quantum dot, using a mean-field approach for
the Kondo interaction. Its umerical efficiency allows us to analyze the Kondo
temperature, the local magnetic susceptibility, and the conductance statistics
for a large number of samples with energy levels obtained by random matrix
theory. We see pronounced parity effects in the average values and in the
probability distributions, depending on an even and odd electronic occupation
of the quantum dot, respectively. These parity effects are directly accessible
in experiments.
