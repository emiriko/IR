We present a new code, CASTRO, that solves the multicomponent compressible
hydrodynamic equations for astrophysical flows including self-gravity, nuclear
reactions and radiation. CASTRO uses an Eulerian grid and incorporates adaptive
mesh refinement (AMR). Our approach to AMR uses a nested hierarchy of
logically-rectangular grids with simultaneous refinement in both space and
time. The radiation component of CASTRO will be described in detail in the next
paper, Part II, of this series.
