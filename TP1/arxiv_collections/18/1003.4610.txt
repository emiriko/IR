Reeb graphs provide a method for studying the shape of a manifold by encoding
the evolution and arrangement of level sets of a simple Morse function defined
on the manifold. Since their introduction in computer graphics they have been
gaining popularity as an effective tool for shape analysis and matching. In
this context one question deserving attention is whether Reeb graphs are robust
against function perturbations. Focusing on 1-dimensional manifolds, we define
an editing distance between Reeb graphs of curves, in terms of the cost
necessary to transform one graph into another. Our main result is that changes
in Morse functions induce smaller changes in the editing distance between Reeb
graphs of curves, implying stability of Reeb graphs under function
perturbations.
