We relate the 10D IIB superstring (primarily free supergravity) expanded
about AdS_5\timesS^5 to 4D N=4 Yang-Mills directly in superspace. The sphere
becomes the CFT internal space of projective superspace, plus a coordinate
counting the number of supergluons. The 32 fermionic coordinates of AdS become
the 8 of the CFT in a spacecone gauge that manifestly preserves SO(3,1).SO(4).
The PSU(2,2|4) algebra of AdS becomes the projective representation (plus the
extra coordinate) on the boundary. (A review of projective superspace and the
projective lightcone limit is included for self-containment.)
