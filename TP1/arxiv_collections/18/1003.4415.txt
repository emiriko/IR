We investigate the physical consequences of orbital current patterns (OCP) in
doped two-leg Cu-O Hubbard ladders. The internal symmetry of the pattern, in
the case of the ladder structure, differs slightly from that suggested so far
for cuprates. We focus on this OCP and look for measurable signatures of its
existence. We compute the magnetic field produced by the OCP at each lattice
site, and estimate its value in view of a possible experimental detection.
Using a renormalization group (RG) analysis, we determine the changes that are
caused by the SU(2) spin-rotational symmetry breaking which occurs when the OCP
is present in the ground state phase diagram. The most signifcant one is an
in-plane SDW gap opening in an otherwise critical phase, at intermediate
dopings. We estimate the value of this gap, give an analytic expression for the
correlation functions and examine some of the magnetic properties of this new
phase which can be revealed in measurements. We compute the conductance in the
presence of a single impurity, using an RG analysis. A discussion of the
various sources of SU(2) symmetry breaking underscores the specificity of the
OCP induced effects.
