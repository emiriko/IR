We introduce the notion of energy solutions of the KPZ equation. Under
minimal assumptions, we prove that the density fluctuations of one-dimensional,
weakly asymmetric, conservative particle systems with respect to the stationary
states are given by energy solutions of the KPZ equation. As a consequence, we
prove that the Cole-Hofp solutions are also energy solutions of the KPZ
equation.
