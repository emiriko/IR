We describe a general construction of finiteness spaces which subsumes the
interpretations of all positive connectors of linear logic. We then show how to
apply this construction to prove the existence of least fixpoints for
particular functors in the category of finiteness spaces: these include the
functors involved in a relational interpretation of lazy recursive algebraic
datatypes along the lines of the coherence semantics of system T.
