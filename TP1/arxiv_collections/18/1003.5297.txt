A mathematical model for poro-visco-plastic compaction and pressure solution
in porous sediments has been formulated using the Voigt-type rheological
constitutive relation as derived from experimental data. The governing
equations reduce to a nonlinear hyperbolic heat conduction equation in the case
of slow deformation where permeability is relatively high and the pore fluid
pressure is nearly hydrostatic, while travelling wave exists in the opposite
limit where over-pressuring occurs and the pore fluid pressure is almost
quasi-lithostatic. Full numerical simulation using a finite element method
agree well with the approximate analytical solutions.
