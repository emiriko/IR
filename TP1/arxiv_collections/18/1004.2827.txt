We have studied the zero-temperature statistics of the charge transfer
between the two edges of Quantum Hall liquids of, in general, different filling
factors, $\nu_{0,1}=1/(2 m_{0,1}+1)$, with $m_0 \geq m_1\geq 0$, forming
Mach-Zehnder interferometer. General expression for the cumulant generating
function in the large-time limit is obtained for symmetric interferometer with
equal propagation times along the two edges between the contacts and constant
bias voltage. The low-voltage limit of the generating function can be
interpreted in terms of the regular Poisson process of electron tunneling,
while its leading large-voltage asymptotics is proven to coincide with the
solution of kinetic equation describing quasiparticle transitions between the
$m$ states of the interferometer with different effective flux through it,
where $m\equiv 1+m_{0}+m_{1}$. For $m>1$, this dynamics reflects both the
fractional charge $e/m$ and the fractional statistical angle $\pi /m$ of the
tunneling quasiparticles. Explicit expressions for the second (shot noise) and
third cumulants are obtained, and their voltage dependence is analyzed.
