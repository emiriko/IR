I conjecture that the nearsightedness of component electronic matter largely
determines the size of a virus. These two length scales, one from physics and
one from biochemistry, are in fact the same dimension which connects our
quantum and everyday worlds. Learning how viruses interact with microscopic
molecules and macroscopic biological cells might help us understand the
quantum-to-classical transition in general cases of multiscale phenomena.
