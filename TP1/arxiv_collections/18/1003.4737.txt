The Cosmic Ray Energetics And Mass (CREAM) calorimeter is designed to measure
the spectra of cosmic-ray particles over the energy range from ~10^11 eV to
~10^15 eV. Its first flight as part of the CREAM-I balloon-borne payload in
Antarctica during the 2004/05 season resulted in a recordbreaking 42 days of
exposure. Calorimeter calibration using various beam test data will be
discussed in an attempt to assess the uncertainties of the energy measurements.
