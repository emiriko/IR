The use of improved covariance matrix estimators as an alternative to the
sample estimator is considered an important approach for enhancing portfolio
optimization. Here we empirically compare the performance of 9 improved
covariance estimation procedures by using daily returns of 90 highly
capitalized US stocks for the period 1997-2007. We find that the usefulness of
covariance matrix estimators strongly depends on the ratio between estimation
period T and number of stocks N, on the presence or absence of short selling,
and on the performance metric considered. When short selling is allowed,
several estimation methods achieve a realized risk that is significantly
smaller than the one obtained with the sample covariance method. This is
particularly true when T/N is close to one. Moreover many estimators reduce the
fraction of negative portfolio weights, while little improvement is achieved in
the degree of diversification. On the contrary when short selling is not
allowed and T>N, the considered methods are unable to outperform the sample
covariance in terms of realized risk but can give much more diversified
portfolios than the one obtained with the sample covariance. When T<N the use
of the sample covariance matrix and of the pseudoinverse gives portfolios with
very poor performance.
