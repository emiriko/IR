We present a search for tau sneutrino production using the Tevatron ppbar
collision data collected with the CDF II detector and corresponding to an
integrated luminosity of 1 fb^-1. We focus on the scenarios predicted by the
R-parity violating (RPV) supersymmetric models in which tau sneutrinos decay to
two charged leptons of different flavor. With the data consistent with the
standard model expectations, we set the upper limits on sigma(ppbar -> tau
sneutrino)*BR(tau sneutrino ->emu,mutau,etau) and use these results to
constrain the RPV couplings as a function of tau sneutrino mass.
