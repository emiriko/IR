The electronic structure and optical response of electrically gated bilayer
graphene are studied by first-principles approaches. We have obtained the
induced band gap that is in good agreement with experiment when the applied
electric field is less than 1.5 V/nm. The infrared optical absorbance is
calculated within the single-particle excitation picture and its fine
structures are presented. In addition, the calculated infrared optical
absorbance is found to be strongly depending on stacking styles of bilayer
graphene and the polarization direction of the incident light, which provides
efficient ways to identify the electric-field intensity and stacking styles in
experiment. Finally, many-electron effects are discussed.
