The enormous progress in controlling quantum optical and atomic systems has
prompted ideas for new experimental realizations of strongly correlated
many-body systems operating with light. These systems consist of photons
confined in optical cavities, which interact strongly with atoms or atomiclike
structures. Due to the interaction between the two particle species optical
nonlinearities appear, leading to a quantum phase transition from Mott to
superfluid phase. Here, we address the Tavis-Cummings lattice model, which
describes light-matter systems containing multiple atomiclike structures in
each cavity. In particular, we investigate the phase boundary delimiting Mott
from superfluid phase and the elementary excitations of the two-dimensional
Tavis-Cummings lattice model in dependence of the number of atomiclike
structures per cavity. In order to obtain the results we employ the variational
cluster approach. We evaluate spectral functions and densities of states of
both particle species, which allows us to characterize the fundamental
excitations of light-matter systems. These excitations are termed polaritons
and are superpositions of photons and atomic excitations. We introduce
polariton quasiparticles as appropriate linear combinations of both particle
species and analyze the weights of their constituents. Our results demonstrate
the dependence of the quantum phase transition and the elementary excitations
on the number of atomiclike structures per cavity and provide thus valuable
insight into the physics of light-matter systems.
