We show that plane parabolic flow in a microfluidic channel causes nonmotile
helically-shaped bacteria to drift perpendicular to the shear plane. Net drift
results from the preferential alignment of helices with streamlines, with a
direction that depends on the chirality of the helix and the sign of the shear
rate. The drift is in good agreement with a model based on resistive force
theory, and separation is efficient (>80%) and fast (<2s). We estimate the
effect of Brownian rotational diffusion on chiral separation and show how this
method can be extended to separate chiral molecules.
