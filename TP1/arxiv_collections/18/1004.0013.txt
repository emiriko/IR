We propose a modified version of the TeV scale B-L extension of the standard
model, where neutrino masses are generated through the inverse seesaw
mechanism. We show that heavy neutrinos associated with this model can be
accessible via clean signals at the LHC. The search for the extra gauge boson
Z'_{B-L} through the decay into dileptons or two dileptons plus missing energy
is studied. We also show that the B-L extra Higgs can be directly probed at the
LHC via a clean dilepton and missing energy signal.
