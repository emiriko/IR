We study the dielectric function of the homogeneous hole gas in p-doped
zinc-blende III-V bulk semiconductors within random phase approximation with
the valence band being modeled by Luttinger's Hamiltonian in the spherical
approximation. In the static limit we find a beating of Friedel oscillations
between the two Fermi momenta for heavy and light holes, while at large
frequencies dramatic corrections to the plasmon dispersion occur.
