The resonant Raman scattering in N-IR - UV range from amorphous hydrogenated
carbon (a-C:H) reveal inclusions of trans-polyacetylene (trans-(CH)x) chains
with approximate length of up to 120 C=C units and inclusions of
poly(p-phenylene vinylene) (PPV) polymer chains. The PPV is evidenced by a
strong dispersive mode at ca. 1175 cm-1. It was found that the Raman response
from core Ag trans-(CH)x modes incorporated into a-C:H to changing excitation
energy is identical to of free-standing chains thus facilitating identification
of trans-(CH)x in complex carbonaceous materials spectra.
