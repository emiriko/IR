We study nanoelectromechanical resonators fabricated from suspended flakes of
NbSe$_2$ (thickness$\sim$30-50 nm) to probe charge density wave (CDW) physics
at nanoscale. Variation of elastic and electronic properties accompanying the
CDW phase transition (around 30 K) are investigated simultaneously using the
devices as self-sensing heterodyne mixers. Elastic modulus is observed to
change by 10 per cent, an amount significantly larger than what had been
reported earlier in the case of bulk crystals. We also study the modulation of
conductance by electric field effect, and examine its relation to the order
parameter and the CDW energy gap at the Fermi surface.
