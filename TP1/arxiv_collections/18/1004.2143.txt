We consider development of the models of the source of the Kerr-Newman (KN)
solution and new aspects related with the obtained recently field model based
on a domain wall bubble with superconducting interior, arXiv:1003.2928[hep-th].
The internal Higgs field regularizes the KN solution, expelling electromagnetic
field from interior to the boundary of bubble. The KN source forms a
gravitating soliton, interior of which is similar to oscillating solitons
(Q-balls, oscillons), while exterior is consistent with the KN solution. We
obtain that a closed Wilson loop appears on the edge of the bubble, resulting
in quantization of angular momentum of the regularized solutions. A new
holographic interpretation of the mysterious twosheetedness of the Kerr
geometry is given. The KN gravitating soliton with parameters of electron is
discussed.
