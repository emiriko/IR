Recent observations of the supernova remnant W44 by the \emph{Fermi}
spacecraft observatory strongly support the idea that the bulk of galactic
cosmic rays is accelerated in such remnants by a Fermi mechanism, also known as
diffusive shock acceleration. However, the W44 expands into weakly ionized
dense gas, and so a significant revision of the mechanism is required. In this
paper we provide the necessary modifications and demonstrate that strong
ion-neutral collisions in the remnant surrounding lead to the steepening of the
energy spectrum of accelerated particles by \emph{exactly one power}. The
spectral break is caused by Alfven wave evanescence leading to the fractional
particle losses. The gamma-ray spectrum generated in collisions of the
accelerated protons with the ambient gas is also calculated and successfully
fitted to the Fermi Observatory data. The parent proton spectrum is best
represented by a classical test particle power law E^-2, steepening to E^-3 at
E_br~7GeV due to deteriorated particle confinement.
