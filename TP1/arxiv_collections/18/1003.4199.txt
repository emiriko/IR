The confinement of electromagnetic field is studied in axial symmetrical,
warped, 6D World Brane, using a recently proposed topological abelian string
vortex solution as background. It was found, that the massless gauge field
fluctuations follow 4D Maxwell equations in the Lorenz gauge. The massless zero
mode is localized when the thickness of the string-vortex is less than 5%
$\beta/4\pi e^{2}$ there are not others localized massless modes. There is also
an infinite of non localized massive Fourier modes, that follow 4 dimensional
Proca equations with a continuous spectrum. To compute the corrections to the
Coulomb potential, a radial cutoff was introduced, in order to achieve a
discrete mass spectrum. As main result, a $\frac{1}{R^{2}}$ correction was
found for the 4D effective Coulomb law. Although, this correction is milder
than the $% \frac{1}{R^{3}}$ expected for flat 5+1 dimensional
electromagnetism, the result is in correspondence with the observed behavior of
the Coulomb potential at nowadays measurable distances.
