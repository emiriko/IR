The properties of the - presumably - youngest Galactic supernova remnant
(SNR) G1.9+0.3 are investigated within the framework of nonlinear kinetic
theory of cosmic ray acceleration in SNRs. The observed angular size and
expansion speed as well as the radio and X-ray emission measurements are used
to determine relevant physical parameters of this SNR. Under the assumption
that SNR G1.9+0.3 is the result of a Type Ia supernova near the Galactic center
(at the distance d=8.5 kpc) the nonthermal properties are calculated. In
particular, the expected TeV gamma-ray spectral energy density is predicted to
be as low as $\epsilon_{\gamma}F_{\gamma} \approx 5\times 10^{-15}$ erg
cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, strongly dependent ($F_{\gamma}\propto d^{-11}$) upon the
source distance d.
