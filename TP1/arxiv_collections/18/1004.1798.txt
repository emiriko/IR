We phenomenologically put local constraints on the rotation of distant masses
by using the planets of the solar system. First, we analytically compute the
orbital secular precessions induced on the motion of a test particle about a
massive primary by a Coriolis-like force, treated as a small perturbation of
first order in the rotation, in the case of a constant angular velocity vector
\Psi directed along a generic direction in space. The semimajor axis a and the
eccentricity e of the test particle do not secularly precess, contrary to the
inclination I, the longitude of the ascending node \Omega, the longitude of the
pericenter \varpi and the mean anomaly M. Then, we compare our prediction for
<\dot\varpi> with the corrections \Delta\dot\varpi to the usual perihelion
precessions of the inner planets recently estimated by fitting long data sets
with different versions of the EPM ephemerides. We obtain |\Psi_z| <=
0.0006-0.013 arcsec cty^-1, |\Psi_x| <= 0.1-2.7 arcsec cty-1, |\Psi_y| <=
0.3-2.3 arcsec cty^-1. Interpreted in terms of models of space-time involving
cosmic rotation, our results are able to yield constraints on cosmological
parameters like the cosmological constant \Lambda and the Hubble parameter H_0
not too far from their values determined with cosmological observations and, in
some cases, several orders of magnitude better than the constraints usually
obtained so far from space-time models not involving rotation. In the case of
the rotation of the solar system throughout the Galaxy, occurring clockwise
about the North Galactic Pole, our results for \Psi_z are in disagreement with
the expected value of it at more than 3-\sigma level.
