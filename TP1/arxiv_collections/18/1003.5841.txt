Light localization is controlled at a scale of lambda/10 in the harmonic
regime from the far field domain in a plasmonic nanoantenna. The nanoantenna
under study consists of 3 aligned spheres 50 nm in diameter separated by a
distance of 5 nm. By simply tuning the orientation of an incident plane wave,
symmetric and antisymmetric mode-balancing induces a strong enhancement of the
near field intensity in one cavity while nullifying the light intensity in the
other cavity. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the dipolar moment of a
plasmonic particle can be fully extinguished when strongly coupled with a dimer
of identical nanoparticles. Consequently, optical transparency can be achieved
in an ultra-compact symmetric metallic structure.
