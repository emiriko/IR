We consider electronic transport through a single-molecule junction where the
molecule has a degenerate spectrum. Unlike previous transport models, and
theories a rate-equations description is no longer possible, and the quantum
coherences between degenerate states have to be taken into account. We present
the derivation and application of a master equation that describes the system
in the weak-coupling limit and give an in-depth discussion of the parameter
regimes and the new phenomena due to coherent on-site dynamics.
