Theoretical calculations on transmission of quantum states such as
Schr\"{o}dinger cat (SC) states are considered in a periodically poled
nonlinear crystal (PPNC). Combinations of various initial states (SC, coherent
(C),and vacuum (V)) of light waves at frequencies $\omega_{e}$ and
$3\omega_{e}$ at the input of a PPNC are studied. It is shown that the
transmission and interference between superposition of macroscopically
distinguishable states can be achieved by using a PPNC. Visualization and
analyzes of transmission and interference processes are demonstrated with the
help of reduced Wigner quasi-probability distribution functions of considered
light waves.
