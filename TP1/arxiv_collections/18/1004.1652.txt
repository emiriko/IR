The Frenkel Kontorova (FK) model is known to exhibit the so called Aubry's
transition which is a jamming or frictional transition at zero temperature.
Recently we found similar transition at zero and finite temperatures in a
super-conducting Josephson junction array (JJA) on a square lattice under
external magnetic field. In the present paper we discuss how these problems are
related.
