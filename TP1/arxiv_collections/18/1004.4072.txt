Linearly polarized Galactic synchrotron emission provides valuable
information about the properties of the Galactic magnetic field and the
interstellar magneto-ionic medium, when Faraday rotation along the line of
sight is properly taken into account. We aim to survey the Galactic plane at 6
cm including linear polarization. At such a short wavelength Faraday rotation
effects are in general small and the Galactic magnetic field properties can be
probed to larger distances than at long wavelengths. The Urumqi 25-m telescope
is used for a sensitive 6 cm survey in total and polarized intensities. WMAP
K-band (22.8 GHz) polarization data are used to restore the absolute zero-level
of the Urumqi U and Q maps by extrapolation. Total intensity and polarization
maps are presented for a Galactic plane region of 129 degree < l < 230 degree
and |b| < 5 degree in the anti-centre with an angular resolution of 9'5 and an
average sensitivity of 0.6 mK and 0.4 mK Tb in total and polarized intensity,
respectively. We briefly discuss the properties of some extended Faraday
Screens detected in the 6 cm polarization maps. The Sino-German 6 cm
polarization survey provides new information about the properties of the
magnetic ISM. The survey also adds valuable information for discrete Galactic
objects and is in particular suited to detect extended Faraday Screens with
large rotation measures hosting strong regular magnetic fields.
