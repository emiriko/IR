The Condon domain phase diagram for beryllium is determined in magnetic
fields up to 10 T and at temperatures down to 1.3 K using a standard ac pick-up
coil method to measure the de Haas-van Alphen (dHvA) effect. The detection of
the transition point from the homogeneous state to the Condon domain state
(CDS) is based on the extremely non-linear response to the modulation field
resulting from a small irreversibility in the dHvA magnetization. The
experimental results are compared with theoretical predictions calculated from
the Fermi surface (FS) of beryllium. The width h_m of the hysteresis loop in
the CDS is measured in a wide temperature and field region. A model for the
hysteresis size is proposed and numerically calculated for the whole phase
diagram.
