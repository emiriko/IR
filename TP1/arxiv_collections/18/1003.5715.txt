IceCube is a 1 km^3 neutrino telescope currently under construction at the
South Pole. The detector will consist of 5160 optical sensors deployed at
depths between 1450 m and 2450 m in clear Antarctic ice distributed over 86
strings. An air shower array covering a surface area of 1 km2 above the in-ice
detector will measure cosmic ray air showers in the energy range from 300 TeV
to above 1 EeV. The detector is designed to detect neutrinos of all flavors:
electron-, muon-, and tau-neutrinos. With 59 strings in operation in 2009,
construction is 67% complete. Based on data taken to date, the observatory
meets its design goals. Selected results will be presented.
