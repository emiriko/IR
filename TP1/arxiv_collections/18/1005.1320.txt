A pseudo-random number generator (RNG) might be used to generate w-bit random
samples in d dimensions if the number of state bits is at least dw. Some RNGs
perform better than others and the concept of equidistribution has been
introduced in the literature in order to rank different RNGs. We define what it
means for a RNG to be (d,w)-equidistributed, and then argue that
(d,w)-equidistribution is not necessarily a desirable property.
