This paper presents a feature level fusion approach which uses the improved
K-medoids clustering algorithm and isomorphic graph for face and palmprint
biometrics. Partitioning around medoids (PAM) algorithm is used to partition
the set of n invariant feature points of the face and palmprint images into k
clusters. By partitioning the face and palmprint images with scale invariant
features SIFT points, a number of clusters is formed on both the images. Then
on each cluster, an isomorphic graph is drawn. In the next step, the most
probable pair of graphs is searched using iterative relaxation algorithm from
all possible isomorphic graphs for a pair of corresponding face and palmprint
images. Finally, graphs are fused by pairing the isomorphic graphs into
augmented groups in terms of addition of invariant SIFT points and in terms of
combining pair of keypoint descriptors by concatenation rule. Experimental
results obtained from the extensive evaluation show that the proposed feature
level fusion with the improved K-medoids partitioning algorithm increases the
performance of the system with utmost level of accuracy.
