We study the vortex phase diagram of the single-layer Bi2Sr2CuO6+d (Bi2201)
superconductor by means of bulk magnetization measurements on high-quality
oxygen-overdoped crystals. In striking contrast with the results found in the
moderately-doped two and three-layer Bi-based cuprates, Bi2201 exhibits a
strong temperature-dependent second-peak effect. By means of measurements of
the in and out-of-plane first-penetration field we provide direct evidence that
this phenomenon is mainly associated to an increase of the electromagnetic
anisotropy on warming. The effect of oxygen-doping d on the vortex phase
diagram results in both the irreversibility and second-peak lines shifting to
higher temperatures and fields. This enhanced stability of the Bragg glass
phase suggests that the interlayer coupling between Cu-O layers increases with
d. In addition, we found that the critical temperature follows the parabolic
relation with the number of holes per Cu-O plane that holds for most single and
two-layer cuprates.
