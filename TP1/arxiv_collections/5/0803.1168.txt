We use QCD sum rules to study the possible existence of a $D_s\bar{D}^*+
D_s^*\bar{D}$ molecule with the quantum number $J^P=1^+$. We consider the
contributions of condensates up to dimension eight and work at leading order in
$\alpha_s$. We obtain $m_{D_sD^*}=(3.96\pm0.10) \GeV$ around 100 MeV above the
mass of the meson X(3872). The proposed state is a natural generalized state to
the strangeness sector of the X(3872), which was also found to be consistent
with a multiquark state from a previous QCD sum rule analysis.
