For stationary axially symmetric spacetimes we find a simple expression for
the Lense-Thirring precession in terms of the Ernst potential. This expression
is used to compute, in the weak field approximation, the major non-spherical
contributions to the precession of a gyroscope orbiting the Earth. We reproduce
previously known results and give a new estimation for non-spherical
contributions.
