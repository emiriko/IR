Let $V$ and $W$ be finite dimensional real vector spaces and let
$G\subset\GL(V)$ and $H\subset\GL(W)$ be finite subgroups.
  Assume for simplicity that the actions contain no reflections. Let $Y$ and
$Z$ denote the real algebraic varieties corresponding to $\R[V]^G$ and
$\R[W]^H$, respectively. If $V$ and $W$ are quasi-isomorphic, i.e., if there is
a linear isomorphism $L\colon V\to W$ such that $L$ sends $G$-orbits to
$H$-orbits and $L\inv$ sends $H$-orbits to $G$-orbits, then $L$ induces an
isomorphism of $Y$ and $Z$. Conversely, suppose that $f\colon Y\to Z$ is a germ
of a diffeomorphism sending the origin of $Y$ to the origin of $Z$. Then we
show that $V$ and $W$ are quasi-isomorphic, This result is closely related to a
theorem of Strub \cite{Strub}, for which we give a new proof. We also give a
new proof of a result of \cite{KrieglLosikMichor03} on lifting of
biholomorphisms of quotient spaces.
