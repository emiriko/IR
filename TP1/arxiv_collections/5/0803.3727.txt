As we follow our Universe to early times, we find that matter was crushed to
high densities, somewhat similar to the behavior at a black hole singularity.
String theory has made progress in explaining the internal structure of black
holes, so we would like to extrapolate the ideas learnt from black holes to the
early Universe. If we assume that we want the most probable state of the
Universe at early times, then we should look at the kind of state that
describes a generic black hole. This suggests a definite equation of state for
the matter in the early Universe. Quantum effects can stretch across
macroscopic distances in black holes, and these might be important in
understanding the early Universe as well.
