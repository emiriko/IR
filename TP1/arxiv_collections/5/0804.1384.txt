Studies of angle-dependent magnetoresistance oscillations (AMRO) in the
interlayer conductivity of layered metals have generally considered
semi-classical electron transport. We consider a quantum correction to the
semi-classical conductivity that arises from what can be described as an
interlayer Cooperon. This depends on both the disorder potential within a layer
and the correlations of the disorder potential between layers. We compare our
results with existing experimental data on organic charge transfer salts that
are not explained within the standard semi-classical transport picture. In
particular, our results may be applicable to effects that have been seen when
the applied magnetic field is almost parallel to the conducting layers. We
predict the presence of a peak in the resistivity as the field direction
approaches the plane of the layers. The peak can occur even when there is
weakly incoherent transport between layers.
