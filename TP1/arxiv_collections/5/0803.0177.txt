We study spectral and far-field characteristics of lasing emission from
stadium-shaped semiconductor (InGaAsP) microlasers. We demonstrate that the
correspondence between a lasing far-field emission pattern and the result of a
ray simulation becomes better as the number of lasing modes increases. This
phenomenon is reproduced in the wave calculation of the cavity modes.
