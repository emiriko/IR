The electric mean squared radii <r^2>_E of Lambda(1405) are calculated in the
chiral unitary model. We describe the Lambda(1405) as a dynamically generated
resonance fully in the octet meson and octet baryon scattering. We also
consider ``Lambda(1405)'' as a bound state of KbarN. For the later
``Lambda(1405),'' we obtain negative and larger absolute value of electric mean
squared radius than that of ordinary baryons, which implies that Lambda(1405)
have structure of widely spread K^- around p.
