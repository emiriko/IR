This paper presents efficient algorithms for testing the finite, polynomial,
and exponential ambiguity of finite automata with $\epsilon$-transitions. It
gives an algorithm for testing the exponential ambiguity of an automaton $A$ in
time $O(|A|_E^2)$, and finite or polynomial ambiguity in time $O(|A|_E^3)$.
These complexities significantly improve over the previous best complexities
given for the same problem. Furthermore, the algorithms presented are simple
and are based on a general algorithm for the composition or intersection of
automata. We also give an algorithm to determine the degree of polynomial
ambiguity of a finite automaton $A$ that is polynomially ambiguous in time
$O(|A|_E^3)$. Finally, we present an application of our algorithms to an
approximate computation of the entropy of a probabilistic automaton.
