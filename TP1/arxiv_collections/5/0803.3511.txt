New physics in the form of scalar/pseudoscalar operators cannot lower the
semileptonic branching ratio B(B --> K mu+ mu-) below its standard model value.
In addition, we show that the upper bound on the leptonic branching ratio B(B_s
--> mu+ mu-) sets a strong constraint on the maximum value of B(B --> K mu+
mu-) in models with multiple Higgs doublets: with the current bound, B(B --> K
mu+ mu-) cannot exceed the standard model prediction by more than 2.5%. The
conclusions hold true even if the new physics couplings are complex. However
these constraints can be used to restrict new physics couplings only if the
theoretical and experimental errors in B(B --> K mu+ mu-) are reduced to a few
per cent. The constraints become relaxed in a general class of models with
scalar/pesudoscalar operators.
