Mathematical models of infectious diseases, which are in principle
analytically tractable, use two general approaches. The first approach,
generally known as compartmental modeling, addresses the time evolution of
disease propagation at the expense of simplifying the pattern of transmission.
The second approach uses network theory to incorporate detailed information
pertaining to the underlying contact structure among individuals while
disregarding the progression of time during outbreaks. So far, the only
alternative that enables the integration of both aspects of disease propagation
simultaneously while preserving the variety of outcomes has been to abandon the
analytical approach and rely on computer simulations. We offer a new analytical
framework, which incorporates both the complexity of contact network structure
and the time progression of disease spread. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
this framework is equally effective on finite- and "infinite"-size networks.
This formalism can be equally applied to similar percolation phenomena on
networks in other areas of science and technology.
