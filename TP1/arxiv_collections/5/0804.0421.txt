A scheme for backward retrieval in optical quantum memories in which
information is stored in collective states of an extended resonant atomic
ensemble is developed such that phase conjugation can be implemented by
application of an external nonuniform electric (magnetic) field without use of
coherent exciting pulses. The possibilities of realizing such a scheme using
resonant solid-state materials are discussed.
