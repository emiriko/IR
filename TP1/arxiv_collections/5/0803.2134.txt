The triple differential cross section (TDX) for the 12C(p,2p) proton knockout
reaction from the 1p3/2 single-particle state measured at 392 MeV is
investigated by nonrelativistic distorted wave impulse approximation (DWIA)
with accurate treatment of the kinematics of the colliding two protons and
effects of in-medium modification to the matrix elements of the proton-proton
(pp) effective interaction. Some simplifying approximations made in previous
studies with DWIA are examined. The off-the-energy-shell matrix elements of the
pp effective interaction are shown to play an essential role in describing the
asymmetric two peaks of the measured TDX corresponding to the kinematics in
which the momentum transfer is fixed.
