The near-threshold behavior of the ppbar invariant mass spectrum from the
J/psi -> omega ppbar decay reported recently by the BES Collaboration is
analyzed. Contrary to the statement made by the BES Collaboration itself our
study demonstrates that there is indeed a noticeable enhancement in the ppbar
invariant mass spectrum near threshold. Moreover, this enhancement is nicely
reproduced by the final state interaction in the relevant 11S0 ppbar partial
wave as given by the Julich nucleon--antinucleon model. Therefore, and again
contrary to the statement by the BES Collaboration, their new data on J/psi ->
omega ppbar decay in fact strongly support the FSI interpretation of the ppbar
enhancement, seen also in other decay reactions.
