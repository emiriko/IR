We calculate the stress tensor, or energy-momentum tensor, form factors of
the pion and of axial vector mesons in the chiral limit of a hard wall AdS/CFT
model of QCD. One (of the two) pion gravitational form factors is directly
related to the second moment of the pion generalized parton distribution, thus
providing a sum rule for the latter. As was also the case for vector mesons,
both the pion and the axial vector mesons appear strikingly more compact
measured by the gravitational form factor than by the electromagnetic form
factor.
