By analyzing the spacing of genes on chromosomes, we find that
transcriptional and RNA-processing regulatory sequences outside coding regions
leave footprints on the distribution of intergenic distances. Using analogies
between genes on chromosomes and one-dimensional gases, we constructed a
statistical null model. We have used this to estimate typical upstream and
downstream regulatory sequence sizes in various species. Deviations from this
model reveal bi-directional transcriptional regulatory regions in S. cerevisiae
and bi-directional terminators in E. coli.
