In this paper we present an efficient computational and symbolic algorithms
for solving a backward pentadiagonal linear systems. The implementation of the
algorithms using Computer Algebra Systems (CAS) such as MAPLE, MACSYMA,
MATHEMATICA, and MATLAB are straightforward. An examples are given in order to
illustrate the algorithms. The symbolic algorithm is competitive the other
methods for solving a backward pentadiagonal linear systems.
