We discuss the parity-violating left-right asymmetries (LRAs) in M\"{o}ller
scattering at the International Linear Collider (ILC) induced by doubly charged
Higgs bosons in models with $SU(2)_L$ triplet and singlet scalar bosons, which
couple to the left- and right-handed charged leptons, respectively. These
bosons are important in the scenarios for the generation of the neutrino mass.
We demonstrate that the contributions to the LRAs from the triplet and singlet
bosons are opposite to each other. In particular, we show that the doubly
charged Higgs boson from the singlet scalar can be tested at the ILC by using
the resonance effect.
