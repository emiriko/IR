Standard introductory modern physics textbooks do not exactly dwell on
superfluidity in 4He. Typically, Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) is mentioned
in the context of an ideal Bose gas, followed by the statement that BEC happens
in 4He and that the ground state of 4He exhibits many interesting properties
such as having zero viscosity. Not only does this approach not explain in any
way why 4He becomes a superfluid, it denies students the opportunity to learn
about the far reaching consequences of energy gaps as they develop in both
superfluids and superconductors. We revisit superfluid 4He by starting with
Feynman's explanation of superfluidity based on Bose statistics as opposed to
BEC, and we present exercises for the students that allow them to arrive at a
very accurate estimate of the superfluid transition temperature and of the
energy gap separating the ground state from the first excited state. This paper
represents a self-contained account of superfluidity, which can be covered in
one or two lessons in class.
