Human error research on overconfidence supports the benefits of early
visibility of defects and disciplined development. If risk to the enterprise is
to be reduced, individuals need to become aware of the reality of the quality
of their work. Several cycles of inspection and defect removal are inevitable.
Software Quality Management measurements of defect density and removal
efficiency are applicable. Research of actual spreadsheet error rates shows
data consistent with other software depending on the extent to which the work
product was reviewed before inspection. The paper argues that the payback for
an investment in early review time is justified by the saving in project delay
and expensive errors in use.
