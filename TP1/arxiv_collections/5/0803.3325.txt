For a newly discovered iron-based high $T_c$ superconductor
LaFeAsO$_{1-x}$F$_x$, we have constructed a minimal model, where inclusion of
all the five Fe $d$ bands is found to be necessary. Random-phase approximation
is applied to the model to investigate the origin of superconductivity. We
conclude that the multiple spin fluctuation modes arising from the nesting
across the disconnected Fermi surfaces realize an extended s-wave pairing,
while d-wave pairing can also be another candidate.
