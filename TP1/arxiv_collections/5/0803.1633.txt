A simple exactly solvable model is given of the dynamical coupling between a
person's classically described perceptions and that person's quantum
mechanically described brain. The model is based jointly upon von Neumann's
theory of measurement and the empirical findings of close connections between
conscious intentions and synchronous oscillations in well separated parts of
the brain. A quantum-Zeno-effect-based mechanism is described that allows
conscious intentions to influence brain activity in a functionally appropriate
way. The robustness of this mechanism in the face of environmental decoherence
effects is emphasized.
