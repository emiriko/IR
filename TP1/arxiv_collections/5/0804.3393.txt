We propose to search for gravitational waves from PKS 2155-304 as well as
other blazars. PKS 2155-304 emitted a long duration energetic flare in July
2006, with total isotropic equivalent energy released in TeV gamma rays of
approximately $10^{45}$ ergs. Any possible gravitational wave signals
associated with this outburst should be seen by gravitational wave detectors at
the same time as the electromagnetic signal. During this flare, the two LIGO
interferometers at Hanford and the GEO detector were in operation and
collecting data. For this search we will use the data from multiple
gravitational wave detectors. The method we use for this purpose is a coherent
network analysis algorithm and is called {\tt RIDGE}. To estimate the
sensitivity of the search, we perform numerical simulations. The sensitivity to
estimated gravitational wave energy at the source is about $2.5 \times 10^{55}$
ergs for a detection probability of 20%. For this search, an end-to-end
analysis pipeline has been developed, which takes into account the motion of
the source across the sky.
