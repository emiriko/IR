DAFNE, the Frascati F-factory, has recently completed experimental runs for
the three main detectors, KLOE, FINUDA and DEAR achieving 1.6x10E+32 cm-2s-1
peak and 10 pb-1 daily integrated luminosities. Improving these results by a
significant factor requires changing the collision scheme. For this reason, in
view of the SIDDHARTA detector installation, relevant modifications of the
machine have been realized, aimed at implementing a new collision scheme based
on a large Piwinski angle and crab-waist, together with several other hardware
modifications involving injection kickers, bellows and beam pipe sections.
