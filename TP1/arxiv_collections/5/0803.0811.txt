We propose a new method for reconstruction of sparse signals with and without
noisy perturbations, termed the subspace pursuit algorithm. The algorithm has
two important characteristics: low computational complexity, comparable to that
of orthogonal matching pursuit techniques when applied to very sparse signals,
and reconstruction accuracy of the same order as that of LP optimization
methods. The presented analysis shows that in the noiseless setting, the
proposed algorithm can exactly reconstruct arbitrary sparse signals provided
that the sensing matrix satisfies the restricted isometry property with a
constant parameter. In the noisy setting and in the case that the signal is not
exactly sparse, it can be shown that the mean squared error of the
reconstruction is upper bounded by constant multiples of the measurement and
signal perturbation energies.
