A recent proposal for mixed dynamics of classical and quantum ensembles is
shown, in contrast to other proposals, to satisfy the minimal algebraic
requirements proposed by Salcedo for any consistent formulation of such
dynamics. Generalised Ehrenfest relations for the expectation values of
classical and quantum observables are also obtained. It is further shown that
additional desirable requirements, related to separability, may be satisfied
under the assumption that only the configuration of the classical component is
directly accessible to measurement, eg, via a classical pointer. Although the
mixed dynamics is formulated in terms of ensembles on configuration space,
thermodynamic mixtures of such ensembles may be defined which are equivalent to
canonical phase space ensembles on the classical sector. Hence, the formulation
appears to be both consistent and physically complete.
