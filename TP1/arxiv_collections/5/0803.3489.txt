The SL(3,C)-representation variety R of a free group F arises naturally by
considering surface group representations for a surface with boundary. There is
a SL(3,C)-action on the coordinate ring of R. The geometric points of the
subring of invariants of this action is an affine variety X. The points of X
parametrize isomorphism classes of completely reducible representations. The
coordinate ring C[X] is a complex Poisson algebra with respect to a
presentation of F imposed by the surface. In previous work, we have worked out
the bracket on all generators when the surface is a three-holed sphere and when
the surface is a one-holed torus. In this paper, we show how the symplectic
leaves corresponding to these two different Poisson structures on X relate to
each other. In particular, they are symplectically dual at a generic point.
Moreover, the topological gluing map which turns the three-holed sphere into
the one-holed torus induces a rank preserving Poisson map on C[X].
