We present a calculation of the NLO QCD corrections for the production of
three vector bosons at the LHC, namely Z Z Z, W+ W- Z, W+ Z Z, and W+ W- W+
production. The virtual corrections are computed using the recently proposed
method of reduction at the integrand level (OPP reduction). Concerning the
contributions coming from real emission we used the dipole subtraction to treat
the soft and collinear divergences. We find that the QCD corrections for these
electroweak processes are in the range between 70 and 100 percent. As such they
have to be considered in experimental studies of triple vector boson production
at the LHC.
