I discuss the question whether it is possible that the LHC will find no
signal for the Higgs particle. It is argued that in this case singlet scalars
should be present that could move in extra, even fractional, dimensions. A
critical view at the existing electroweak data shows that this possibility
might be favored over the simplest standard model. In this case one needs the
ILC in order to study the Higgs sector.
