This paper proposes a radial dependent dispersive finite-difference
time-domain method for the modelling of electromagnetic cloaking structures.
The permittivity and permeability of the cloak are mapped to the Drude
dispersion model and taken into account in dispersive FDTD simulations.
Numerical simulations demonstrate that under ideal conditions, objects placed
inside the cloak are `invisible' to external electromagnetic fields. However
for the simplified cloak based on linear transformations, the back scattering
has a similar level to the case of a PEC cylinder without any cloak, rendering
the object still being `visible'. It is also demonstrated numerically that the
simplified cloak based on high-order transformations can indeed improve the
cloaking performance.
