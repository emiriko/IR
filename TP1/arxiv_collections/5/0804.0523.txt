An interaction-free measurement protocol is described for a quantum circuit
consisting of a superconducting qubit and a read-out Josephson junction. By
measuring the state of the qubit one can ascertain the presence of a current
pulse through the circuit at a previous time without any energy exchange
between the qubit and the pulse.
