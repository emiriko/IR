Instead of static entropy we assert that the Kolmogorov complexity of a
static structure such as a solid is the proper measure of disorder (or
chaoticity). A static structure in a surrounding perfectly-random universe acts
as an interfering entity which introduces local disruption in randomness. This
is modeled by a selection rule $R$ which selects a subsequence of the random
input sequence that hits the structure. Through the inequality that relates
stochasticity and chaoticity of random binary sequences we maintain that Lin's
notion of stability corresponds to the stability of the frequency of 1s in the
selected subsequence. This explains why more complex static structures are less
stable. Lin's third law is represented as the inevitable change that static
structure undergo towards conforming to the universe's perfect randomness.
