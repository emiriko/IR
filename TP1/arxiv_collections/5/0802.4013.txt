The fundamental laws and constants of our universe seem to be finely tuned
for life. The various multiverse hypotheses are popular explanations for the
fine tuning. This paper reviews the four main suggestions on inference in the
presence of possible multiple universes and observer selection effects. Basic
identities from probability theory and previously unnoticed conditional
dependencies of the propositions involved are used to decide among the
alternatives. In the case of cosmic fine-tuning, information about the
observation is not independent of the hypothesis. It follows that the
observation should be used as data when comparing hypotheses. Hence, approaches
that use the observation only as background information are incorrect. It is
also shown that in some cases the self-sampling assumption by Bostrom leads to
probabilities greater than one, leaving the approach inconsistent. The "some
universe" (SU) approach is found wanting. Several reasons are given on why the
"this universe" (TU) approach seems to be correct. Lastly, the converse
selection effect by White is clarified by showing formally that the converse
condition leads to SU and its absence to TU. The overall result is that,
because multiverse hypotheses do not predict the fine-tuning for this universe
any better than a single universe hypothesis, the multiverse hypotheses fail as
explanations for cosmic fine-tuning. Conversely, the fine-tuning data does not
support the multiverse hypotheses.
