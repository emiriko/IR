Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technologies are developing rapidly
with increasing study of the design, fabrication and commercialization of
microscale systems and devices. Accurate knowledge on the mechanical behaviors
of thin film materials used for MEMS is important for successful design and
development of MEMS. Here a novel electroplating spring-bridge micro-tensile
specimen integrates pin-pin align holes, misalignment compensate spring, load
sensor beam and freestanding thin film is demonstrated and fabricated. The
specimen is fit into a specially designed micro-mechanical apparatus to carry
out a series of monotonic tensile testing on sub-micron freestanding thin
films. Certain thin films applicable as structure or motion gears in MEMS were
tested including sputtered gold, copper and tantalum nitride thin films. Metal
specimens were fabricated by sputtering; for tantalum nitride film samples,
nitrogen gas was introduced into the chamber during sputtering tantalum films
on the silicon wafer. The sample fabrication method involves three steps of
lithography and two steps of electroplating copper to hold a dog bone
freestanding thin film. Using standard wet etching or lift off techniques, a
series of microtensile specimens were patterned in metal thin films, holes, and
seed layer for spring and frame structure on the underlying silicon oxide
coated silicon substrate. Two steps of electroplating processing to distinct
spring and frame portion of the test chip. Finally, chemical etched away the
silicon oxide to separated electroplated specimen and silicon substrate.
