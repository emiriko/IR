In this paper, we report some on-going focused research, but are further keen
to set it in the context of a proposed bigger picture, as follows. There is a
certain depressing pattern about the attitude of industry to spreadsheet error
research and a certain pattern about conferences highlighting these issues. Is
it not high time to move on from measuring spreadsheet errors to developing an
armoury of disciplines and controls? In short, we propose the need to
rigorously lay the foundations of a spreadsheet engineering discipline.
Clearly, multiple research teams would be required to tackle such a big task.
This suggests the need for both national and international collaborative
research, since any given group can only address a small segment of the whole.
There are already a small number of examples of such on-going international
collaborative research. Having established the need for a directed research
effort, the rest of the paper then attempts to act as an exemplar in
demonstrating and applying this focus. With regard to one such of research, in
a recent paper, Panko (2005) stated that: "...group development and testing
appear to be promising areas to pursue". Of particular interest to us are some
gaps in the published research record on techniques to reduce errors. We
further report on the topics: techniques for cross-checking, time constraints
effects, and some aspects of developer perception.
