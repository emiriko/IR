A new type of approximate scaling compatible with the Balitsky-Kovchegov
equation with running coupling is found, which is different from the previously
known running coupling geometric scaling. The corresponding asymptotic
traveling wave solution is derived. Although featuring different scaling
behaviors, the two solutions are complementary approximations of the same
universal solution, and they become equivalent in the high energy limit. The
new type of scaling is observed in the small-x DIS data.
