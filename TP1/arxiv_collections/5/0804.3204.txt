For the treatment of interacting electrons in crystal lattices approximations
based on the picture of effective sites, coupled in a self-consistent fashion,
have proven very useful. Particularly in the presence of strong local
correlations, a local approach to the problem, combining a powerful method for
the short ranged interactions with the lattice propagation part of the
dynamics, determines the quality of results to a large extent. For a
considerable time the non crossing approximation (NCA) in direct perturbation
theory, an approach originally developed by Keiter for the Anderson impurity
model, built a standard for the description of the local dynamics of
interacting electrons. In the last couple of years exact methods like the
numerical renormalization group (NRG) as pioneered by Wilson, have surpassed
this approximation as regarding the description of the low energy regime. We
present an improved approximation level of direct perturbation theory for
finite Coulomb repulsion U, the crossing approximation one (CA1) and discuss
its connections with other generalizations of NCA. CA1 incorporates all
processes up to fourth order in the hybridization strength V in a
self-consistent skeleton expansion, retaining the full energy dependence of the
vertex functions. We reconstruct the local approach to the lattice problem from
the point of view of cumulant perturbation theory in a very general way and
discuss the proper use of impurity solvers for this purpose. Their reliability
can be tested in applications to e.g. the Hubbard model and the
Anderson-lattice model. We point out shortcomings of existing impurity solvers
and improvements gained with CA1 in this context.
