We discus all possible spherically symmetric black hole type solutions to an
N=2 supergravity model with SO(3) gauging. The solutions consist of a one
parameter family illustrating that the no-hair theorem does not hold and an
isolated solution that a supersymmetric analogue of a coloured black hole.
