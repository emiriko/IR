The problem of hydrogen neutrals interacting with the heliospheric bow shock
region has received considerable attention recently, motivated primarily by the
hope that the Voyager spacecraft may soon encounter the first of the
heliospheric boundaries. The complexity of the charge exchange interactions has
limited our analytic understanding so far. In this work we develop a
semi-analytic one-dimensional model based upon a double expansion technique to
investigate the self-consistent interaction of shock with neutrals. The
underlying method uses the Boltzmann transport equation that describes neutral
transport, and is coupled to plasma protons predominantly through charge
exchange processes. The gyrotropic distribution function of the neutrals is
first expanded in terms of Legendre polynomials followed by associated Laguerre
harmonics. The resulting set of equations can be cast into a square matrix
whose eigenvalues depend upon sources and the plasma distribution. The
interstellar protons, in a high $\beta$ limit, are described by a hydrodynamic
fluid with source terms that couple neutrals and plasma and further modify both
distributions in a self-consistent manner.
