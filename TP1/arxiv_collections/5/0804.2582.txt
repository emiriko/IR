Here we report a new class of superconductors prepared by high pressure
synthesis in the quaternary family ReFeAsO1-delta (Re = Sm, Nd, Pr, Ce, La)
without fluorine doping. The onset superconducting critical temperature (Tc) in
these compounds increases with the reduction of Re atom size, and the highest
Tc obtained so far is 55 K in SmFeAsO1-delta. For the NdFeAsO1-delta system
with different oxygen concentration a dome-shaped phase diagram was found.
