We develop a self-consistent model of turbulence in a local interstellar
medium (ISM). The model describes a partially ionized magnetofluid ISM in which
a neutral hydrogen fluid interacts with a plasma dominantly through a charge
exchange. The ISM turbulent correlation scales in our model are much bigger
than the shock characteristic length-scales. Unlike small length-scale linear
collisional dissipation in the fluid, the charge exchange processes can be
effective unpredictably on a variety of ISM length-scales depending upon the
neutral and plasma densities, the charge exchange cross section and the
characteristic length scales. We find, from scaling arguments that the charge
exchange interactions modify spectral transfer associated with large-scale
energy containing eddies. Consequently, the ISM turbulent cascade are steeper
than those predicted by Kolmogorov's phenomenology.
