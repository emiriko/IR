It is proposed four dimensional curved space-time with de-Sitter group of
motion. Theory contain free dimension constants of length, impulse and action.
Under infinite values of these parameters theory pass to usual Minkowski
space-time with Poincare group of motion. In modified space gauge invariant
field theory is constructed.
