Energy dissipation in a nonequilibrium steady state is studied in driven
quantum Langevin systems. We study energy dissipation flow to thermal
environment, and obtain a general formula for the average rate of energy
dissipation using an autocorrelation function for the system variable. This
leads to a general expression of the equality that connects the violation of
the fluctuation-response relation to the rate of energy dissipation, the
classical version of which was first studied by Harada and Sasa. We also point
out that the expression depends on coupling form between system and reservoir.
