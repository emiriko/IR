We investigate the interaction of excitons in a two dimensional lattice and
photons in a planar cavity in the presence of disorder. The strong
exciton-photon coupling is described in terms of polariton quasi-particles,
which are scattered by a disorder potential. We consider three kinds of
disorder: (a) inhomogeneous exciton energy, (b) inhomogeneous exciton-photon
coupling and (c) deviations from an ideal lattice. These three types of
disorder are characteristic of different physical systems, and their separate
analysis gives insight on the competition between randomness and light-matter
coupling. We consider conventional planar polariton structures (with excitons
resonant to photon modes emitting normal to the cavity) and Bragg polariton
structures, in which excitons in a lattice are resonant with photon modes at a
finite angle satisfying the Bragg condition. We calculate the absorption
spectra in the normal direction and at the Bragg angle by a direct
diagonalization of the exciton-photon Hamiltonian. We found that in some cases
weak disorder increases the light-matter coupling and leads to a larger
polariton splitting. Moreover, we found that the coupling of excitons and
photons is less sensitive to disorder of type (b) and (c). This suggests that
polaritonic structures realized with impurities in a semiconductor or with
atoms in optical lattices are good candidate for the observation of some of the
Bragg polariton features.
