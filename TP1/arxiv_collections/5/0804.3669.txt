We analyzed the energy and momentum distributions of laser-induced
high-energy photoelectrons of alkali and rare gas atoms. For the plateau
electrons with energies above $4U_p$, ($U_p$ is the ponderomotive energy), in
the tunneling ionization regime, we showed that they originate from the
backscattering of laser-induced returning electrons. Using the differential
elastic scattering cross sections between the target ion with \emph{free}
electrons, we explain experimental observations of whether the plateau electron
spectra is flat or steeply descending, and their dependence on species and
laser intensity. This quantitative rescattering theory can be used to obtain
energy and momentum distributions of plateau electrons without the need of
solving the time-dependent Schr\"{o}dinger equation, but with similar accuracy.
