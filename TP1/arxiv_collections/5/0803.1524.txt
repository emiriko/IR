Entanglement and Berry phase are investigated in two interacting qubit
systems. The XXZ spin interaction model with a slowly rotating magnetic field
is employed for the interaction between the two qubits. We show how the
anisotropy of interaction reveals unique relations between the Berry phases and
the entanglements for the eigenstates of the system.
