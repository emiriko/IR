Let $L$ and $H$ be finite-dimensional restricted Lie algebras over a perfect
field $\F$ such that $u(L)\cong u(H)$, where $u(L)$ is the restricted
enveloping algebra of $L$. We prove that if $L$ is $p$-nilpotent and abelian,
then $L\cong H$. We deduce that if $L$ is abelian and $\F$ is algebraically
closed, then $L\cong H$. We use these results to prove the main result of this
paper stating that if $L$ is $p$-nilpotent, then $L/L'^p+\gamma_3(L)\cong
H/H'^p+\gamma_3(H)$.
