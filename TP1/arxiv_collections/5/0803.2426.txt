We investigate coupled identical phase oscillators with scale-free
distribution of coupling strength. It is shown that partially locked states can
occur due to the inhomogeneity in coupling and some properties of the coupling
function. Various quantities of the partially locked states are computed
through a self-consistency argument and the values show good agreement with
simulation results.
