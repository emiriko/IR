We have previously proposed a light pseudoscalar Higgs boson in the
next-to-minimal supersymmetric standard model (NMSSM), the A_1^0, as a
candidate to explain the HyperCP observations in Sigma^+ -> p mu^+ mu^-. In
this paper we calculate the rates for several other rare decay modes that can
help confirm or refute this hypothesis. The first modes we evaluate are K_L ->
pi pi A_1^0, which are interesting because they are under study by the KTeV
Collaboration. We next turn to eta -> pi pi A_1^0, which are interesting
because they are independent of the details of the flavor-changing sector of
the NMSSM and may be accessible at DAPhNE. For completeness, we also evaluate
Omega^- -> Xi^- A_1^0.
