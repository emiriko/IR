The aim of the present paper is twofold. We study directed porosity in
connection with conformal iterated function systems (CIFS) and with singular
integrals. We prove that limit sets of finite CIFS are porous in a stronger
sense than already known. Furthermore we use directed porosity to establish
that truncated singular integral operators, with respect to general Radon
measures $\mu$ and kernels $K$, converge weakly in some dense subspaces of
$L^2(\mu)$ when the support of $\mu$ belongs to a broad family of sets. This
class contains many fractal sets like CIFS's limit sets.
