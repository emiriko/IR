We discuss a method for calculating the Chern-Schwartz-MacPherson (CSM) class
of a Schubert variety in the Grassmannian using small resolutions introduced by
Zelevinsky. As a consequence, we show how to compute the Chern-Mather class and
local Euler obstructions using small resolutions instead of the Nash blowup.
The algorithm obtained for CSM classes also allows us to prove new cases of a
positivity conjecture of Aluffi and Mihalcea.
