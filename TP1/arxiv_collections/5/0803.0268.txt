We consider the model of a false vacuum bubble with a thin wall where the
surface energy density is composed of two different components, "domain-wall"
type and "dust" type, with opposite signs. We find stably oscillating
solutions, which we call "breathing bubbles". By decay to a lower mass state,
such a breathing bubble could become either i) a child universe or ii) a bubble
that "eats up" the original universe, depending on the sign of the surface
energy of the "domain-wall" component. We also discuss the effect of the
finite-thickness corrections to the thin-wall approximation and possible
origins of the energy contents of our model.
