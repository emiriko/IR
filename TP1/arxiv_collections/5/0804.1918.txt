We study effects of the running of the coupling in QCD at small Bjorken-x and
in particular the ones related to gluon saturation. After introducing the steps
taken to the derivation of the next to leading order nonlinear evolution
equation, we discuss the infrared sensitivity of the Pomeron intercept, the
energy dependence of the saturation momentum and the appearance of geometrical
scaling, and the dominance of the running coupling effects over the ones
introduced by loops of Pomerons.
