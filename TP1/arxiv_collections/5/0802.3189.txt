We prove an $L^2$ extension theorem of Ohsawa-Takegoshi type for extending
holomorphic sections of line bundles from a subvariety which is given as a
maximal log-canonical center of a pair and is of general codimension in a
projective variety. Our method of proof indicates that such a setting is the
most natural one in a sense, for general $L^2$ extension of line bundle
sections.
