Evolutionary Computation is a branch of computer science with which,
traditionally, High Energy Physics has fewer connections. Its methods were
investigated in this field, mainly for data analysis tasks. These methods and
studies are, however, less known in the high energy physics community and this
motivated us to prepare this lecture. The lecture presents a general overview
of the main types of algorithms based on Evolutionary Computation, as well as a
review of their applications in High Energy Physics.
