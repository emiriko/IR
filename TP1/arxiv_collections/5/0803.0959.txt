We present experimental evidence for a long-range protein-protein interaction
in purple membrane (PM). The interprotein dynamics were quantified by measuring
the spectrum of the acoustic phonons in the 2D bacteriorhodopsin (BR) protein
lattice using inelastic neutron scattering. Phonon energies of about 1 meV were
determined. The data are compared to an analytical model, and the effective
spring constant for the interaction between neighboring protein trimers are
determined to be k=53 N/m. Additional, optical-like excitations at 0.45 meV
were found and assigned to intraprotein dynamics between neighboring BR
monomers.
