We have selected and spatially separated the two conformers of 3-aminophenol
(C$_6$H$_7$NO) present in a molecular beam. Analogous to the separation of ions
based on their mass-to-charge ratios in a quadrupole mass filter, the neutral
conformers are separated based on their different mass-to-dipole-moment ratios
in an ac electric quadrupole selector. For a given ac frequency, the individual
conformers experience different focusing forces, resulting in different
transmissions through the selector. These experiments demonstrate that
conformer-selected samples of large molecules can be prepared, offering new
possibilities for the study of gas-phase biomolecules.
