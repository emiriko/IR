Low-temperature scanning tunneling spectroscopy reveals that the Kondo
temperature T_K of Co atoms adsorbed on Cu/Co/Cu(100) multilayers varies
between 60 K and 134 K as the Cu film thickness decreases from 20 to 5 atomic
layers. The observed change of T_K is attributed to a variation of the density
of states at the Fermi level \rho_F induced by quantum well states confined to
the Cu film. A model calculation based on the quantum oscillations of \rho_F at
the belly and the neck of the Cu Fermi surface reproduces most of the features
in the measured variation of T_K.
