Within the minimal supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model, the mass
of the light CP-even Higgs boson is computed to three-loop accuracy, taking
into account the next-to-next-to-leading order effects from supersymmetric
Quantum Chromodynamics. We consider two different scenarios for the mass
hierarchies of the supersymmetric spectrum. Our numerical results amount to
corrections of about 500 MeV which is of the same order as the experimental
accuracy expected at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC).
