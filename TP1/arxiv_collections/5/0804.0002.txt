Superconductivity above 25K, and possibly above 40K, has recently been
discovered in $LaO_{1-x}F_xFeAs$ and related compounds. We propose that this is
another example of the mechanism of hole superconductivity at play. This
requires the existence of hole carriers at the Fermi energy, which appears to
contradict current observations. We propose that two-band conduction is taking
place in these materials, that the negative ion $As^{-3}$ plays a key role, and
that superconductivity is non-phononic and driven by pairing and undressing of
heavily dressed hole carriers to lower their kinetic energy. We make several
predictions of future observations based on our theory.
