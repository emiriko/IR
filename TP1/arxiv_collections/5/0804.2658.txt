We apply a semi-classical method to the problem of field angle-dependent
oscillations of the density of states and thermal conductivity for nodal
superconductors and apply our results to the superconductor PrOs$_4$Sb$_{12}$.
The oscillatory contributions to the thermal conductivity for all possible
point node configurations for a superconductor with $T_h$ symmetry are
calculated. It is found that experimental results are best accounted for by
nodes in the off-axis directions $[\pm \sin\phi_0, 0, \pm\cos\phi_0]$, which
are associated with the time-reversal breaking, triplet paired phase $D_2(E)$.
