Switching voltage of first-order metal-insulator transition (MIT) in VO_2, an
inhomogeneous strongly correlated system, is changed by irradiating an infrared
light with wavelength, 1.5 micrometer, and applying the electric field
(photo-induced switching). This was predicted in the hole-driven MIT theory in
which hole doping of a low concentration below 0.01% into conduction band
(Fermi surface) induces the abrupt MIT as correlation effect. The switching is
explained by the Mott transition not the Peierls transition.
