The linear 1-alcohols n-C16H33OH, n-C17H35OH, n-C19H37OH have been imbibed
and solidified in lined up, tubular mesopores of silicon with 10 nm and 15 nm
mean diameters, respectively. X-ray diffraction measurements reveal a set of
six discrete orientation states (''domains'') characterized by a perpendicular
alignment of the molecules with respect to the long axis of the pores and by a
four-fold symmetry about this direction, which coincides with the crystalline
symmetry of the Si host. A Bragg peak series characteristic of the formation of
bilayers indicates a lamellar structure of the spatially confined alcohol
crystals in 15 nm pores. By contrast, no layering reflections could be detected
for 10 nm pores. The growth mechanism responsible for the peculiar orientation
states is attributed to a nano-scale version of the Bridgman technique of
single-crystal growth, where the dominant growth direction is aligned
parallelly to the long pore axes. Our observations are analogous to the growth
phenomenology encountered for medium length n-alkanes confined in mesoporous
silicon (Phys. Rev. E 75, 021607 (2007)) and may further elucidate why porous
silicon matrices act as an effective nucleation-inducing material for protein
solution crystallization.
