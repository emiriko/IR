Hirsch (1999) proposed a mechanism and geometry for the observation of the
spin-Hall effect. In this work, we present a novel realization of the Hirsch
geometry in a platinum (Pt) nanostructure, which is an increasingly important
material for spintronics applications. Measurements were made in a non-local
geometry to avoid spurious effects. The measurements show the large spin Hall
conductivity of Pt. The results are compared with gold (Au) and aluminum (Al).
Possible theoretical explanations of our observations are briefly mentioned.
