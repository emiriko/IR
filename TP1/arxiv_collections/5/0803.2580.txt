We derive critical noise levels for Gallager codes on asymmetric channels as
a function of the input bias and the temperature. Using a statistical mechanics
approach we study the space of codewords and the entropy in the various
decoding regimes. We further discuss the relation of the convergence of the
message passing algorithm with the endogeny property and complexity,
characterizing solutions of recursive equations of distributions for cavity
fields.
