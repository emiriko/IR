Generalizing a recent work [T. Taniguchi and E. G. D. Cohen, J. Stat. Phys.
126, 1 (2006)] that was based on the Onsager-Machlup theory, a nonlinear
relaxation process is considered for a macroscopic thermodynamic quantity. It
is found that the fluctuation theorem holds in the nonlinear nonequilibrium
regime if the change of the entropy characterized by local equilibria is
appropriately renormalized. The fluctuation theorem for the ordinary entropy
change is recovered in the linear near-equilibrium case. This result suggests a
possibility that the the information-theoretic entropy of the Shannon form may
be modified in the strongly nonlinear nonequilibrium regime.
