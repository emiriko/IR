This paper addresses the question of which models fit with information
concerning the preferences of the decision maker over each attribute, and his
preferences about aggregation of criteria (interacting criteria). We show that
the conditions induced by these information plus some intuitive conditions lead
to a unique possible aggregation operator: the Choquet integral.
