We have calculated the finite-frequency current noise of a
superconductor-ferromagnet quantum point contact (SF QPC). This signal is
qualitatively affected by the spin-dependence of interfacial phase shifts
(SDIPS) acquired by electrons upon reflection on the QPC. For a weakly
transparent QPC, noise steps appear at frequencies or voltages determined
directly by the SDIPS. These steps can occur at experimentally accessible
temperatures and frequencies. Finite frequency noise is thus a promising tool
to characterize the scattering properties of a SF QPC.
