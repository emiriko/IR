We propose the superfluid to Mott-insulator quantum phase transition in an
array of exciton-polariton traps can be utilized for massive parallel
generation of indistinguishable single photons. By means of analytical and
numerical methods, the device operations and system properties are studied
using realistic experimental parameters. Such a deterministic, fault-tolerant,
massive parallel generation may open up a new perspective in photonic quantum
information processing.
