We develop an incremental tableau-based decision procedures for the
  Alternating-time temporal logic ATL and some of its variants.
  While running within the theoretically established complexity upper bound, we
claim that our tableau is practically more efficient in the average case than
other decision procedures for ATL known so far. Besides, the ease of its
adaptation to variants of ATL demonstrates the flexibility of the proposed
procedure.
