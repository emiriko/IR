In this lecture, the early history of asymptotic freedom is discussed. The
first completely correct derivation of \beta_0 in non-abelian gauge theory
(Khriplovich, 1969) was done in the Coulomb gauge; this derivation is
reproduced (in modernized terms) in Sect. 2. A qualitative physical explanation
of asymptotic freedom via chromomagnetic properties of vacuum (Nielsen, 1981)
is discussed in Sect. 3.
