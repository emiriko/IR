We study a model of strongly correlated electrons on the square lattice which
exhibits charge frustration and quantum critical behavior. The potential is
tuned to make the interactions supersymmetric. We establish a rigorous
mathematical result which relates quantum ground states to certain tiling
configurations on the square lattice. For periodic boundary conditions this
relation implies that the number of ground states grows exponentially with the
linear dimensions of the system. We present substantial analytic and numerical
evidence that for open boundary conditions the system has gapless edge modes.
