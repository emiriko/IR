We study quantum adiabatic dynamics, where the slowly moving field is
influenced by system's state (feedback). The information for the feedback is
gained from non-disturbating measurements done on an ensemble of identical
non-interacting systems. The situation without feedback is governed by the
adiabatic theorem: adiabatic energy level populations stay constant, while the
adiabatic eigenvectors get a specific phase contribution (Berry phase).
However, under feedback the adiabatic theorem does not hold: the adiabatic
populations satisfy a closed equation of motion that coincides with the
replicator dynamics well-known by its applications in evolutionary game theory.
The feedback generates a new gauge-invariant adiabatic phase, which is free of
the constraints on the Berry phase (e.g., the new phase is non-zero even for
real adiabatic eigenfunctions).
