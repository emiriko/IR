Heisenberg's uncertainty principle and recently derived many no-go theorems
including the no-cloning theorem and the no-deleting theorem have corroborated
the idea that we can never access quantum information without causing
disturbance. Here we disprove this presumption by predicting a novel
phenomenon, `quantum catalysis of information,' where a system enables an
otherwise impossible task by exchanging information through a quantum
communication channel. This fact implies that making use of quantum information
does not always cause disturbance.
