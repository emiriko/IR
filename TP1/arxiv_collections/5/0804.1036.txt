The upcoming European design study `Einstein gravitational-wave Telescope'
represents the first step towards a substantial, international effort for the
design of a third-generation interferometric gravitational wave detector. It is
generally believed that third-generation instruments might not be installed
into existing infrastructures but will provoke a new search for optimal
detector sites. Consequently, the detector design could be subject to fewer
constraints than the on-going design of the second generation instruments. In
particular, it will be prudent to investigate alternatives to the traditional
L-shaped Michelson interferometer. In this article, we review an old proposal
to use three Michelson interferometers in a triangular configuration. We use
this example of a triple Michelson interferometer to clarify the terminology
and will put this idea into the context of more recent research on
interferometer technologies. Furthermore the benefits of a triangular detector
will be used to motivate this design as a good starting point for a more
detailed research effort towards a third-generation gravitational wave
detector.
