It has been shown that different Abelian and non-Abelian fraction quantum
Hall states can be characterized by patterns of zeros described by sequences of
integers {S_a}. In this paper, we will show how to use the data {S_a} to
calculate various topological properties of the corresponding fraction quantum
Hall state, such as the number of possible quasiparticle types and their
quantum numbers, as well as the actions of the quasiparticle tunneling and
modular transformations on the degenerate ground states on torus.
