This document contains a proposal of the BEPC-II collider beam energy
calibration system (IHEP, Beijing). The system is based on Compton
backscattering of carbon dioxide laser radiation, producing a beam of high
energy photons. Their energy spectrum is then accurately measured by HPGe
detector. The high-energy spectrum edge will allow to determine the average
electron or positron beam energy with relative accuracy about 3x10^-5.
