Metallic nanoclusters displaying electronic shell structure exhibit the
special feature of a correlation between their geometry and the number of
delocalized electrons . Their shape evolution can be described as a quantum
oscillation between quasi-resonant states (prolate and oblate configurations)
whose amplitudes depend upon the degree of shell filling. The picture explains
the evolution of absorption spectra and predicts a peculiar isotope effect .
