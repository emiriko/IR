We argue that all the common thermodynamic proofs based on the pump-engine
couple possess an inherent circularity and hence are of doubtful value. In
certain cases, ways of avoiding them are suggested. In others, the difficulties
are discussed. Particularly, we emphasize that a neat proof of Carnot theorems
requires the entropic formulation of the second law.
