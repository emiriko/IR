We show that, by appropriately tuning physically relevant interactions in
two-component nonlinear Schrodinger equations, it is possible to achieve a
regime with particle-like solitonic collisions. This allows us to construct an
analogue of the Newton's cradle and also to create localized collective
excitations in solitary-wave chains which are quasi-integrable solitons, i.e.
supersolitons.
  We give a physical explanation of the phenomenon, support it with a
perturbative analysis, and confirm our predictions by direct simulations.
