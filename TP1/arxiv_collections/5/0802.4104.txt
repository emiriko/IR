In the present work, it is shown that the problem of the accelerating
expansion of the Universe can be directly solved by applying Einstein
geometrization philosophy in a wider geometry. The geometric structure used to
fulfil the aim of the work is a version of Absolute Parallelism geometry in
which curvature and torsion are simultaneously non vanishing objects. It is
shown that, while the energy corresponding to the curvature of space- time
gives rise to an attractive force, the energy corresponding to the torsion
indicates the presence of a repulsive force. A fine tuning parameter can be
adjusted to give the observed phenomena.
