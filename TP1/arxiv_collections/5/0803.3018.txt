Geometries with horizons offer insights into relationships between general
relativity and quantum physics. For static spherically symmetric space-times,
the event horizon is coincident with a coordinate anomaly that introduces
complications in descriptions of near horizon physics. Naive introduction of
dynamics using coordinates with anomalous behavior coincident with the horizon
also introduces invariant singular physical content at that horizon. However,
the introduction of a temporal coordinate that is non-orthogonal to spatial
coordinates near the horizon, but asymptotically orthogonal, provides a dynamic
description without singular physical content at the horizon itself. Penrose
diagrams will be presented exhibiting temporal dependencies for accreting and
evaporating black holes, and near horizon light-like trajectories will be
examined. In addition, the quantum mechanics of simple quantum fields will be
explored. Finally, a two-fluid cosmology will be suggested to describe dynamic
coherent aspects of the universe as a whole.
