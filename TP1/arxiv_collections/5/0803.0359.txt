A novel stochastic fluid model is proposed with non-ideal structure factor
consistent with compressibility, and adjustable transport coefficients. This
Stochastic Hard Sphere Dynamics (SHSD) algorithm is a modification of the
Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) algorithm and has several computational
advantages over event-driven hard-sphere molecular dynamics. Surprisingly, SHSD
results in an equation of state and pair correlation function identical to that
of a deterministic Hamiltonian system of penetrable spheres interacting with
linear core pair potentials. The fluctuating hydrodynamic behavior of the SHSD
fluid is verified for the Brownian motion of a nano-particle suspended in a
compressible solvent.
