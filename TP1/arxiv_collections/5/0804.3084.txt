We study the neutralino relic density in the minimal supersymmetric standard
model with natural light Higgs sector in which all Higgs masses, the
supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking parameters, and the higgsino mass parameter mu
are of order the weak scale. To realize this situation we adopt nonuniversal
Higgs masses at the grand unified scale. We show that in some parameter space
in which the SUSY breaking parameters are comparatively small, not only the
constraint from the observed relic density of dark matter but also the LEP
Higgs bound and the constraint from the b ->s gamma process are satisfied. In
most of the parameter space, the neutralino relic density becomes smaller than
the observed relic density in contrast with the results in the constrained
minimal SUSY standard model (CMSSM). The reason is that the neutralino
coannihilation processes to Higgs bosons open even if the gaugino mass is small
and the cross sections become large due to the small dimensionful parameters.
Especially small mu parameter and the light CP-odd Higgs, which are difficult
to be realized in the CMSSM, are essential for the result.
