In this paper we presented an overview on our works. More than ten years ago,
we proposed a new fundamental equation of nonequilibrium statistical physics in
place of the present Liouville equation. That is the stochastic velocity type's
Langevin equation in 6N dimensional phase space or its equivalent Liouville
diffusion equation. This equation is time-reversed asymmetrical. It shows that
the form of motion of particles in statistical thermodynamic systems has the
drift-diffusion duality, and the law of motion of statistical thermodynamics is
expressed by a superposition of both the law of dynamics and stochastic
velocity and possesses both determinism and probability. Hence it is different
with the law of motion of particles in dynamical systems. Starting from this
fundamental equation the BBGKY diffusion equation hierarchy, the Boltzmann
collision diffusion equation, the hydrodynamic equations such as the mass
drift-diffusion equation, the Navier-Stokes equation and the thermal
conductivity equation have been derived and presented here. What is more
important, we first constructed a nonlinear evolution equation of
nonequilibrium entropy density in 6N, 6 and 3 dimensional phase space,
predicted the existence of entropy diffusion. This evolution equation reveals
that the time rate of change of nonequilibrium entropy density originates
together from its drift, diffusion and production in space. Furthermore, we
presented a formula for entropy production rate (i.e. the law of entropy
increase), proved that internal attractive force in nonequilibrium system can
result in entropy decrease while internal repulsive force leads to another
entropy increase, obtained an unified theoretical expression for thermodynamic
degradation and self-organizing evolution, and revealed that the entropy
diffusion mechanism caused the system to approach to equilibrium.
