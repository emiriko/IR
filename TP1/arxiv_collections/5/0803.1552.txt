We consider the dynamics of a non-recombining haploid population of finite
size which accumulates deleterious mutations irreversibly. This ratchet like
process occurs at a finite speed in the absence of epistasis, but it has been
suggested that synergistic epistasis can halt the ratchet. Using a diffusion
theory, we find explicit analytical expressions for the typical time between
successive clicks of the ratchet for both non-epistatic and epistatic fitness
functions. Our calculations show that the inter-click time is of a scaling form
which in the absence of epistasis gives a speed that is determined by size of
the least-loaded class and the selection coefficient. With synergistic
interactions, the ratchet speed is found to approach zero rapidly for arbitrary
epistasis. Our analytical results are in good agreement with the numerical
simulations.
