Gene regulation in higher eukaryotes involves a complex interplay between the
gene proximal promoter and distal genomic elements (such as enhancers) which
work in concert to drive spatio-temporal expression. The experimental
characterization of gene regulatory elements is a very complex and
resource-intensive process. One of the major goals in computational biology is
the \textit{in-silico} annotation of previously uncharacterized elements using
results from the subset of known, annotated, regulatory elements.
  The computational annotation of these hitherto uncharacterized regions would
require an identification of features that have good predictive value for
regulatory behavior.
  In this work, we study transcriptional regulation as a problem in
heterogeneous data integration, across sequence, expression and interactome
level attributes. Using the example of the \textit{Gata2} gene and its recently
discovered urogenital enhancers \cite{Khandekar2004} as a case study, we
examine the predictive value of various high throughput functional genomic
assays in characterizing these enhancers and their regulatory role. Observing
results from the application of modern statistical learning methodologies for
each of these data modalities, we propose a set of attributes that are most
discriminatory in the localization and behavior of these enhancers.
