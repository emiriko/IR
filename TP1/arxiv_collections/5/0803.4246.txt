We show that misfit strain originated from the film-substrate lattice
mismatch strongly increases the value of the quadratic magnetoelectric
coupling. The giant magnetoelectric coupling, size effects and misfit strain
cause strong changes of ferroic films phase diagrams at zero external magnetic
and electric fields, in particular, the transformation of antiferromagnetic
phase into ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic ones for compressive or tensile
misfit strains correspondingly as well as thickness induced paramagnetic or/and
paraelectric phases appearance. Ferromagnetism appearance and magnetoelectric
coupling increase in thin ferroelectric-antiferromagnetic films is in agreement
with available experimental data and opens the way for tailoring of ferroic
films magnetic and electric properties.
