We present an extension to a d-ary alphabet of a recently proposed
deterministic quantum key distribution protocol. It relies on the use of
mutually unbiased bases in prime power dimension d, for which we provide an
explicit expression. Then, by considering a powerful individual attack, we show
that the security of the protocol is maximal for d=3.
