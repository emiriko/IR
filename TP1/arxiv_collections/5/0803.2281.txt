Recently, Gautschi introduced so-called generalized Gauss-Radau and
Gauss-Lobatto formulae which are quadrature formulae of Gaussian type involving
not only the values but also the derivatives of the function at the endpoints.
In the present note we show the positivity of the corresponding weights; this
positivity has been conjectured already by Gautschi. As a consequence, we
establish several convergence theorems for these quadrature formulae.
