The generation of muon-antimuon pairs is calculated in the collision of an
ultrarelativistic bare ion with an intense x-ray laser beam. The reaction
proceeds nonlinearly via absorption of two laser photons. By systematic study
throughout the nuclear chart we show that the interplay between the nuclear
charge and size, along with the possibility of nuclear excitation leads to
saturation of the total production rates for high-Z ions, in contrast to the
usual Z^2 scaling for pointlike projectiles. The process is experimentally
accessible by combining present-day ion accelerators with near-future laser
sources and in principle allows for the measurement of nuclear form factors.
