We present brief synopses of supersymmetric models where either the
neutralino composition or its mass is adjusted so that thermal relic
neutralinos from the Big Bang saturate the measured abundance of cold dark
matter in the universe. We first review minimal supergravity (mSUGRA), and then
examine its various one-parameter extensions where we relax the assumed
universality of the soft supersymmetry breaking parameters. Our goal is to
correlate relic-density-allowed parameter choices with expected phenomena in
direct, indirect and collider dark matter search experiments. For every
non-universal model, we first provide plots to facilitate the selection of
``dark-matter allowed'' parameter space points, and then present salient
features of each model with respect to searches at Tevatron, LHC and ILC and
also direct and indirect dark matter searches. We present benchmark scenarios
that allow one to compare and contrast the non-universal models with one
another and with the paradigm mSUGRA framework. We show that many implications
about sparticle properties and collider signals drawn from the analysis of the
relic density constraint within mSUGRA do not carry over to simple
one-parameter extensions of the mSUGRA framework. We find that in many
relic-density-consistent models, there is one (or more) detectable edge in the
invariant mass distribution of same-flavour, opposite sign dileptons in SUSY
cascade decay events at the LHC. Finally, we scan the parameter space of these
various models, requiring consistency with the LEP2 constraint on the chargino
mass, and with the observed relic density, and examine prospects for direct and
indirect dark matter detection. We find that in a large number of cases the
mechanism that causes the early universe neutralino annihilation rate to be
large (so as to produce the measured relic density) also enhances the direct
detection rate, and often also the rates for indirect detection of neutralino
dark matter.
