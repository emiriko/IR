We have shown that non-zero U_{e3} is generated in a see-saw type softly
broken A_4 symmetric model through a single parameter perturbation in m_D in a
single element. We have explored all possible 9 cases to study the neutrino
mixing angles considering the best fitted values of \Delta m_{\odot}^2 and
\Delta m_{atm}^2 with all parameters real. We have extended our analysis for
the complex case and demonstrated large low energy CP violation (J_{CP}\simeq
10^{-2}) and m_{ee} in addition to mixing and mass pattern. We have also
investigated leptogenesis and for a reasonable choice of model parameters
compatible with low energy data, WMAP value of baryon asymmetry 6\times
10^{-10} is obtained for right handed neutrino mass scale M_0\simeq 10^{13}
GeV. We have obtained a relation among the phases responsible for leptogenesis
and have shown that these phases also have correlations with low energy CP
violating phases.
