In the anomaly-mediated supersymmetry breaking model with the assumption of
the generic form of Kahler potential, gauginos are the only kinematically
accessible superparticles to the LHC. We consider the LHC phenomenology of such
a model assuming that the gluino is lighter than 1 TeV. We show that a
significant number of charged Winos, which may travel O(10 cm) before the
decay, are produced from the gluino production processes. Thus, in this class
of model, it will be very important to search for short charged tracks using
inner detectors. We also show that, if a large number of the charged Wino
tracks are identified, the lifetime of the charged Wino can be measured, which
provides us a test of anomaly mediation.
