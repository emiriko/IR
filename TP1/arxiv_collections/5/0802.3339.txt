We theoretically analyze the synchronized and desynchronized phases of
coupled non-equilibrium polariton condensates within mean field theory. An
analytical condition for the existence of a synchronized phase is derived for
two coupled wells. The case of many wells in a 2D disordered geometry is
studied numerically. The relation to recent experiments on polariton
condensation in CdTe microcavities is discussed.
