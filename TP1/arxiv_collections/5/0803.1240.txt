Quantized detector networks (QDN) deals with quantum information exchange
between observers and their apparatus rather than with systems under
observation. Partial observations in QDN involve subsets of the elementary
signal detectors which constitute an apparatus. We use them to prove that QDN
is consistent with Einstein locality and violations of Bell-type inequalities.
