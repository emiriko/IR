In this paper we present a simple algorithm for representation of statistical
data of any origin by complex probability amplitudes. Numerical simulation with
Mathematica-6 is performed. The Bloch's sphere is used for visualization of
results of numerical simulation. On the one hand, creation of such a
quantum-like (QL) representation and its numerical approval is an important
step in clarification of extremely complicated interrelation between classical
and quantum randomness. On the other hand, it opens new possibilities for
application the mathematical formalism of QM in other domains of science.
