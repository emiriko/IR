We investigate the ac transport of magnetization in non-itinerant quantum
systems such as spin chains described by the XXZ Hamiltonian. Using linear
response theory, we calculate the ac magnetization current and the power
absorption of such magnetic systems. Remarkably, the difference in the exchange
interaction of the spin chain itself and the bulk magnets (i.e. the
magnetization reservoirs), to which the spin chain is coupled, strongly
influences the absorbed power of the system. This feature can be used in future
spintronic devices to control power dissipation. Our analysis allows to make
quantitative predictions about the power absorption and we show that magnetic
systems are superior to their electronic counter parts.
