We analyze the question whether sliding window time averages applied to
stationary increment processes converge to a limit in probability. The question
centers on averages, correlations, and densities constructed via time averages
of the increment x(t,T)=x(t+T)-x(t)and the assumption is that the increment is
distributed independently of t. We show that the condition for applying
Tchebyshev's Theorem to time averages of functions of stationary increments is
strongly violated. We argue that, for both stationary and nonstationary
increments, Tchebyshev's Theorem provides the basis for constructing emsemble
averages and densities from a single, historic time series if, as in FX
markets, the series shows a definite statistical periodicity on the average.
