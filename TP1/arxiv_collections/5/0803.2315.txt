We propose a series of methods to represent the evolution of a field of
science at different levels: namely micro, meso and macro levels. We use a
previously introduced asymmetric measure of paradigmatic proximity between
terms that enables us to extract structure from a large publications database.
We apply our set of methods on a case study from the complex systems community
through the mapping of more than 400 complex systems science concepts indexed
from a database as large as several millions of journal papers. We will first
summarize the main properties of our asymmetric proximity measure. Then we show
how salient paradigmatic fields can be embedded into a 2-dimensional
visualization into which the terms are plotted according to their relative
specificity and generality index. This meso-level helps us producing
macroscopic maps of the field of science studied featuring the former
paradigmatic fields.
