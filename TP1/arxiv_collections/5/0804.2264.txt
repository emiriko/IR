Faster algorithms, novel cryptographic mechanisms, and alternative methods of
communication become possible when the model underlying information and
computation changes from a classical mechanical model to a quantum mechanical
one. Quantum algorithms perform a select set of tasks vastly more efficiently
than any classical algorithm, but for many tasks it has been proved that
quantum algorithms provide no advantage. The breadth of quantum computing
applications is still being explored. Major application areas include security
and the many fields that would benefit from efficient quantum simulation. The
quantum information processing viewpoint provides insight into classical
algorithmic issues as well as a deeper understanding of entanglement and other
non-classical aspects of quantum physics. This overview is aimed at technology
managers who wish to gain a high level understanding of quantum information
processing, particularly quantum computing.
