We consider NLO chargino production and decays at the ILC. For this, we
present an NLO extension of the Monte Carlo Event Generator Whizard including
the NLO production. For photonic corrections, we use both a fixed order and a
resummation approach. The latter method evades the problem of negative event
weights and automatically includes leading higher order corrections. We present
results for cross sections and event generation for both methods. As a first
step towards a full NLO Monte Carlo, we consider a LO implementation of the
chargino production and subsequent leptonic decay and investigate the precision
of the sneutrino mass determination by means of lepton energy distributions in
chargino decays. The SM and SUSY backgrounds are included in our study using
full matrix elements as well as smearing effects from ISR and beamstrahlung.
Without using energy distribution fits, the sneutrino mass can be determined
with an error in the percent regime.
