The effective Heisenberg interaction of long distance is constructed in spin
qubits connected to a bus of two strongly coupled chains. Universal quantum
computation can be realized on the basis of the bus which always keeps frozen
at the ground state. It is found that the effective interaction is primarily
determined by the energy spectra of the bus. With the variation of the distance
between two connecting nodes, the interaction alternately occurs between
antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic ones. The long range interaction can also
be attained in coupled infinite chains. The quantum gate operations with the
high precision are implemented in the condition of quantum fluctuations.
