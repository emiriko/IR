We study the supercurrent in a superconductor/ferromagnet/superconductor
graphene junction. In contrast to its metallic counterpart, the oscillating
critical current in our setup decays only weakly upon increasing exchange field
and junction width. We find an unusually large residual value of the
supercurrent at the oscillatory cusps due to a strong deviation from a
sinusoidal current-phase relationship. Our findings suggest a very efficient
device for dissipationless supercurrent switching.
