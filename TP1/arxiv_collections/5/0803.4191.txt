I present a toy model for the Berkovits pure spinor superparticle. It is a
D=1, N=2 superparticle with no physical degrees of freedom. We study the
cohomology in various ways, in particular finding an explicit expression for
the `b'-field. Finally, we construct the topological string B-model from a
straightforward generalization of the system.
