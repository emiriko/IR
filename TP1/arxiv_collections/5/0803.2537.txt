The magneto-photoluminescence of type-II (ZnMn)Te quantum dots is presented.
As a result of the type-II band alignment Aharonov-Bohm (AB) oscillations in
the photoluminescence intensity are evident, confirming previous predictions
for the suitability of this geometry to control the optical Aharonov-Bohm
effect in semiconductor systems. Moreover, the system demonstrates an
interesting interplay between the AB effect and the spin polarization in
diluted magnetic semiconductor quantum dots. The intensity of the AB
oscillations increases with both magnetic field and the degree of optical
polarization, indicating the suppression of spin fluctuations improves the
coherence of the system.
