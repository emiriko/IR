The results of calculations of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) parameters
for the lead halides is reported in this paper. The results are obtained by
using four-component methods. The use of the nonrelativistic L\'evy-Leblond
Hamiltonian along with the relativistic Dirac-Coulomb and spin-free ones allows
us to discriminate scalar and spin-dependent effects on the parameters. It is
found that the wide range of the lead NMR spectra and their large anisotropies
are, mainly, due to spin-dependent effects on the paramagnetic term. Among the
relativistic scalar corrections, the so-called spin-Zeeman kinetic-energy term
turns out to be dominant. The reduced spin-spin coupling constants become
proportional to the product of the atomic numbers of the coupled nuclei.
