We describe a coherent network algorithm for detection and reconstruction of
gravitational wave bursts. The algorithm works for two and more arbitrarily
aligned detectors and can be used for both all-sky and triggered burst
searches. We describe the main components of the algorithm, including the
time-frequency analysis in wavelet domain, construction of the likelihood
time-frequency maps, the identification and selection of burst events.
