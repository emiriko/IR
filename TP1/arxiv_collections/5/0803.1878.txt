The fabrication of epitaxial graphene (EG) on SiC substrate by annealing has
attracted a lot of interest as it may speed up the application of graphene for
future electronic devices. The interaction of EG and the SiC substrate is
critical to its electronic and physical properties. In this work, Raman
spectroscopy was used to study the structure of EG and its interaction with SiC
substrate. All the Raman bands of EG blue shift from that of bulk graphite and
graphene made by micromechanical cleavage, which was attributed to the
compressive strain induced by the substrate. A model containing 13 x 13
honeycomb lattice cells of graphene on carbon nanomesh was constructed to
explain the origin of strain. The lattice mismatch between graphene layer and
substrate causes the compressive stress of 2.27 GPa on graphene. We also
demonstrate that the electronic structures of EG grown on Si and C terminated
SiC substrates are quite different. Our experimental results shed light on the
interaction between graphene and SiC substrate that are critical to the future
applications of EG.
