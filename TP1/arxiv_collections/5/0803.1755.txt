Angular distributions in the final state of pi0-eta photoproduction on
nucleons are considered. As a formal base the familiar isobar model is used in
which the (pi0 eta N) state is a product of the resonance decay into
eta-Delta(1232) and pi-S_{11}(1535) channels. One of the principal assumptions
used is that in the actual energy region the reaction is dominated by a single
resonance state. The developed formalism can serve as a tool for testing spin
and parity of that resonance.
