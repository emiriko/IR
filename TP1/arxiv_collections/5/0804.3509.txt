The differential cross-section for the process p(e,e'p)eta has been measured
at Q2 ~ 5.7 and 7.0 (GeV/c)2 for centre-of-mass energies from threshold to 1.8
GeV, encompassing the S11(1535) resonance, which dominates the channel. This is
the highest momentum transfer measurement of this exclusive process to date.
The helicity-conserving transition amplitude A_1/2, for the production of the
S11(1535) resonance, is extracted from the data. Within the limited Q2 now
measured, this quantity appears to begin scaling as 1/Q3 - a predicted, but not
definitive, signal of the dominance of perturbative QCD, at Q2 ~ 5 (GeV/c)2.
