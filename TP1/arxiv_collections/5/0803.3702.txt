Let R be a discrete valuation ring of unequal characteristic which contains a
primitive p^2-th root of unity. If K is the fraction field of R, it is well
known that (Z/p^2 Z)_K is isomorphic to \mu_{p^2,K}. We prove that any finite
and flat R-group scheme of order p^2 isomorphic to (Z/p^2 Z)_K on the generic
fiber (i.e. a model of (Z/p^2 Z)_K), is the kernel in a short exact sequence
which generically coincides with the Kummer sequence. We will explicitly
describe and classify such models.
