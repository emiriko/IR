Si(001)-(2$\times$1) surface is one of the many two-dimensional systems of
scientific and applied interest. It has two surface state bands (1)
anti-bonding pi* band, which has acceptor states and (2) bonding pi band, which
has donor states. Due to its asymmetric dimer reconstruction, transport through
this surface can be considered in two distinct directions, i.e. along and
perpendicular to the paired dimer rows. We calculate the zero bias conductance
of these surface states under flat-band condition and find that conduction
along the dimer row direction is significant due to strong orbital
hybridization. We also find that the surface conductance is orders of magnitude
higher than the bulk conductance close to the band edges for the unpassivated
surface at room temperature. Therefore, we propose that the transport through
these surface states may be the dominant conduction mechanisms in the recently
reported scanning tunneling microscopy of silicon nanomembranes. We also
calculate the zero bias conductance under flat-band condition for the weakly
interacting dangling bond wires along and perpendicular to the dimer row
direction and find similar trends. Extended Huckel theory is used for the
electronic structure calculations, which is benchmarked with the GW
approximation for Si and has been successfully applied to Si systems in past.
