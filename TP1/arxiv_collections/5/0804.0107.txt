A derivation of the Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem for the microcanonical
ensemble is presented using linear response theory. The theorem is stated as a
relation between the frequency spectra of the symmetric correlation and
response functions. When the system is not in the thermodinamic limit, this
result can be viewed as an extension of the fluctuation-dissipation relations
to a situation where dynamical fluctuations determine the response. Therefore,
the relation presented here between equilibrium fluctuations and response can
have a very different physical nature from the usual one in the canonical
ensemble. These considerations imply that the Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem
is not restricted to the context of thermal equilibrium, where it is usually
derived. Dispersion relations and sum rules are also obtained and discussed in
the present case. Although analogous to the Kramers-Kronig relations, they are
not related to the frequency spectrum but to the energy dependence of the
response function.
