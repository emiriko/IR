We report on photon coincidence measurement in a single GaAs self-assembled
quantum dot (QD) using a pulsed excitation light source. At low excitation,
when a neutral exciton line was present in the photoluminescence (PL) spectrum,
we observed nearly perfect single photon emission from an isolated QD at 670 nm
wavelength. For higher excitation, multiple PL lines appeared on the spectra,
reflecting the formation of exciton complexes. Cross-correlation functions
between these lines showed either bunching or antibunching behavior, depending
on whether the relevant emission was from a biexciton cascade or a charged
exciton recombination.
