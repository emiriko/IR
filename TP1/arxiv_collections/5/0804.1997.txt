This note describes sharp Milnor--Wood inequalities for the Euler number of
flat oriented vector bundles over closed Riemannian manifolds locally isometric
to products of hyperbolic planes. One consequence is that such manifolds do not
admit an affine structure, confirming Chern--Sullivan's conjecture in this
case. The manifolds under consideration are of particular interest, since in
contrary to many other locally symmetric spaces they do admit flat vector
bundle of the corresponding dimension. When the manifold is irreducible and of
higher rank, it is shown that flat oriented vector bundles are determined
completely by the sign of the Euler number.
