In 1980, a burial tomb was unearthed in Jerusalem containing ossuaries
(limestone coffins) bearing such inscriptions as Yeshua son of Yehosef, Marya,
Yoseh--names which match those of New Testament (NT) figures, but were
otherwise in common use. This paper discusses certain statistical aspects of
authenticating or repudiating links between this find and the NT family. The
available data are laid out, and we examine the distribution of names
(onomasticon) of the era. An approach is proposed for measuring the
``surprisingness'' of the observed outcome relative to a ``hypothesis'' that
the tombsite belonged to the NT family. On the basis of a particular--but far
from uncontested--set of assumptions, our measure of ``surprisingness'' is
significantly high.
