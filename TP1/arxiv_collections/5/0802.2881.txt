Tungsten filaments used as sources of electrons in a low temperature liquid
or gaseous helium environment have remarkable properties of operating at
thousands of degrees Kelvin in surroundings at temperatures of order 1 K. We
provide an explanation of this performance in terms of important changes in the
thermal transport mechanisms. The behavior can be cast as a first-order phase
transition.
