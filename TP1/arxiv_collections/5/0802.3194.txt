We report on a large-scale study of student learning of quantum tunneling in
4 traditional and 4 transformed modern physics courses. In the transformed
courses, which were designed to address student difficulties found in previous
research, students still struggle with many of the same issues found in other
courses. However, the reasons for these difficulties are more subtle, and many
new issues are brought to the surface. By explicitly addressing how to build
models of wave functions and energy and how to relate these models to real
physical systems, we have opened up a floodgate of deep and difficult questions
as students struggle to make sense of these models. We conclude that the
difficulties found in previous research are the tip of the iceberg, and the
real issue at the heart of student difficulties in learning quantum tunneling
is the struggle to build the complex models that are implicit in experts'
understanding but often not explicitly addressed in instruction.
