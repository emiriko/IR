We study induced triplet pairing correlations in clean
ferromagnet/superconductor/ferromagnet heterostructures. The pairing state in
the superconductor is the conventional singlet s-wave, and the angle $\alpha$
between the magnetizations of the two ferromagnetic layers is arbitrary. We use
a numerical fully self-consistent solution of the microscopic equations and
obtain the time-dependent triplet correlations via the Heisenberg equations of
motion. We find that in addition to the usual singlet correlations, triplet
correlations, odd in time as required by the Pauli principle, are induced in
both the ferromagnets and the superconductor. These time-dependent correlations
are largest at times of order of the inverse of the Debye cutoff frequency,
$\omega_D$, and we find that within that time scale they are often spatially
very long ranged. We discuss the behavior of the characteristic penetration
lengths that describe these triplet correlations. We also find that the
ferromagnets can locally magnetize the superconductor near the interface, and
that the local magnetization then undergoes strongly damped oscillations. The
local density of states exhibits a variety of energy signatures, which we
discuss, as a function of ferromagnetic strength and $\alpha$.
