We carry out a systematic study of the heavy-light meson strong decays in a
chiral quark model. For the $S$-wave vectors ($D^*(2007)$, $D^{*\pm}(2010)$),
$P$-wave scalars ($D^*_0(2400)$, $B^*_0(5730)$) and tensors ($D^*_2(2460)$,
$D^*_{s2}(2573)$), we obtain results in good agreement with the experimental
data. For the axial vectors $D_1(2420)$ and $D_1^\prime(2430)$, a state mixing
scheme between $1^1P_1$ and $1^3P_1$ is favored with a mixing angle
$\phi\simeq-(55\pm 5)^\circ$, which is consistent with previous theoretical
predictions. The same mixing scheme also applies to $D_{s1}(2460)$ and
$D_{s1}(2536)$ that accounts for the narrow width of the $D_{s1}(2536)$ and its
dominant decay into $D^*K$. For $B_1(5725)$ and $B_1^\prime(5732)$, such a
mixing explains well the decay width of the former but leads to an even broader
$B_1^\prime(5732)$. Predictions for the strange-bottom axial vectors are also
made. For the undetermined meson $D^*(2640)$, we find that they fit in well the
radially excited state $2^3S_1$ according to its decay mode. The newly observed
$D^*_{sJ}(2860)$ strongly favors the $D$-wave excited state $1^3D_3$. For
$D^*_{sJ}(2632)$ and $D^*_{sJ}(2690)$, we find they are difficult to fit in any
$D_s$ excitations in that mass region, if the experimental data are accurate.
Theoretical predictions for decay modes of those unobserved states as
multiplets of 2S and 1D waves are also presented, which should be useful for
further experimental search for those states.
