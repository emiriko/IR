We numerically study the dynamics of a discrete spring-block model introduced
by Olami, Feder and Christensen (OFC) to mimic earthquakes and investigate to
which extent this simple model is able to reproduce the observed spatiotemporal
clustering of seismicty. Following a recently proposed method to characterize
such clustering by networks of recurrent events [Geophys. Res. Lett. {\bf 33},
L1304, 2006], we find that for synthetic catalogs generated by the OFC model
these networks have many non-trivial statistical properties. This includes
characteristic degree distributions -- very similar to what has been observed
for real seismicity. There are, however, also significant differences between
the OFC model and earthquake catalogs indicating that this simple model is
insufficient to account for certain aspects of the spatiotemporal clustering of
seismicity.
