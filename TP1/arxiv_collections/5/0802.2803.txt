We introduce the notion of ''maximal rank type'' for representations of
quivers, which requires certain collections of maps involved in the
representation to be of maximal rank. We show that real root representations of
quivers are of maximal rank type. By using the maximal rank type property and
universal extension functors we construct all real root representations of a
particular wild quiver with three vertices. From this construction it follows
that real root representations of this quiver are tree modules. Moreover,
formulae given by Ringel can be applied to compute the dimension of the
endomorphism ring of a given real root representation.
