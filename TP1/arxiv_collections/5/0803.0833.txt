A new type of scalar potential inspired by unparticles is proposed for the
electroweak symmetry breaking. The interaction between the standard model
fields and unparticle sector is described by the non-integral power of fields
that originates from the nontrivial scaling dimension of the unparticle
operator. We find that unlike the usual integral-power potential, the
electroweak symmetry is broken at tree level. The scale invariance of
unparticle sector is also broken simultaneously, resulting in a physical Higgs
and a lighter scalar particle.
