Whereas single- and two-photon wave packets are usually treated as pure
states, in practice they will be mixed. We study how entanglement created with
mixed photon wave packets is degraded. We find in particular that the
entanglement of a delocalized single-photon state of the electro-magnetic field
is determined simply by its purity. We also discuss entanglement for two-photon
mixed states, as well as the influence of a vacuum component.
