Loops are abundant in native RNA structures and proliferate close to the
unfolding transition. By including a statistical weight ~ l^{-c} for loops of
length l in the recursion relation for the partition function, we show that the
calculated heat capacity depends sensitively on the presence and value of the
exponent c, even of short t-RNA. For homo-RNA we analytically calculate the
critical temperature and critical exponents which exhibit a non-universal
dependence on c.
