Richomme asked the following question: what is the infimum of the real
numbers $\alpha$ > 2 such that there exists an infinite word that avoids
$\alpha$-powers but contains arbitrarily large squares beginning at every
position? We resolve this question in the case of a binary alphabet by showing
that the answer is $\alpha$ = 7/3.
