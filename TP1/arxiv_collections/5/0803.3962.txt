The one-dimensional motion of $N$ particles in the field of many incoherent
waves is revisited numerically. When the wave complex amplitudes are
independent, with a gaussian distribution, the quasilinear approximation is
found to always overestimate transport and to become accurate in the limit of
infinite resonance overlap.
