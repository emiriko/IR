We present a dynamical spectral model for Large Eddy Simulation of the
incompressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations based on the Eddy Damped
Quasi Normal Markovian approximation. This model extends classical spectral
Large Eddy Simulations for the Navier-Stokes equations to incorporate general
(non Kolmogorovian) spectra as well as eddy noise. We derive the model for MHD
and show that introducing a new eddy-damping time for the dynamics of spectral
tensors in the absence of equipartition between the velocity and magnetic
fields leads to better agreement with direct numerical simulations, an
important point for dynamo computations.
