Experiments at Jefferson Laboratory, MIT-Bates, LEGS, Mainz, Bonn, GRAAL, and
Spring-8 offer new opportunities to understand in detail how nucleon resonance
($N^*$) properties emerge from the nonperturbative aspects of QCD. Preliminary
data from CLAS collaboration, which cover a large range of photon virtuality
$Q^2$ show interesting behavior with respect to $Q^2$ dependence: in the region
$Q^2 \le 1.5 {GeV}^2$, both the transverse amplitude, $A_{1/2}(Q^2)$, and the
longitudinal amplitude, $S_{1/2}(Q^2)$, decrease rapidly. In this work, we
attempt to use first-principles lattice QCD (for the first time) to provide a
model-independent study of the Roper-nucleon transition form factor.
