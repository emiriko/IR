The alternating-current (AC) Josephson effect is studied in a system
consisting of two weakly coupled Bose Hubbard models. In the framework of the
mean field theory, Gross-Pitaevskii equations show that the amplitude of the
Josephson current is proportional to the product of superfluid order
parameters. In addition, the chemical potential--current relation for a small
size system is obtained via the exact numerical computation. This allows us to
propose a feasible experimental scheme to measure the Mott lobes of the quantum
phase transition.
