We construct a two-field higher-order gradient micropolar model for Cosserat
media on the basis of a square lattice of elements with rotational degrees of
freedom. This model includes equations of single-field higher-order gradient
micropolar theory, and additional ones, which allow modelling of short
wavelength phenomena. We demonstrate an example of short wavelength spatially
localized static deformations in a structural system, which could not be
obtained in the classical single-field framework, but which are captured by the
proposed two-field model.
