In this paper, we consider a planar dynamical system with a piecewise linear
function containing an arbitrary number (but finite) of dropping sections and
approximating some continuous nonlinear function. Studying all possible local
and global bifurcations of its limit cycles, we prove that such a piecewise
linear dynamical system with $k$ dropping sections and $2k+1$ singular points
can have at most $k+2$ limit cycles, $k+1$ of which surround the foci one by
one and the last, $(k+2)$-th, limit cycle surrounds all of the singular points
of this system.
