This paper explores the links between Knowledge Management and new
community-based models of the organization from both a theoretical and an
empirical perspective. From a theoretical standpoint, we look at Communities of
Practice (CoPs) and Knowledge Management (KM) and explore the links between the
two as they relate to the use of information systems to manage knowledge. We
begin by reviewing technologically supported approaches to KM and introduce the
idea of "Systemes d'Aide a la Gestion des Connaissances" SAGC (Systems to aid
the Management of Knowledge). Following this we examine the contribution that
communal structures such as CoPs can make to intraorganizational KM and
highlight some of 'success factors' for this approach to KM that are found in
the literature. From an empirical standpoint, we present the results of a
survey involving the Chief Knowledge Officers (CKOs) of twelve large French
businesses; the objective of this study was to identify the factors that might
influence the success of such approaches. The survey was analysed using
thematic content analysis and the results are presented here with some short
illustrative quotes from the CKOs. Finally, the paper concludes with some brief
reflections on what can be learnt from looking at this problem from these two
perspectives.
