We study the time evolution of different Laponite suspensions from a
low-viscosity ergodic state to a viscoelastic non-ergodic state over a wide
range of volume fractions and salt contents. We find that the evolution of
non-ergodicity parameter (Debye-Waller factor) splits into two branches for all
the samples, which correspond to two distinct dynamically arrested states. At
moderately high salt concentrations, on the other hand, a third and new
nonergodic state appears that are different from the above two nonergodic
states. Measurement of the conductivity of Laponite solutions in pure water
shows that the contribution of counterions in the ionic strength is
considerable and their role should be taken into account in interpretations of
aging dynamics and the phase diagram. Based on these data and available data in
the literature, we propose a new (non-equilibrium) phase diagram for Laponite
suspensions.
