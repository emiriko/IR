We study the localization of vibrational modes of frictionless granular
media. We introduce a new method, motivated by earlier work on non-Hermitian
quantum problems, which works well both in the localized regime where the
localization length $\xi$ is much less than the linear size $L$ and in the
regime $\xi$ grater or of order $L$ when modes are extended throughout our
finite system. Our very lowest frequency modes show "quasi-localized"
resonances away from the jamming point; the spatial extent of these regions
increases as the jamming point is approached, as expected theoretically.
Throughout the remaining frequency range, our data show no signature of the
nearness of the jamming point and collapse well when properly rescaled with the
system size. Using Random Matrix Theory we derive the scaling relation $\xi$ ~
$L^{d/2}$ for the regime $\xi$ >> $L$ in $d$ dimensions.
