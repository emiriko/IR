This chapter presents a review on spin transfer torque in magnetic tunnel
junctions. In the first part, we propose an overview of experimental and
theoretical studies addressing current-induced magnetization excitations in
magnetic tunnel junctions. The most significant results are presented and the
main observable characteristics are discussed. A description of the mechanism
of spin transfer in ferromagnets is finally proposed. In the second part, a
quantum description of spin transport in magnetic tunnel junctions with
amorphous barrier is developed. The role of spin-dependent reflections as well
as electron incidence and spin-filtering by the barrier are described. We show
that these mechanisms give rise to specific properties of spin transfer in
tunnel junctions, very different from the case of metallic spin-valves. In the
third part, the theoretical observable features of spin transfer in magnetic
tunnel junctions are derived and the validity of these results is discussed and
compared to recent experiments. To conclude this chapter, we study the
mechanism of spin transfer in half-metallic tunnel junctions, expected to mimic
MgO-based magnetic tunnel junctions.
