A straightforward new technique is introduced which enables measurement at
hadron colliders of an analytical combination of the masses of pair-produced
semi-invisibly decaying particles and their invisible decay products. The new
technique makes use of the invariance under contra-linear Lorentz boosts of a
simple combination of the transverse momentum components of the aggregate
visible products of each decay chain. In the general case where the invariant
masses of the visible decay products are non-zero it is shown that in principle
the masses of both the initial particles from the hard scattering and the
invisible particles produced in the decay chains can be determined
independently. This application is likely to be difficult to realise in
practice however due to the contamination of the final state with ISR jets. The
technique may be of most use for measurements of SUSY particle masses at the
LHC, however the technique should be applicable to any class of hadron collider
events in which heavy particles of unknown mass are pair-produced and decay to
semi-invisible final states.
