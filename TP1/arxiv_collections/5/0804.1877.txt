We calculate low moments of the leading-twist and next-to-leading twist
nucleon distribution amplitudes on the lattice using two flavors of clover
fermions. The results are presented in the MSbar scheme at a scale of 2 GeV and
can be immediately applied in phenomenological studies. We find that the
deviation of the leading-twist nucleon distribution amplitude from its
asymptotic form is less pronounced than sometimes claimed in the literature.
