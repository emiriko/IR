It can be expected that the respective endpoints of the Gregory-Laflamme
black brane instability and the Rayleigh-Plateau membrane instability are
related because the bifurcation diagrams of the black hole-black string system
and the liquid drop-liquid bridge system display many similarities. In this
paper, we investigate the non-linear dynamics of the Rayleigh-Plateau
instability in a range of dimensions, including the critical dimension at which
the phase structure changes. We show that near the critical dimension and
above, depending on a parameter in initial conditions an unstable cylinder will
either pinch off or converge to an equilibrium state. The equilibrium state is
apparently non-uniform but has a constant mean curvature everywhere. The
results suggest that in the gravity side, near the critical dimension and
above, the final state of an unstable black string (which is not too long) is a
non-uniform black string. The equation of motion adopted to describe the
dynamics is the surface diffusion equation, which was originally proposed to
describe a grooving process of heated metal surfaces. An interesting
correspondence between the diffusion dynamics and black hole (thermo)dynamics
is discussed.
