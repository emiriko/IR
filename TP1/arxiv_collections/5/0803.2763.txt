We produce Bose-Einstein condensates of two different species, $^{87}$Rb and
$^{41}$K, in an optical dipole trap in proximity of interspecies Feshbach
resonances. We discover and characterize two Feshbach resonances, located
around 35 and 79 G, by observing the three-body losses and the elastic
cross-section. The narrower resonance is exploited to create a double species
condensate with tunable interactions. Our system opens the way to the
exploration of double species Mott insulators and, more in general, of the
quantum phase diagram of the two species Bose-Hubbard model.
