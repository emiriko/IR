The $^{19}$F($\alpha$,p)$^{22}$Ne reaction is considered to be one of the
main sources of fluorine depletion in AGB and Wolf-Rayet stars. The reaction
rate still retains large uncertainties due to the lack of experimental studies
available. In this work the yields for both exit channels to the ground state
and first excited state of $^{22}$Ne have been measured and several previously
unobserved resonances have been found in the energy range E$_{lab}$=792-1993
keV. The level parameters have been determined through a detailed R-matrix
analysis of the reaction data and a new reaction rate is provided on the basis
of the available experimental information.
