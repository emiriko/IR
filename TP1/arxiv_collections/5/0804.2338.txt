We present results from numerical Classical Yang Mills calculations of the
initial stage Glasma field configurations in a relativistic heavy ion
collision. We compute the initial gluon multiplicity from RHIC to LHC energies.
The initial conditions for the classical field computation are taken from a
dipole model parametrization tested on HERA data, meaning that all the
parameters, including the normalization and the value of the saturation scale,
are fixed from DIS data.
