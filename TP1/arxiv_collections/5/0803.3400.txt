The multi-component nonlinear Schrodinger equation related to C.I=Sp(2p)/U(p)
and D.III=SO(2p)/U(p)-type symmetric spaces with non-vanishing boundary
conditions is solvable with the inverse scattering method (ISM). As Lax
operator L we use the generalized Zakharov-Shabat operator. We show that the
ISM for L is a nonlinear analog of the Fourier-transform method. As appropriate
generalizations of the usual Fourier-exponential functions we use the so-called
squared solutions, which are constructed in terms of the fundamental analytic
solutions (FAS) of L and the Cartan-Weyl basis of the Lie algebra, relevant to
the symmetric space. We derive the completeness relation for the squared
solutions which turns out to provide spectral decomposition of the recursion
(generating) operators, a natural generalizations of id/dx in the case of
nonlinear evolution equations.
