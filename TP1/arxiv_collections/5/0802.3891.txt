We study a two-dimensional semi-totalistic binary cell-state cellular
automaton, which imitates a reversible precipitation in an abstract chemical
medium. The systems exhibits a non-trivial growth and nucleation. We
demonstrate how basic computational operation can be realized in the system
when the propagation of the growing patterns is self-restricted by stationary
localizations. We show that precipitating patterns of different morphology
compete between each other and thus implement serial and non-serial logical
gates.
