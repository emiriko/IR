An extended SU(3) shell model that for the first time explicitly includes
unique-parity levels is introduced. Shell-model calculations for the isotopes
of $^{64}$Ge and $^{68}$Se are performed where valence nucleons beyond the
N=28=Z core occupy levels of the normal parity upper-$fp$ shell
($f_{5/2},p_{3/2},p_{1/2}$) and the unique parity $g_{9/2}$ intruder
configuration. The levels of the upper-$fp$ shell are handled within the
framework of an m-scheme basis as well as its pseudo-SU(3) counterpart, and
respectively, the $g_{9/2}$ as a single level and as a member for the complete
$gds$ shell. It is demonstrated that the extended SU(3) approach allows one to
better probe the effects of deformation and to account for many key properties
of the system by using a highly truncated model space.
