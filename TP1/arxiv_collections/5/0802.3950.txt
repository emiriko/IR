We discuss a generic model of Bayesian inference with binary variables
defined on edges of a planar graph. The Loop Calculus approach of [1, 2] is
used to evaluate the resulting series expansion for the partition function. We
show that, for planar graphs, truncating the series at single-connected loops
reduces, via a map reminiscent of the Fisher transformation [3], to evaluating
the partition function of the dimer matching model on an auxiliary planar
graph. Thus, the truncated series can be easily re-summed, using the Pfaffian
formula of Kasteleyn [4]. This allows to identify a big class of
computationally tractable planar models reducible to a dimer model via the
Belief Propagation (gauge) transformation. The Pfaffian representation can also
be extended to the full Loop Series, in which case the expansion becomes a sum
of Pfaffian contributions, each associated with dimer matchings on an extension
to a subgraph of the original graph. Algorithmic consequences of the Pfaffian
representation, as well as relations to quantum and non-planar models, are
discussed.
