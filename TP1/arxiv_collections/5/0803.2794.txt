We have investigated the tunneling properties of an electron double quantum
well system where the lowest Landau level of each quantum well is half filled.
This system is expected to be a Bose condensate of excitons. Our four-terminal
dc measurements reveal a nearly vanishing interlayer voltage and the existence
of critical tunneling currents which depend on the strength of the condensate
state.
