Diagrammatic Monte Carlo (DiagMC) is a numeric technique that allows one to
calculate quantities specified in terms of diagrammatic expansions, the latter
being a standard tool of many-body quantum statistics. The sign problem that is
typically fatal to Monte Carlo approaches, appears to be manageable with
DiagMC. Starting with a general introduction to the principles of DiagMC, we
present a detailed description of the DiagMC scheme for interacting fermions
(Hubbard model), as well as the first illustrative results for the equations of
state.
