We report recrystallization of epitaxial (epi-) GaN(0001) film under
indentation.Hardness value is measured close to 10 GPa, using a Berkovich
indenter. Pop-in burst in the loading line indicates nucleation of dislocations
setting in plastic motion of lattice atoms under stress field for the
recrystallization process. Micro-Raman studies are used to identify the
recrystallization process. Raman area mapping indicates the crystallized
region. Phonon mode corresponding to E2(high) close to 570 cm-1 in the as-grown
epi-GaN is redshifted to stress free value close to 567 cm-1 in the indented
region. Evolution of A1(TO) and E1(TO) phonon modes are also reported to
signify the recrystallization process.
