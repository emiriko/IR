The momentum distribution in a Fermi gas with two spin states and a large
scattering length has a tail that falls off like 1/k^4 at large momentum k, as
pointed out by Shina Tan. He used novel methods to derive exact relations
between the coefficient of the tail in the momentum distribution and various
other properties of the system. We present simple derivations of these
relations using the operator product expansion for quantum fields. We identify
the coefficient as the integral over space of the expectation value of a local
operator that measures the density of pairs.
