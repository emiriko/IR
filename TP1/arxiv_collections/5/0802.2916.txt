We study the motion of a (space filling) D3-brane at the tip of a warped
deformed conifold, looking for inflationary trajectories. In our setup no anti
D3-brane is present and the inflaton potential is induced by threshold
corrections to the superpotential. First we study the slow roll regime and find
that, allowing for fine tuning, hilltop inflation compatible with CMB data can
take place. Then we consider the DBI regime and formulate a necessary condition
for a phenomenologically viable inflationary stage. En passant, we propose a
mechanism to cancel the large inflaton mass in the standard radial D3-anti
D3-brane inflation.
