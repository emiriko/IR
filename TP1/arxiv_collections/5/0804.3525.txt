A new version of the separable kernel of the nucleon-nucleon interaction in
the Bethe-Salpeter approach is presented. The phase shifts are fitted to recent
experimental data for singlet and uncoupled triplet partial waves of the
neutron-proton scattering with total angular momenta J=0,1. The results are
compared with other model calculations.
