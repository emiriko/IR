It is proposed in this paper that without a measurement, the wave function of
a system periodically transits to a bound energy eigenfunction or the
complementary wave function that is orthogonal to all the bound energy
eigenfunctions. Applying this assumption to analyze results of position
measurement shows that when the wave function of the entangled incident object
and a position detector is a linear combination of the bound energy
eigenfunctions of the entangled system prior to collapses, the detection rate
essentially equals the probability flux of the incident object entering the
detector. When the wave function of the entangled incident object and a
position detector is not a linear combination of the bound energy
eigenfunctions of the entangled system, results of position measurement can
also be explained by the proposed self-induced photon emission and absorption.
