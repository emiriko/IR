Precision measurements of branching fractions and CP asymmetries in
non-leptonic b -> s decays reveal certain "puzzles" when compared with Standard
Model expectations based on a global fit of the CKM triangle and general
theoretical expectations. Without reference to a particular model, we
investigate to what extent the (small) discrepancies observed in (B -> J/psi
K), (B -> phi K) and (B -> K pi) may constrain new physics in (b -> s q qbar)
operators. In particular, we compare on a quantitative level the relative
impact of different quark flavours q=c,s,u,d.
