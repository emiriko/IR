After a brief review of the muon g-2 status, we analyze the possibility that
the present discrepancy between experiment and the Standard Model (SM)
prediction may be due to hypothetical errors in the determination of the
hadronic leading-order contribution to the latter. In particular, we show how
an increase of the hadro-production cross section in low-energy e^+e^-
collisions could bridge the muon g-2 discrepancy, leading however to a decrease
on the electroweak upper bound on M_H, the SM Higgs boson mass. That bound is
currently M_H < ~ 150GeV (95%CL) based on the preliminary top quark mass M_t =
172.6(1.4)GeV and the recent determination \Delta \alpha_{\rm had}^{(5)}(M_Z) =
0.02768(22), while the direct-search lower bound is M_H > 114.4GeV (95%CL). By
means of a detailed analysis we conclude that this solution of the muon g-2
discrepancy is unlikely in view of current experimental error estimates.
However, if this turns out to be the solution, the 95%CL upper bound on M_H is
reduced to about 130GeV which, in conjunction with the experimental lower
bound, leaves a narrow window for the mass of this fundamental particle.
