We calculate the energy of a homogeneous one component plasma and find that
the energy is lower for correlated motions of the particles as compared to
uncorrelated motion. Our starting point is the conserved approximately
relativistic (Darwin) energy for a system of electromagnetically interacting
particles that arises from the neglect of radiation. For the idealized model of
a homogeneous one component plasma the energy only depends on the particle
canonical momenta and the vector potential. The vector potential is then
calculated in terms of the canonical momenta using recent theoretical advances
and the plasma Hamiltonian is obtained. The result can be understood either as
due to the energy lowering caused by the attraction of parallel currents or,
alternatively, as due to the inductive inertia associated with the flow of net
current.
