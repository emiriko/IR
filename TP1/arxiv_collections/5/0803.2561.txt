The T helper (Th) phenotypes, Th1/Th2, are acquired upon interaction of a
naive T helper cell and an antigen presenting cell (APC). Naive T helper cells
may differentiate into either phenotype, and the actual outcome is determined
by the density and avidity of the antigenic determinants presented by the APC,
and the APCs inherent costimulatory properties. Until recently it was thought
that differentiation is further affected by cytokines. In our work, We have
specified aspects of T-cell cytokine networks using B method of software
engineering. With this model, we are able to run verification with B-toolkit
and allow us to compare the dynamic behavior of the model to actual
experimental data from College of Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine. Here
we present a Wu-Hsing model of Th1-Th2 system.
