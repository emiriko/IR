The Midwest Geometry Conference 2007 was devoted to the substantial
mathematical legacy of Thomas P. Branson who passed away unexpectedly the
previous year. This contribution to the Proceedings briefly introduces this
legacy. We also take the opportunity of recording his bibliography. Thomas
Branson was on the Editorial Board of SIGMA and we are pleased that SIGMA is
able to publish the Proceedings.
