We present a quantum theory for one-dimensional spin-1/2 multiferroics, where
the vector spin chirality couples with the electric polarization. Based on
exact diagonalization and bosonization, it is shown that quantum fluctuations
appreciably reduce the chiral ordering amplitude and the associated
ferroelectric polarization. This yields nearly collinear spin correlations in
short-range scales, in qualitative agreement with recent neutron scattering
experiments. There appear gapless chirality excitations described by phasons
and new solitons, which can be experimentally verified from the low-energy
dielectric response.
