The Iwasawa main conjecture fields has been an important tool to study the
arithmetic of special values of $L$-functions of Hecke characters of imaginary
quadratic fields. To obtain the finest possible invariants it is important to
know the main conjecture for all prime numbers $p$ and also to have an
equivariant version at disposal.
  In this paper we first prove the main conjecture for imaginary quadratic
fields for all prime numbers $p$, improving earlier results by Rubin. From this
we deduce the equivariant main conjecture in the case that a certain
$\mu$-invariant vanishes. For prime numbers $p\nmid 6$ which split in $K$, this
is a theorem by a result of Gillard.
