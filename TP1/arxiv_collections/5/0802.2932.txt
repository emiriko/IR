Spreadsheets in financial markets are frequently used as database, calculator
and reporting application combined. This paper describes an alternative
approach in which spreadsheet design and database technology have been brought
together in order to alleviate management and regulatory concerns over the
operational risks of spreadsheet usage. In particular, the paper focuses on the
rapid creation and centralised deployment of statistical analytics within a
software system now in use by major investment banks, and presents a novel
technique for the manipulation in spreadsheets of high volumes of intraday
market data.
