We propose a simple technique for the generation of arbitrary-sized Dicke
states in a chain of trapped ions. The method uses global addressing of the
entire chain by two pairs of delayed but partially overlapping laser pulses to
engineer a collective adiabatic passage along a multi-ion dark state. Our
technique, which is a many-particle generalization of stimulated Raman
adiabatic passage (STIRAP), is decoherence-free with respect to spontaneous
emission and robust against moderate fluctuations in the experimental
parameters. Furthermore, because the process is very rapid, the effects of
heating are almost negligible under realistic experimental conditions. We
predict that the overall fidelity of synthesis of a Dicke state involving ten
ions sharing two excitations should approach 98% with currently achievable
experimental parameters.
