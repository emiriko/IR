A recently advanced argument against the atmospheric greenhouse effect is
refuted. A planet without an infrared absorbing atmosphere is mathematically
constrained to have an average temperature less than or equal to the effective
radiating temperature. Observed parameters for Earth prove that without
infrared absorption by the atmosphere, the average temperature of Earth's
surface would be at least 33 K lower than what is observed.
