Till the late nineties the accepted cosmological model was that of a Universe
that had originated in the Big Bang and was now decelerating under the
influence of as yet undetected dark matter, so that it would come to a halt and
eventually collapse. In 1997 however, the author had put forward a contra model
wherein the Universe was driven by dark energy, essentially the quantum zero
point field, and was accelerating with a small cosmological constant. There
were other deductions too, all in total agreement with observation. All this
got confirmation in 1998 and subsequent observations have reconfirmed the
findings.
