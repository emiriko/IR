We have studied the intensity correlations between two orthogonally linearly
polarized components of a laser field propagating through a resonant atomic
medium. These experiments have been performed in a Rubidium atomic vapor. We
observe that the correlations between the orthogonally polarized components of
the laser beam are maximal in the absence of a magnetic field. The magnitude of
the correlations depends on the applied magnetic field, and the magnitude first
decreases and then increases with increasing magnetic field. Minimal
correlations and maximal rotation angles are observed at the same magnetic
fields. The width of the correlation function is directly proportional to the
excited state lifetime and inversely proportional to the Rabi frequency of
laser field. These results can be useful for improving optical magnetometers
and for optical field or atomic spin squeezing.
