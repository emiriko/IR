In 1992 Drinfeld posed the question of finding the set theoretic solutions of
the Yang-Baxter equation. Recently, Gateva-Ivanova and Van den Bergh and
Etingof, Schedler and Soloviev have shown a group theoretical interpretation of
involutive non-degenerate solutions. Namely, there is a one-to-one
correspondence between involutive non-degenerate solutions on finite sets and
groups of $I$-type. A group $\mathcal{G}$ of $I$-type is a group isomorphic to
a subgroup of the natural semidirect product of $Fa_n$, the free abelian group
of rank $n$, by $Sym_n$, the symmetric group on $n$ letters, so that the
projection onto $Fa_n$ is a bijective map. The projection of $\mathcal{G}$ onto
$Sym_n$ we call an involutive Yang-Baxter group (IYB group). This suggests the
following strategy to attack Drinfeld's problem for involutive non-degenerate
set theoretic solutions. First classify the IYB groups and second, for a given
IYB group $G$, classify the groups of $I$-type with $G$ as associated IYB
group. It is known that every IYB group is solvable. In this paper some results
supporting the converse of this property are obtained. More precisely, we show
that some classes of groups are IYB groups. We also give a non-obvious method
to construct infinitely many groups of $I$-type (and hence infinitely many
involutive non-degenerate set theoretic solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation)
with a prescribed associated IYB group.
