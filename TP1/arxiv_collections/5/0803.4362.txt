Using the volume coupling version of the cloudy bag model, the quark-meson
coupling model is extended to study the role of pion field and the properties
of nuclear matter. The extended model includes the effect of gluon exchange as
well as the pion-cloud effect, and provides a good description of the nuclear
matter properties. The relationship between the extended model and the EFT
approach to nuclear matter is also discussed.
