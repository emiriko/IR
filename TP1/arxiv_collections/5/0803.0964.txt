The topographic structure of Giemsa banded (G-banded) early metaphase human
chromosomes adsorbed on glass was analyzed by atomic force microscope using
amplitude modulation mode [AM-AFM]. Longitudinal height measurements for early
metaphasic human chromosomes showed a central ridge that was further
characterized by transversal height measurements. The heterochromatic regions
displayed a high level of transversal symmetry, while the euchromatic ones
presented several peaks across the transversal height measurements. We suggest
that this central ridge and symmetry patterns point out a transitional
arrangement of the early metaphase chromosome and support evidence for
interchromatidal interactions prior to disjunction.
