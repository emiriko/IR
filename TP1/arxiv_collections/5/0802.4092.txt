The isothermal magnetoresistance [R($\theta$)] of [001] and [110] epitaxial
films of La$_{2 / 3}$Sr$_{1 / 3}$MnO$_{3}$ measured as a function of the angle
$\theta$ between current ($\vec{I}$) and magnetic field ($\vec{H}$), both in
the plane of the film, is measured at several temperatures between 10 and 300K.
The magnetic easy axis of these polytypes is intimately related to the
orientation of Mn - O - Mn bonds with respect to the crystallographic axis on
the plane of the substrate and energy equivalence of some of these axes. The
magnetization vector ($\vec{M}$) of the [001] and [110] type films is pinned
along the [110] and [001] directions respectively at low fields. A
magnetization orientation phase transition (MRPT) which manifests itself as a
discontinuity and hysteresis in $R(\psi)$ where $\psi$ is the angle between
$\vec{H}$ and the easy axis for the $\vec{H}$ below a critical value
$\vec{H}^*$ has been established. The boundary of the pinned and depinned phase
on the H-T plane has been established. The highly robust pinning of
magnetization seen in [110] films is related to their uniquely defined easy
axis. The isothermal resistance R$_\bot$ and R$_\|$ for $\vec{I} \bot \vec{H}$
and $\vec{I} \| \vec{H}$, respectively for both polytypes follows the
inequality R$_\bot >$ R$_\|$ for all ranges of fields ($0 \leq H \leq 3500Oe$)
and temperatures (10K - 300K). A full fledged analysis of the rotational
magnetoresistance is carried out in the framework of D\"oring theory for MR in
single crystal samples. Strong deviations from the predicted angular dependence
are seen in the irreversible regime of magnetization.
