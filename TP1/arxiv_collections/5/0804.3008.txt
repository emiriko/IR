The excessiveness of integration-by-part (IBP) identities is discussed. The
Lie-algebraic structure of the IBP identities is used to reduce the number of
the IBP equations to be considered. It is shown that Lorentz-invariance (LI)
identities do not bring any information additional to that contained in the IBP
identities, and therefore, can be discarded.
