The validity of the Luttinger sum rule is investigated within the prototype
tight-binding model of interacting fermions in one dimension, i.e., the t-V
model including the next-nearest neighbor hopping t' in order to break the
particle-hole symmetry. Scaling analysis of finite-system results at
half-filling reveals evident breakdown of the sum rule in the regime of large
gap at V >> t, while the sum rule appears to recover together with vanishing of
the Mott-Hubbard gap.
