An interpretation of an electromagnetic quantum as a single pulse is
suggested. In this context the Planck formula is shown to be equivalent to the
Heisenberg time-energy uncertainty relation. This allows to treat the photon
frequency as an inverse time of emission. Such an ansatz avoids the inherent
problems of the conventional approach.
