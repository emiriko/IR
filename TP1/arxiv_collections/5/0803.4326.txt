We consider extensions of excluded volume interactions for complex corpora
that generalize simple rod-like particles. The Onsager equation can be defined
for quite general configuration spaces, and the dimension reduction of the
phase space in the limit of highly intense interaction can be shown. The
formalism describes both freely articulated and interacting N-rods and the
example of interacting 2-rods is given in detail.
