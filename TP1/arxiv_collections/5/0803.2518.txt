We present an exact solution describing a stationary and axisymmetric object
with electromagnetic and dilaton fields. The solution generalizes the usual
Kerr-Taub-NUT (Newman-Unti-Tamburino) spacetime in general relativity and is
obtained by boosting this spacetime in the fifth dimension and performing a
Kaluza-Klein reduction to four dimensions. We also discuss the physical
parameters of this solution and calculate its gyromagnetic ratio.
