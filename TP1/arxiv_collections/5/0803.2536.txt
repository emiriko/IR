The differences between the character of the Schwarzschild and Ernst
spacetimes are illustrated by comparing the photon capture cones, and the
embedding diagrams of the $t=\mathrm{const}$ sections of the equatorial planes
of both the ordinary and optical reference geometry of these spacetimes. The
non-flat asymptotic character of the Ernst spacetime reflects itself in two
manifest facts: the escape photon cones correspond to purely outward radial
direction, and the embedding diagrams of both the ordinary and optical geometry
shrink to zero radius asymptotically. Using the properties of the embedding
diagrams, regions of these spacetimes which could have similar character are
estimated, and it is argued that they can exist for the Ernst spacetimes with a
sufficiently low strength of the magnetic field.
