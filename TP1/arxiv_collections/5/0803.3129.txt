Like orbitals in atoms and molecules, persistent currents may appear in
larger aggregates. Though classically, equilibrium magnetic moment of
non-rotating objects is forbidden, it is known that equilibrium quantum
circulating currents are allowed. Such currents were predicted to be periodic
with the external magnetic field. It is shown that in general, whenever a
periodic component is found, there must be a large aperiodic component forcing
aperiodic contribution to the equilibrium magnetic moment as a function of the
external field.
