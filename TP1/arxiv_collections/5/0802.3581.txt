The notion of lambda-symmetries, originally introduced by C. Muriel and J.L.
Romero, is extended to the case of systems of first-order ODE's (and of
dynamical systems in particular). It is shown that the existence of a symmetry
of this type produces a reduction of the differential equations, restricting
the presence of the variables involved in the problem. The results are compared
with the case of standard (i.e. exact) Lie-point symmetries and are also
illustrated by some examples.
