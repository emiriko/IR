Motivated by the observation of neutrino oscillations, we extend the Higgs
boson exempt no-scale supersymmetry model (HENS) by adding three heavy
right-handed neutrino chiral supermultiplets to generate the light neutrino
masses and mixings. The neutrino Yukawa couplings can induce new lepton flavor
violating couplings among the soft terms in the course of renormalization group
running down from the boundary scale. We study the effects this has on the
predictions for low-energy probes of lepton flavor violation(LFV). Heavy
right-handed neutrinos also provide a way to generate the baryon asymmetry
through leptogenesis. We find that consistency with LFV and leptogenesis puts
strong requirements on either the form of the Yukawa mass matrix or the
smallness of the Higgs up soft mass. In all cases, we generically expect that
new physics LFV is non-zero and can be found in a future experiment.
