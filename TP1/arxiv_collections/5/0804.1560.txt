We develop a new ab initio many-body approach capable of describing
simultaneously both bound and scattering states in light nuclei, by combining
the resonating-group method with the use of realistic interactions, and a
microscopic and consistent description of the nucleon clusters. This approach
preserves translational symmetry and Pauli principle. We present phase shifts
for neutron scattering on 3H, 4He and 10Be and proton scattering on {3,4}He,
using realistic nucleon-nucleon potentials. Our A=4 scattering results are
compared to earlier ab initio calculations. We demonstrate that a proper
treatment of the coupling to the n-10Be continuum is essential to explain the
parity-inverted ground state in 11Be.
