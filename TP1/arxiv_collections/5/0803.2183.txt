We consider the Springer fiber over a nilpotent endomorphism. Fix a Jordan
basis and consider the standard torus relative to this. We deal with the
problem to describe the flags fixed by the torus which belong to a given
component of the Springer fiber. We solve the problem in the hook, two-row and
two-column cases. We provide two main characterizations which are common to the
three cases, and which involve dominance relations between Young diagrams and
combinatorial algorithms. Then, for these three cases, we deduce topological
properties of the components and their intersections.
