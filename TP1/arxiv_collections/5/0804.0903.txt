We consider the long-time behavior of small amplitude solutions of the
semilinear wave equation $\Box \phi =\phi^p$ in odd $d\geq 5$ spatial
dimensions. We show that for the quadratic nonlinearity ($p=2$) the tail has an
anomalously small amplitude and fast decay. The extension of the results to
more general nonlinearities involving first derivatives is also discussed.
