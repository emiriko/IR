We formulate a theory of current-induced spin torques in inhomogeneous III-V
ferromagnetic semiconductors. The carrier spin-3/2 and large spin-orbit
interaction, leading to spin non-conservation, introduce significant conceptual
differences from spin torques in ferromagnetic metals. We determine the spin
density in an electric field in the weak momentum scattering regime,
demonstrating that the torque on the magnetization is intimately related to
spin precession under the action of both the spin-orbit interaction and the
exchange field characteristic of ferromagnetism. The spin polarization excited
by the electric field is smaller than in ferromagnetic metals and, due to lack
of angular momentum conservation, cannot be expressed in a simple closed
vectorial form. Remarkably, scalar and spin-dependent scattering do not affect
the result. We use our results to estimate the velocity of current-driven
domain walls.
