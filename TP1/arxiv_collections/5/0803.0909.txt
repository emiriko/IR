In this thesis, attention is paid to small experimental testbed applications
with respect to the quantum phase estimation algorithm, the core approach for
finding energy eigenvalues. An iterative scheme for quantum phase estimation
(IPEA) is derived from the Kitaev phase estimation, a study of robustness of
the IPEA utilized as a few-qubit testbed application is performed, and an
improved protocol for phase reference alignment is presented. Additionally, a
short overview of quantum cryptography is given, with a particular focus on
quantum steganography and authentication.
