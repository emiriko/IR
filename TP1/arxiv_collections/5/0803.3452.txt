We consider quantum decoherence in solid-state systems by studying the
transverse dynamics of a single qubit interacting with a fermionic bath and
driven by external pulses. Our interest is in investigating the extent to which
the lost coherence can be restored by the application of external pulses to the
qubit. We show that the qubit evolution under various pulse sequences can be
mapped onto Keldysh path integrals. This approach allows a simple diagrammatic
treatment of different bath excitation processes contributing to qubit
decoherence. We apply this theory to the evolution of the qubit coupled to the
Andreev fluctuator bath in the context of widely studied superconducting
qubits. We show that charge fluctuations within the Andreev-fluctuator model
lead to a 1/f noise spectrum with a characteristic temperature depedence. We
discuss the strategy for suppression of decoherence by the application of
higher-order (beyond spin echo) pulse sequences.
