We give an explicit expression for the geometric measure of entanglement for
three qubit states that are linear combinations of four orthogonal product
states. It turns out that the geometric measure for these states has three
different expressions depending on the range of definition in parameter space.
Each expression of the measure has its own geometrically meaningful
interpretation. Such an interpretation allows oneself to take one step toward a
complete understanding for the general properties of the entanglement measure.
The states that lie on joint surfaces separating different ranges of
definition, designated as shared states, seem to have particularly interesting
features. The properties of the shared states are fully discussed.
