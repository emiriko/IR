Leptogenesis is a class of scenarios where the baryon asymmetry of the
Universe is produced from a lepton asymmetry generated in the decays of a heavy
sterile neutrino. We explain the motivation for leptogenesis. We review the
basic mechanism, and describe subclasses of models. We then focus on recent
developments in the understanding of leptogenesis: finite temperature effects,
spectator processes, and in particular the significance of flavor physics.
