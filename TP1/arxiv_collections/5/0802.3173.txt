A scheme for fast, compact, and controllable acceleration of heavy particles
in vacuum is proposed, in which two counterpropagating lasers with variable
frequencies drive a beat-wave structure with variable phase velocity, thus
allowing for trapping and acceleration of heavy particles, such as ions or
muons. Fine control over the energy distribution and the total charge of the
beam is obtained via tuning of the frequency variation. The acceleration scheme
is described with a one-dimensional theory, providing the general conditions
for trapping and scaling laws for the relevant features of the particle beam.
Two-dimensional, electromagnetic particle-in-cell simulations confirm the
validity and the robustness of the physical mechanism.
