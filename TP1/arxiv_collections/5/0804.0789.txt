The AdS/CFT correspondence has been tested through the reproduction of
standard results. Following this approach, we use the correspondence to obtain
the Hawking temperature of a black hole in 1+1 dimensions. Using an auxiliary
Liouville field, the holographic energy-momentum tensor is found and compared
with a radiation energy-momentum tensor, verifying that the correspondence
gives the correct temperature. The information about the radiated field in the
CFT sector is contained in the central charge, whereas in the radiation tensor
this information is in the statistical distribution. This result allows to
determine the radiation of scalar and Dirac fields easily and without the
necessity of solving the corresponding Klein-Gordon or Dirac equation in a
curved spacetime. In both cases, the correct temperature was obtained.
