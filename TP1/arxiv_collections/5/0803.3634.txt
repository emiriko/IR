For more than a century Liesegang patterns -- self-organized, quasi-periodic
structures occurring in diffusion-limited chemical reactions with two
components -- have been attracting scientists. The pattern formation can be
described by four basic empirical laws. In addition to many experiments,
several models have been devised to understand the formation of the bands and
rings. Here we review the most important models and complement them with
detailed three-dimensional lattice-gas simulations. We show how the mean-field
predictions can be reconciled with experimental data by a redefinition of the
distances suggested by our lattice-gas simulations.
