We numerically study the system of rapidly rotating Bose atoms at the filling
factor (ratio of particle number to vortex number) $\nu=1$ with the dipolar
interaction. A moderate dipolar interaction stabilizes the incompressible
quantum liquid at $\nu=1$. Further addition induces a collapse of it. The state
after the collapse is a compressible state which has phases with stripes and
bubbles.
  There are two types of bubbles with a different array. We also investigate
models constructed from truncated interactions and the models with the
three-body contact interaction. They also have phases with stripes and bubbles.
