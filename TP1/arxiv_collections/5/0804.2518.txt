The quantum field theory of gravitation is constructed in terms of Lagrangian
density of Dirac fields which couple to the electromagnetic field $A_\mu$ as
well as the gravitational field $\cal G$. The gravity appears in the mass term
as $ m(1+g {\cal G}) \bar{\psi}\psi $ with the coupling constant of $g$. In
addition to the gravitational force between fermions, the electromagnetic field
$A_\mu$ interacts with the gravity as the fourth order effects and its strength
amounts to $\alpha$ times the gravitational force. Therefore, the interaction
of photon with gravity is not originated from Einstein's general relativity
which is entirely dependent on the unphysical assumption of the principle of
equivalence. Further, we present a renormalization scheme for the gravity and
show that the graviton stays massless.
