We examine the impact of a complex absorbing potential on electron transport,
both in the continuum and on a lattice. This requires the use of non-Hermitian
Hamiltonians; the required formalism is briefly outlined. The lattice
formulation allows us to study the interesting problem of an electron
interacting with a stationary spin, and the subsequent time evolution of the
electron and spin properties as the electron is absorbed after the initial
interaction. Remarkably, the properties of the localized spin are affected
'at-a-distance' by the interaction of the (now entangled) electron with a
complex potential.
