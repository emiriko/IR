Cardassian models are an alternative to general relativity which have been
proposed as an approach to explaining accelerated cosmic expansion while
avoiding directly introducing dark energy. They are generally formulated only
in the homogeneous and isotropic case. In this paper an extension of the usual
formulation to general spatially homogeneous geometries is given. A
characteristic feature of many classes of Cardassian models is the occurrence
of big rip singularities where the scale factor tends to infinity after a
finite time. It is shown that big rip singularities are also widespread in more
general homogeneous cases. It is also shown that there is isotropization in the
approach to a big rip singularity which bears a strong resemblance to the
late-time isotropization observed in cosmological spacetimes which accelerate
forever in the future.
