We present a combined study of the thermal expansion and the thermal
conductivity of the perovskite series RCoO_3 with R = La, Nd, Pr and Eu. The
well-known spin-state transition in LaCoO_3 is strongly affected by the
exchange of the R ions due to their different ionic radii, i.e. chemical
pressure. This can be monitored in detail by measurements of the thermal
expansion, which is a highly sensitive probe for detecting spin-state
transitions. The Co ions in the higher spin state act as additional scattering
centers for phonons, therefore suppressing the phonon thermal conductivity.
Based on the analysis of the interplay between spin-state transition and heat
transport, we present a quantitative model of the thermal conductivity for the
entire series. In PrCoO_3, an additional scattering effect is active at low
temperatures. This effect arises from the crystal field splitting of the 4f
multiplet, which allows for resonant scattering of phonons between the various
4f levels.
