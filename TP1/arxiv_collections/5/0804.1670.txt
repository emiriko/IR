The Portevin-Le Chatelier(PLC) effect has been investigated by deforming
Al-2.5%Mg alloy in the strain rate regime where simultaneously two types (type
B and type A) of serrations appear in the stress strain curve. Our analysis
reveal that in this strain rate regime the entire PLC dynamics for a particular
strain rate experiment is governed by a single band which changes its character
during the deformation.
