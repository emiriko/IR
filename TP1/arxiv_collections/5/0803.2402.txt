This paper discusses a simple theoretical throw model for frontal
vehicle-pedestrian collisions. The model is based on the simple assumption that
pedestrian movement after impact can be approximated by movement of a mass
point. Two methods of reconstruction of vehicle-pedestrian collision are
discussed: one knowing only the throw distance and the other when also impact
to ground contact distance is known. The model is verified by field data
available in the literature and by comportment with full scale numerical
simulation.
