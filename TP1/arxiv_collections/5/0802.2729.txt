This paper reports the observations of long-time relaxation, aging, and
temperature memory behaviors of resistance and magnetization in the
ferromagnetic state of a polycrystalline La0.7Ca0.3Mn0.925Ti0.075O3 compound.
The observed glassy dynamics of the electrical transport appears to be
magnetically originated and has a very close association with the magnetic
glassiness of the sample. Phase separation and strong correlation between
magnetic interactions and electronic conduction play the essential roles in
producing such a resistive glassiness. We explain the observed effects in terms
of a coexistence of two competing thermomagnetic processes, domain growth and
magnetic freezing, and propose that hole-doped perovskite manganites can be
considered as "resistive glasses".
