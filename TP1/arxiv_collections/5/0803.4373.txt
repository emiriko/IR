We study the quantum moment problem: Given a conditional probability
distribution together with some polynomial constraints, does there exist a
quantum state rho and a collection of measurement operators such that (i) the
probability of obtaining a particular outcome when a particular measurement is
performed on rho is specified by the conditional probability distribution, and
(ii) the measurement operators satisfy the constraints. For example, the
constraints might specify that some measurement operators must commute.
  We show that if an instance of the quantum moment problem is unsatisfiable,
then there exists a certificate of a particular form proving this. Our proof is
based on a recent result in algebraic geometry, the noncommutative
Positivstellensatz of Helton and McCullough [Trans. Amer. Math. Soc.,
356(9):3721, 2004].
  A special case of the quantum moment problem is to compute the value of
one-round multi-prover games with entangled provers. Under the conjecture that
the provers need only share states in finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, we
prove that a hierarchy of semidefinite programs similar to the one given by
Navascues, Pironio and Acin [Phys. Rev. Lett., 98:010401, 2007] converges to
the entangled value of the game. It follows that the class of languages
recognized by a multi-prover interactive proof system where the provers share
entanglement is recursive.
