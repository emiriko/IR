Electromigrated nanoscale junctions have proven very useful for studying
electronic transport at the single-molecule scale. However, confirming that
conduction is through precisely the molecule of interest and not some
contaminant or metal nanoparticle has remained a persistent challenge,
typically requiring a statistical analysis of many devices. We review how
transport mechanisms in both purely electronic and optical measurements can be
used to infer information about the nanoscale junction configuration. The
electronic response to optical excitation is particularly revealing. We briefly
discuss surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy on such junctions, and present new
results showing that currents due to optical rectification can provide a means
of estimating the local electric field at the junction due to illumination.
