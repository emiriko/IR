We show that a version of the nearly Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model
(nMSSM), extended only in the singlet sector to include the additional
superfields of right-handed neutrinos and very heavy Dirac particles conserving
$B-L$, admits a viable scenario for Dirac leptogenesis and naturally small
Dirac neutrino masses. The origin of the ($B-L$)-conserving high singlet
neutrino scale and the desired supersymmetry breaking terms is associated with
dynamical supersymmetry breaking in the hidden sector.
