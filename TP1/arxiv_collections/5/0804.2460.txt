We have studied the competition and coexistence of staggered triplet SC with
d-wave singlet SC and SDW in the mean-field approximation. Detailed numerical
studies demonstrate that particle-hole asymmetry mixes these states and
therefore they are simultaneously present. Even more interesting were the
results of our study of the influence of a uniform magnetic field. We observe
novel transitions that show the characteristics of Fulde-Ferrel phases, yet
they concern transitions to different combinations of the above orders. For
example, above a given field, in a particle-hole symmetric system we observe a
transition from d-wave singlet SC to a state in which d-wave singlet SC
coexists with staggered triplet SC and SDW. We believe our results may provide,
among others, a direct explanation to recent puzzles about the Fulde Ferrel
like states that are apparently observed in CeCoIn5.
