A technique for determining the permeability of a phospholipid membrane on a
single giant unilamellar vesicle (GUV) is described, which complements the
existing methods utilizing either a planar black lipid membrane or
sub-micrometre-sized liposomes. A single GUV is transferred using a
micropipette from a solution of a nonpermeable solute into an iso-osmolar
solution of a solute with a higher membrane permeability. Osmotical swelling of
the vesicle is monitored with a CCD camera mounted on a phase contrast
microscope, and a sequence of images is obtained. On each image, the points on
the vesicle contour are determined using Sobel filtering with adaptive
binarization threshold, and from these, the vesicle radius is calculated with a
great accuracy. From the time-dependence of the vesicle radius, the membrane
permeability is obtained. Using a test set of data, the method provided a
consistent estimate of the POPC membrane permeability for glycerol, P = 1.7 x
10^-8 m/s, with individual samples ranging from 1.61 x 10^-8 m/s to 1.98 x
10^-8 m/s. This value is ~40% lower than the one obtained on similar systems.
Possible causes for this discrepancy are discussed.
