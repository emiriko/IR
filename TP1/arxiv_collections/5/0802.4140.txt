We introduce several possible generalizations of tomography for quadratic
surfaces. We analyze different types of elliptic, hyperbolic and hybrid
tomograms. In all cases it is possible to consistently define the inverse
tomographic map. We find two different ways of introducing tomographic
sections. The first method operates by deformations of the standard Radon
transform. The second method proceeds by shifting a given quadric pattern. The
most general tomographic transformation can be defined in terms of marginals
over surfaces generated by deformations of complete families of hyperplanes or
quadrics. We discuss practical and conceptual perspectives and possible
applications.
