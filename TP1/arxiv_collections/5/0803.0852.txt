We study the surprising discrepancy between the number of primes
corresponding, respectively, to the two letters of an infinite word engendered
by one of the simplest Lindenmayer systems. We formulate a conjecture
concerning the rate of growth of this discrepancy, which seems to tend to e for
every two sufficiently high consecutive even rank iterates of the Lindenmayer
system.
