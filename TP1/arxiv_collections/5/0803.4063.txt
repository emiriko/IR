The car-following behavior of individual drivers in real city traffic is
studied on the basis of (publicly available) trajectory datasets recorded by a
vehicle equipped with an radar sensor. By means of a nonlinear optimization
procedure based on a genetic algorithm, we calibrate the Intelligent Driver
Model and the Velocity Difference Model by minimizing the deviations between
the observed driving dynamics and the simulated trajectory when following the
same leading vehicle. The reliability and robustness of the nonlinear fits are
assessed by applying different optimization criteria, i.e., different measures
for the deviations between two trajectories. The obtained errors are in the
range between~11% and~29% which is consistent with typical error ranges
obtained in previous studies. In addition, we found that the calibrated
parameter values of the Velocity Difference Model strongly depend on the
optimization criterion, while the Intelligent Driver Model is more robust in
this respect. By applying an explicit delay to the model input, we investigated
the influence of a reaction time. Remarkably, we found a negligible influence
of the reaction time indicating that drivers compensate for their reaction time
by anticipation. Furthermore, the parameter sets calibrated to a certain
trajectory are applied to the other trajectories allowing for model validation.
The results indicate that ``intra-driver variability'' rather than
``inter-driver variability'' accounts for a large part of the calibration
errors. The results are used to suggest some criteria towards a benchmarking of
car-following models.
