Using x-ray resonant magnetic scattering and x-ray magnetic circular
dichroism, techniques that are element specific, we have elucidated the role of
Ho3+ in multiferroic HoMnO3. In zero field, Ho3+ orders antiferromagnetically
with moments aligned along the hexagonal c direction below 40 K, and undergoes
a transition to another magnetic structure below 4.5 K. In applied electric
fields of up to 1x10^7 V/m, the magnetic structure of Ho3+ remains unchanged.
