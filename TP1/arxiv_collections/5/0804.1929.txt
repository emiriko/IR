Inelastic neutron scattering measurements were performed on single crystal
Co3V2O8 wherein magnetic cobalt ions reside on distinct spine and cross-tie
sites within kagome staircase planes. This system displays a rich magnetic
phase diagram which culminates in a ferromagnetic ground state below Tc~6 K. We
have studied the low-lying magnetic excitations in this phase within the kagome
plane. Despite the complexity of the system at higher temperatures, linear
spin-wave theory describes most of the quantitative detail of the inelastic
neutron measurements. Our results show two spin-wave branches, the higher
energy of which displays finite spin-wave lifetimes well below Tc, and
negligible magnetic exchange coupling between Co moments on the spine sites.
