Analyzing spin transport of quasi-2D electrons gas moving through a
semiconductor wave guide subject to a sectionally homogeneous tilted magnetic
field, we found well-defined selection rules for resonant and antiresonant spin
carrier transmission. Based on these selection rules and the band shift induced
by the magnetic field strength and the tilting angles, we propose an efficient
spin inversion device. For a polarized incoming electron beam, we can determine
from our theoretical approach, physical conditions for spin-inversion
efficiency up to 80%. We visualize this mechanism in terms of conductance and
the spacial behavior of the wave function amplitude along the superlattice.
