Lead has been deposited on the ten-fold surface of decagonal Al72Ni11Co17 to
form an epitaxial quasicrystalline single-element monolayer. The overlayer
grows through nucleation of nanometer-sized irregular islands and the coverage
saturates at 1 ML. The overlayer is well-ordered quasiperiodically as evidenced
by LEED and Fourier transforms of STM images. Annealing the film to 600 K
improves the structural quality, but causes the evaporation of some material
such that the film develops pores. Electronic structure measurements using
X-ray photoemission spectroscopy indicate that the chemical interaction of the
Pb atoms with the substrate is weak.
