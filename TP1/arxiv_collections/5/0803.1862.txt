In this paper we consider human factors and their impact on spreadsheet
development in strategic decision-making. This paper brings forward research
from many disciplines both directly related to spreadsheets and a broader
spectrum from psychology to industrial processing. We investigate how human
factors affect a simplified development cycle and what the potential
consequences are.
