We investigate the relevance of the meson loops in the $f_0(1710)$ scalar
meson decay into one photon and one vector meson, ($\rho$, $\omega$ and
$\phi$). In particular we estimate the size of the loops coming from the decay
of the $f_0(1710)$ into two pseudoscalar mesons, containing three pseudoscalar
mesons in the loop or two pseudoscalar and one vector meson. The results,
despite having large uncertainties, manifest that the contribution of the meson
loops to these radiative decays is quite relevant and should be taken into
account by the theoretical calculations which use this observables as a test of
the possible glueball nature of this resonance.
