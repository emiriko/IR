For a light scalar coupled to gravity, I study the gravitational backreaction
associated with large field variations. I show a generic obstruction in
sourcing a super-Planckian scalar profile without making the whole experiment
collapse into a black hole. In empty space the scalar variation obeys an
absolute bound, of order of the Planck scale. A Newtonian analysis suggests
that inside its sources the scalar can undergo arbitrarily large variations
without causing large gravitational backreactions. However the maximum
attainable \Delta \phi increases only logarithmically with the size of the
source. The bound straightforwardly generalizes to any number of dimensions,
and to moduli space-like cases, where it applies to the invariant length in
field space as measured by the kinetic metric.
