We describe the first observations on the time-dependent dissipation when the
drive level of a torsional oscillator containing solid He-4 is abruptly
changed. The relaxation of dissipation in solid He-4 shows rich dynamical
behavior including exponential and logarithmic time-dependent decays,
hysteresis, and memory effects.
