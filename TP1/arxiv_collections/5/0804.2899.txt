We investigate the utility of cosmological and astrophysical observations for
distinguishing between supersymmetric theories. In particular we consider 276
pairs of models that give rise to nearly identical patterns of observables at
hadron colliders. Despite inherent uncertainties in such things as the local
halo density model, or background rates from astrophysical sources, we find
observations associated with stable relic neutralinos can be a surprisingly
effective discriminant between candidate theories. We focus attention on
neutralino scattering experiments (direct detection of relic neutralinos) and
observations of gamma-rays from relic neutralino annihilation (indirect
detection experiments). With extremely conservative physics assumptions and
background estimates we find 101 of the 276 degenerate pairs can be
distinguished. Using slightly more optimistic assumptions about background
rates increases this number to 186 of the 276 pairs. In the direct detection
arena the ability to distinguish between models will be dependent on further
progress in addressing uncertainty in nuclear matrix elements. For observations
in the indirect detection arena we discuss the sensitivity of these results to
additional assumptions made about the cosmological density of neutralinos and
the galactic halo profile. We also comment on the complementarity of this study
to recent work investigating these same pairs at a 500 GeV linear collider.
