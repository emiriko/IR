Transport studies of a bent quantum Hall junction at integer filling factors
show strongly insulating states at higher fields. In this paper we analyze the
strongly insulating behavior as a function of temperature T and dc bias V, in
order to classify the localization mechanisms responsible for the insulating
state. The temperature dependence suggests a crossover from activated
nearest-neighbor hopping at higher T to variable-range hopping conduction at
lower T. The base temperature electric field dependence is consistent with 1D
variable-range hopping conduction. We observe almost identical behavior at
filling factors 1 and 2, and discuss how the bent quantum Hall junction
conductance appears to be independent of the bulk spin state. Various models of
1D variable-range hopping which either include or ignore interactions are
compared, all of which are consistent with the basic model of disorder coupled
counter-propagating quantum Hall edges.
