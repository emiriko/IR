We shortly summarize the present status of neutrino magnetic moment studies
(theory and experiment). Then we discuss the quasiclassical treatment of
neutrino spin evolution in matter. After that we come to the quantum approach
to description of neutrino and electron motion in matter on the basis of the
quantum wave equations exact solutions method with special focus on spin
effects.
