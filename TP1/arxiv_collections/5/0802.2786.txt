Within the framework of the Helfrich elastic theory of membranes and of
differential geometry we study the possible instabilities of spherical vesicles
towards double bubbles. We find that not only temperature, but also magnetic
fields can induce topological transformations between spherical vesicles and
double bubbles and provide a phase diagram for the equilibrium shapes.
