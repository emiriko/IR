We study the proximity effect in superconductor-ferromagnet (SF) structure
with a narrow domain wall (DW) at the SF interface. The width of the domain
wall is assumed to be larger than the Fermi wave length, but smaller than other
characteristic lengths (for example, the ''magnetic'' length). The transmission
coefficient is supposed to be small so that we deal with a weak proximity
effect. Solving the linearized Eilenberger equation, we find analytical
expressions for quasiclassical Green's functions. These functions describe the
short-range (SR) condensate components, singlet and triplet with zero
projection of the total spin on the quantization z-axis, induced in F due to
the proximity effect as well as long-range odd triplet component (LRTC) with a
nonzero projection of the total spin of Cooper pairs on the $z$% -axis. The
amplitude of the LRTC essentially depends on the product $h\tau $ and increases
with increasing the exchange energy $h$ ($\tau $ is the elastic scattering
time). We calculate the Josephson current in SFS junction with a thickness of
the F layer much greater than the penetration length of the SR components. The
Josephson critical current caused by the LRTC may be both positive and negative
depending on chirality of the magnetic structure in F.
  The density of states (DOS) in a diffusive SF bilayer is also analyzed. It is
shown that the contributions of the SR and LR components to the DOS in F have a
different dependence on the thickness $d$ of the F layer (nonmonotonous and
monotonous).
