Calculations are carried out for the scattering of heavy rare gas atoms with
surfaces using a recently developed classical theory that can track particles
trapped in the physisorption potential well and follow them until ultimate
desorption. Comparisons are made with recent experimental data for xenon
scattering from molten gallium and indium, systems for which the rare gas is
heavier than the surface atoms. The good agreement with the data obtained for
both time-of-flight energy-resolved spectra and for total scattered angular
distributions yields an estimate of the physisorption well depths for the two
systems.
