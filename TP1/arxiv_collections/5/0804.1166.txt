The dielectric properties of metallic nanoclusters in the presence of an
applied electromagnetic field are investigated using non-local linear response
theory. In the quantum limit we find a non-trivial dependence of the induced
field and charge distribution on the spatial separation between the clusters
and on the frequency of the driving field. Using a genetic algorithm, these
quantum functionalities are exploited to custom-design sub-wavelength lenses
with a frequency controlled switching capability.
