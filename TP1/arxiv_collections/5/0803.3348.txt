This letter reports two moment extensions of the entropy of a distribution.
By understanding the traditional entropy as the average of the original
distribution up to a random variable transformation, the traditional moments
equation become immediately applicable to entropy. We also suggest an
alternative family of entropy moments. The discriminative potential of such
entropy moment extensions is illustrated with respect to different types of
distributions with otherwise undistinguishable traditional entropies.
