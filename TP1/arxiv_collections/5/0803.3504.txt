Sensitivity indices when the inputs of a model are not independent are
estimated by local polynomial techniques. Two original estimators based on
local polynomial smoothers are proposed. Both have good theoretical properties
which are exhibited and also illustrated through analytical examples. They are
used to carry out a sensitivity analysis on a real case of a kinetic model with
correlated parameters.
