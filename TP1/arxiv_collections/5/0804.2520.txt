A stirring device consisting of a periodic motion of rods induces a mapping
of the fluid domain to itself, which can be regarded as a homeomorphism of a
punctured surface. Having the rods undergo a topologically-complex motion
guarantees at least a minimum amount of stretching of material lines, which is
important for chaotic mixing. We use topological considerations to describe the
nature of the injection of unmixed material into a central mixing region, which
takes place at injection cusps. A topological index formula allow us to predict
the possible types of unstable foliations that can arise for a fixed number of
rods.
