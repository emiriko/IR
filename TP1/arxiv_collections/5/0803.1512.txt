A new protocol, quantum energy distribution (QED), is proposed in which
multiple parties can simultaneously extract positive energy from spin chains by
common secret keys shared by an energy supplier. QED is robust against
impersonation; an adversary, who does not have a common secret key and attempts
to get energy, will instead give energy to the spin chains. The total amount of
energy transfer gives a lower bound of the residual energy of any local cooling
process by the energy supplier.
