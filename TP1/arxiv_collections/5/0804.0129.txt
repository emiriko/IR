After proving a general no-cloning theorem for black boxes, we derive the
optimal universal cloning of unitary transformations, from one to two copies.
The optimal cloner is realized by quantum channels with memory, and greately
outperforms the optimal measure-and-reprepare cloning strategy. Applications
are outlined, including two-way quantum cryptographic protocols.
