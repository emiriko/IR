We consider the analogue of the 4th Appelrot class of motions of the
Kowalevski top for the case of two constant force fields. The trajectories of
this family fill the four-dimensional surface O^4 in the six-dimensional phase
space. The constants of three first integrals in involution restricted to this
surface fill one of the sheets of the bifurcation diagram in R^3. We point out
the pair of partial integrals to obtain the explicit parametric equations of
this sheet. The induced system on O^4 is shown to be Hamiltonian with two
degrees of freedom having the thin set of points where the induced symplectic
structure degenerates. The region of existence of motions in terms of the
integral constants is found. We provide the separation of variables on O^4 and
the algebraic formulae for the initial phase variables.
