We investigate various classes of Gauge Mediated Supersymmetry Breaking
models and show that the Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model can
solve the mu-problem in a phenomenologically acceptable way. These models
include scenarios with singlet tadpole terms, which are phenomenologically
viable, e.g., in the presence of a small Yukawa coupling <~ 10^{-5}. Scenarios
with suppressed trilinear A-terms at the messenger scale lead naturally to
light CP-odd scalars, which play the r\^ole of pseudo R-axions. A wide range of
parameters of such models satisfies LEP constraints, with CP-even Higgs scalars
below 114 GeV decaying dominantly into a pair of CP-odd scalars.
