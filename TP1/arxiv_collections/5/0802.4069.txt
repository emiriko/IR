In a previous paper [J. Chem. Phys. 121 4501 (2004)] a unique bipolar
decomposition, Psi = Psi1 + Psi2 was presented for stationary bound states Psi
of the one-dimensional Schroedinger equation, such that the components Psi1 and
Psi2 approach their semiclassical WKB analogs in the large action limit.
Moreover, by applying the Madelung-Bohm ansatz to the components rather than to
Psi itself, the resultant bipolar Bohmian mechanical formulation satisfies the
correspondence principle. As a result, the bipolar quantum trajectories are
classical-like and well-behaved, even when Psi has many nodes, or is wildly
oscillatory. In this paper, the previous decomposition scheme is modified in
order to achieve the same desirable properties for stationary scattering
states. Discontinuous potential systems are considered (hard wall, step, square
barrier/well), for which the bipolar quantum potential is found to be zero
everywhere, except at the discontinuities. This approach leads to an exact
numerical method for computing stationary scattering states of any desired
boundary conditions, and reflection and transmission probabilities. The
continuous potential case will be considered in a future publication.
