Molecular fingerprinting through absorption spectroscopy is a powerful
analytical method. Wide spectral ranges are explored with Doppler-limited
resolution. Fast data acquisition, accurate measurements of frequency,
intensity, and line shape; time-resolved, selective spectra are achieved with
excellent sensitivities. However, presently spectrometers are unable to provide
all these features at once.
