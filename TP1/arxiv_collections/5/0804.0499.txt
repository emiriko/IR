A network's topology information can be given as an adjacency matrix. The
bitmap of sorted adjacency matrix(BOSAM) is a network visualisation tool which
can emphasise different network structures by just looking at reordered
adjacent matrixes. A BOSAM picture resembles the shape of a flower and is
characterised by a series of 'leaves'. Here we show and mathematically prove
that for most networks, there is a self-similar relation between the envelope
of the BOSAM leaves. This self-similar property allows us to use a single
envelope to predict all other envelopes and therefore reconstruct the outline
of a network's BOSAM picture. We analogise the BOSAM envelope to human's
fingerprint as they share a number of common features, e.g. both are simple,
easy to obtain, and strongly characteristic encoding essential information for
identification.
