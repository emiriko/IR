This paper concerns the experimental validation of some mathematical models
previously developed by the authors, to predict the static behaviour of
microelectrostatic actuators, basically free-clamped microbeams. This layout is
currently used in RF-MEMS design operation or even in material testing at
microscale. The analysis investigates preliminarily the static behaviour of a
set of microcantilevers bending in-plane. This investigation is aimed to
distinguish the geometrical linear behaviour, exhibited under small
displacement assumption, from the geometrical nonlinearity, caused by large
deflection. The applied electromechanical force, which nonlinearly depends on
displacement, charge and voltage, is predicted by a coupled-field approach,
based on numerical methods and herewith experimentally validated, by means of a
Fogale Zoomsurf 3D. Model performance is evaluated on pull-in prediction and on
the curve displacement vs. voltage. In fact, FEM nonlinear solution performed
by a coupled-field approach, available on commercial codes, and by a FEM
non-incremental approach are compared with linear solution, for different
values of the design parameters.
