Electron pairing and ferromagnetism in various cluster geometries are studied
with emphasis on tetrahedron and square pyramid under variation of interaction
strength, electron doping and temperature. These exact calculations of charge
and spin collective excitations and pseudogaps yield intriguing insights into
level crossing degeneracies, phase separation and condensation. Criteria for
spin-charge separation and reconciliation driven by interaction strength, next
nearest coupling and temperature are found. Phase diagrams resemble a number of
inhomogeneous, coherent and incoherent nanoscale phases seen recently in high
T$_c$ cuprates, manganites and CMR nanomaterials.
