In this work we study the asymptotic behavior of solutions of the
incompressible two-dimensional Euler equations in the exterior of a single
smooth obstacle when the obstacle becomes very thin tending to a curve. We
extend results by Iftimie, Lopes Filho and Nussenzveig Lopes, obtained in the
context of an obstacle tending to a point, see [Comm. PDE, {\bf 28} (2003),
349-379].
