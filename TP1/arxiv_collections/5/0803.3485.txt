In this paper various properties of global and local changes of variables as
well as properties of canonical transforms are investigated on modulation and
Wiener amalgam spaces. We establish several relations among localisations of
modulation and Wiener amalgam spaces and, as a consequence, we obtain several
versions of local and global Beurling-Helson type theorems. We also establish a
number of positive results such as local boundedness of canonical transforms on
modulation spaces, properties of homogeneous changes of variables, and local
continuity of Fourier integral operators on Fourier Lebesgue spaces. Finally,
counterparts of these results are discussed for spaces on the torus as well as
for weighted spaces.
