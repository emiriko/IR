We demonstrate experimentally the delay of squeezed light and entanglement
using Electromagnetically Induced Transparency (EIT) in a rubidium vapour cell.
We perform quadrature amplitude measurements of the probe field and find no
appreciable excess noise from the EIT process. From an input squeezing of 3.1
dB at low sideband frequencies, we observed the survival of 2 dB of squeezing
at the EIT output. By splitting the squeezed light on a beam-splitter, we
generated biased entanglement between two beams. We transmit one of the
entangled beams through the EIT cell and correlate the quantum statistics of
this beam with its entangled counterpart. We experimentally observed a 2 $\mu$s
delay of the biased entanglement and obtained a preserved degree of
wavefunction inseparability of 0.71, below the unity value for separable
states.
