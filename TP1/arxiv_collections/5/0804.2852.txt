Although the gulf between the theory and practice in Information Systems is
much lamented, few researchers have offered a way forward except through a
number of (failed) attempts to develop a single systematic theory for
Information Systems. In this paper, we encourage researchers to re-examine the
practical consequences of their theoretical arguments. By examining these
arguments we may be able to form a number of more rigorous theories of
Information Systems, allowing us to draw theory and practice together without
undertaking yet another attempt at the holy grail of a single unified
systematic theory of Information Systems.
