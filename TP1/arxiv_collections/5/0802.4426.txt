The occurrence of non-adiabatic effects in the vibrational properties of
metals have been predicted since the 60's, but hardly confirmed experimentally.
We report the first fully \emph{ab initio} calculations of non-adiabatic
frequencies of a number of layer and conventional metals. We suggest that
non-adiabatic effects can be a feature of the vibrational Raman spectra of any
bulk metal, and show that they are spectacularly large (up to 30% of the phonon
frequencies) in the case of layer metals, such as superconducting $MgB_2$,
$CaC_6$ and other graphite intercalated compounds. We develop a framework
capable to estimate the electron momentum-relaxation time of a given system,
and thus its degree of non-adiabaticity, in terms of the experimentally
observed frequencies and linewidths.
