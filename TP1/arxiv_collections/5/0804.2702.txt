A simple relaxation function I(t/tauzero; alpha, beta) unifying the stretched
exponential with the compressed hyperbola is obtained, and its properties
studied. The scaling parameter tauzero has dimensions of time, whereas the
shape-determining parameters alpha and beta are dimensionless, both taking
values between 0 and 1. For short times, the relaxation function is always
exponential, with time constant tauzero. For small values of alpha, the
function is close to exponential for all times, irrespective of beta. The
function is also close to an exponential when beta is near unity, irrespective
of alpha. For large values of alpha and long times, the function is close to a
stretched exponential, provided that beta>0. The compressed hyperbola is
recovered for beta=0.
