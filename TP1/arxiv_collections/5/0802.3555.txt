The paper presents the description of the structure of the nearest field of
the internal gravity waves at the critical modes of their excitation. Studied
are the exact solutions both for the elevation component and the vertical
component of the speed describing the structure of the wave field in the direct
vicinity of the source. At that the single mode of the elevation is expressed
through the full elliptic integral of the first order, and the single mode of
the vertical speed - through McDonald function and the logarithmic functions.
As the result of the study it was possible to obtain expressions for the full
field representing the sum of the wave modes and expressed through the
derivatives of the gamma function. The obtained asymptotic and exact
representations of the solution allow to describe the critical modes of
generation of the internal gravity waves near to the sources of excitations -
for the wide ranges of the sources movement velocity .
