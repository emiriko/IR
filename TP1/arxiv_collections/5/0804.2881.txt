The response of bright and dark solitons to rapid variations in an expulsive
longitudinal trap is investigated. We concentrate on the effect of transient
changes in the trap frequency in the form of temporal delta kicks and the
hyperbolic cotangent functions. Exact expressions are obtained for the soliton
profiles. This is accomplished using the fact that a suitable linear
Schrodinger stationary state solution in time can be effectively combined with
the solutions of non-linear Schrodinger equation, for obtaining solutions of
the Gross-Pitaevskii equation with time dependent scattering length in a
harmonic trap. Interestingly, there is rapid pulse amplification in certain
scenarios.
