I show that if the capital accumulation dynamics is stochastic a new term, in
addition to that given by accounting prices, has to be introduced in order to
derive a correct estimate of the genuine wealth of an economy. In a simple
model with multiplicative accumulation dynamics I show that: 1) the value
function is always a decreasing function of volatility 2) the accounting prices
are affected by volatility 3) the new term always gives a negative contribution
to wealth changes. I discuss results for models with constant elasticity
utility functions. When the elasticity of marginal utility is larger than one,
accounting prices increase with volatility whereas when it is less than one
accounting prices decrease with volatility. These conclusions are not altered
when adopting optimal saving rates.
