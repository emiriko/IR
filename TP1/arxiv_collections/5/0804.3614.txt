The critical behavior of long straight rigid rods of length $k$ ($k$-mers) on
square and triangular lattices at intermediate density has been studied. A
nematic phase, characterized by a big domain of parallel $k$-mers, was found.
This ordered phase is separated from the isotropic state by a continuous
transition occurring at a intermediate density $\theta_c$. Two analytical
techniques were combined with Monte Carlo simulations to predict the dependence
of $\theta_c$ on $k$, being $\theta_c(k) \propto k^{-1}$. The first involves
simple geometrical arguments, while the second is based on entropy
considerations. Our analysis allowed us also to determine the minimum value of
$k$ ($k_{min}=7$), which allows the formation of a nematic phase on a
triangular lattice.
