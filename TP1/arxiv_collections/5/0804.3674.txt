A method of entanglement production is suggested, based on the resonant
generation of topological modes in systems with Bose-Einstein condensates
trapped in optical or magnetic lattices. The method makes it possible to
regulate the strength of entanglement production as well as to govern its time
variation. This method can serve as a practical tool for quantum information
processing and quantum computing.
