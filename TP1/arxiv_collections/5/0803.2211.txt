A new theorem on conditions for convergence to consensus of a multiagent
time-dependent time-discrete dynamical system is presented. The theorem is
build up on the notion of averaging maps. We compare this theorem to results by
Moreau (IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, vol. 50, no. 2, 2005) about
set-valued Lyapunov theory and convergence under switching communication
topologies. We give examples that point out differences of approaches including
examples where Moreau's theorem is not applicable but ours is. Further on, we
give examples that demonstrate that the theory of convergence to consensus is
still not complete.
