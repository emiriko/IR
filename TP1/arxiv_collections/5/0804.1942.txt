We show that the universal unitary completion of certain locally algebraic
representation of $G:=\GL_2(\Qp)$ with $p>2$ is non-zero, topologically
irreducible, admissible and corresponds to a 2-dimensional crystalline
representation with non-semisimple Frobenius via the $p$-adic Langlands
correspondence for $G$.
