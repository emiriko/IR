Recently, Alekseev and Belinski have presented a new exact solution of the
Einstein-Maxwell equations which describes two Reissner-Nordstrom (RN) sources
in reciprocal equilibrium (no struts nor strings); one source is a naked
singularity, the other is a black hole: this is the only possible configuration
for separable object, apart from the well-known extreme case ($m_i=e_i$).
  In the present paper, after a brief summary of this solution, we study in
some detail the coordinate systems used and the main features of the
gravitational and electric fields. In particular we graph the plots of the
electric force lines in three qualitatively different situations: equal-signed
charges, opposite charges and the case of a naked singularity near a neutral
black hole.
