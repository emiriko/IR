We discuss the integrability structure of deformed, four-dimensional N=4
super Yang-Mills theories using Yangians. We employ a recent procedure by
Beisert and Roiban that generalizes the beta deformation of Lunin and Maldacena
to produce N=1 superconformal gauge theories, which have the superalgebra
SU(2,2|1)xU(1)xU(1). The deformed theories, including those with the more
general twist, were shown to have retained their integrable structure. Here we
examine the Yangian algebra of these deformed theories. In a five field
subsector, we compute the two cases of SU(2)xU(1)xU(1)xU(1) and
SU(2|1)xU(1)xU(1) as residual symmetries of SU(2,2|1)xU(1)xU(1). We compute a
twisted coproduct for these theories, and show that only for the residual
symmetry do we retain the standard coproduct. The twisted coproduct thus
provides a method for symmetry breaking. However, the full Yangian structure of
SU(2|3) is manifest in our subsector, albeit with twisted coproducts, and
provides for the integrability of the theory.
