We study electronic transport through a magnetic molecule with an intrinsic
spin $S$ coupled to two magnetic electrodes, in the incoherent regime. The
molecule is modeled as a single resonant level with large Coulomb repulsion (no
double occupancy). The molecular spin is isotropic and it interacts with the
electronic spin through an exchange interaction. Using an alternative method to
the usual master equation approach, we are able to obtain analytical formulas
for various physical quantities of interest, such as the mean current and the
current fluctuations, but also the mean value of $J_z$ -the $z$ component of
the total spin on the molecule- and its fluctuations. This allows us to
understand how the electronic current between the magnetized electrodes can
control the polarization of the molecular spin. We observe in particular that
the fluctuations of $J_z$ reach unexpectedly high values.
