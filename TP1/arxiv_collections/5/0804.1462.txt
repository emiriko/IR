We consider the coarsening properties of a kinetic Ising model with a memory
field. The probability of a spin-flip depends on the persistence time of the
spin in a state. The more a spin has been in a given state, the less the
spin-flip probability is. We numerically studied the growth and persistence
properties of such a system on a two dimensional square lattice. The memory
introduces energy barriers which freeze the system at zero temperature. At
finite temperature we can observe an apparent arrest of coarsening for low
temperature and long memory length. However, since the energy barriers
introduced by memory are due to local effects, there exists a timescale on
which coarsening takes place as for the Ising model. Moreover the two point
correlation functions of the Ising model with and without memory are the same,
indicating that they belong to the same universality class.
