We propose a physical setup that can be used to simulate the quantum dynamics
of the Ising model with present-day technology. Our scheme consists of
electrons floating on superfluid helium which interact via Coulomb forces. In
the limit of low temperatures, the system will stay near the ground state where
its Hamiltonian is equivalent to the Ising model and thus shows phenomena such
as quantum criticality. Furthermore, the proposed design could be generalized
in order to study interacting field theories (e.g., $\lambda\phi^4$) and
adiabatic quantum computers.
