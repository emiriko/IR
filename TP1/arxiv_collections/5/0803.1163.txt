We have studied the thermodynamics of the stuffed spin ice material,
Dy2(DyxTi2-x)O7-x/2, in which additional Dy3+ replace Ti4+ in the pyrochlore
Dy2Ti2O7. Heat capacity measurements indicate that these materials lose the
spin ice zero point entropy for x >= 0.3, sharply contrasting with results on
the analogous Ho materials. A finite ac susceptibility is observed as T ~ 0 in
both the Ho and Dy materials with x = 0.67, which suggests that spin
fluctuations persist down to T ~ 0. We propose that both the entropy and
susceptibility data may be explained as a result of domains of local pyrochlore
type structural order in these materials.
