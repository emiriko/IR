We have experimentally demonstrated how two beams of light separated by an
octave in frequency can become entangled after their interaction in a
second-order nonlinear medium. The entangler consisted of a nonlinear crystal
placed within an optical resonator that was strongly driven by coherent light
at the fundamental and second-harmonic wavelengths. An inter-conversion between
the fields created quantum correlations in the amplitude and phase quadratures,
which were measured by two independent homodyne detectors. Analysis of the
resulting correlation matrix revealed a wavefunction inseparability of 0.74(1)
< 1 thereby satisfying the criterion of entanglement.
