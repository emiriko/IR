We study the evolution of a system of two qubits, each of which interacts
locally with a spin chain with nontrivial internal Hamiltonian. We present an
exact solution to this problem and analyze the dependence of decoherence on the
distance between the interaction sites. In the strong coupling regime we find
that decoherence increases with increasing distance. In the weak coupling
regime the dependence of decoherence with distance is not generic (i.e., it
varies according to the initial state). Decoherence becomes independent of
distance when the latter is over a saturation length $l$. Numerical results for
the Ising chain suggest that the saturation scale is related to the correlation
length $\xi$. For strong coupling we display evidence of the existence of
non--Markovian effects (such as environment--induced interactions between the
qubits). As a consequence the system can undergo a quasiperiodic sequence of
``sudden deaths and revivals'' of entanglement, with a time scale related to
the distance between qubits.
