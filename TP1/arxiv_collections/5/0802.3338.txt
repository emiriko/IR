After a suitable gauge fixing, the local gravitational degrees of freedom of
the Gowdy $S^1\times S^2$ and $S^3$ cosmologies are encoded in an axisymmetric
field on the sphere $S^2$. Recently, it has been shown that a standard field
parametrization of these reduced models admits no Fock quantization with a
unitary dynamics. This lack of unitarity is surpassed by a convenient
redefinition of the field and the choice of an adequate complex structure. The
result is a Fock quantization where both the dynamics and the SO(3)-symmetries
of the field equations are unitarily implemented. The present work proves that
this Fock representation is in fact unique inasmuch as, up to equivalence,
there exists no other possible choice of SO(3)-invariant complex structure
leading to a unitary implementation of the time evolution.
