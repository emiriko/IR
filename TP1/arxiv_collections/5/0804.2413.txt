This survey covers state-of-the-art Bayesian techniques for the estimation of
mixtures. It complements the earlier Marin, Mengersen and Robert (2005) by
studying new types of distributions, the multinomial, latent class and t
distributions. It also exhibits closed form solutions for Bayesian inference in
some discrete setups. Lastly, it sheds a new light on the computation of Bayes
factors via the approximation of Chib (1995).
