We present a new technique for verifying correspondences in security
protocols. In particular, correspondences can be used to formalize
authentication. Our technique is fully automatic, it can handle an unbounded
number of sessions of the protocol, and it is efficient in practice. It
significantly extends a previous technique for the verification of secrecy. The
protocol is represented in an extension of the pi calculus with fairly
arbitrary cryptographic primitives. This protocol representation includes the
specification of the correspondence to be verified, but no other annotation.
This representation is then translated into an abstract representation by Horn
clauses, which is used to prove the desired correspondence. Our technique has
been proved correct and implemented. We have tested it on various protocols
from the literature. The experimental results show that these protocols can be
verified by our technique in less than 1 s.
