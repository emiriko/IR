Due to a suitable Higgs mechanism, a standard Anti-de Sitter gauge theory
becomes spontaneously broken. The resulting Lorentz invariant gravitational
action includes the Hilbert-Einstein term of ordinary Einstein-Cartan gravity
with cosmological constant, plus contributions quadratic in curvature and
torsion, and a scalar Higgs sector.
