The combinatorial problem of counting the black hole quantum states within
the Isolated Horizon framework in Loop Quantum Gravity is analyzed. A
qualitative understanding of the origin of the band structure shown by the
degeneracy spectrum, which is responsible for the black hole entropy
quantization, is reached. Even when motivated by simple considerations, this
picture allows to obtain analytical expressions for the most relevant
quantities associated to this effect.
