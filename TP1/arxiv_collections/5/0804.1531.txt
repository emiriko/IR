We report measurements of the $\pi^- p \to \pi^o n$ differential cross
sections at six momenta (104-143 MeV/c) and four angles (0-40 deg) by detection
of $\gamma$-ray pairs from $\pi^o \to \gamma \gamma$ decays using the TRIUMF
RMC spectrometer. This region exhibits a vanishing zero-degree cross section
from destructive interference between s-- and p--waves, thus yielding special
sensitivity to pion-nucleon dynamics and isospin symmetry breaking. Our data
and previous data do not agree, with important implications for earlier claims
of large isospin violating effects in low energy pion-nucleon interactions.
