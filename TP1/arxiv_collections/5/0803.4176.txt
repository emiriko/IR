We show how models of neutrino masses and mixings can be differentiated on
the basis of their predictions for $\theta_{13}$ and lepton flavor violation in
radiative charged lepton decays and $\mu - e$ conversion. We illustrate the
lepton flavor violation results for five predictive SO(10) SUSY GUT models and
point out the relative importance of their heavy right-handed neutrino mass
spectra and $\theta_{13}$ predictions.
