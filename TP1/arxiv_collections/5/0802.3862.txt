In this paper we shall introduce the mathematical framework for the
description of measurements of quantum processes. Using this framework the
process estimation problems can be treated in the similar way as the state
estimation problems, only replacing the concept of positive operator valued
measure (POVM) by the concept of process POVM (PPOVM). In particular, we will
show that any measurement of qudit channels can be described by a collection of
effects (positive operators) defined on two-qudit system. However, the effects
forming a PPOVM are not normalized in the usual sense. We will demonstrate the
usage of this formalism in discrimination problems by showing that perfect
channel discrimination is equivalent to a specific unambiguous state
discrimination.
