We consider self-propelled particles undergoing run-and-tumble dynamics (as
exhibited by E. coli) in one dimension. Building on previous analyses at
drift-diffusion level for the one-particle density, we add both interactions
and noise, enabling discussion of domain formation by "self-trapping", and
other collective phenomena. Mapping onto detailed-balance systems is possible
in certain cases.
