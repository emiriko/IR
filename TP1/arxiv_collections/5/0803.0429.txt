Density functional studies of 26K superconducting LaFeAs(O,F) are reported.
We find a low carrier density, high density of states, $N(E_F)$ and modest
phonon frequencies relative to $T_c$. The high $N(E_F)$ leads to proximity to
itinerant magnetism, with competing ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic
fluctuations and the balance between these controlled by doping level. Thus
LaFeAs(O,F) is in a unique class of high $T_c$ superconductors: high $N(E_F)$
ionic metals near magnetism.
