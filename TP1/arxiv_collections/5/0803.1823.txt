In this article we study a generalization of DGP scenarios, where the induced
gravity is given by a $f(R)$ term. We obtain the effective gravitational
equations and the effective FLRW cosmological equation on the brane of this
model. We show that this generalization has also two regime, a 5D regime a low
energies that has a self-accelerated branch of interest for cosmology and a 4D
regime at high energies that it is described a modified gravitational theory.
