We give an explicit expression for the (finitely) flat remainder after
analytic normal form reduction of a family of planar saddles of diffeomorphisms
or vector fields. We distinguish between a rational or irrational ratio of the
moduli of the eigenvalues at the saddle for a certain value of the parameter.
