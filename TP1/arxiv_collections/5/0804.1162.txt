We derive the spatial coherence and intensity profiles of beams emerging from
two consecutive collimating apertures, and compare our results with data. We
show how to make a Gaussian Schell-model (GSM) beam by assuming Gaussian
apertures. Then we compare the intensity profile, the transverse coherence
width and the divergence angle of a GSM beam with those same properties of a
beam that is collimated with two hard-edged slits. The GSM beam formulae are
simpler, and offer an intuitive way to understand how partially coherent beams
interact with interferometers.
