The notion of special symplectic connections is closely related to contact
parabolic geometries due to the work of M. Cahen and L. Schwachh\"ofer. We
remind their characterization and reinterpret the result in terms of
generalized Weyl connections. The aim of this paper is to provide an
alternative and more explicit construction of special symplectic connections of
three types from the list. This is done by pulling back an ambient linear
connection from the total space of a natural scale bundle over the homogeneous
model of the corresponding contact parabolic structure.
