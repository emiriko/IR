As a rule, a quadratic functional depending on a great number of binary
variables has a lot of local minima. One of approaches allowing one to find in
averaged deeper local minima is aggregation of binary variables into larger
blocks/domains. To minimize the functional one has to change the states of
aggregated variables (domains). In the present publication we discuss methods
of domains formation. It is shown that the best results are obtained when
domains are formed by variables that are strongly connected with each other.
