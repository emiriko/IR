Coupled map lattices are a paradigm of higher-dimensional dynamical systems
exhibiting spatio-temporal chaos. A special case of non-hyperbolic maps are
one-dimensional map lattices of coupled Chebyshev maps with periodic boundary
conditions, called chaotic strings. In this short note we show that the fine
structure of the self energy of this chaotic string in the scaling region (i.e.
for very small coupling) is retained if we reduce the length of the string to
three lattice points.
