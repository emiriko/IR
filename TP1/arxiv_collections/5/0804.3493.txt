In this article we consider sheaf quotients of affine superschemes by affine
supergroups that act on them freely. The necessary and sufficient conditions
for such quotients to be affine are given. If $G$ is an affine supergroup and
$H$ is its normal supersubgroup, then we prove that a dur $K$-sheaf
$\tilde{\tilde{G/H}}$ is again affine supergroup. Additionally, if $G$ is
algebraic, then a $K$-sheaf $\tilde{G/H}$ is also algebraic supergroup and it
coincides with $\tilde{\tilde{G/H}}$. In particular, any normal supersubgroup
of an affine supergroup is faithfully exact.
