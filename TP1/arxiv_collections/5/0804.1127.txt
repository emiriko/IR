We review the foundations of Einstein's general theory of relativity, discuss
recent progress in the tests of relativistic gravity, and present motivations
for new generation of high-accuracy gravitational experiments. We discuss the
advances in our understanding of fundamental physics anticipated in the near
future and evaluate discovery potential of the recently proposed gravitational
experiments.
