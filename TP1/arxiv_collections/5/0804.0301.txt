We show that all thermodynamic quantities of the Einstein-Born-Infeld black
holes in three dimensions can be obtained from the dilaton and its potential of
two dimensional dilaton gravity through the dimensional reduction. These are
all between non-rotating uncharged BTZ black hole (NBTZ) and charged BTZ black
hole (CBTZ).
