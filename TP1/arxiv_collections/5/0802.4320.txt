In gravitational-wave detection, special emphasis is put onto searches that
focus on cosmic events detected by other types of astrophysical observatories.
The astrophysical triggers, e.g. from gamma-ray and X-ray satellites, optical
telescopes and neutrino observatories, provide a trigger time for analyzing
gravitational wave data coincident with the event. In certain cases the
expected frequency range, source energetics, directional and progenitor
information is also available. Beyond allowing the recognition of gravitational
waveforms with amplitudes closer to the noise floor of the detector, these
triggered searches should also lead to rich science results even before the
onset of Advanced LIGO. In this paper we provide a broad review of LIGO's
astrophysically triggered searches and the sources they target.
