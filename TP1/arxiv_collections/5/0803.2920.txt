We propose a cavity-QED-based scheme of generating entanglement between
atoms. The scheme is scalable to an arbitrary number of atoms, and can be used
to generate a variety of multipartite entangled states such as the
Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger, W, and cluster states. Furthermore, with a role
switching of atoms with photons, the scheme can be used to generate
entanglement between cavity fields. We also introduce a scheme that can
generate an arbitrary multipartite field graph state.
