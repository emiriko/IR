We explore the role of electron correlation in quasi one dimensional quantum
wires as the range of the interaction potential is changed and their thickness
is varied by performing exact quantum Monte Carlo simulations at various
electronic densities. In the case of unscreened interactions with a long range
1/x tail there is a crossover from a liquid to a quasi Wigner crystal state as
the density decreases. When this interaction is screened, quasi long range
order is prevented from forming, although a significant correlation with 4 k_F
periodicity is still present at low densities. At even lower electron
concentration, exchange is suppressed and the spin-dependent interactions
become negligible, making the electrons behave like spinless fermions. We show
that this behavior is shared by the long range and screened interactions by
studying the spin and charge excitations of the system in both cases. Finally,
we study the effect of electron correlations in the double quantum wire
experiment [Steinberg et al., Phys. Rev. B 77, 113307 (2006)], by introducing
an accurate model for the screening in the experiment and explicitly including
the finite length of the system in our simulations. We find that decreasing the
electron density drives the system from a liquid to a state with quite strong 4
k_F correlations. This crossover takes place around $20 \mu m^{-1}$, the
density where the electron localization occurs in the experiment. The charge
and spin velocities are also in remarkable agreement with the experimental
findings in the proximity of the crossover. We argue that correlation effects
play an important role at the onset of the localization transition.
