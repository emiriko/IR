The temperature dependence of electron spin coherence in singly negatively
charged (In,Ga)As/GaAs quantum dots is studied by time-resolved Faraday
rotation. The decoherence time T2 is constant on a microsecond scale for
temperatures below 20 K, for higher temperatures it shows a surprisingly sharp
drop into the nanoseconds range. The decrease cannot be explained through
inelastic scattering with phonons, and may be related with elastic scattering
due to phonon-mediated fluctuations of the hyperfine interaction.
