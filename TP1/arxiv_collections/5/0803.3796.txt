Desharnais, Gupta, Jagadeesan and Panangaden introduced a family of
behavioural pseudometrics for probabilistic transition systems. These
pseudometrics are a quantitative analogue of probabilistic bisimilarity.
Distance zero captures probabilistic bisimilarity. Each pseudometric has a
discount factor, a real number in the interval (0, 1]. The smaller the discount
factor, the more the future is discounted. If the discount factor is one, then
the future is not discounted at all. Desharnais et al. showed that the
behavioural distances can be calculated up to any desired degree of accuracy if
the discount factor is smaller than one. In this paper, we show that the
distances can also be approximated if the future is not discounted. A key
ingredient of our algorithm is Tarski's decision procedure for the first order
theory over real closed fields. By exploiting the Kantorovich-Rubinstein
duality theorem we can restrict to the existential fragment for which more
efficient decision procedures exist.
