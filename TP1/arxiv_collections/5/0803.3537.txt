Electroproduction of exclusive $\phi$ vector mesons has been studied with the
CLAS detector in the kinematical range $1.4\leq Q^2\leq 3.8$ GeV$^{2}$,
$0.0\leq t^{\prime}\leq 3.6$ GeV$^{2}$, and $2.0\leq W\leq 3.0$ GeV. The
scaling exponent for the total cross section as $1/(Q^2+M_{\phi}^2)^n$ was
determined to be $n=2.49\pm 0.33$. The slope of the four-momentum transfer $t'$
distribution is $b_{\phi}=0.98 \pm 0.17$ GeV$^{-2}$. Under the assumption of
s-channel helicity conservation (SCHC), we determine the ratio of longitudinal
to transverse cross sections to be $R=0.86 \pm 0.24$. A 2-gluon exchange model
is able to reproduce the main features of the data.
