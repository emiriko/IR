In this paper we compute the Fourier spectra of some recently discovered
binomial APN functions. One consequence of this is the determination of the
nonlinearity of the functions, which measures their resistance to linear
cryptanalysis. Another consequence is that certain error-correcting codes
related to these functions have the same weight distribution as the
2-error-correcting BCH code. Furthermore, for fields of odd degree, our results
provide an alternative proof of the APN property of the functions.
