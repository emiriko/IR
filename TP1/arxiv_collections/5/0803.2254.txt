We comment on both recent progress and lingering puzzles related to research
on magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs). MTJs are already being used in
applications such as magnetic-field sensors in the read heads of disk drives,
and they may also be the first device geometry in which spin-torque effects are
applied to manipulate magnetic dynamics, in order to make nonvolatile magnetic
random access memory. However, there remain many unanswered questions about
such basic properties as the magnetoresistance of MTJs, how their properties
change as a function of tunnel-barrier thickness and applied bias, and what are
the magnitude and direction of the spin-transfer-torque vector induced by a
tunnel current.
