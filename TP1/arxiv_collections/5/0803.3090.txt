The suspension and levitation of superconductors by permanent magnets is one
of the most fascinating consequences of superconductivity, and a wonderful
instrument for generating interest in low temperature physics and
electrodynamics. We present a novel classroom demonstration of the
levitation/suspension of a superconductor over a magnetic track that maximizes
levitation/suspension time, separation distance between the magnetic track and
superconductor and also insulator aesthetics. The demonstration as described is
both inexpensive and easy to construct.
