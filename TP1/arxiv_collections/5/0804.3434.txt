This is a set of lecture notes that developed out of courses on the lambda
calculus that I taught at the University of Ottawa in 2001 and at Dalhousie
University in 2007 and 2013. Topics covered in these notes include the untyped
lambda calculus, the Church-Rosser theorem, combinatory algebras, the
simply-typed lambda calculus, the Curry-Howard isomorphism, weak and strong
normalization, polymorphism, type inference, denotational semantics, complete
partial orders, and the language PCF.
