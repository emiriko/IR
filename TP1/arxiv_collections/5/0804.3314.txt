We describe the T=0 quantum phase transition in heavy fermion systems as an
orbital selective Mott transition (OSMT) using a cluster extension of dynamical
mean field theory. This transition is characterized by the emergence of a new
intermediate energy scale corresponding to the opening of a pseudogap and the
vanishing of the low-energy hybridization between light and heavy electrons. We
identify the fingerprint of Mott physics in heavy electron systems with the
appearance of surfaces in momentum space where the self-energy diverges and we
derive experimental consequences of this scenario for photoemission,
compressibility, optical conductivity, susceptibility and specific heat.
