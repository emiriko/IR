As one of important analysis tools, microscopes with high spatial resolution
are indispensable for scientific research and medical diagnosis, and much
attention is always focused on the improvement of resolution. Over the past
decade, a novel technique called ghost imaging has been developed that may
provide a new approach toward increasing the resolution of an imaging system.
In this paper, we introduce this technique into microscopes for the first time
and report a proof-of-principle experimental demonstration of a microscope
scheme based on ghost imaging.
