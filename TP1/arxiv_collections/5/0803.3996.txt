In a recent preprint [0803.3052] A. Kanigel et al report evidence for
Bogoliubov-type excitations in the pseudogap phase in the anti-nodal region,
where a robust pseudogap remains well above Tc. This important experimental
result has been theoretically predicted by us almost 6 years ago on a basis of
the phenomenological boson fermion model. An earlier theoretical prediction on
the basis of this model was that of a pseudogap in the electron DOS, setting in
at some temperature T* and evolving into the superconducting gap upon
approaching Tc. A natural logical pursuit of this early work was to show that,
in order to have a superconducting state evolved out of a pseudogap state, the
diamagnetic bosonic pair fluctuations (characterizing the pseudogap phase) have
to be propagating modes, which are phase correlated over finite distances above
Tc. If so, then the pseudogap feature has to be reflected in characteristic
features of the single particle excitations, showing remnants of the Bogoliubov
modes inherent in the superconducting phase. Such Bogoliubov modes result from
dynamical feedback effects between single electron excitations and dynamical
local pairing fluctuations. We briefly recollect here our theoretical results
and confront them with the recent experimental findings.
