The electronic structure, bonding and magnetism in graphene containing
vacancies are studied using density-functional methods. The single-vacancy
graphene ground state is spin polarized and structurally flat. The unpolarized
state is non planar only for finite segments. Systems containing periodic
arrays of vacancies displays magnetic transitions and metal-insulator
transitions.
