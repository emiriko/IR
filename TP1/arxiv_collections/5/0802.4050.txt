We propose to set the Skyrme parameters F_{\pi} and e such that they
reproduce the physical masses of the nucleon and the deuteron. We allow
deformation using an axially symmetric solution and simulated annealing to
minimize the total energy for the B=1 nucleon and B=$ deuteron. First we find
that axial deformations are responsible for a significant reduction (factor of
\approx 4) of the rotational energy but also that it is not possible to get a
common set of parameters F_{\pi} and e which would fit both nucleon and
deuteron masses simultaneously at least for m_{\pi}= 138 MeV, 345 MeV and 500
MeV. This suggests that either m_{\pi}>500 MeV or additional terms must be
added to the Skyrme Lagrangian.
