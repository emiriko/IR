The outstanding discrepancy between the measured and calculated
(local-density approximation) Fermi surfaces in the well-characterized,
paramagnetic Fermi liquid Sr2RhO4 is resolved by including the spin-orbit
coupling and Coulomb repulsion. This results in an effective spin-orbit
coupling constant enhanced 2.15 times over the bare value. A simple formalism
allows discussion of other systems. For Sr2RhO4, the experimental specific-heat
and mass enhancements are found to be 2.2.
