We will prove that Ruelle L-function for a cuspidal local system on an odd
dimensional hyperbolic manifold with finite volume satisfies a functional
equation and an analog of the Riemann hypothesis. We will also compute its
Laurent expansion at the origin and will prove that the second coefficient
coincides with a rational multiple of the volume up to a certain contribution
from cusps. Moreover if the dimension is three we will identify the leading
coefficient. Both of them will be intepreted by the Borel regulator in
algebraic K-theory. Also a relation with the L^2-torsion will be discussed.
