We observe a sudden breakdown of the transport of a strongly repulsive
Bose-Einstein condensate through a shallow optical lattice of finite width. We
are able to attribute this behavior to the development of a self-trapped state
by using accurate numerical methods and an analytical description in terms of
nonlinear Bloch waves. The dependence of the breakdown on the lattice depth and
the interaction strength is investigated. We show that it is possible to
prohibit the self-trapping by applying a constant offset potential to the
lattice region. Furthermore, we observe the disappearance of the self-trapped
state after a finite time as a result of the revived expansion of the
condensate through the lattice. This revived expansion is due to the finite
width of the lattice.
