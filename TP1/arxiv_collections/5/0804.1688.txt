It is argued that a change in particle rest mass must involve a multiply
connected space-time topology. The LHC can probe these topological effects
through the particle leakage (~18%) that it experiences in particle mass
changing interactions. With a probability of ~82%, this 4-space leakage causes
a downward shift in the observable Higgs mass, from its physical value of 131.6
GeV to 125.2 GeV.
