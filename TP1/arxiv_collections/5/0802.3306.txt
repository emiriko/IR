Using Planck scale oscillators in the background dark energy in a model that
parallels the theory of phonons, we deduce the Planck mass, the elementary
particle mass scale, the mass of the Universe and a recently discovered
residual energy in the cosmic background. We also deduce the Beckenstein
temperature formula for black holes. Finally we show that the model explains
the four minute time lag in thearrival of gamma photons from a recently
observed gamma flare by the MAGIC telescope.
