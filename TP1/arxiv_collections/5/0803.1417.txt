The computer-aided diagnosis system we developed for the mass
characterization is mainly based on a segmentation algorithm and on the neural
classification of several features computed on the segmented mass. Mass
segmentation plays a key role in most computerized systems. Our technique is a
gradient-based one, showing the main characteristic that no free parameters
have been evaluated on the dataset used in this analysis, thus it can directly
be applied to datasets acquired in different conditions without any ad-hoc
modification. A dataset of 226 masses (109 malignant and 117 benign) has been
used in this study. The segmentation algorithm works with a comparable
efficiency both on malignant and benign masses. Sixteen features based on
shape, size and intensity of the segmented masses are analyzed by a
multi-layered perceptron neural network. A feature selection procedure has been
carried out on the basis of the feature discriminating power and of the linear
correlations interplaying among them. The comparison of the areas under the ROC
curves obtained by varying the number of features to be classified has shown
that 12 selected features out of the 16 computed ones are powerful enough to
achieve the best classifier performances. The radiologist assigned the
segmented masses to three different categories: correctly-, acceptably- and
non-acceptably-segmented masses. We initially estimated the area under ROC
curve only on the first category of segmented masses (the 88.5% of the
dataset), then extending the dataset to the second sub-class (reaching the
97.8% of the dataset) and finally to the whole dataset, obtaining Az =
0.805+-0.030, 0.787+-0.024 and 0.780+-0.023, respectively.
