We give a uniform geometric realization for the cluster algebra of an
arbitrary finite type with principal coefficients at an arbitrary acyclic seed.
This algebra is realized as the coordinate ring of a certain reduced double
Bruhat cell in the simply connected semisimple algebraic group of the same
Cartan-Killing type. In this realization, the cluster variables appear as
certain (generalized) principal minors.
