In a short superconducting nanowire connected to bulk superconducting leads,
quantum phase slips behave as a system of linearly (as opposed to
logarithmically) interacting charges. This system maps onto quantum mechanics
of a particle in a periodic potential. We show that, while the state with a
high density of phase slips is not a true insulator (a consequence of Josephson
tunneling between the leads), for a range of parameters it behaves as such down
to unobservably small temperatures. We also show that quantum phase slips give
rise to multiple branches (bands) in the energy-current relation and to an
interband ("exciton") mode.
