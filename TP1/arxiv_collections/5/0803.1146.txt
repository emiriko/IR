In this paper we use the combinatorics of alcove walks to give a uniform
combinatorial formula for Macdonald polynomials for all Lie types. These
formulas are generalizations of the formulas of Haglund-Haiman-Loehr for
Macdonald polynoimals of type GL(n). At q=0 these formulas specialize to the
formula of Schwer for the Macdonald spherical function in terms of positively
folded alcove walks and at q=t=0 these formulas specialize to the formula for
the Weyl character in terms of the Littelmann path model (in the positively
folded gallery form of Gaussent-Littelmann).
