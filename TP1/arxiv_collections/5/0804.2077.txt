Neutral particles can be guided and focussed using electric field gradients
that focus in one transverse direction and defocus in the other, alternating
between the two directions. Such a guide is suitable for transporting particles
that are attracted to strong electric fields, which cannot be guided using
static fields. Particles are only transmitted if their initial positions and
transverse speeds lie within the guide's phase space acceptance. Nonlinear
forces are always present in the guide and can severely reduce this acceptance.
We consider the effects of the two most important nonlinear forces, a term in
the force that is cubic in the off-axis displacement, and a nonlinear term
which couples together the two transverse motions. We use approximate
analytical techniques, along with numerical methods, to calculate the influence
of these nonlinear forces on the particle trajectories and on the phase space
acceptance. The cubic term alters the focussing and defocussing powers, leading
either to an increase or a decrease of the acceptance depending on its sign. We
find an approximate analytical result for the phase space acceptance including
this cubic term. Using a perturbation method we show how the coupling term
leads to slow changes in the amplitudes of the transverse oscillations. This
term reduces the acceptance when it reduces the focussing power, but has little
influence when it increases that power. It is not possible to eliminate both
nonlinear terms, but one can be made small at the expense of the other. We show
how to choose the guide parameters so that the acceptance is optimized.
