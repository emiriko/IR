The usual formulations of quantum field theory in Minkowski spacetime make
crucial use of features--such as Poincare invariance and the existence of a
preferred vacuum state--that are very special to Minkowski spacetime. In order
to generalize the formulation of quantum field theory to arbitrary globally
hyperbolic curved spacetimes, it is essential that the theory be formulated in
an entirely local and covariant manner, without assuming the presence of a
preferred state. We propose a new framework for quantum field theory, in which
the existence of an Operator Product Expansion (OPE) is elevated to a
fundamental status, and, in essence, all of the properties of the quantum field
theory are determined by its OPE. We provide general axioms for the OPE
coefficients of a quantum field theory. These include a local and covariance
assumption (implying that the quantum field theory is locally and covariantly
constructed from the spacetime metric), a microlocal spectrum condition, an
"associativity" condition, and the requirement that the coefficient of the
identity in the OPE of the product of a field with its adjoint have positive
scaling degree. We prove curved spacetime versions of the spin-statistics
theorem and the PCT theorem. Some potentially significant further implications
of our new viewpoint on quantum field theory are discussed.
