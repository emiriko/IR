Resonance Raman (RR) peaks of and stretching modes and their higher harmonics
have been observed superimposed on photoluminescence (PL) spectrum of thin
films. Commercial fluorine doped thin films deposited by sputtering on glass
and thin films deposited on Si by laser ablation have been studied. The
dispersions of CO and OH stretching RR modes are ~ 600 cm-1/eV and 800 cm-1
respectively. The dispersion of the third harmonic of CO stretching mode is ~
2000 cm-1/eV. Similar dispersion of RR peak of stretching modes and higher
harmonics superimposed on PL spectra has been observed in Mo1-xFexO2 thin films
and SiO2 bulk glass. Large dispersion of RR peaks seems to be a common property
of oxides with impurities of and .
