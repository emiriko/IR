Shor's algorithm (SA) is a quantum algorithm for factoring integers. Since SA
has polynomial complexity while the best classical factoring algorithms are
sub-exponential, SA is cited as evidence that quantum computers are more
powerful than classical computers. SA is critically dependent on the Quantum
Fourier Transform (QFT) and it is known that the QFT is sensitive to errors in
the quantum state input to it. In this paper, we show that the polynomial
scaling of SA is destroyed by input errors to the QFT part of the algorithm. We
also show that Quantum Error Correcting Codes (QECC) are not capable of
suppressing errors due to operator imprecision and that propagation of operator
precision errors is sufficient to severely degrade the effectiveness of SA.
Additionally we show that operator imprecision in the error correction circuit
for the Calderbank-Shor-Steane QECC is mathematically equivalent to decoherence
on every physical qubit in a register. We conclude that, because of the effect
of operator precision errors, it is likely that physically realizable quantum
computers will be capable of factoring integers no more efficiently than
classical computers.
