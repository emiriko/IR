We report on the photo-induced precession of the ferromagnetically coupled Mn
spins in (Ga,Mn)As, which is observed even with no external magnetic field
applied. We concentrate on various experimental aspects of the time-resolved
magneto-optical Kerr effect (TR-MOKE) technique that can be used to clarify the
origin of the detected signals. We show that the measured data typically
consist of several different contributions, among which only the oscillatory
signal is directly connected with the ferromagnetic order in the sample.
