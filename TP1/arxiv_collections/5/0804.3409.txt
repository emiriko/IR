We comment on the paper "On application of the time-energy uncertainty
relation to M\"ossbauer neutrino experiments" (see arXiv: 0803.1424) in which
our paper "Time-energy uncertainty relations for neutrino oscillation and
M\"ossbauer neutrino experiment" (see arXiv: 0803.0527) has been criticized. We
argue that this critique is a result of misinterpretation: The authors of
(arXiv: 0803.1424) do not take into account (or do not accept) the fact that at
present there exist different schemes of neutrino oscillations which can not be
distinguished in usual neutrino oscillation experiments. We stress that a
recently proposed M\"ossbauer neutrino experiment provides the unique
possibility to discriminate basically different approaches to oscillations of
flavor neutrinos.
