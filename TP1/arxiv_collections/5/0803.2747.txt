In a system of $n$ quantum particles, the correlations are classified into a
series of irreducible $k$-particle correlations ($2\le k\le n$), where the
irreducible $k$-particle correlation is the correlation appearing in the states
of $k$ particles but not existing in the states of $k-1$ particles. A measure
of the degree of irreducible $k$-particle correlation is defined based on the
maximal entropy construction. By adopting a continuity approach, we overcome
the difficulties in calculating the degrees of irreducible multi-particle
correlations for the multi-particle states without maximal rank. In particular,
we obtain the degrees of irreducible multi-particle correlations in the
$n$-qubit stabilizer states and the $n$-qubit generalized GHZ states, which
reveals the distribution of multi-particle correlations in these states.
