A simple supersymmetric SO(10) GUT in five dimensions is considered. The
fifth dimension is compactified on the $S^1/(Z_2\times Z_2^\prime)$ orbifold
possessing two inequivalent fixed points. In our setup, all matter and Higgs
multiplets reside on one brane (PS brane) where the original SO(10) gauge group
is broken down to the Pati-Salam (PS) gauge group, SU(4)$_c \timesSU(2)_L
\times$ SU(2)$_R$, by the orbifold boundary condition, while only the SO(10)
gauge multiplet resides in the bulk. The further breaking of the PS symmetry to
the Standard Model gauge group is realized by Higgs multiplets on the PS brane
as usual in four dimensional models. Proton decay is fully suppressed. In our
simple setup, the gauge coupling unification is realized after incorporating
threshold corrections of Kaluza-Klein modes. When supersymmetry is assumed to
be broken on the other brane, supersymmetry breaking is transmitted to the PS
brane through the gaugino mediation with the bulk gauge multiplet.
