An exact analytic solution is presented for coherent resonant excitation of a
two-state quantum system driven by a time-dependent pulsed external field with
a hyperbolic-secant shape in the presence of dephasing. Analytic results are
derived for the amplitude and the phase shift of the damped Rabi oscillations.
