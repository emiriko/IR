We present a comprehensive and self-contained simplified review of the
quantum computing scheme of Phys. Rev. Lett. 98, 190504 (2007), which features
a 2-D nearest neighbor coupled lattice of qubits, a threshold error rate
approaching 1%, natural asymmetric and adjustable strength error correction and
low overhead arbitrarily long-range logical gates. These features make it by
far the best and most practical quantum computing scheme devised to date. We
restrict the discussion to direct manipulation of the surface code using the
stabilizer formalism, both of which we also briefly review, to make the scheme
accessible to a broad audience.
