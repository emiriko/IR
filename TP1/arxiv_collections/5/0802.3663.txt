The effect of noise on the reversal of a magnetic dipole is investigated on
the basis of computer simulation of the Landau-Lifshits equation. It is
demonstrated that at the reversal by the pulse with sinusoidal shape, there
exists the optimal duration, which minimizes the mean reversal time (MRT) and
the standard deviation (jitter). Both the MRT and the jitter significantly
depend on the angle between the reversal magnetic field and the anisotropy
axis. At the optimal angle the MRT can be decreased by 7 times for damping
$\alpha$=1 and up to 2 orders of magnitude for $\alpha$=0.01, and the jitter
can be decreased from 1 to 3 orders of magnitude in comparison with the
uniaxial symmetry case.
