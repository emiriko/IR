We consider a cosmological solution which can explain anisotropic evolution
of spatial dimensions and the stabilization of extra dimensions in brane gas
formalism. We evaluate the effective potentials, induced by brane gas, bulk
flux and supergravity particles, which govern the sizes of the observed three
and the extra dimensions. It is possible that the wrapped internal volume can
oscillate between two turning points or sit at the minimum of the potential
while the unwrapped three dimensional volume can expand monotonically.
Including the supergravity particles makes the effective potential steeper as
the internal volume shrinks.
