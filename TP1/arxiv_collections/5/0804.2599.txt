A momentum of the photon in a surface plasmon could be hundreds and even
thousand times higher as compared to a momentum of a photon in a free space.
Such a photon could be scattered on an electron the later being supplied by a
notable momentum. This momentum is approximately of the same value as a
momentum transposed by an X-ray photon. A physical fundamental importance of
the observation is outlined. Various practical applications of the phenomenon
are proposed including an optical nanodevice.
