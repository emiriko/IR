An atomic force microscope is used to structure a film of multilayer
graphene. The resistance of the sample was measured in-situ during
nanomachining narrow trenches. We found a reversible behavior in the electrical
resistance which we attribute to the movement of dislocations. After several
attempts also permanent changes are observed.
