I discuss thermoelectric properties of a quantum dot coupled to one normal
and one superconducting lead in the presence of Kondo effect and Andreev
scattering. I will focus on conductance, thermal conductance, thermopower and
related quantities like thermoelectric figure of merit which is a direct
measure of the usefulness of the system for applications and Wiedemann-Franz
ratio which indicates if the system is in the Fermi liquid state. I will show
that the superconductivity strongly modifies the thermal properties of the
system. In particular, the thermopower is strongly enhanced near the
superconducting transition temperature. Moreover, the Andreev reflections are
suppressed due to strong on-dot Coulomb repulsion. The suppression of the
Andreev reflections leads to a violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law and to a
non-Fermi liquid ground state.
