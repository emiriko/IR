We study the evolution of the energy gap in a unitary Fermi gas as a function
of temperature. To this end we approximate the Fermi gas by the Hubbard lattice
Hamiltonian and solve using the dynamical mean-field approximation. We have
found that below the critical temperature, Tc, the system is a superfluid and
the energy gap is decreasing monotonously. For temperatures above Tc the system
is an insulator and the corresponding energy gap is monotonously increasing.
