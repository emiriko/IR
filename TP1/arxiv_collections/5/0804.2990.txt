We have analytically explored temperature dependence of critical number of
particles for the collapse of a harmonically trapped attractively interacting
Bose gas below the condensation point by introducing a kinetic approach within
the Hartree-Fock approximation. The temperature dependence obtained by this
easy approach is consisted with that obtained from the scaling theory.
