The Kondo lattice antiferromagnet YbNiSi3 was investigated by neutron
scattering. The magnetic structure of YbNiSi3 was determined by neutron
diffraction on a single-crystalline sample. Inelastic scattering experiments
were also performed on a pulverized sample to study the crystalline electric
field (CEF) excitations. Two broad CEF excitations were observed, from which
the CEF parameters were determined. The temperature dependence of the magnetic
susceptibility chi and the magnetic specific heat Cmag were calculated using
the determined CEF model, and compared with previous results.
