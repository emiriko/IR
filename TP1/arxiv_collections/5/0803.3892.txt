We study the dynamics of a radioactive species flowing through a porous
material, within the Continuous-Time Random Walk (CTRW) approach to the
modelling of stochastic transport processes. Emphasis is given to the case
where radioactive decay is coupled to anomalous diffusion in locally
heterogeneous media, such as porous sediments or fractured rocks. In this
framework, we derive the distribution of the number of jumps each particle can
perform before a decay event. On the basis of the obtained results, we compute
the moments of the cumulative particle distribution, which can be then used to
quantify the overall displacement and spread of the contaminant species.
