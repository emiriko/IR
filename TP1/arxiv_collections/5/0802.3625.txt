The GMc-interpretation (Gravitation-Motion of mass-light with maximal speed
c) is a consistent approach to quantum mechanics very closely related to
classical physics. Several postulates are formulated that are satisfied in
classical physics, general relativity theory, quantum theory and
thermodynamics. In this interpretation, particles are always particles, never
waves, and many paradoxes can be easily understood or avoided. In particular,
the postulates allow to explain the measurement problem and the concept of
interaction-free measurements; the latter allows to find objects without
``touching'' them, and sometimes the phrase ``seeing in the dark'' is used.
Additionally, the concepts of complementarity, uncertainty, decoherence,
locality and realism are investigated. One key property of this interpretation
is that all observed probabilities and interference patterns are known before a
particle is in the experiment. Ontological questions are discussed.
