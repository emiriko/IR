We propose a concrete model which exhibits ferromagnetism and electron-pair
condensation simultaneously. The model is defined on two chains and consists of
the electron hopping term, the on-site Coulomb repulsion, and a ferromagnetic
interaction which describes ferromagnetic coupling between two electrons, one
on a bond in a chain and the other on a site in the other chain. It is
rigorously shown that the model has fullypolarized ferromagnetic pairing ground
states. The higher dimensional version of the model is also presented.
