We consider a few-particle system of trapped neutral fermionic atoms at
ultra-low temperatures, with the attractive interaction tuned to Feshbach
resonance. We calculate the energies and the spatial densities of the few-body
systems using a generalisation of the extended Thomas-Fermi (ETF) method, and
assuming the particles obey the Haldane-Wu fractional exclusion statistics
(FES) at unitarity. This method is different from the scaled ETF version given
by Chang and Bertsch (Phys. Rev. A76,021603(R) (2007)). Our semiclassical FES
results are consistent with the Monte-Carlo calculations of the above authors,
but can hardly be distinguished from their over all scaling of the ETF result
at unitarity.
