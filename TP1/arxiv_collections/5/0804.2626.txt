A fully ab initio scheme based on quantum chemical wavefunction methods is
used to investigate the correlated multiorbital electronic structure of a
3d-metal compound, LaCoO3. The strong short-range electron correlations,
involving both Co and O orbitals, are treated by multireference techniques. The
use of effective parameters like the Hubbard U and interorbital U', J terms and
the problems associated with their explicit calculation are avoided with this
approach. We provide new insight into the spin-state transition at about 90 K
and the nature of charge carriers in the doped material. Our results indicate
the formation of a t4e2 high-spin state in LaCoO3 for T>90 K. Additionally, we
explain the paramagnetic phase in the low-temperature lightly doped compound
through the formation of Zhang-Rice-like O hole states and ferromagnetic
clusters.
