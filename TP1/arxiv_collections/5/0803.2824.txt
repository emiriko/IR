A well-known approach to intradomain traffic engineering consists in finding
the set of link weights that minimizes a network-wide objective function for a
given intradomain traffic matrix. This approach is inadequate because it
ignores a potential impact on interdomain routing. Indeed, the resulting set of
link weights may trigger BGP to change the BGP next hop for some destination
prefixes, to enforce hot-potato routing policies. In turn, this results in
changes in the intradomain traffic matrix that have not been anticipated by the
link weights optimizer, possibly leading to degraded network performance.
  We propose a BGP-aware link weights optimization method that takes these
effects into account, and even turns them into an advantage. This method uses
the interdomain traffic matrix and other available BGP data, to extend the
intradomain topology with external virtual nodes and links, on which all the
well-tuned heuristics of a classical link weights optimizer can be applied. A
key innovative asset of our method is its ability to also optimize the traffic
on the interdomain peering links. We show, using an operational network as a
case study, that our approach does so efficiently at almost no extra
computational cost.
