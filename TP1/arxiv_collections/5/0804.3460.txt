Oxygen vacancies at the SnO2(110) and (101) surface and subsurface sites have
been studied in the framework of density functional theory by using both
all-electron Gaussian and pseudopotential plane-wave methods. The all-electron
calculations have been performed using the B3LYP exchange-correlation
functional with accurate estimations of energy gaps and density of states. We
show that bulk oxygen vacancies are responsible for the appearance of a fully
occupied flat energy level lying at about 1 eV above the top valence band, and
an empty level resonant with the conduction band. Surface oxygen vacancies
strongly modify the surface band structures with the appearance of intragap
states covering most of the forbidden energy window, or only a small part of
it, depending on the vacancy depth from the surface. Oxygen vacancies can
account for electron affinity variations with respect to the stoichiometric
surfaces as well. A significant support to the present results is found by
comparing them to the available experimental data.
