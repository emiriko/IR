We explore some basic entanglement features of multiqubit systems that are
relevant for the development of algorithms for searching highly entangled
states. In particular, we compare the behaviours of multiqubit entanglement
measures based (i) on the von Neumann entropy of marginal density matrices and
(ii) on the linear entropy of those matrices.
