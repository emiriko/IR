We provide numerical evidence for composite fermion pairing in quantum Hall
bilayer systems at filling $\nu=1/2 + 1/2$ for intermediate spacing between the
layers. We identify the phase as $p_x + i p_y$ pairing, and construct high
accuracy trial wavefunctions to describe the groundstate on the sphere. For
large distances between the layers, and for finite systems, a competing "Hund's
rule" state, or composite fermion liquid, prevails for certain system sizes. We
argue that for larger systems, the pairing phase will persist to larger layer
spacing.
