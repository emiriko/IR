The two-dimensional d-p model (or extended Hubbard model) on a square lattice
is investigated for fermion pairing by a slave boson method. The inter-site
d-fermion interaction is introduced additionally. The momentum space
counterpart of this interaction is taken to be separable and expanded in terms
of basis functions corresponding to mixed symmetry states. The investigation
leads to anomalous pairing of fermion fields only for pure d-wave symmetry. The
charge and spin ordering gaps appear in the single- particle spectrum when
d(x,y) state is taken into account.The non-Fermi liquid behavior is found to be
the prevalent one generally. The study yields a good qualitative account of the
nodal-antinodal dichotomy. Two gaps appear in the normal state spectrum; the
larger one corresponds to the sum and the smaller to the difference of spin and
charge ordering gaps. This two-gap scenario is in qualitative agreement with
recent experimental finding.
