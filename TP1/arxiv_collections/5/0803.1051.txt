The statistics of the iso-height lines in (2+1)-dimensional
Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) model is shown to be conformal invariant and
equivalent to those of self-avoiding random walks. This leads to a rich variety
of new exact analytical results for the KPZ dynamics. We present direct
evidence that the iso-height lines can be described by the family of conformal
invariant curves called Schramm-Loewner evolution (or $SLE_\kappa$) with
diffusivity $\kappa=8/3$. It is shown that the absence of the non-linear term
in the KPZ equation will change the diffusivity $\kappa$ from 8/3 to 4,
indicating that the iso-height lines of the Edwards-Wilkinson (EW) surface are
also conformally invariant, and belong to the universality class of the domain
walls in the O(2) spin model.
