We study magnetoresistivity oscillations in a high-mobility two-dimensional
electron system subject to both microwave and dc electric fields. First, we
observe that the oscillation amplitude is a periodic function of the inverse
magnetic field and is strongly suppressed at microwave frequencies near
half-integers of the cyclotron frequency. Second, we obtain a complete set of
conditions for the differential resistivity extrema and saddle points. These
findings indicate the importance of scattering without microwave absorption and
a special role played by microwave-induced scattering events antiparallel to
the electric field.
