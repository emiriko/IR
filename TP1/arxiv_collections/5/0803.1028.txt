Consider a rigid body having a fixed point in a superposition of two constant
force fields (for example, gravitational and magnetic). Introducing the
condition of Kowalevski type, O.I.Bogoyavlensky (1984) has found the first
integral generalizing that of Kowalevski and pointed out the integrable case
with two invariant relations, which reduces to the 1st Appelrot class when one
of the fields vanishes. The article presents a new case with two invariant
relations integrable in Jacobi sense and generalizing the 2nd and 3rd classes
of Appelrot.
