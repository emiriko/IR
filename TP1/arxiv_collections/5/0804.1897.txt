We report an electrically driven semiconductor single photon source capable
of emitting photons with a coherence time of up to 400 ps under fixed bias. It
is shown that increasing the injection current causes the coherence time to
reduce and this effect is well explained by the fast modulation of a
fluctuating environment. Hong-Ou-Mandel type two-photon interference using a
Mach-Zehnder interferometer is demonstrated using this source to test the
indistinguishability of individual photons by post-selecting events where two
photons collide at a beamsplitter. Finally, we consider how improvements in our
detection system can be used to achieve a higher interference visibility.
