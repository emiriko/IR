This paper treats two topics: matrices with sign patterns and Jacobians of
certain mappings. The main topic is counting the number of plus and minus
coefficients in the determinant expansion of sign patterns and of these
Jacobians. The paper is motivated by an approach to chemical networks initiated
by Craciun and Feinberg. We also give a graph-theoretic test for determining
when the Jacobian of a chemical reaction dynamics has a sign pattern.
