We present a fully relativistic formalism for describing neutrino-induced
$\Delta$-mediated single-pion production from nuclei. We assess the ambiguities
stemming from the $\Delta$ interactions. Variations in the cross sections of
over 10% are observed, depending on whether or not magnetic-dipole dominance is
assumed to extract the vector form factors. These uncertainties have a direct
impact on the accuracy with which the axial-vector form factors can be
extracted. Different predictions for $C_5^A(Q^2)$ induce up to 40-50% effects
on the $\Delta$-production cross sections. To describe the nucleus, we turn to
a relativistic plane-wave impulse approximation (RPWIA) using realistic
bound-state wave functions derived in the Hartree approximation to the
$\sigma$-$\omega$ Walecka model. For neutrino energies larger than 1 GeV, we
show that a relativistic Fermi-gas model with appropriate binding-energy
correction produces comparable results as the RPWIA which naturally includes
Fermi motion, nuclear-binding effects and the Pauli exclusion principle.
Including $\Delta$ medium modifications yields a 20 to 25% reduction of the
RPWIA cross section. The model presented in this work can be naturally extended
to include the effect of final-state interactions in a relativistic and
quantum-mechanical way. Guided by recent neutrino-oscillation experiments, such
as MiniBooNE and K2K, and future efforts like MINER$\nu$A, we present $Q^2$,
$W$, and various semi-inclusive distributions, both for a free nucleon and
carbon, oxygen and iron targets.
