We present direct evidence of enhanced Ga interdiffusion in InAs
free-standing nanowires grown at moderate temperatures by molecular beam
epitaxy on GaAs (111)B. Scanning electron microscopy together with X-ray
diffraction measurements in coplanar and grazing incidence geometries show that
nominally grown InAs NWs are actually made of In$_{0.86}$Ga$_{0.14}$As. Unlike
typical vapor-liquid-solid growth, these nanowires are formed by
diffusion-induced growth combined with strong interdiffusion from substrate
material. Based on the experimental results, a simple nanowire growth model
accounting for the Ga interdiffusion is also presented. This growth model could
be generally applicable to the molecular beam heteroepitaxy of III-V nanowires.
