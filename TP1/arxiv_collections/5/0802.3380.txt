We study the coupled dynamics of primary and secondary structure formation
(i.e. slow genetic sequence selection and fast folding) in the context of a
solvable microscopic model that includes both short-range steric forces and and
long-range polarity-driven forces. Our solution is based on the diagonalization
of replicated transfer matrices, and leads in the thermodynamic limit to
explicit predictions regarding phase transitions and phase diagrams at genetic
equilibrium. The predicted phenomenology allows for natural physical
interpretations, and finds satisfactory support in numerical simulations.
