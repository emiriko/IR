Detailed calculations of the transport coefficients of a recently introduced
particle-based model for fluid dynamics with a non-ideal equation of state are
presented. Excluded volume interactions are modeled by means of biased
stochastic multiparticle collisions which depend on the local velocities and
densities. Momentum and energy are exactly conserved locally. A general scheme
to derive transport coefficients for such biased, velocity dependent collision
rules is developed. Analytic expressions for the self-diffusion coefficient and
the shear viscosity are obtained, and very good agreement is found with
numerical results at small and large mean free paths. The viscosity turns out
to be proportional to the square root of temperature, as in a real gas. In
addition, the theoretical framework is applied to a two-component version of
the model, and expressions for the viscosity and the difference in diffusion of
the two species are given.
