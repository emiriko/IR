We propose and numerically investigate a scalable ring trap for cold atoms
that surmounts problems of roughness of the potential and end--effects of trap
wires. A stable trapping potential is formed about an electrically isolated,
conducting loop in an ac magnetic field by time averaging the superposition of
the external and induced magnetic fields. We investigate the use of additional
fields to eliminate Majorana spin flip losses and to create novel trapping
geometries. The possibility of micro--fabrication of these ring traps offers
the prospect of developing Sagnac atom interferometry in atom--chip devices.
