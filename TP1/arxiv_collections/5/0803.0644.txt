We report on the synthesis and on basic superconducting properties of a
completely new Mo_2Re_3B ternary boride. The crystal structure of the Mo_2Re_3B
compound is characterised by Pmmm space group and the cell parameters: a=11.626
A, b=8.465 A and c=8.026 A. The critical temperature is Tc=8.5 K, whereas the
lower and the upper-critical fields at zero temperature are equal to
Hc1(0)=19.2 mT and to Hc2(0)=3.7 T, respectively. The corresponding
Ginzburg-Landau parameter is equal to k=16.5 and the superconducting gap is
estimated to be 2delta/kTc=3.2.
