Grooves were etched in a conductive layer of a conductive, transparent glass,
and a nanoporous TiO2 film was deposited on both the conductive and
nonconductive area. The width of the grooves was 100 $\mu$m and 150 $\mu$m. A
transparent TiO2 film was dye-sensitized, covered with an electrolyte, and
sandwiched with a cover glass. The conductivity of the dye-sensitized TiO2 film
permeated with electrolyte was studied in the dark and under illumination, and
was observed to be dependent on light intensity, wavelength and applied
voltage. This study shows that dye-sensitized nanoporous films can be used as a
wavelength dependent photoconductor.
