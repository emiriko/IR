The near-horizon geometries of the spinning D3-, M2- and M5-branes are
examined by the probes immersed in a co-rotating frame. It is found that the
geometries become unstable at critical values of the spin angular velocity by
emitting the branes. We show that this instability corresponds to the
metastability of the black hole systems and different from the known (local)
thermodynamic instability. For the D3 case, the instability found here is in
complete agreement with the known metastability of the N=4 super-Yang-Mills
theory with R-symmetry chemical potentials.
