The notion of distance in Hilbert space is relevant in many scenarios. In
particular, distances between quantum states play a central role in quantum
information theory. An appropriate measure of distance is the quantum Jensen
Shannon divergence (QJSD) between quantum states. Here we study this distance
as a geometrical measure of entanglement and apply it to different families of
states.
