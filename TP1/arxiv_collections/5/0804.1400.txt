The well-known experimentally observed \textit{sp}-derived Au(111) Shockley
surface states with Rashba spin splitting are perfectly fit by an effective
tight-binding model, considering a two-dimensional hexagonal lattice with
$p_{z}$-orbital and nearest neighbor hopping only. The extracted realistic band
parameters are then imported to perform the Landauer-Keldysh formalism to
calculate nonequilibrium spin transport in a two-terminal setup sandwiching a
Au(111) surface channel. Obtained results show strong spin density on the
Au(111) surface and demonstrate (i) intrinsic spin-Hall effect, (ii)
current-induced spin polarization, and (iii) Rashba spin precession, all of
which have been experimentally observed in semiconductor heterostructures, but
not in metallic surface states. We therefore urge experiments in the latter for
these spin phenomena.
