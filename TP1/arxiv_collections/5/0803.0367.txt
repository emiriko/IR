A common feature of mycorrhizal observation is the growth of the infection on
the plant root as a percent of the infected root or root tip length. Often,
this is measured as a logistic curve with an eventual, though usually
transient, plateau. It is shown in this paper that the periods of stable
percent infection in the mycorrhizal growth cycle correspond to periods where
both the plant and mycorrhiza growth rates and likely metabolism are tightly
coupled.
