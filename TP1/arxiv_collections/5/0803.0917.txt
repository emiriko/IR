We study the cohomology of certain local systems on moduli spaces of
principally polarized abelian surfaces with a level 2 structure. The trace of
Frobenius on the alternating sum of the \'etale cohomology groups of these
local systems can be calculated by counting the number of pointed curves of
genus 2 with a prescribed number of Weierstrass points over the given finite
field. This cohomology is intimately related to vector-valued Siegel modular
forms. The corresponding scheme in level 1 was carried out in [FvdG]. Here we
extend this to level 2 where new phenomena appear.
  We determine the contribution of the Eisenstein cohomology together with its
S_6-action for the full level 2 structure and on the basis of our computations
we make precise conjectures on the endoscopic contribution. We also make a
prediction about the existence of a vector-valued analogue of the
Saito-Kurokawa lift. Assuming these conjectures that are based on ample
numerical evidence, we obtain the traces of the Hecke-operators T(p) for p < 41
on the remaining spaces of `genuine' Siegel modular forms. We present a number
of examples of 1-dimensional spaces of eigenforms where these traces coincide
with the Hecke eigenvalues. We hope that the experts on lifting and on
endoscopy will be able to prove our conjectures.
