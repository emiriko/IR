To date, there has been no evidence for the macroscopic structural phase
transition to the low temperature tetragonal structure (LTT) with a space group
P42/ncm in high-TC cuprate of rare earth-free La2-xSrxCuO4 (LSCO). By
investigating Cu-NMR on single crystals, we have found that spatially
incoherent LTT structure emerges below 50 K in the sample with x=0.12. This
incoherent structure is considered to play a key role for the slight depression
of the superconductivity around x=1/8.
