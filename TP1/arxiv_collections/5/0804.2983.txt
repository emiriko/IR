This work clarifies the relation between network circuit (topology) and
behavior (information transmission and synchronization) in active networks,
e.g. neural networks. As an application, we show how to determine a network
topology that is optimal for information transmission. By optimal, we mean that
the network is able to transmit a large amount of information, it possesses a
large number of communication channels, and it is robust under large variations
of the network coupling configuration. This theoretical approach is general and
does not depend on the particular dynamic of the elements forming the network,
since the network topology can be determined by finding a Laplacian matrix (the
matrix that describes the connections and the coupling strengths among the
elements) whose eigenvalues satisfy some special conditions. To illustrate our
ideas and theoretical approaches, we use neural networks of electrically
connected chaotic Hindmarsh-Rose neurons.
