We experimentally and theoretically analyze the transmission of
continuous-wave and pulsed squeezed vacuum through rubidium vapor under the
conditions of electromagnetically induced transparency. Frequency- and
time-domain homodyne tomography is used to measure the quadrature noise and
reconstruct the quantum states of the transmitted light. A simple theoretical
model explains the spectrum and degradation of the transmitted squeezing with
high precision.
