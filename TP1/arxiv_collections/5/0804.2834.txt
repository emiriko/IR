We obtain, via the Gauss-Codazzi formalism, the expression of the effective
Einstein-Brans-Dicke projected equations in a non-$\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ symmetric
braneworld scenario which presents hybrid compactification. It is shown that
the functional form of such equations resembles the one in the Einstein's case,
except by the fact that they bring extra informations in the context of exotic
compactifications.
