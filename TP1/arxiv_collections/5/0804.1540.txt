We present a neutron and X-rays scattering study of the phase transitions of
4-n-octyl-4'-cyanobiphenyl (8CB) confined in unidirectional nanopores of porous
alumina and porous silicon (PSi) membranes with an average diameter of 30 nm.
Spatial confinement reveals a rich polymorphism, with at least four different
low temperature phases in addition to the smectic A phase. The structural study
as a function of thermal treatments and conditions of spatial confinement
allows us to get insights into the formation of these phases and their relative
stability. It gives the first description of the complete phase behavior of 8CB
confined in PSi and provides a direct comparison with results obtained in bulk
conditions and in similar geometric conditions of confinement but with reduced
quenched disorder effects using alumina anopore membranes
