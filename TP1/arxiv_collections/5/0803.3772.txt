Possible superconductivity of electrons with the Dirac spectrum is analyzed
using the BCS model. We calculate the critical temperature, the superconducting
energy gap, and supercurrent as functions of the doping level and of the
pairing interaction strength. Zero doping is characterized by existence of the
quantum critical point such that the critical temperature vanishes below some
finite value of the interaction strength. However, the critical temperature
remains finite for any nonzero electron or hole doping level when the Fermi
energy is shifted away from the Dirac point of the normal-state electron
spectrum. We analyze the behavior of the characteristic length scales, i.e.,
the London penetration depth and the coherence length, which determine the
critical magnetic fields.
