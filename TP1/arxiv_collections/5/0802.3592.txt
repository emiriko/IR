We study the CP-violating terms of the spin-spin correlations in chargino
production e+e- -> chi^+/-_1 chi^-/+_2, and their subsequent two-body decays
into sneutrinos plus leptons. We propose novel CP-sensitive observables with
the help of T-odd products of the spin-spin terms. These terms depend on the
polarizations of both charginos, with one polarization perpendicular to the
production plane. We identify two classes of CP-sensitive observables; one
requires the reconstruction of the production plane, the other not. Our
framework is the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model with complex parameters.
