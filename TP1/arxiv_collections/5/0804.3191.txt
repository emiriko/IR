An accurate model of a vertical pillar quantum dot is described. The full
three dimensional structure of the device containing the dot is taken into
account and this leads to an effective two dimensional model in which electrons
move in the two lateral dimensions, the confinement is parabolic and the
interaction potential is very different from the bare Coulomb potential. The
potentials are found from the device structure and a few adjustable parameters.
Numerically stable calculation procedures for the interaction potential are
detailed and procedures for deriving parameter values from experimental
addition energy and chemical potential data are described. The model is able to
explain magnetic field dependent addition energy and chemical potential data
for an individual dot to an accuracy of about 5%, the accuracy level needed to
determine ground state quantum numbers from experimental transport data.
Applications to excited state transport data are also described.
