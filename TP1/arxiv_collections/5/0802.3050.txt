This paper presents several design issues related to the monolithic
integration of a 3-phase AC to DC low voltage, low power rectifier for 3-phase
micro source electrical conditioning. Reduced input voltage operation (down to
1V), high efficiency, and output voltage regulations are implemented, based on
commercially available CMOS technology. Global design and system issues are
detailed. The management of start-up sequences under self supplied conditions
as well as output voltage regulations are specifically addressed. Simulation
results, practical implementation and validation are presented. They are based
on the association of three micro elements : a 3-phase micro-generator, a stand
alone 3-phase AC to DC integrated rectifier, and an output voltage conditioner
based on a commercially available IC.
