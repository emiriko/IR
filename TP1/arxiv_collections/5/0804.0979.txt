In principle, by accepting the idea of a non-zero vacuum energy, the physical
vacuum of present particle physics might represent a preferred reference frame.
By treating this quantum vacuum as a relativistic medium, the non-zero
energy-momentum flow expected in a moving frame should effectively behave as a
small thermal gradient and could, in principle, induce a measurable anisotropy
of the speed of light in a loosely bound system as a gas. We explore the
phenomenological implications of this scenario by considering a new class of
dedicated ether-drift experiments where arbitrary gaseous media fill the
resonating optical cavities. Our predictions cover most experimental set up and
should motivate precise experimental tests of these fundamental issues.
