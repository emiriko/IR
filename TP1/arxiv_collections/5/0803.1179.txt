We study strain localization as an enhanced velocity weakening mechanism on
earthquake faults. Fault friction is modeled using Shear Transformation Zone
(STZ) Theory, a microscopic physical model for non-affine rearrangements in
granular fault gouge. STZ Theory is implemented in spring slider and dynamic
rupture models of faults. We compare dynamic shear localization to deformation
that is uniform throughout the gouge layer, and find that localized slip
enhances the velocity weakening of the gouge. Localized elastodynamic ruptures
have larger stress drops and higher peak slip rates than ruptures with
homogeneous strain.
