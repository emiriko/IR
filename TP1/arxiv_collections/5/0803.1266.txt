Stochastic point processes relevant to the theory of long-range aperiodic
order are considered that display diffraction spectra of mixed type, with
special emphasis on explicitly computable cases together with a unified
approach of reasonable generality. The latter is based on the classical theory
of point processes and the Palm distribution. Several pairs of autocorrelation
and diffraction measures are discussed which show a duality structure analogous
to that of the Poisson summation formula for lattice Dirac combs.
