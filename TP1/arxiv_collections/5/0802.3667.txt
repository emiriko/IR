It has been suggested that anisotropic quasiparticle scattering will
stabilize anisotropic phases of superfluid $^3$He contained within highly
porous silica aerogel. For example, global anisotropy introduced via uniaxial
compression of aerogel might stabilize the axial state, which is called the
A-phase in bulk superfluid 3He. Here we present measurements of the phase
diagram of superfluid 3He in a 98% porous silica aerogel using transverse
acoustic impedance methods. We show that uniaxial compression of the aerogel by
17% does not stabilize an axial phase.
