A new integrable (2+1)-dimensional nonlocal nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation
is proposed. The $N$-soliton solution is given by Gram type determinant. It is
found that the localized N-soliton solution has interesting interaction
behavior which shows change of amplitude of localized pulses after collisions.
