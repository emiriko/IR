We show that spin-density separation in a Bose gas is not restricted to 1D
but also occurs in higher dimension. The ratio ($\alpha$) of the intra-species
atom-atom interaction strength to the inter-species interaction strength,
strongly influences the dynamics of spin-density separation and the elementary
excitations. The density wave is phonon-like for all values of $\alpha$. For
$\alpha<1$, spin wave is also phonon-like. The spin waves have a quadratic
dispersion in the $\alpha=1$ coupling regime, while in the phase separated
regime ($\alpha>1$) the spin waves are found to be damped. The dynamical
structure factor (DSF) reveals two distinct peaks corresponding to the density
and spin waves for $\alpha \le 1$. For $\alpha > 1$ there is only one DSF peak
corresponding to the density wave.
