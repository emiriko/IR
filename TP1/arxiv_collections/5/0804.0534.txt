We consider Kemp's q-analogue of the binomial distribution. Several
convergence results involving the classical binomial, the Heine, the discrete
normal, and the Poisson distribution are established. Some of them are
q-analogues of classical convergence properties. Besides elementary estimates,
we apply Mellin transform asymptotics.
