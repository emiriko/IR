The viscosity and self-diffusion constant of particle-based mesoscale
hydrodynamic methods, multi-particle collision dynamics (MPC) and dissipative
particle dynamics (DPD), are investigated, both with and without
angular-momentum conservation. Analytical results are derived for fluids with
an ideal-gas equation of state and a finite-time-step dynamics, and compared
with simulation data. In particular, the viscosity is derived in a general form
for all variants of the MPC method. In general, very good agreement between
theory and simulations is obtained.
