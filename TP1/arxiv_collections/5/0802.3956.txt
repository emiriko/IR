We prove an optimal estimate on the smallest singular value of a random
subgaussian matrix, valid for all fixed dimensions. For an N by n matrix A with
independent and identically distributed subgaussian entries, the smallest
singular value of A is at least of the order \sqrt{N} - \sqrt{n-1} with high
probability. A sharp estimate on the probability is also obtained.
