We determine the exact many-body properties of a bosonic Tonks-Girardeau gas
confined in a harmonic potential with a tunable $\delta$-function barrier at
the trap center. This is done by calculating the reduced single particle
density matrix, the pair-distribution function, and momentum distribution of
the gas as a function of barrier strength and particle number. With increasing
barrier height we find that the ground state occupation in a diagonal basis
diverges from the $\sqrt N$ behavior that is expected for the case of a simple
harmonic trap. In fact, the scaling of the occupation number depends on whether
one has an even or odd number of particles. Since this quantity is a measure of
the coherence of our sample we show how the odd-even effect manifests itself in
both the momentum distribution of the Bose gas and interference fringe
visibility during free temporal evolution.
