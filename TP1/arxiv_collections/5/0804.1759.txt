Recent progress in the field of ultracold gases has allowed the creation of
phase-segregated Bose-Fermi systems. We present a theoretical study of their
collective excitations at zero temperature. As the fraction of fermion to boson
particle number increases, the collective mode frequencies take values between
those for a fully bosonic and those for a fully fermionic cloud, with damping
in the intermediate region. This damping is caused by fermions which are
resonantly driven at the interface.
