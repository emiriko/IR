This note investigates the size of the guard band for non-periodic discrete
Hilbert transform, which has recently been proposed for data hiding and
security applications. It is shown that a guard band equal to the duration of
the message is sufficient for a variety of analog signals and is, therefore,
likely to be adequate for discrete or digital data.
