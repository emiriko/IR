By re-examining recently-published data from angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy we demonstrate that, in the superconducting region of the phase
diagram, the pseudogap ground state is an arc metal. This scenario is
consistent with results from Raman spectroscopy, specific heat and NMR. In
addition, we propose an explanation for the "Fermi pockets" inferred from
quantum oscillations in terms of a pseudogapped bilayer Fermi surface.
