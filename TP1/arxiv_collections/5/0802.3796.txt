Very recently (by which we mean two days ago), Y. Sekiwa submitted a paper
[arXiv:0802.3266] that dismisses some previous calculations of the de Sitter
radiative temperature. Significantly, these calculations employed the
(so-called) tunneling methodology, which the stated author then goes on to
correspondingly revise. After briefly commenting on what the tunneling
framework can be claimed to say and what it cannot, we respond to the author's
criticisms and proposed revision.
