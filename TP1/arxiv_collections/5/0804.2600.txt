We study various properties of an ultracold two-dimensional (2D) Bose gas
that are beyond a mean-field description. We first derive the effective
interaction for such a system as realized in current experiments, which
requires the use of an energy dependent $T$-matrix. Using this result, we then
solve the mean-field equation of state of the modified Popov theory, and
compare it with the usual Hartree-Fock theory. We show that even though the
former theory does not suffer from infrared divergences in both the normal and
superfluid phases, there is an unphysical density discontinuity close to the
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. We then improve upon the mean-field
description by using a renormalization group approach and show how the density
discontinuity is resolved. The flow equations in two dimensions, in particular,
of the symmetry-broken phase, already contain some unique features pertinent to
the 2D XY model, even though vortices have not been included explicitly. We
also compute various many-body correlators, and show that correlation effects
beyond the Hartree-Fock theory are important already in the normal phase as
criticality is approached. We finally extend our results to the inhomogeneous
case of a trapped Bose gas using the local-density approximation and show that
close to criticality, the renormalization group approach is required for the
accurate determination of the density profile.
