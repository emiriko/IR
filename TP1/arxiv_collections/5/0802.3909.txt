The $\eta$-$\eta^\prime$ mixing angle is deduced from an updated
phenomenological analysis of $J/\psi$ decays into a vector and a pseudoscalar
meson. Corrections due to non-ideal $\omega$-$\phi$ mixing are confirmed to be
crucial to find $\theta_P=(-16.9\pm 1.7)^\circ$, in agreement with most recent
analyses. The newly reported values of $B(J/\psi\to\rho\pi)$ by the BABAR and
BES Collaborations make more difficult a reasonable description of data.
