Ac electrokinetic flows are commonly used for manipulating micron-scale
particles in a biosensor system. At the solid-liquid state there are two kinds
of processes in the reaction between analytes and ligands: the mass transport
process and the chemical reaction process. The mass transport process is
related to convection and diffusion. Total or partial limit of mass transport
would retard the diffusion from the bulk fluid to the interface of reaction.
This effect decreases the possibility of adsorption of analyte and ligand
because the chemical reaction is faster than the diffusion. In order to solve
this problem, we apply an ac electric field to induce a vortex field by the
electrothermal effect, which helps in increasing the rate of diffusion. By
using the finite element analysis software, COMSOL Multiphysics, we optimized
several parameters of the microelectrode structures and the position of the
reacting surface, i.e. the microcantilever, by a simplified 2-D model and a 3-D
model. It is successful in accelerating the reacting rate of the molecule which
is limited by mass transport. The factor of the efficiency is about 1.429 when
the operating voltage is 15 Vrms peak-to-peak. In addition, the surface
concentration of the complex on the microcantilever has been simulated.
