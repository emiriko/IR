In this work, we present a fully parameterized capped transmission line model
for electromagnetic optimization of a wafer level package (WLP) for RF MEMS
applications using the Ansoft HFSS-TM electromagnetic simulator. All the
degrees of freedom (DoF's) in the package fabrication can be modified within
the model in order to optimize for losses and mismatch (capacitive and
inductive couplings) introduced by the cap affecting the MEMS RF behaviour.
Ansoft HFSS-TM was also validated for the simulation of capped RF MEMS devices
by comparison against experimental data. A test run of capped 50 transmission
lines and shorts was fabricated and tested.
