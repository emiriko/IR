We examine the recent COMPASS data on the spin structure function g_1
singlet. We show that it is rather difficult to use the data in the present
form in order to draw conclusions on the initial parton densities. However, our
tentative estimate is that the data better agree with positive rather than
negative initial gluon densities.
