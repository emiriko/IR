We propose a dynamical model for business cycle based on an optimal DI model.
In the model there exists a conserved quantity, which corresponds to the total
energy in a dynamical system. We found that the business cycle with the period
6 or 7 years is nicely reproduced, since the model predicts a periodic motion
in the conservative system.
