Photogalvanic effects are observed and investigated in wurtzite
(0001)-oriented GaN/AlGaN low-dimensional structures excited by terahertz
radiation. The structures are shown to represent linear quantum ratchets.
Experimental and theoretical analysis exhibits that the observed photocurrents
are related to the lack of an inversion center in the GaN-based
heterojunctions.
