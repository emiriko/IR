We investigate the persistent spin currents in one- and two-dimensional
electron systems with spin-orbit interaction in thermodynamics equilibrium at
absolute zero temperature. The persistent spin current is the intrinsic one
which is connected with the Berry phases in the configuration spaces of an
electron system and winding numbers in the field configurations of electrons.
When the topological space of the configuration of a system has the nontrivial
first homotopy groups, the persistent spin currents in the system could be
nonzero and not easily destroyed by impurity scattering in ballistic limit. The
non-vanishing background spin currents in infinite two-dimensional electron
system found by Rashba could be realized by the transport persistent spin
currents in a finite torus electron system with spin-orbit interaction. In this
sense, we meet the challenge proposed by Rashba.
