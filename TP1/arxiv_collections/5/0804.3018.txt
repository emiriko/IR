We prove a law of large numbers and a central limit theorem for a tagged
particle in a symmetric simple exclusion process in the one-dimensional lattice
with variable diffusion coefficient. The scaling limits are obtained from a
similar result for the current through -1/2 for a zero-range process with bond
disorder. For the CLT, we prove convergence to a fractional Brownian motion of
Hurst exponent 1/4.
