We investigate nuclear-resonant electron scattering as occurring in the
two-step process of nuclear excitation by electron capture (NEEC) followed by
internal conversion. The nuclear excitation and decay are treated by a
phenomenological collective model in which nuclear states and transition
probabilities are described by experimental parameters. We present capture
rates and resonant strengths for a number of heavy ion collision systems
considering various scenarios for the resonant electron scattering process. The
results show that for certain cases resonant electron scattering can have
significantly larger resonance strengths than NEEC followed by the radiative
decay of the nucleus. We discuss the impact of our findings on the possible
experimental observation of NEEC.
