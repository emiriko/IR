The physicists working in several areas of research know quite well the name
of Ettore Majorana, since it is currently associated to fundamental concepts
like {\it Majorana neutrinos} in particle physics and cosmology or {\it
Majorana fermions} in condensed matter physics. But, probably, very few is
known about other substantial contributions of that ingenious scholar, and even
less about his personal background. For non specialists, instead, the name of
Ettore Majorana is usually intimately related to the fact that he disappeared
rather mysteriously on March 26, 1938, just seventy years ago, and was never
seen again. The life and the work of this Italian scientist is the object of
the present review, which will also offer a summary of the main results
achieved in recent times by the historical and scientific researches on his
work.
