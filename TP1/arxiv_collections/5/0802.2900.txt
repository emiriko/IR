The structure of a single antiparallel ferroelectric domain wall in LiNbO3 is
quantitatively mapped by piezoelectric force microscopy (PFM) with calibrated
probe geometry. The PFM measurements are performed for 49 probes with the
radius varying from 10 to 300 nm. The magnitude and variation of the
experimental piezoelectric coefficient across a domain wall matches the
profiles calculated from a comprehensive analytical theory, as well as
3-dimensional finite element method simulations. Quantitative agreement between
experimental and theoretical profile widths is obtained only when a finite
disk-type tip radius that is in true contact with the sample surface is
considered, which is in agreement with scanning electron microscopy images of
the actual tips after imaging. The magnitude of the piezoelectric coefficient
is shown to be independent of the tip radius, and the PFM profile width is
linearly proportional to the tip radius. Finally we demonstrate a method to
extract any intrinsic material broadening of the ferroelectric wall width.
Surprisingly wide wall widths of 20- 200nm are observed.
