We present a joint implementation of dynamical-mean-field theory (DMFT) with
the pseudopotential plane-wave approach, via Wannier functions, for the
determination of the electronic properties of strongly correlated materials.
The scheme uses, as input for the DMFT calculations, a tight-binding
Hamiltonian obtained from the plane-wave calculations by projecting onto
atomic-centered symmetry-constrained Wannier functions for the correlated
orbitals. We apply this scheme to two prototype systems: a paramagnetic
correlated metal, SrVO3, and a paramagnetic correlated system, V2O3, which
exhibits a metal-insulator transition. Comparison with available
Linear-Muffin-Tin-Orbital (LMTO) plus DMFT calculations demonstrate the
suitability of the joint DMFT pseudopotential-plane-wave approach to describe
the electronic properties of strongly correlated materials. This opens the way
to future developments using the pseudopotential-plane-wave DMFT approach to
address also total-energy properties, such as structural properties.
