The exact solubility of the Kitaev-type spin honeycomb lattice model was
proved by means of a Majorana fermion representation or a Jordan-Wigner
transformation while the explicit form of the anyon in terms of Pauli matrices
became not transparent. The nonabelian statistics of anyons and the fusion
rules can only be expressed in indirect ways to Pauli matrices. We convert the
ground state and anyonic excitations back to the forms of Pauli matrices and
explicitly demonstrate the nonabelian anyonic statistics as well as the fusion
rules. These results may instruct the experimental realization of the
nonabelian anyons. We suggest a proof-in-principle experiment to verify the
existence of the nonabelian anyons in nature.
