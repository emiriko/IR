Fully consistent axially-symmetric-deformed Quasi-particle Random Phase
Approximation (QRPA) calculations have been performed, in which the same Gogny
D1S effective force has been used for both the Hartree-Fock-Bogolyubov mean
field and the QRPA approaches. Giant resonances calculated in deformed
$^{26-28}$Si and $^{22-24}$Mg nuclei as well as in the spherical $^{30}$Si and
$^{28}$Mg isotopes are presented. Theoretical results for isovector-dipole and
isoscalar monopole, quadrupole, and octupole responses are presented and the
impact of the intrinsic nuclear deformation is discussed.
