We recently proposed a scheme for the creation of coherent superpositions of
vortex states in Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) using orbital angular momentum
(OAM) states of light [Phys. Rev. Lett. 95, 173601 (2005)]. Here we discuss
further technical details of the proposal, provide alternative,
time-reversal-symmetric scheme for transfer of a superposition of OAM states of
light to the BEC via a procedure analogous to the traditional STimulated Raman
Adiabatic Passage (STIRAP) technique, and discuss an alternative trap
configuration conducive for sustaining large charge vortices. Superpositions of
OAM states of light, created using experimental techniques, can be transfered
to an initially nonrotating BEC via a specially devised Raman coupling scheme.
The techniques proposed here open up avenues to study coherent interaction of
OAM states of light with matter. The study could also be employed for
performing various quantum information processing tasks with OAM states of
light--including a memory for a quantum state of the initial superposition.
