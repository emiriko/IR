Dielectric and magnetic phenomena in spin and charge frustrated system RFe2O4
(R is a rare-earth metal ion) are studied. An electronic model for charge, spin
and orbital degrees in a pair of triangular-lattice planes is derived. We
analyze this model by utilizing the mean-field approximation and the
Monte-Carlo simulation in a finite size cluster. A three fold-type charge
ordered structure with charge imbalance between the planes is stabilized in
finite temperatures. This polar charge order is reinforced by spin ordering of
Fe ions. This novel magneto-dielectric phenomenon is caused by spin frustration
and charge-spin coupling in the exchange interaction. We show cross-correlation
effect in magnetic- and electric-field responses. Oxygen deficiency effect as
an impurity effect in a frustrated charge-spin coupled system is also examined.
