Generic classically integrable boundary conditions for the $A_{n}^{(1)}$
affine Toda field theories (ATFT) are investigated. The present analysis rests
primarily on the underlying algebra, defined by the classical version of the
reflection equation. We use as a prototype example the first non-trivial model
of the hierarchy i.e. the $A_2^{(1)}$ ATFT, however our results may be
generalized for any $A_{n}^{(1)}$ ($n>1$). We assume here two distinct types of
boundary conditions called some times soliton preserving (SP), and soliton
non-preserving (SNP) associated to two distinct algebras, i.e. the reflection
algebra and the ($q$) twisted Yangian respectively. The boundary local
integrals of motion are then systematically extracted from the asymptotic
expansion of the associated transfer matrix. In the case of SNP boundary
conditions we recover previously known results. The other type of boundary
conditions (SP), associated to the reflection algebra, are novel in this
context and lead to a different set of conserved quantities that depend on free
boundary parameters. It also turns out that the number of local integrals of
motion for SP boundary conditions is `double' compared to those of the SNP
case.
