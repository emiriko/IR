It is tempting to try to explain the reported time-modulated decay rate in
the GSI experiment by arguing that the matrix element for decay at any time
results in an interference between two slightly different momentum values in
the parent ion beam. I show here that a unitarity theorem of quantum mechanics
rules out a wide class of such explanations.
