We propose a scheme in which entanglement can be transferred from atoms
(discrete variables) to entangled states of cavity fields (continuous
variables). The cavities play the role of a kind of quantum memory for
entanglement, in such a way that it is possible to retrieve it back to the
atoms. In our method, two three level atoms in a lambda configuration,
previously entangled, are set to interact with single mode cavity fields
prepared in coherent states. During the process, one e-bit of entanglement may
be deposited in the cavities in an efficient way. We also show that the stored
entanglement may be transferred back to flying atoms.
