We investigate the indirect effects of heavy vector bileptons being exchanged
in polarized Moller scattering, at the next generation of linear colliders.
Considering both longitudinal and transverse beam polarization, and accounting
for initial-state radiation, beamstrahlung and beam energy spread, we discuss
how angular distributions and asymmetries can be used to detect clear signals
of virtual bileptons, and the possibility of distinguishing theoretical models
that incorporate these exotic particles. We then estimate 95% C.L. bounds on
the mass of these vector bileptons and on their couplings to electrons.
