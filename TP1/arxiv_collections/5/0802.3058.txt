A general description of the long-range elastic interaction is proposed. The
far-field type of the interaction is determined by the way of symmetry breaking
of the distribution of the elastic field produced by the topological defect as
isolated inclusions. Every topological defect can be present as the source of
the elastic field and can be described in the terms of this field. At the short
distance the source can be described as nonlinear object which present charge
of linear theory of elastic field at the far distance. In this article the
nonlinear models of source of a elastic field was proposed.
