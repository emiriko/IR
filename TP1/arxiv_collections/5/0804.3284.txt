We determine the ground-state phase-diagram of a Hubbard Hamiltonian with
correlated hopping, which is asymmetric under particle-hole transform. By
lowering the repulsive Coulomb interaction U at appropriate filling and
interaction parameters, the ground state separates into a hole and an electron
conducting phases: two different wave vectors characterize the system and
charge-charge correlations become incommensurate. By further decreasing U
another transition occurs at which the hole conducting region becomes
insulating, and conventional phase separation takes place. Finally, for
negative U the whole system eventually becomes a paired insulator. It is
speculated that such behavior could be at the origin of the incommensurate
superconducting phase recently discovered in the 1D Hirsch model. The exact
phase boundaries are calculated in one dimension.
