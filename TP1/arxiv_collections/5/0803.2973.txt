Intrusion Detection Systems (ids)provide an important layer of security for
computer systems and networks, and are becoming more and more necessary as
reliance on Internet services increases and systems with sensitive data are
more commonly open to Internet access. An ids responsibility is to detect
suspicious or unacceptable system and network activity and to alert a systems
administrator to this activity. The majority of ids use a set of signatures
that define what suspicious traffic is, and Snort is one popular and actively
developing open-source ids that uses such a set of signatures known as Snort
rules. Our aim is to identify a way in which Snort could be developed further
by generalising rules to identify novel attacks. In particular, we attempted to
relax and vary the conditions and parameters of current Snort rules, using a
similar approach to classic rule learning operators such as generalisation and
specialisation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through
experiments with standard datasets and show that we are able to detect
previously undeleted variants of various attacks. We conclude by discussing the
general effectiveness and appropriateness of generalisation in Snort based ids
rule processing.
