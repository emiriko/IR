A factorization formula for certain automorphisms of a Poisson algebra
associated to a quiver is proved, which involves framed versions of moduli
spaces of quiver representations. This factorization formula is related to
wall-crossing formulas for Donaldson-Thomas type invariants of M. Kontsevich
and Y. Soibelman.
