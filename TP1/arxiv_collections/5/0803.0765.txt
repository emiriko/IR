We discuss the collider phenomenology of TeV Z' gauge bosons related to the
absence of a bare mu-term in the superpotential. Decays of the type Z' -->
Higgsinos can directly test whether a gauge symmetry is responsible for
forbidding the Higgsino mass. Decays to multi-lepton final states may allow
these signatures to be observed at the Large Hadron Collider. We comment on
whether it will be possible to state definitively that the mu-term is forbidden
via a gauge symmetry.
