We calculate the dependence on an applied electric field of the g tensor of a
single electron in a self-assembled InAs/GaAs quantum dot. We identify dot
sizes and shapes for which one in-plane component of the g tensor changes sign
for realistic electric fields, and show this should permit full Bloch-sphere
control of the electron spin in the quantum dot using only a static magnetic
field and a single vertical electric gate.
