Orientational glasses with CO molecules occupying 26% and 90% of the
octahedral interstitial sites in the C60 lattice have been investigated by the
dilatometric method in a temperature interval of 2.5 - 23 K. At temperatures 4
- 6 K the glasses undergo a first-order phase transition which is evident from
the hysteresis of the thermal expansion and the maxima in the temperature
dependences of the linear thermal expansion coefficients, and the
thermalization times of the samples. The effect of the noncentral CO-C60
interaction upon the thermal expansion and the phase transition in these
glasses was clarified by comparing the behavior of the properties of the CO-C60
and N2-C60 solutions.
