We performed a comparative analysis of the arguments of Einstein, Podolsky
and Rosen -- EPR, 1935 (against the completeness of QM) and the theoretical
formalism of QM (due to von Neumann, 1932). We found that the EPR
considerations do not match at all with the von Neumann's theory. Thus EPR did
not criticize the real theoretical model of QM. The root of EPR's paradoxical
conclusion on incompleteness of QM is the misuse of von Neumann's projection
postulate. EPR applied this postulate to observables with degenerate spectra
(which is totally forbidden by the axiomatics of QM).
