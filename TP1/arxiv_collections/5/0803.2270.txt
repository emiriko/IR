We study, using molecular dynamics simulations, the kinetics of shape
recovery in a model solid undergoing transformations from square to a general
rhombic lattice, the triangular lattice being included as a special case. We
determine the necessary and sufficient conditions for such shape recovery in
terms of the nature and dynamics of transient and localized {\em non-affine
zones} which inevitably accompany the transformation.
