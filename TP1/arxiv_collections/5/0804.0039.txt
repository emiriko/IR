Doppler shift observations of spacecraft, such as Galileo, NEAR, Cassini,
Rosetta and MESSENGER in earth flybys, have all revealed unexplained speed
`anomalies' - that the doppler-shift determined speeds are inconsistent with
expected speeds. Here it is shown that these speed anomalies are not real and
are actually the result of using an incorrect relationship between the observed
doppler shift and the speed of the spacecraft - a relationship based on the
assumption that the speed of light is isotropic in all frames, i.e. invariant.
Taking account of the repeatedly measured light-speed anisotropy the anomalies
are resolved. The Pioneer 10/11 anomalies are discussed, but not resolved. The
spacecraft observations demonstrate again that the speed of light is not
invariant, and is isotropic only with respect to a dynamical 3-space. The
existing doppler shift data also offers a resource to characterise a new form
of gravitational waves, the dynamical 3-space turbulence, that has also been
detected by other techniques.
