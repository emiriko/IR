The ancestral selection graph in population genetics was introduced by
KroneNeuhauser (1997) as an analogue of the coalescent genealogy of a sample of
genes from a neutrally evolving population. The number of particles in this
graph, followed backwards in time, is a birth and death process with quadratic
death and linear birth rates. In this paper an explicit form of the probability
distribution of the number of particles is obtained by using the density of the
allele frequency in the corresponding diffusion model obtained by Kimura
(1955). It is shown that the process of fixation of the allele in the diffusion
model corresponds to convergence of the ancestral process to its stationary
measure. The time to fixation of the allele conditional on fixation is studied
in terms of the ancestral process.
