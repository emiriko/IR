We demonstrate control and stabilization of an optical frequency comb
generated by four-wave mixing in a monolithic microresonator with a mode
spacing in the microwave regime (86 GHz). The comb parameters (mode spacing and
offset frequency) are controlled via the power and the frequency of the pump
laser, which constitutes one of the comb modes. Furthermore, generation of a
microwave beat note at the comb's mode spacing frequency is presented, enabling
direct stabilization to a microwave frequency standard.
