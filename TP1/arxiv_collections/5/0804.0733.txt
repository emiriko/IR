Wu, Lou, Lai and Chang proposed a multi-exponentiation algorithm using binary
complements and the non-adjacent form. The purpose of this paper is to show
that neither the analysis of the algorithm given by its original proposers nor
that by other authors are correct. In fact it turns out that the complement
operation does not have significant influence on the performance of the
algorithm and can therefore be omitted.
