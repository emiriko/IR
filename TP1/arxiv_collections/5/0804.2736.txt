We consider an ordered ferromagnet in the vicinity of a T=0 transition into a
paramagnet. We show that the free energy and the transverse and longitudinal
static susceptibilities contain non-analyticities which destroy a continuous
second-order transition. Depending on the parameters, the transition either
becomes first-order, or occurs via an intermediate spiral phase.
