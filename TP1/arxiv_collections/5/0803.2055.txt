We employ a novel new approach to study local quark-hadron duality using
"truncated" moments, or integrals of structure functions over restricted
regions of x, to determine the degree to which individual resonance regions are
dominated by leading twist. Because truncated moments obey the same Q^2
evolution equations as the leading twist parton distributions, this approach
makes possible for the first time a description of resonance region data and
the phenomenon of quark-hadron duality directly from QCD.
