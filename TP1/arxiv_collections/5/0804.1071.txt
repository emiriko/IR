Combining infrared reflectivity, transport, susceptibility and several
diffraction techniques, we find compelling evidence that CaCrO3 is a rare case
of a metallic and antiferromagnetic transition-metal oxide with a
three-dimensional electronic structure. LSDA calculations correctly describe
the metallic behavior as well as the anisotropic magnetic ordering pattern of C
type: The high Cr valence state induces via sizeable pd hybridization
remarkably strong next-nearest neighbor interactions stabilizing this ordering.
The subtle balance of magnetic interactions gives rise to magneto-elastic
coupling, explaining pronounced structural anomalies observed at the magnetic
ordering transition.
