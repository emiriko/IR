Recently, coexistence of ferromagnetism (T_Curie = 2.8K) and
superconductivity (T_sc = 0.8K) has been reported in UCoGe, a compound close to
a ferromagnetic instability at ambient pressure P. Here we present resistivity
measurements under pressure on a UCoGe polycrystal. The phase diagram obtained
from resistivity measurements on a polycrystalline sample is found to be
qualitatively different to those of all other ferromagnetic superconductors. By
applying high pressure, ferromagnetism is suppressed at a rate of 1.4 K/GPa. No
indication of ferromagnetic order has been observed above P ~ 1GPa. The
resistive superconducting transition is, however, quite stable in temperature
and persists up to the highest measured pressure of about 2.4GPa.
Superconductivity would therefore appear also in the paramagnetic phase.
However, the appearance of superconductivity seems to change at a
characteristic pressure P* ~ 0.8GPa. Close to a ferromagnetic instability, the
homogeneity of the sample can influence strongly the electronic and magnetic
properties and therefore bulk phase transitions may differ from the
determination by resistivity measurements.
