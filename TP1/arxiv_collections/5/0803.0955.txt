We consider the dynamics of a meromorphic map on a compact kahler surface
whose topological degree is smaller than its first dynamical degree. The latter
quantity is the exponential rate at which its iterates expand the cohomology
class of a kahler form. Our goal in this article and its sequels is to carry
out a conjectural program for constructing and analyzing a natural measure of
maximal entropy for each such map. Here we take the first step, converting
information about the linear action of the map on cohomology to invariant
currents with special geometric structure. We also give some examples and
identify some additional properties of maps on irrational surfaces and of maps
whose invariant cohomology classes have vanishing self-intersection.
