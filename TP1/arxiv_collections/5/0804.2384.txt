We present a scheme, based only on linear optics and standard photon
detection, that allows to generate heralded multiphoton entangled states of
arbitrary photon number from spontaneous parametric downconversion (PDC) in the
weak interaction regime. The scheme also works in the strong interaction
regime, i.e., for the production of large photon numbers, when photon-number
resolving detectors with nearly perfect quantum efficiency are used. In
addition, the same setup can be used for quantum metrology as multiphoton
interferometer with sensitivity at the Heisenberg limit.
