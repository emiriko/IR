Excel lacks features for modular design. Had it such features, as do most
programming languages, they would save time, avoid unneeded programming, make
mistakes less likely, make code-control easier, help organisations adopt a
uniform house style, and open business opportunities in buying and selling
spreadsheet modules. I present Excelsior, a system for bringing these benefits
to Excel.
