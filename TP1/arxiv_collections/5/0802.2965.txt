First evidence for single top quark production has recently been found by
both the D0 and CDF experiments. By combining three analyses, D0 measured a
cross section of 4.7 +- 1.3 pb, with a significance of 3.6 standard deviations,
and CDF's matrix elements analysis measured a cross section of 3.0 +1.2 -1.1
pb, with a significance of 3.1 standard deviations. These analyses also
provided the first direct measurements of the CKM matrix element, |Vtb|,
without assuming unitarity. This talk briefly describes the latest single top
production results from the two experiments.
