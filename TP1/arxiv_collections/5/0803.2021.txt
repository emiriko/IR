The transfer of information between different physical forms is a central
theme in communication and computation, for example between processing entities
and memory. Nowhere is this more crucial than in quantum computation, where
great effort must be taken to protect the integrity of a fragile quantum bit.
Nuclear spins are known to benefit from long coherence times compared to
electron spins, but are slow to manipulate and suffer from weak thermal
polarisation. A powerful model for quantum computation is thus one in which
electron spins are used for processing and readout while nuclear spins are used
for storage. Here we demonstrate the coherent transfer of a superposition state
in an electron spin 'processing' qubit to a nuclear spin 'memory' qubit, using
a combination of microwave and radiofrequency pulses applied to 31P donors in
an isotopically pure 28Si crystal. The electron spin state can be stored in the
nuclear spin on a timescale that is long compared with the electron decoherence
time and then coherently transferred back to the electron spin, thus
demonstrating the 31P nuclear spin as a solid-state quantum memory. The overall
store/readout fidelity is about 90%, attributed to systematic imperfections in
radiofrequency pulses which can be improved through the use of composite
pulses. We apply dynamic decoupling to protect the nuclear spin quantum memory
element from sources of decoherence. The coherence lifetime of the quantum
memory element is found to exceed one second at 5.5K.
