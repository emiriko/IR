We investigate collisions of solitons of the gap type, supported by a lattice
potential in repulsive Bose-Einstein condensates, with an effective
double-barrier potential that resembles a Fabry-Perot cavity. We identify
conditions under which the trapping of the entire incident soliton in the
cavity is possible. Collisions of the incident soliton with an earlier trapped
one are considered too. In the latter case, many outcomes of the collisions are
identified, including merging, release of the trapped soliton with or without
being replaced by the incoming one, and trapping of both solitons.
