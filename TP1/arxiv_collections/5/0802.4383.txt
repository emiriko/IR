Free standing beams containing a two-dimensional electron system are shaped
from a GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure. Quantum point contacts and (double) quantum
dots are laterally defined using metal top gates. We investigate the electronic
properties of these nanostructures by transport spectroscopy. Tunable localized
electron states in freely suspended nanostructures are a promising tool to
investigate the electron-phonon-interaction.
