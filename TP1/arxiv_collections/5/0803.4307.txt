We present a general theory of current deviations in straight current
carrying wires with random imperfections, which quantitatively explains the
recent observations of organized patterns of magnetic field corrugations above
micron-scale evaporated wires. These patterns originate from the most efficient
electron scattering by Fourier components of the wire imperfections with
wavefronts along the $\pm 45^{\circ}$ direction. We show that long range
effects of surface or bulk corrugations are suppressed for narrow wires or
wires having an electrically anisotropic resistivity.
