We review some recent developments in charm meson physics. In particular, we
discuss theoretical predictions and experimental measurements of charmed meson
decays to leptonic, semileptonic, and hadronic final states and implications of
such measurements to searches for new physics. We discuss D0-anti-D0-mixing and
CP-violation in charm, and discuss future experimental prospects and
theoretical challenges in this area.
