High-kappa dielectrics for insulating layers are a current key ingredient of
microelectronics. X2O3 sesquioxide compounds are among the candidates. Here we
show for a typical material of this class, ScO3, that the relatively modest
dielectric constant of its crystalline phase is enhanced in the amorphous phase
by over 40% (from ~15 to ~22). This is due to the disorder-induced activation
of low frequency cation-related modes which are inactive or inefficient in the
crystal, and by the conservation of effective dynamical charges (a measure of
atomic polarizability). The analysis employs density-functional energy-force
and perturbation-theory calculations of the dielectric response of amorphous
samples generated by pair-potential molecular dynamics.
