We present clear evidence of strong effects of Gribov copies in Landau gauge
gluon and ghost propagators computed on the lattice at small momenta by
employing a new approach to Landau gauge fixing and a more effective numerical
algorithm. It is further shown that the new approach substantially decreases
notorious finite-volume effects.
