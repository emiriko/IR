We have computed the one-loop electroweak expression of diagonal and non
diagonal stop-antistop and sbottom-antisbottom production from initial state
gluons at LHC. We have investigated the possibility that the one-loop effects
exhibit a dependence on "extra" supersymmetric parameters different from the
final squark masses. Our results, given for a choice of twelve SUSY benchmark
points in the MSSM with mSUGRA symmetry breaking, show that in some cases a
mild dependence might arise, at the percent relative level, of not simple
experimental detection.
