This article describes epistemological distinctions between science and
history. Science investigates models of natural law using repeatable
experiments as the ultimate arbiter. In contrast, history investigates past
events by considering physical evidence, documentary evidence, and eyewitness
testimony. Because questions of natural law are repeatably testable by any
audience that exercises due experimental care, models of natural law are
inherently more objective and testable with greater certainty than theories of
past events.
