General formulation of hydrodynamics describing transversally thermalized
matter created at the early stages of ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions
is presented. Similarities and differences with the standard
three-dimensionally thermalized relativistic hydrodynamics are discussed. The
role of the conservation laws as well as the thermodynamic consistency of
two-dimensional thermodynamic variables characterizing transversally
thermalized matter is emphasized.
