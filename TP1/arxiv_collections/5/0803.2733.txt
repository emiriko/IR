We report an experimental method to create optical lattices with real-time
control of their periodicity. We demonstrate a continuous change of the lattice
periodicity from 0.96 $\mu$m to 11.2 $\mu$m in one second, while the center
fringe only moves less than 2.7 $\mu$m during the whole process. This provides
a powerful tool for controlling ultracold atoms in optical lattices, where
small spacing is essential for quantum tunneling, and large spacing enables
single-site manipulation and spatially resolved detection.
