We investigate transport through molecular wires whose energy levels are
affected by environmental fluctuations. We assume that the relevant
fluctuations are so slow that they, within a tight-binding description, can be
described by disordered, Gaussian distributed onsite energies. For long wires,
we find that the corresponding current distribution can be rather broad even
for a small energy variance. Moreover, we analyse with a Floquet master
equation the interplay of laser excitations and static disorder. Then the
disorder leads to spatial asymmetries such that the laser diving can induce a
ratchet current.
