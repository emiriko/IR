Population Monte Carlo has been introduced as a sequential importance
sampling technique to overcome poor fit of the importance function. In this
paper, we compare the performances of the original Population Monte Carlo
algorithm with a modified version that eliminates the influence of the
transition particle via a double Rao-Blackwellisation. This modification is
shown to improve the exploration of the modes through an large simulation
experiment on posterior distributions of mean mixtures of distributions.
