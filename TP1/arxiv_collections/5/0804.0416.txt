We propose one possible mechanism for deconfinement based on an SU(2)
slave-boson theory. Resorting to an effective field theory approach, we show
that introduction of an isospin interaction potential gives rise to a fermion
zero mode in an instanton-hedgehog configuration. As a result, meron-type
vortices are allowed. We demonstrate how emergence of such vortices results in
the doping-independent decreasing ratio of superfluid weight.
