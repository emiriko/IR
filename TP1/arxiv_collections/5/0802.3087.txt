A cost effectively method to fabricate nanopores in silicon by only using the
conventional wet-etching technique is developed in this research. The main
concept of the proposed method is a two-step etching process, including a
premier double-sided wet etching and a succeeding track-etching. A special
fixture is designed to hold the pre-etched silicon wafer inside it such that
the track-etching can be effectively carried out. An electrochemical system is
employed to detect and record the ion diffusion current once the pre-etched
cavities are etched into a through nanopore. Experimental results indicate that
the proposed method can cost effectively fabricate nanopores in silicon.
