Based on density functional calculations, optimized structures of graphite
oxide are found for various coverage by oxygen and hydroxyl groups, as well as
their ratio corresponding to the minimum of total energy. The model proposed
describes well known experimental results. In particular, it explains why it is
so difficult to reduce the graphite oxide up to pure graphene. Evolution of the
electronic structure of graphite oxide with the coverage change is
investigated.
