The solution of energy-balance model of the Earth global climate and the
EPICA Dome C and Vostok experimental data of the Earth surface
palaeotemperature evolution over past 420 and 740 kyr are compared. In the
framework of proposed bifurcation model (i) the possible sharp warmings of the
Dansgaard-Oeschger type during the last glacial period due to stochastic
resonance is theoretically argued; (ii) the concept of climatic sensitivity of
water in the atmosphere, whose temperature instability has the form of
so-called hysteresis loop, is proposed, and based of this concept the time
series of global ice volume over the past 1000 kyr, which is in good agreement
with the time series of delta O-18 concentration in the sea sediments, is
obtained; (iii) the so-called "CO2 doubling" problem is discussed
