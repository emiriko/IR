We define a notion of pseudo-unitarizability for weight modules over a
generalized Weyl algebra (of rank one, with commutative coeffiecient ring $R$),
which is assumed to carry an involution of the form $X^*=Y$, $R^*\subseteq R$.
We prove that a weight module $V$ is pseudo-unitarizable iff it is isomorphic
to its finitistic dual $V^\sharp$. Using the classification of weight modules
by Drozd, Guzner and Ovsienko, we obtain necessary and sufficient conditions
for an indecomposable weight module to be isomorphic to its finitistic dual,
and thus to be pseudo-unitarizable. Some examples are given, including
$U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ for $q$ a root of unity.
