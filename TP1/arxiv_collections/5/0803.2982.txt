We investigate the local implementation of nonlocal operations with the block
matrix form, and propose a protocol for any diagonal or offdiagonal block
operation. This method can be directly generalized to the two-party multiqubit
case and the multiparty case. Especially, in the multiparty cases, any diagonal
block operation can be locally implemented using the same resources as the
multiparty control-U operation discussed in Ref. [Eisert et al., Phys. Rev. A
62, 052317(2000)]. Although in the bipartite case, this kind of operations can
be transformed to control-U operation using local operations, these
transformations are impossible in the multiparty cases. We also compare the
local implementation of nonlocal block operations with the remote
implementation of local operations, and point out a relation between them.
