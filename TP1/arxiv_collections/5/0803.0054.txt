In this paper we discuss new adaptive proposal strategies for sequential
Monte Carlo algorithms--also known as particle filters--relying on criteria
evaluating the quality of the proposed particles. The choice of the proposal
distribution is a major concern and can dramatically influence the quality of
the estimates. Thus, we show how the long-used coefficient of variation of the
weights can be used for estimating the chi-square distance between the target
and instrumental distributions of the auxiliary particle filter. As a
by-product of this analysis we obtain an auxiliary adjustment multiplier weight
type for which this chi-square distance is minimal. Moreover, we establish an
empirical estimate of linear complexity of the Kullback-Leibler divergence
between the involved distributions. Guided by these results, we discuss
adaptive designing of the particle filter proposal distribution and illustrate
the methods on a numerical example.
