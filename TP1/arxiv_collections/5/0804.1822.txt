The recent observations of the purely leptonic decay $\Ds \to \mu^+
\nu_{\mu}$ and $\tau^+\nu_{\tau}$ at CLEO-c and $B$ factory may allow a
possible contribution from a charged Higgs boson. One such measurement of the
decay constant $f_{D_s}$ differs from the most precise unquenched lattice QCD
calculation by 4 $\sigma$ level. Meanwhile, the measured ratio, ${\cal BR}(\Ds
\to \mu^+ \nu_{\mu})$ / ${\cal BR}(\Dp \to \mu^+ \nu_{\mu})$, is larger than
the standard model prediction at 2.0$\sigma$ level. We discuss that the precise
measurement of the ratio ${\cal BR}(\Ds \to \mu^+ \nu_{\mu})$ / ${\cal BR}(\Dp
\to \mu^+ \nu_{\mu})$ at BES-III will shed light on the presence of new
intermediate particles by comparing the theoretical predictions, especially,
the predictions of high precise unquenched lattice QCD calculation.
