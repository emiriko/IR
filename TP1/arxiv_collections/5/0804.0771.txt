We present a method of obtaining information about spin lifetimes in quantum
dots from measurements of electrical transport. The dot is under resonant
microwave irradiation and at temperatures comparable to or larger than the
Zeeman energy. We find that the ratio of the spin coherence times T_{1}/T_{2}
can be deduced from a measurement of current through the quantum dot as a
function the applied magnetic field. We calculate the noise power spectrum of
the dot current and show that a dip occurs at the Rabi frequency with a line
width given by 1/T_{1}+1/T_{2}.
