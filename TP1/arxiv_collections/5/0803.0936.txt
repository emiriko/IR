The dynamical coupled channel approach is applied to study the
$\omega$--meson production induced by pions and photons scattering from the
proton. The parameters of the model are fixed in a two-channel (\on,\pn)
calculation for the non-resonant and resonant contributions to the $T$ matrix
by fitting the available unpolarized differential cross section data. The
polarized photon beam asymmetry is predicted and compared to existing data.
