We study the relativistic BCS-BEC crossover within a class of
Nambu-Jona-Lasinio type models, including arbitrary Lorentz-scalar pairing
channels. Using the mean-field approximation we investigate spectral properties
of the collective bosonic excitations in the superfluid phase, with particular
attention to the Nambu--Goldstone bosons of the broken symmetry. This is a
first step towards a systematic improvement of the mean-field approximation by
including the fluctuation effects. The general results are illustrated on
pairing in dense two-flavor quark matter - the two-flavor color superconductor.
