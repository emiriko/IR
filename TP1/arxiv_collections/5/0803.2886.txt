We compute the spectral density for ensembles of of sparse symmetric random
matrices using replica, managing to circumvent difficulties that have been
encountered in earlier approaches along the lines first suggested in a seminal
paper by Rodgers and Bray. Due attention is payed to the issue of localization.
Our approach is not restricted to matrices defined on graphs with Poissonian
degree distribution. Matrices defined on regular random graphs or on scale-free
graphs, are easily handled. We also look at matrices with row constraints such
as discrete graph Laplacians. Our approach naturally allows to unfold the total
density of states into contributions coming from vertices of different local
coordination.
