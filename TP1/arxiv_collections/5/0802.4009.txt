In the series La_{2/3-x}Tb_{x}Ca_{1/3}MnO_{3}, it is known that the
compositions are ferromagnetic for smaller values of x and show spin glass
characteristics at larger values of x. Our studies on the magnetic properties
of various compositions in the La_{2/3-x}Tb_{x}Ca_{1/3}MnO_{3} series show that
the cross over from ferromagnetic to spin glass region takes place above x ~
1/8. Also, a low temperature anomaly at 30 K, observed in the ac susceptibility
curves, disappears for compositions above this critical value of x. A mixed
phase region coexists in the narrow compositional range 0.1 <= x <= 0.125,
indicating that the ferromagnetic to spin glass cross over is not abrupt.
