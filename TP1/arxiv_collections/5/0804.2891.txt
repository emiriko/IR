The results of molecular dynamics simulations of the properties of water in
an aqueous ionic solution close to an interface with a model metallic electrode
are described. In the simulations the electrode behaves as an ideally
polarizable hydrophilic metal, supporting image charge interactions with
charged species, and it is maintained at a constant electrical potential with
respect to the solution so that the model is a textbook representation of an
electrochemical interface through which no current is passing. We show how
water is strongly attracted to and ordered at the electrode surface. This
ordering is different to the structure that might be imagined from continuum
models of electrode interfaces. Further, this ordering significantly affects
the probability of ions reaching the surface. We describe the concomitant
motion and configurations of the water and ions as functions of the electrode
potential, and we analyze the length scales over which ionic atmospheres
fluctuate. The statistics of these fluctuations depend upon surface structure
and ionic strength. The fluctuations are large, sufficiently so that the mean
ionic atmosphere is a poor descriptor of the aqueous environment near a metal
surface. The importance of this finding for a description of electrochemical
reactions is examined by calculating, directly from the simulation, Marcus free
energy profiles for transfer of charge between the electrode and a redox
species in the solution and comparing the results with the predictions of
continuum theories. Significant departures from the electrochemical textbook
descriptions of the phenomenon are found and their physical origins are
characterized from the atomistic perspective of the simulations.
