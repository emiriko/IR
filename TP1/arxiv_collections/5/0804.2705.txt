We study the phase diagram of a mixture of Bose-Einstein condensate and a
two-component Fermi gas. In particular, we identify the regime where the
homogeneous system becomes unstable against phase separation. We show that,
under proper conditions, the phase separation phenomenon can be exploited as a
robust probe of Fermi superfluid.
