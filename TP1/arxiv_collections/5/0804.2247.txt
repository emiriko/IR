The uncertainty or the variability of the data may be treated by considering,
rather than a single value for each data, the interval of values in which it
may fall. This paper studies the derivation of basic description statistics for
interval-valued datasets. We propose a geometrical approach in the
determination of summary statistics (central tendency and dispersion measures)
for interval-valued variables.
