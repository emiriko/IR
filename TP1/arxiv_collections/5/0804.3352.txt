Yields of Delta(1230), Sigma(1385) resonances produced in heavy ion
collisions are studied within the framework of a kinetic master equation. The
time evolution is driven by the process Delta(1230) \leftrightarrow N \pi,
Sigma(1385) \leftrightarrow \Lambda \pi . We obtain resonance yield both below
and above chemical equilibrium, depending on initial hadronization condition
and separation of kinetic and chemical freeze-out.
