Using dynamic simulations and analytic methods, we study the elastic response
of a helical filament subject to uniaxial tension over a wide range of bend and
twist persistence length. A low-pitch helix at low temperatures exhibits a
stretching instability and the force-extension curve consists of a sequence of
spikes. At elevated temperature (i.e. small persistence lengths) the helix
melts and a pronounced force plateau is obtained in the fixed-extension
ensemble. The torque boundary condition significantly affects the resulting
elastic properties.
