In this paper, we outline a new approach to quantum gravity; describing
states for a bounded region of spacetime as eigenstates for two classes of
physically plausible gedanken experiments. We end up with two complementary
descriptions in which the point set continuum disappears.
  The first replaces the continuum of events with a handlebody decomposition of
loop space. We conjecture that techniques fron algebraic topology will allow us
to extend state sum models on spacetime to loop space.
  The second picture replaces the continuum with a nondistributive lattice; the
classical limit seems more tractible in this picture.
