Variations of polarization of the electronic field is a dielectric property
quantified by Resta et al. and discovered to be a Berry phase of the electronic
subsystem. In order to continue the previous research we wrote a scalar phase
\Phi as the circulation of the polarization field or in alternative and in a
more general form as the flux of a new vector field called macroscopic rotonic
field. The latter shows to be a more general scalar Berry phase concerning the
interaction of the electronic subsystem with an external electromagnetic field.
