A general recipe is developed for the study of rigid body dynamics in terms
of Poincar\'e surfaces of section. A section condition is chosen which captures
every trajectory on a given energy surface. The possible topological types of
the corresponding surfaces of section are determined, and their 1:1 projection
to a conveniently defined torus is proposed for graphical rendering.
