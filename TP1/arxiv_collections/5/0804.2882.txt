The dynamics of a system composed of two coupled optical cavities, each
containing a single two-level atom, is studied over a wide range of detuning
and coupling values. A description of the field in terms of delocalized modes
reveals that the detuning between the atoms and these modes is controlled by
the coupling between the cavities; this detuning in turn governs the nature of
the dynamics. If the atoms are highly detuned from both delocalized field
modes, the dynamics becomes dispersive and an excitation may be transferred
from the first atom to the second without populating the field. In the case of
resonance between the atoms and one of the delocalized modes, state transfer
between the atoms requires intermediate excitation of the field. Thus the
interaction between the two atoms can be controlled by adjusting the coupling
between the cavities.
