A novel form of amorphous carbon with sp-sp2 hybridization has been recently
produced by supersonic cluster beam deposition showing the presence in the film
of both polyynic and cumulenic species [L. Ravagnan et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 98,
216103 (2007)]. Here we present a in situ Raman characterization of the low
frequency vibrational region (400-800 cm-1) of sp-sp2 films at different
temperatures. We report the presence of two peaks at 450 cm-1 and 720 cm-1. The
lower frequency peak shows an evolution with the variation of the sp content
and it can be attributed, with the support of density functional theory (DFT)
simulations, to bending modes of sp linear structures. The peak at 720 cm-1
does not vary with the sp content and it can be attributed to a feature in the
vibrational density of states activated by the disorder of the sp2 phase.
