In a recent continuous-variable quantum memory experiment, one quadrature of
light pulse is directly uploaded by the light-atom coupling whereas
complementary quadrature is obtained by homodyne measurement of the out-coupled
light. Subsequently, information from homodyne mea- surement is written into
the memory by feed-back electro-optical control of the atomic state. Using the
same experimental set-up, a deterministic noise excess free record of unknown
quantum states to continuous-variable quantum atomic memory is proposed.
Further, the memory experiment is extended by the pre-squeezing of the recorded
state of light and squeezing post-correction of the recorded state. To upload a
resource to the memory, as single-photon state or superposition of co- herent
states, the post-selection of the measurement results from homodyne detection
is suggested. Then such the probabilistic upload approaches even a lossless
transfer of these highly nonclassical states into the quantum memory.
