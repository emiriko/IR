This is a comment on "Guiding, Focusing, and Sensing on the Subwavelength
Scale Using Metallic Wire Arrays" by G. Shvets, S. Trendafilov, J. B. Pendry
and A. Sarychev published in Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 053903 (2007), which
demonstrates that the endoscope proposed in the letter does not demonstrate
satisfactory subwavelength imaging performance.
