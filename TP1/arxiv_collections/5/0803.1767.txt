Recently, we have discovered a new concept of permanent wave resonance with
potential spatial oscillations. This means the constant wave swinging frequency
on the whole energy intervals of spectral forbidden zones destroying physical
solutions and deepening the theory of waves in periodic potentials. It also
shows the other side of strengthening the fundamentally important magic nuclear
structures. A new language of wave bending will be presented to enrich our
quantum intuition, e.g., the paradoxical effective attraction of barriers and
repulsion of wells in multichannel systems.
