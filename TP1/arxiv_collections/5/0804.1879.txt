We present the definition of the logical framework TF, the Type Framework. TF
is a lambda-free logical framework; it does not include lambda-abstraction or
product kinds. We give formal proofs of several results in the metatheory of
TF, and show how it can be conservatively embedded in the logical framework LF:
its judgements can be seen as the judgements of LF that are in beta-normal,
eta-long normal form. We show how several properties, such as adequacy theorems
for object theories and the injectivity of constants, can be proven more easily
in TF, and then `lifted' to LF.
