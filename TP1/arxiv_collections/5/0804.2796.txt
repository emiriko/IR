The phonon and crystal field excitations in several rare earth titanate
pyrochlores are investigated. Magnetic measurements on single crystals of
Gd2Ti2O7, Tb2Ti2O7, Dy2Ti2O7 and Ho2Ti2O7 are used for characterization, while
Raman spectroscopy and terahertz time domain spectroscopy are employed to probe
the excitations of the materials. The lattice excitations are found to be
analogous across the compounds over the whole temperature range investigated
(295-4 K). The resulting full phononic characterization of the R2Ti2O7
pyrochlore structure is then used to identify crystal field excitations
observed in the materials. Several crystal field excitations have been observed
in Tb2Ti2O7 in Raman spectroscopy for the first time, among which all of the
previously reported excitations. The presence of additional crystal field
excitations, however, suggests the presence of two inequivalent Tb3+ sites in
the low temperature structure. Furthermore, the crystal field level at
approximately 13 cm-1 is found to be both Raman and dipole active, indicating
broken inversion symmetry in the system and thus undermining its current
symmetry interpretation. In addition, evidence is found for a significant
crystal field-phonon coupling in Tb2Ti2O7. These findings call for a careful
reassessment of the low temperature structure of Tb2Ti2O7, which may serve to
improve its theoretical understanding.
