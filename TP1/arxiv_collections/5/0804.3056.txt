I study the average deformation rate of an amorphous material submitted to an
external uniform shear strain rate, in the geometry known as the split-bottom
configuration. The material is described using a stochastic model of plasticity
at a mesoscopic scale. A shear band is observed to start at the split point at
the bottom, and widen progressively towards the surface. In a two-dimensional
geometry the average statistical properties of the shear band look similar to
those of the directed polymer model. In particular, the surface width of the
shear band is found to scale with the system height H as H^q with q=0.68 +/-
0.02. In more realistic three dimensional simulations the exponent changes to
q=0.60 +/- 0.02 and the bulk profile of the width of the shear band is closer
to a quarter of circle, as it was observed to be the case in recent simulations
of granular materials.
