A simple decay model is introduced. The model comprises of a point potential
well, which experiences an abrupt change. Due to the temporal variation the
initial quantum state can either escape from the well or stay localized as a
new bound state. The model allows for an exact analytical solution while having
the necessary features of a decay process. The results show that the decay is
never exponential, as classical dynamics predicts. Moreover, at short times the
decay has a \textit{fractional} power law, which differs from perturbation
quantum methods predictions.
