In this paper, we show how simple logistic growth that was studied
intensively during the last 200 years in many domains of science could be
extended in a rather simple way and with these extensions is capable to produce
a collection of behaviors widely observed in an enormous number of real-life
systems in Economics, Sociology, Biology, Ecology and more.
