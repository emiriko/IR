We employ density functional theory to study in detail the crystallization of
super-paramagnetic particles in two dimensions under the influence of an
external magnetic field that lies perpendicular to the confining plane. The
field induces non-fluctuating magnetic dipoles on the particles, resulting into
an interparticle interaction that scales as the inverse cube of the distance
separating them. In line with previous findings for long-range interactions in
three spatial dimensions, we find that explicit inclusion of liquid-state
structural information on the {\it triplet} correlations is crucial to yield
theoretical predictions that agree quantitatively with experiment. A
non-perturbative treatment is superior to the oft-employed functional Taylor
expansions, truncated at second or third order. We go beyond the usual Gaussian
parametrization of the density site-orbitals by performing free minimizations
with respect to both the shape and the normalization of the profiles, allowing
for finite defect concentrations.
