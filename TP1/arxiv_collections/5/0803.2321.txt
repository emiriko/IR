The insulator to metal transition in solid hydrogen was predicted over 70
years ago but the demonstration of this transition remains a scientific
challenge. In this regard, a peak in the temperature vs. pressure melting line
of hydrogen may be a possible precursor for metallization. However, previous
measurements of the fusion curve of hydrogen have been limited in pressure by
diffusion of hydrogen into the gasket or diamonds. To overcome this limitation
we have used an innovative technique of pulsed laser heating of the sample and
final peak in the melting line at P=64.7+-4GPa and T=1055+-20 K.
