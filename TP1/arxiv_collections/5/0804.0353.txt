This paper pursues some applications of Rough Set Theory (RST) and
neural-fuzzy model to analysis of "lugeon data". In the manner, using Self
Organizing Map (SOM) as a pre-processing the data are scaled and then the
dominant rules by RST, are elicited. Based on these rules variations of
permeability in the different levels of Shivashan dam, Iran has been
highlighted. Then, via using a combining of SOM and an adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy
Inference System (NFIS) another analysis on the data was carried out. Finally,
a brief comparison between the obtained results of RST and SOM-NFIS (briefly
SONFIS) has been rendered.
