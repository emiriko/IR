We propose to store several integers modulo a small prime into a single
machine word. Modular addition is performed by addition and possibly
subtraction of a word containing several times the modulo. Modular
Multiplication is not directly accessible but modular dot product can be
performed by an integer multiplication by the reverse integer. Modular
multiplication by a word containing a single residue is a also possible.
Therefore matrix multiplication can be performed on such a compressed storage.
We here give bounds on the sizes of primes and matrices for which such a
compression is possible. We also explicit the details of the required
compressed arithmetic routines.
