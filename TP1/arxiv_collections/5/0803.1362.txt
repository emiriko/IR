The Universe, far to be homogenous, expands in large empty bubbles of the
large-scale structure, but not in mass concentrations like galaxies, so that
the Robertson-Walker solution does not fit. We suggest that a symmetry breaking
occurred in a distant past, during the radiation-dominated era. Before, the
three-dimensional hypersurface was invariant under the action of O(3) and the
Robertson-Walker metric could be used. But this obliges the so-called constants
and physics, length and time scale factors to be involved through a generalized
gauge process, which is built. The subsequent variation of the speed of light
solves the horizon problem, while the Planck barrier disappears
