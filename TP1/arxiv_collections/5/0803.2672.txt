We demonstrate a novel technique for coupling XUV harmonic radiation out of a
femtosecond enhancement cavity. We use a small-period diffraction grating
etched directly into the surface of a dielectric mirror. For the fundamental
light, this element acts as a high reflector. For harmonic wavelengths, it acts
as a diffraction grating, coupling XUV radiation out of the cavity. Using this
method, we observed the 3rd through 21st odd harmonics with a dramatic increase
in usable power over previous results of high harmonic generation at high
repetition rates.
