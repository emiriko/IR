The equilibrium free energy landscape of off-lattice model heteropolymers as
a function of an internal coordinate, namely the end-to-end distance, is
reconstructed from out-of-equilibrium steered molecular dynamics data. This
task is accomplished via two independent methods: by employing an extended
version of the Jarzynski equality (EJE) and the inherent structure (IS)
formalism. A comparison of the free energies estimated with these two schemes
with equilibrium results obtained via the umbrella sampling technique reveals a
good quantitative agreement among all the approaches in a range of temperatures
around the ``folding transition'' for the two examined sequences. In
particular, for the sequence with good foldability properties, the mechanically
induced structural transitions can be related to thermodynamical aspects of
folding. Moreover, for the same sequence the knowledge of the landscape profile
allows for a good estimation of the life times of the native configuration for
temperatures ranging from the folding to the collapse temperature. For the
random sequence, mechanical and thermal unfolding appear to follow different
paths along the landscape.
