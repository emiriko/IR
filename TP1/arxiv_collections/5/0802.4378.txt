The superscaling analysis using the scaling function obtained within the
coherent density fluctuation model is extended to calculate charge-changing
neutrino and antineutrino scattering on $^{12}$C at energies from 1 to 2 GeV
not only in the quasielastic but also in the delta excitation region. The
results are compared with those obtained using the scaling functions from the
relativistic Fermi gas model and from the superscaling analysis of inclusive
scattering of electrons from nuclei.
