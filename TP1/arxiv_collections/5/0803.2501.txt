We consider a generalization of the Ruelle theorem for the case of continuous
time problems. We present a result which we believe is important for future use
in problems in Mathematical Physics related to $C^*$-Algebras We consider a
finite state set $S$ and a stationary continuous time Markov Chain $X_t$,
$t\geq 0$, taking values on S. We denote by $\Omega$ the set of paths $w$
taking values on S (the elements $w$ are locally constant with left and right
limits and are also right continuous on $t$). We consider an infinitesimal
generator $L$ and a stationary vector $p_0$. We denote by $P$ the associated
probability on ($\Omega, {\cal B}$). This is the a priori probability. All
functions $f$ we consider bellow are in the set ${\cal L}^\infty (P)$. From the
probability $P$ we define a Ruelle operator ${\cal L}^t, t\geq 0$, acting on
functions $f:\Omega \to \mathbb{R}$ of ${\cal L}^\infty (P)$. Given $V:\Omega
\to \mathbb{R}$, such that is constant in sets of the form $\{X_0=c\}$, we
define a modified Ruelle operator $\tilde{{\cal L}}_V^t, t\geq 0$. We are able
to show the existence of an eigenfunction $u$ and an eigen-probability $\nu_V$
on $\Omega$ associated to $\tilde{{\cal L}}^t_V, t\geq 0$. We also show the
following property for the probability $\nu_V$: for any integrable $g\in {\cal
L}^\infty (P)$ and any real and positive $t$ $$ \int e^{-\int_0^t (V \circ
\Theta_s)(.) ds} [ (\tilde{{\cal L}}^t_V (g)) \circ \theta_t ] d \nu_V = \int g
d \nu_V$$ This equation generalize, for the continuous time Markov Chain, a
similar one for discrete time systems (and which is quite important for
understanding the KMS states of certain $C^*$-algebras).
