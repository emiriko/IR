The production of $\eta'$ mesons in the reactions $pp\to pp\eta'$ and $pn\to
pn\eta' $ at threshold-near energies is analyzed within a covariant effective
meson-nucleon theory. The description of cross section and angular
distributions of the available data in this kinematical region in the $pp$
channel is accomplished by including meson currents and nucleon currents with
the resonances $S_{11}(1650)$, $P_{11}(1710)$ and $P_{13}(1720)$. Predictions
for the $pn$ channel are given. The di-electron production from subsequent
$\eta'$ Dalitz decay $\eta' \to \gamma \gamma^* \to\gamma e^+e^-$ is also
calculated and numerical results are presented for intermediate energy and
kinematics of possible experiments with HADES, CLAS and KEK-PS.
