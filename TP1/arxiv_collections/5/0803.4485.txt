In this contribution we describe in some detail different aspects of the
construction of BFKL cross sections. We focus on several effects which are
relevant at next-to-leading order. In particular, we describe QCD coherence in
DIS final states, improvements of the collinear region in multi-Regge
kinematics, inclusive jet production at next-to-leading order, and azimuthal
angle decorrelations of Mueller-Navelet jets at hadron colliders.
