In these lectures, I give an introduction to and overview of braneworlds and
black holes in the context of warped compactifications. I first describe the
general paradigm of braneworlds, and introduce the Randall-Sundrum model. I
discuss braneworld gravity, both using perturbation theory, and also non
perturbative results. I then discuss black holes on the brane, the obstructions
to finding exact solutions, and ways of tackling these difficulties. I describe
some known solutions, and conclude with some open questions and controversies.
