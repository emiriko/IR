A study at both the molecular and extended solid level in the framework DFT
is carried out for KM[Cr(CN)$_6$] (M = V, Ni). From molecular calculations, the
exchange parameters J are obtained, pointing to the expected magnetic ground
states, i.e., antiferromagnetic for M = V with J = -296.5 cm$^{-1}$ and
ferromagnetic for M = Ni with J = +40.5 cm$^{-1}$. From solid state
computations the same ground states and J magnitudes are confirmed from energy
differences. Furthermore an analysis of the site projected density of states
and of the chemical bonding is developed in which the cyanide ion linkage is
analyzed addressing some isomerism aspects.
