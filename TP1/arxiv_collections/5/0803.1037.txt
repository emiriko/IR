High degree of preservation of spin states during energy relaxation processes
mediated by optical phonons is demonstrated in a single quantum dot.
Optical-phonon resonance and relevant suppression of spin relaxation are
clearly identified as dip structures in photoluminescence excitation spectra
probed by the positive trion emission. The absence of continuum states makes
this observation possible under the cross-circularly polarized detection with
respect to a circularly polarized pumping. Consequently, distinguishably high
degree of circular polarization up to ~0.85 is achieved without applying
external magnetic field at the optical-phonon resonance. Rate equation analysis
reveals that the spin-flip probability during energy relaxation is restricted
to less than 7.5%. It is also indicated that the spin flip time of the positive
trion ground state is extended by more than 3 times compared with that of
neutral exciton ground state. This corresponds to the spin flip time longer
than 11 ns for the positive trion ground state. The influence of nuclear
polarization to the present measurements is also discussed.
