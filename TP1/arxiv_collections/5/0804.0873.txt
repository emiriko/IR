We introduce a new class of two(multi)-matrix models of positive Hermitean
matrices coupled in a chain; the coupling is related to the Cauchy kernel and
differs from the exponential coupling more commonly used in similar models. The
correlation functions are expressed entirely in terms of certain biorthogonal
polynomials and solutions of appropriate Riemann-Hilbert problems, thus paving
the way to a steepest descent analysis and universality results. The
interpretation of the formal expansion of the partition function in terms of
multicolored ribbon-graphs is provided and a connection to the O(1) model. A
steepest descent analysis of the partition function reveals that the model is
related to a trigonal curve (three-sheeted covering of the plane) much in the
same way as the Hermitean matrix model is related to a hyperelliptic curve.
