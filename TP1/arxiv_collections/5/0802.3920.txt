A uniformly accelerating observer perceives the Minkowski vacuum state as a
thermal bath of radiation. We point out that this field-theory effect can be
derived, for any dimension higher than two, without actually invoking very high
energy physics. This supports the view that this phenomenon is robust against
Planck-scale physics and, therefore, should be compatible with any underlying
microscopic theory.
