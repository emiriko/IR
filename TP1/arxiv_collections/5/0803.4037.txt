We adapt our previous results for the ``partition function'' of the
superintegrable chiral Potts model with open boundaries to obtain the
corresponding matrix elements of e^{-\alpha H}, where H is the associated
hamiltonian. The spontaneous magnetization M_r can be expressed in terms of
particular matrix elements of e^{-\alpha H} S^r_1 \e^{-\beta H}, where S_1 is a
diagonal matrix.We present a conjecture for these matrix elements as an m by m
determinant, where m is proportional to the width of the lattice. The author
has previously derived the spontaneous magnetization of the chiral Potts model
by analytic means, but hopes that this work will facilitate a more algebraic
derivation, similar to that of Yang for the Ising model.
