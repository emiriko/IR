An efficient approach to the evaluation of effective elastic properties of
carbon-carbon plain weave textile composites using the Mori-Tanaka method is
presented. The method proves its potential even if applied to real material
systems with various types of imperfections including the non-uniform waviness
of the fiber-tow paths, both along its longitudinal direction and through the
laminate thickness. Influence of the remaining geometrical parameters is
accounted for by optimal calibration of the shape of the equivalent ellipsoidal
inclusion. An application of the method to a particular sample of the
carbon-carbon composite laminate demonstrates not only its applicability but
also its efficiency particularly when compared to finite element simulations.
