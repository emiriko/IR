This entry in the Encyclopedia of Complexity and Systems Science, Springer
present a summary of some of the concepts and calculational tools that have
been developed in attempts to apply statistical physics approaches to
seismology. We summarize the leading theoretical physical models of the
space-time organization of earthquakes. We present a general discussion and
several examples of the new metrics proposed by statistical physicists,
underlining their strengths and weaknesses. The entry concludes by briefly
outlining future directions. The presentation is organized as follows. I
