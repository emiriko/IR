In this paper we propose a scheme to implement a quantum teleportation based
on the current experimental design [Nature (London) 431, 162 (2004); ibid 445,
515 (2007)] in which superconducting charge qubits are capacitively coupled to
a single high-Q superconducting coplanar resonator. As advantage of this
architecture, it permits the use of multiqubit gates between non-nearest qubits
and the realization of parallel gates. We consider the case of two qubits
inside the resonator, where the teleportation is accomplished.
