Bose-Einstein condensate of rarified atomic gases is considered as the state
formed by exchange of virtual photons, resonant to the lowest levels of atoms;
such representation corresponds to the Einstein opinion about an
inter-influence of condensable particles. Considered interactions directly lead
to the QED structure of nonlinear potential in the Gross-Pitaevskii equation.
Linear momenta that correspond to the thermal energy of condensable atoms are
connected to near field of particles and therefore leave atoms immovable. The
estimations of these effects do not contradict the observed data; the general
quantum principles predict possibility of stimulating of BEC formation by
resonant irradiation. All this requires the spectroscopic investigation of BEC
on different steps of formation.
