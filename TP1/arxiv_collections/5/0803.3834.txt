The magnitude of the angular momentum ($J^2$) in quantum mechanics is larger
than expected from a classical model. We explain this deviation in terms of
quantum fluctuations. A standard quantum mechanical calculation gives the
correct interpretation of the components of the angular momentum in the vector
model in terms of projections and fluctuations. We show that the addition of
angular momentum in quantum mechanics gives results consistent with the
classical intuition in this vector model.
