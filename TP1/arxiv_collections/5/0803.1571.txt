The equation of state (EOS) is of utmost importance for the description of
the hydrodynamic phase of strongly interacting matter in relativistic heavy-ion
collisions. Lattice QCD can provide useful information on the EOS, mainly for
small net baryon densities. The QCD quasiparticle model provides a means to map
lattice QCD results into regions relevant for a variety of experiments. We
report here on effects of collectives modes and damping on the EOS. Some
predictions for forthcoming heavy-ion collisions at LHC/ALICE are presented and
perspectives for deriving an EOS for FAIR/CBM are discussed.
