In this letter we have pointed out that frustration in spin glass is realized
through the Berry phase due to the conflict between the spin ordering in the
course of parallel transport of spinor. We have came to the point that the
Berry phase depicting the chiral change of helicity of a quantized spinor is
prominent only in the presence of frustration.
