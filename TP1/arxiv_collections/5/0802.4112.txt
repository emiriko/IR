Natural languages are described in this paper in terms of networks of
synonyms: a word is identified with a node, and synonyms are connected by
undirected links. Our statistical analysis of the network of synonyms in Polish
language showed it is scale-free; similar to what is known for English. The
statistical properties of the networks are also similar. Thus, the statistical
aspects of the networks are good candidates for culture independent elements of
human language. We hypothesize that optimization for robustness and efficiency
is responsible for this universality. Despite the statistical similarity, there
is no one-to-one mapping between networks of these two languages. Although many
hubs in Polish are translated into similarly highly connected hubs in English,
there are also hubs specific to one of these languages only: a single word in
one language is equivalent to many different and disconnected words in the
other, in accordance with the Whorf hypothesis about language relativity.
Identifying language-specific hubs is vitally important for automatic
translation, and for understanding contextual, culturally related messages that
are frequently missed or twisted in a naive, literary translation.
