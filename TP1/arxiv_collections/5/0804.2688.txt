We discuss SUSY models in which renormalizable lepton number violating
couplings hide the decay of the Higgs through h -> \chi_1^0 + \chi_1^0 followed
by \chi_1^0 -> \tau + 2 jets or \chi_1^0 -> \nu_\tau + 2 jets and also explain
neutrino masses. This mechanism can be made compatible with gauge mediated SUSY
breaking.
