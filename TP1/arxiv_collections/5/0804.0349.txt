We propose a scheme for a phase qubit in an SIFIS junction, consisting of
bulk superconductors (S), a proximity-induced ferromagnet (F), and insulating
barriers (I). The qubit state is constituted by 0 and $\pi$ phase states of the
junction, in which the charging energy of the junction leads to the
superposition of the two states. The qubit is operated by the gate voltage
applied to the ferromagnet, and insensitive to the decoherence sources existing
in other superconducting qubits. We discuss a scalable scheme for qubit
measurement and tunable two-qubit coupling.
