Real networks can be classified into two categories: fractal networks and
non-fractal networks. Here we introduce a unifying model for the two types of
networks. Our model network is governed by a parameter $q$. We obtain the
topological properties of the network including the degree distribution,
average path length, diameter, fractal dimensions, and betweenness centrality
distribution, which are controlled by parameter $q$. Interestingly, we show
that by adjusting $q$, the networks undergo a transition from fractal to
non-fractal scalings, and exhibit a crossover from `large' to small worlds at
the same time. Our research may shed some light on understanding the evolution
and relationships of fractal and non-fractal networks.
