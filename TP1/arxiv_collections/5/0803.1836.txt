We examine whether renormalization effects can cause Newton's constant to
change dramatically with energy, perhaps even reducing the scale of quantum
gravity to the TeV region without the introduction of extra dimensions. We
examine a model that realizes this possibility and describe experimental
signatures from production of small black holes.
