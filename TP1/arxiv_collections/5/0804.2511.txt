We review reformulation of the map from tensor product of crystals to the
rigged configurations in terms of the energy function of affine crystals.
Especially, we give intuitive picture of the inverse scattering formalism for
the periodic box-ball systems formulated by Kuniba-Takagi-Takenouchi
(arXiv:math/0602481v2).
