A recent work has investigated the possibility that the mass scale for the
ultraviolet (UV) brane in the Randall-Sundrum (RS) model is of the order 10^3
TeV. In this so called ``Little Randall-Sundrum'' (LRS) model the bounds on the
gauge sector are less severe, permitting a lower Kaluza-Klein scale and cleaner
discovery channels. However employing a low UV scale nullifies one major appeal
of the RS model; namely the elegant explanation of the hierarchy between the
Planck and weak scales. In this work we show that by localizing the gauge,
fermion and scalar sector of the LRS model on a five dimensional slice of a
doubly warped spacetime one may obtain the low UV brane scale employed in the
LRS model and motivate the weak-Planck hierarchy. We also consider the
generalization to an n-warped spacetime.
