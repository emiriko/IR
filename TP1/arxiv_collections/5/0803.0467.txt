The paper proposes an envelope soliton model of the electron. The soliton
propagates within a waveguide which size varies with the potential. The soliton
is the solution of the Schroedinger equation with the addition of a nonlinear
term that is the negative of Bohm's Quantum potential. This potential is
interpreted as representing the dispersion of the linear equation. The model is
based on de Broglie's original wave-particle concept, which is based on the
Special theory of relativity. The model thus illustrates that theory.
