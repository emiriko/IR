Based on the monogamy of entanglement, we develop the technique of quantum
conditioning to build an {\it additive} entanglement measure: the conditional
entanglement of mutual information. Its {\it operational} meaning is elaborated
to be the minimal net "flow of qubits" in the process of partial state merging.
The result and conclusion can also be generalized to multipartite entanglement
cases.
