In the present work, we study, by means of a one-dimensional lattice model,
the collective excitations corresponding to intra molecular ones of a chain
like proteins. It is shown that such excitations are described by the Nonlinear
Schrodinger equation with saturation. The solutions obtained here are the bell
solitons, bubbles, kinks and crowdons. Since they belong to different sectors
on the parametric space, the bubble condensation could give place to some
important changes of face in this kind of nonlinear system. Additionally, it is
shown that the limiting velocity of the solitons is the velocity of sound waves
corresponding to longitudinal vibrations of molecules.
