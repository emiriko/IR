We calculate the geometric phase for different open systems (spin-boson and
spin-spin models). We study not only how they are corrected by the presence of
the different type of environments but also discuss the appearence of
decoherence effects. These should be taken into account when planning
experimental setups to study the geometric phase in the nonunitary regime. We
propose a model with slow decoherence rate in which the geometric phase is
still modified and might be measured.
