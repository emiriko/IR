For each finite real reflection group $W$, we identify a copy of the type-$W$
simplicial generalised associahedron inside the corresponding simplicial
permutahedron. This defines a bijection between the facets of the generalised
associahedron and the elements of the type $W$ non-crossing partition lattice
which is more tractable than previous such bijections. We show that the
simplicial fan determined by this associahedron coincides with the Cambrian fan
for $W$.
