In this dissertation, we discuss how our understanding of the large-N
spectrum of AdS/CFT has been deepened by integrability-based approaches. We
begin with a comprehensive review of the integrability of the gauge theory
spin-chain and that of the string sigma model. In the light of the AdS/CFT
duality, they should be just two ways of describing the same underlying
integrability, and it is believed that the unified integrability can be
characterised by a set of Bethe ansatz equations which is valid for all values
of the 't Hooft coupling. By studying the asymptotic spectrum of the AdS/CFT in
the infinite spin/R-charge limit, we first identify the corresponding solitonic
counterparts in the context of the AdS/CFT, which are the so-called dyonic
giant magnons and the SYM magnon boundstates. Then we show that the S-matrix
computed directly from the string solitons scattering precisely reproduces the
prediction from the conjecture. We further perform an analyticity test by
studying the singularities of the conjectured magnon boundstate S-matrix and
checking the physicality conditions. These tests give strong positive supports
for the integrability of large-N AdS/CFT as well as the specific form of the
conjectured Bethe ansatz equations. Concerning the string theory integrability,
we also provide a detailed study of certain classical string solutions on AdS_5
x S^5. These are constructed in such a way they correspond to generic soliton
solutions of (Complex) sine/sinh-Gordon equations via the so-called Pohlmeyer
reduction procedure. Furthermore, we describe them in terms of
algebro-geometric data as finite-gap solutions, giving a complete map of the
elliptic string solutions.
