The recent discovery of methods to isolate graphene, a one-atom-thick layer
of crystalline carbon, has raised the possibility of a new class of
nano-electronics devices based on the extraordinary electrical transport and
unusual physical properties of this material. However, the experimental
realization of devices displaying these properties was, until now, hampered by
the influence of the ambient environment, primarily the substrate. Here we
report on the fabrication of Suspended Graphene devices and on studies of their
electrical transport properties. In these devices, environmental disturbances
were minimized allowing unprecedented access to the intrinsic properties of
graphene close to the Dirac Point (DP) where the energy dispersion of the
carriers and their density-of-states vanish linearly giving rise to a range of
exotic physical properties. We show that charge inhomogeneity is reduced by
almost one order of magnitude compared to that in Non-Suspended Graphene
devices. Moreover, near the DP, the mobility exceeds 100,000 cm2/Vs,
approaching theoretical predictions for evanescent transport in the ballistic
model.
