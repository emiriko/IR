Some significant quantities in mathematics and physics are most naturally
expressed as the Fredholm determinant of an integral operator, most notably
many of the distribution functions in random matrix theory. Though their
numerical values are of interest, there is no systematic numerical treatment of
Fredholm determinants to be found in the literature. Instead, the few numerical
evaluations that are available rely on eigenfunction expansions of the
operator, if expressible in terms of special functions, or on alternative,
numerically more straightforwardly accessible analytic expressions, e.g., in
terms of Painleve transcendents, that have masterfully been derived in some
cases. In this paper we close the gap in the literature by studying projection
methods and, above all, a simple, easily implementable, general method for the
numerical evaluation of Fredholm determinants that is derived from the
classical Nystrom method for the solution of Fredholm equations of the second
kind. Using Gauss-Legendre or Clenshaw-Curtis as the underlying quadrature
rule, we prove that the approximation error essentially behaves like the
quadrature error for the sections of the kernel. In particular, we get
exponential convergence for analytic kernels, which are typical in random
matrix theory. The application of the method to the distribution functions of
the Gaussian unitary ensemble (GUE), in the bulk and the edge scaling limit, is
discussed in detail. After extending the method to systems of integral
operators, we evaluate the two-point correlation functions of the more recently
studied Airy and Airy1 processes for the first time.
