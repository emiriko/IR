Effects of Coulomb correlation on LaOFeAs electronic structure have been
investigated by LDA+DMFT(QMC) method. The calculation results show that LaOFeAs
is in the regime of intermediate correlation strength with significant part of
the spectral density moved from the Fermi energy to Hubbard bands. However the
system is not on the edge of metal insulator-transition because increase of the
Coulomb interaction parameter value from $U$=4.0 eV to $U$=5.0 eV did not
result in insulator state. Correlations affect different d-orbitals not in the
same way. $t_{2g}$ states ($xz,yz$ and $x^2-y^2$ orbitals) have higher energy
due to crystal filed splitting and are nearly half-filled. Their spectral
functions have pseudogap with Fermi energy position on the higher sub-band
slope. Lower energy $e_g$ set of d-orbitals ($3z^2-r^2$ and $xy$) have
significantly larger occupancy values with typically metallic spectral
functions.
