The Groverian measures are analytically computed in various types of
three-qubit states. The final results are also expressed in terms of
local-unitary invariant quantities in each type. This fact reflects the
manifest local-unitary invariance of the Groverian measure. It is also shown
that the analytical expressions for various types have correct limits to other
types. For some types (type 4 and type 5) we failed to compute the analytical
expression of the Groverian measure in this paper. However, from the
consideration of local-unitary invariants we have shown that the Groverian
measure in type 4 should be independent of the phase factor $\phi$, which
appear in the three-qubit state $|\psi>$. This fact with geometric
interpretation on the Groverian measure may enable us to derive the analytical
expressions for general arbitrary three-qubit states in near future.
