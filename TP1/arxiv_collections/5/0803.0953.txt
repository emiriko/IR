We study the tunneling zone solutions of a one-dimensional electrostatic
potential for the relativistic (Dirac to Klein-Gordon) wave equation when the
incoming wave packet exhibits the possibility of being almost totally
transmitted through the barrier. The transmission probabilities, the phase
times and the dwell times for the proposed relativistic dynamics are obtained
and the conditions for the occurrence of accelerated tunneling transmission are
all quantified. We show that, in some limiting cases, the analytical
difficulties that arise when the stationary phase method is employed for
obtaining phase (traversal) tunneling times are all overcome. Lessons
concerning the phenomenology of the relativistic tunneling suggest revealing
insights into condensed-matter experiments using electrostatic barriers for
which the accelerated tunneling effect can be observed.
