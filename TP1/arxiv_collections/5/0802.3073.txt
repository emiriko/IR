Parametric amplification is an interesting way of artificially increasing a
MEMS Quality factor and could be helpful in many kinds of applications. This
paper presents a theoretical study of this principle, based on Matlab/Simulink
simulations, and proposes design guidelines for parametric structures. A new
device designed with this approach is presented together with the corresponding
FEM simulation results.
