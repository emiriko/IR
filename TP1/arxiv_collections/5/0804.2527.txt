We present an empirical expression which holds for the lowest excitation
energy of the natural parity states in even-even nuclei throughout the entire
periodic table. This formula contains spin-dependent factors so that it is
applied to different multipole states with the same model parameters in
contrast to the recently proposed empirical expression where the model
parameters had to be fitted for each multipole separately.
