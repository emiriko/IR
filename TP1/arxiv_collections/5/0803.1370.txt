This reading expounds with expediency on the recently proposed Azimuthally
Symmetric Theory of Gravitation (ASTG) set-up earlier. At its inspection, it
was demonstrated that the ASTG is capable (among others solar anomalies) of
explaining the precession of the perihelion of solar planets. In the present,
we show that the ASTG is capable of explaining the puzzling observations of
flyby anomalies, i.e. the anomalous asymptotic speed increases of the
osculating hyperbolic speed excess. It is shown that these flyby anomalies
occur naturally in the ASTG. We derive the empirical formula proposed by
Anderson et al. in 2008, which up to now has no physical or foundational basis
except that experience suggest it. If the ASTG model is correct, then for the
first time the Anderson et al. formula is given a physical meaning.
