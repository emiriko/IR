We study the quenching dynamics of a one-dimensional spin-1/2 $XY$ model in a
transverse field when the transverse field $h(=t/\tau)$ is quenched repeatedly
between $-\infty$ and $+\infty$. A single passage from $h \to - \infty$ to $h
\to +\infty$ or the other way around is referred to as a half-period of
quenching. For an even number of half-periods, the transverse field is brought
back to the initial value of $-\infty$; in the case of an odd number of
half-periods, the dynamics is stopped at $h \to +\infty$. The density of
defects produced due to the non-adiabatic transitions is calculated by mapping
the many-particle system to an equivalent Landau-Zener problem and is generally
found to vary as $1/\sqrt{\tau}$ for large $\tau$; however, the magnitude is
found to depend on the number of half-periods of quenching. For two successive
half-periods, the defect density is found to decrease in comparison to a single
half-period, suggesting the existence of a corrective mechanism in the reverse
path. A similar behavior of the density of defects and the local entropy is
observed for repeated quenching. The defect density decays as $1/{\sqrt\tau}$
for large $\tau$ for any number of half-periods, and shows a increase in kink
density for small $\tau$ for an even number; the entropy shows qualitatively
the same behavior for any number of half-periods. The probability of
non-adiabatic transitions and the local entropy saturate to 1/2 and $\ln 2$,
respectively, for a large number of repeated quenching.
