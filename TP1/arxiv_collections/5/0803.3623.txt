The dispersive interaction between nanotubes is investigated through ab
initio theory calculations and in an analytical approximation. A van der Waals
density functional (vdW-DF) [Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 246401 (2004)] is used to
determine and compare the binding of a pair of nanotubes as well as in a
nanotube crystal. To analyze the interaction and determine the importance of
morphology, we furthermore compare results of our ab initio calculations with a
simple analytical result that we obtain for a pair of well-separated nanotubes.
In contrast to traditional density functional theory calculations, the vdW-DF
study predicts an intertube vdW bonding with a strength that is consistent with
recent observations for the interlayer binding in graphitics. It also produce a
nanotube wall-to-wall separation which is in very good agreement with
experiments. Moreover, we find that the vdW-DF result for the nanotube-crystal
binding energy can be approximated by a sum of nanotube-pair interactions when
these are calculated in vdW-DF. This observation suggests a framework for an
efficient implementation of quantum-physical modeling of the CNT bundling in
more general nanotube bundles, including nanotube yarn and rope structures.
