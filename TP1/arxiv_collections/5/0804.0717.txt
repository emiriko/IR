We investigate the effect of supersymmetric (SUSY) threshold corrections on
the values of the running quark and charged lepton masses at the GUT scale
within the large $\tan\beta$ regime of the MSSM. In addition to the typically
dominant SUSY QCD contributions for the quarks, we also include the electroweak
contributions for quarks and leptons and show that they can have significant
effects. We provide the GUT scale ranges of quark and charged lepton Yukawa
couplings as well as of the ratios $m_\mu/m_s$, $m_e/m_d$, $y_\tau/y_b$ and
$y_t/y_b$ for three example ranges of SUSY parameters. We discuss how the
enlarged ranges due to threshold effects might open up new possibilities for
constructing GUT models of fermion masses and mixings.
