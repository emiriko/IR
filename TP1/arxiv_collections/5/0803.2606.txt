The momentum distributions associated with both the wave function of a
particle behind a grating and the corresponding Bohmian trajectories are
investigated and compared. Near the grating, it is observed that the former
does not depend on the distance from the grating, while the latter changes with
this distance. However, as one moves further apart from the grating, in the far
field, both distributions become identical.
