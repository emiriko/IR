We report the observation of a Purcell enhancement in the electroluminescence
decay rate of a single quantum dot, embedded in a microcavity
light-emitting-diode structure. Lateral confinement of the optical mode was
achieved using an annulus of low-refractive-index aluminium oxide, formed by
wet oxidation. The same layer acts as a current aperture, reducing the active
area of the device without impeding the electrical properties of the p-i-n
diode. This allowed single photon electroluminescence to be demonstrated at
repetition rates up to 0.5 GHz.
