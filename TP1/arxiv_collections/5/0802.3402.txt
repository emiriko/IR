We show that the secant varieties of rank three compact Hermitian symmetric
spaces in their minimal homogeneous embeddings are normal, with rational
singularities. We show that their ideals are generated in degree three - with
one exception, the secant variety of the $21$-dimensional spinor variety in
$\pp{63}$ where we show the ideal is generated in degree four. We also discuss
the coordinate rings of secant varieties of compact Hermitian symmetric spaces.
