The formulae needed to parametrise sigma, kappa, a0(980) and f0(980) are
reviewed. For sigma and kappa, the Adler zero due to Chiral Symmetry Breaking
plays a crucial role. The f0(980) and a0(980) are locked to the KK threshold by
a cusp mechanism which leads to a sharp peak in attraction at the threshold.
This mechanism may play a wider role. A novel suggestion is that the
confinement potential involves a cooperative effect between QCD effects
(coloured quarks and gluons) and conventional meson exchanges.
