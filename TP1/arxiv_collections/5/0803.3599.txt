The standard equations for semiconductor device analysis were solved by
specifying the electron and hole current injected at a small contact, assuming
high-level injection. Calculated current-voltage characteristics were fit to
measurements of a single point breakdown in an ultrathin dielectric. It was
found that the minority carrier injection level was about 70%.
