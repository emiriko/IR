We study the statistical meaning of the minimization of distortion measure
and the relation between the equilibrium points of the SOM algorithm and the
minima of distortion measure. If we assume that the observations and the map
lie in an compact Euclidean space, we prove the strong consistency of the map
which almost minimizes the empirical distortion. Moreover, after calculating
the derivatives of the theoretical distortion measure, we show that the points
minimizing this measure and the equilibria of the Kohonen map do not match in
general. We illustrate, with a simple example, how this occurs.
