We give labeled natural deduction systems for a family of tense logics
extending the basic linear tense logic Kl. We prove that our systems are sound
and complete with respect to the usual Kripke semantics, and that they possess
a number of useful normalization properties (in particular, derivations reduce
to a normal form that enjoys a subformula property). We also discuss how to
extend our systems to capture richer logics like (fragments of) LTL.
