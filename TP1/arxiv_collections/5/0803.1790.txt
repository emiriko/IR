We study how much the unique ability of the OPERA experiment to directly
detect \nu_\tau can help in probing new, non-standard contact interactions of
the third family of neutrinos. We perform a combined analysis of future,
high-statistics MINOS and OPERA data. For the case of non-standard interactions
in \nu_\mu to \nu_e transitions we also include the impact of possible
DoubleCHOOZ data. In all cases we find that the \nu_\tau sample of OPERA is too
small to be statistically significant, even if one doubles the nominal exposure
of OPERA to 4.5E20 pot. OPERA's real benefit for this measurement lies in its
very high neutrino energy and hence very different L/E compared to MINOS.
