DNA inversion is an important mechanism by which bacteria and bacteriophage
switch reversibly between phenotypic states. In such switches, the orientation
of a short DNA element is flipped by a site-specific recombinase enzyme. We
propose a simple model for a DNA inversion switch in which recombinase
production is dependent on the switch state (orientational control). Our model
is inspired by the fim switch in Escherichia coli. We present an exact
analytical solution of the chemical master equation for the model switch, as
well as stochastic simulations. Orientational control causes the switch to
deviate from Poissonian behaviour: the distribution of times in the on state
shows a peak and successive flip times are correlated.
