The entropy of a hierarchical network topology in an ensemble of sparse
random networks with "hidden variables" associated to its nodes, is the
log-likelihood that a given network topology is present in the chosen
ensemble.We obtain a general formula for this entropy,which has a clear simple
interpretation in some simple limiting cases. The results provide new keys with
which to solve the general problem of "fitting" a given network with an
appropriate ensemble of random networks.
