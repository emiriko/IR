The research presented in this paper establishes a valid, and simplified,
revision of previous spreadsheet error classifications. This investigation is
concerned with the results of a web survey and two web-based gender and
domain-knowledge free spreadsheet error identification exercises. The
participants of the survey and exercises were a test group of professionals
(all of whom regularly use spreadsheets) and a control group of students from
the University of Greenwich (UK). The findings show that over 85% of users are
also the spreadsheet's developer, supporting the revised spreadsheet error
classification. The findings also show that spreadsheet error identification
ability is directly affected both by spreadsheet experience and by error-type
awareness. In particular, that spreadsheet error-type awareness significantly
improves the user's ability to identify, the more surreptitious, qualitative
error.
