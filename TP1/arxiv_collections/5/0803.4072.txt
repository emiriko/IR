Stationary rotating strings can be viewed as geodesic motions in appropriate
metrics on a two-dimensional space. We obtain all solutions describing
stationary rotating strings in flat spacetime as an application. These rotating
strings have infinite length with various wiggly shapes. Averaged value of the
string energy, the angular momentum and the linear momentum along the string
are discussed.
