We have investigated the properties of the structure functions of the
nucleons in the context of the statistical model using only the radius
parameter of the respective nucleons. The radius of the neutron has been
estimated and is found to be 0.8fm. It is interesting to observe that the
proton radius 0.865fm which exactly equals to the most accepted charge radius
of the proton and which in turn characterizes proton as a meso object, yields
reasonable results for the structure function and its properties. GT sum rule
has been investigated with some interesting conclusions.
