We have investigated the systematic transport properties of the layered
112-type cobaltite LaBaCo2O5.5 by means of electrical resistivity,
magnetoresistance, electroresistance and thermoelectric measurements in various
conditions. In order to understand the complex conduction mechanism of
LaBaCo2O5.5, the transport data have been analyzed using different theoretical
models. The system shows semiconductor-semiconductor like transition (TSC)
around 326K, corresponding to ferromagnetic transition and in the low
temperature region resistivity data follows the Motts variable range hopping
model. Interestingly, near and below the room temperature this compound depicts
significant change in electro- and magnetoresistance behavior, the latter one
is noteworthy near the magnetic phase boundary. The temperature dependence of
thermopower, S(T), exhibits p-type polaronic conductivity in the temperature
range of 60-320K and reaches a maximum value of 303 uV/K (at 120K). In the low
temperature AFM region, the unusual S(T) behavior, generally observed for the
cobaltite series LnBaCo2O5.5 (Ln = Rare Earth), is explained by the electron
magnon scattering mechanism as previously described for perovskite manganites.
