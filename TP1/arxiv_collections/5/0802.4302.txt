We discuss a characteristic free version of Frobenius splittings for toric
varieties and give a polyhedral criterion for a toric variety to be diagonally
split. We apply this criterion to show that section rings of nef line bundles
on diagonally split toric varieties are normally presented and Koszul, and that
Schubert varieties are not diagonally split in general.
