A new method is presented, that can help a person become aware of his or her
unconscious preferences, and convey them to others in the form of verbal
explanation. The method combines the concepts of reflection, visualization, and
verbalization. The method was tested in an experiment where the unconscious
preferences of the subjects for various artworks were investigated. In the
experiment, two lessons were learned. The first is that it helps the subjects
become aware of their unconscious preferences to verbalize weak preferences as
compared with strong preferences through discussion over preference diagrams.
The second is that it is effective to introduce an adjustable factor into
visualization to adapt to the differences in the subjects and to foster their
mutual understanding.
