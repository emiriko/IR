The process e+ e- -> phi -> K+ K- has been studied with the CMD-2 detector
using about 542 000 events detected in the center-of-mass energy range from
1.01 to 1.034 GeV. The systematic error of the cross section is estimated to be
2.2%. The phi(1020) meson parameters in the phi -> K+K- decay channel have been
measured: sigma_0(phi-> K+K-) = 2016 +- 8 +- 44 nb, m(phi) = 1019.441 +- 0.008
+- 0.080 MeV/c2, Gamma(phi) = 4.24 +- 0.02 +- 0.03 MeV, B(e+e-)B(K+K-) = (14.27
+- 0.05 +- 0.31)*10(-5).
