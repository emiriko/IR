Discussion of the equatorial photon motion in Kerr-Newman black-hole and
naked-singularity spacetimes with a non-zero cosmological constant is
presented. Both repulsive and attractive cosmological constants are considered.
Circular photon orbits are determined, and their stability is established. The
spacetimes are divided into separated classes according to the properties of
the `effective potential'. There is a special class of Kerr-Newman-de Sitter
black-hole spacetimes with so-called `restricted repulsive barrier'. Further,
the azimuthal motion is discussed and photon trajectories are given in typical
situations. It is shown that for some photons with negative impact parameter
turning points of their azimuthal motion can exist.
