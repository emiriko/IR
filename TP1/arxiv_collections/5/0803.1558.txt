Proteins are polymerized by cyclic machines called ribosome which use their
messenger RNA (mRNA) track also as the corresponding template and the process
is called translation. We explore, in depth and detail, the stochastic nature
of the translation. We compute various distributions associated with the
translation process; one of them, namely dwell time distribution, has been
measured in recent single ribosome experiments (Wen et al. Nature {\bf 452},
598 (2008)). The form of this distribution predicted by our theory is
consistent with that extracted from the experimental data. For our quantitative
calculations, we use a model that captures both the mechano-chemistry of each
individual ribosome as well as their steric interactions. We also demonstrate
the effects of the sequence inhomogeneities of real genes on the fluctuations
and noise in translation. In principle, our new predictions can be tested by
carrying out {\it in-vitro} experiments.
