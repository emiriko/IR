Modifying the Kerr-Schild transformation used to generate black and white
hole spacetimes, new dynamic black and white holes are obtained using a
time-dependent Kerr-Schild scalar field. Physical solutions are found for black
holes that shrink with time and for white holes that expand with time. The
black hole spacetimes are physical only in the vicinity of the black hole, with
the physical region increasing in radius with time. The white hole spacetimes
are physical throughout. Unlike the standard Schwarzschild solution the
singularities are non-isolated, since the time-dependence introduces a
mass-energy distribution. The surfaces in the metrics where g_{tt}=g^{rr}=0 are
dynamic, moving inward with time for the black holes and outward for the white
holes, which leads to a question of whether these spacetimes truly have event
horizons--a problem shared with Vaidya's cosmological black hole spacetimes. By
finding a surface that shrinks or expands at the same rate as the null
geodesics move, and within which null geodesics move inward or outward faster
than the surfaces shrink or expand respectively, it is verified that these do
in fact behave like black and white holes.
