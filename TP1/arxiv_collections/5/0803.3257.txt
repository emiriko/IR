We nonperturbatively investigate a fermion spectrum at finite temperature in
a chiral invariant linear sigma model. Coupled Schwinger-Dyson equations for
fermion and boson are developed in the real time formalism and solved
numerically. From the coupling of a massless fermion with a massive boson, the
fermion spectrum shows a three-peak structure at some temperatures even for the
strong coupling region. This means that the three-peak structure which was
originally found in the one-loop calculation is stable against higher order
corrections even in the strong coupling region.
