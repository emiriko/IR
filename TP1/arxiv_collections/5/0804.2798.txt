Phase-Rectified Signal Averaging (PRSA) was shown to be a powerful tool for
the study of quasi-periodic oscillations and nonlinear effects in
non-stationary signals. Here we present a bivariate PRSA technique for the
study of the inter-relationship between two simultaneous data recordings. Its
performance is compared with traditional cross-correlation analysis, which,
however, does not work well for non-stationary data and cannot distinguish the
coupling directions in complex nonlinear situations. We show that bivariate
PRSA allows the analysis of events in one signal at times where the other
signal is in a certain phase or state; it is stable in the presence of noise
and impassible to non-stationarities.
