We use the conformal invariance and the holographic correspondence to fully
specify the dependence of entanglement entropy on the extrinsic geometry of the
2d surface $\Sigma$ that separates two subsystems of quantum strongly coupled
${\mathcal{N}}=4$ SU(N) superconformal gauge theory. We extend this result and
calculate entanglement entropy of a generic 4d conformal field theory. As a
byproduct, we obtain a closed-form expression for the entanglement entropy in
flat space-time when $\Sigma$ is sphere $S_2$ and when $\Sigma$ is
two-dimensional cylinder. The contribution of the type A conformal anomaly to
entanglement entropy is always determined by topology of surface $\Sigma$ while
the dependence of the entropy on the extrinsic geometry of $\Sigma$ is due to
the type B conformal anomaly.
