It is usual in introductory courses of mechanics to develop the work and
energy formalism from Newton's laws. On the other hand, literature analyzes the
way in which forces transform under a change of reference frame.
Notwithstanding, no analogous study is done for the way in which work and
energy transform under those changes of reference frames. We analyze the
behavior of energy and work under such transformations and show explicitly the
expected invariance of the formalism under Galilean transformations for one
particle and a system of particles. The case of non inertial systems is also
analyzed and the fictitious works are characterized. In particular, we show
that the total fictitious work in the center of mass system vanishes even if
the center of mass defines a non inertial frame. Finally, some subtleties that
arise from the formalism are illustrated by examples.
