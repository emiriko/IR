By means of optimal control techniques we model and optimize the manipulation
of the external quantum state (center-of-mass motion) of atoms trapped in
adjustable optical potentials. We consider in detail the cases of both non
interacting and interacting atoms moving between neighboring sites in a lattice
of a double-well optical potentials. Such a lattice can perform
interaction-mediated entanglement of atom pairs and can realize two-qubit
quantum gates. The optimized control sequences for the optical potential allow
transport faster and with significantly larger fidelity than is possible with
processes based on adiabatic transport.
