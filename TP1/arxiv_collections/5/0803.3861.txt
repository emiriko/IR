We present a method for determining the free energy dependence on a selected
number of collective variables using an adaptive bias. The formalism provides a
unified description which has metadynamics and canonical sampling as limiting
cases. Convergence and errors can be rigorously and easily controlled. The
parameters of the simulation can be tuned so as to focus the computational
effort only on the physically relevant regions of the order parameter space.
The algorithm is tested on the reconstruction of alanine dipeptide free energy
landscape.
