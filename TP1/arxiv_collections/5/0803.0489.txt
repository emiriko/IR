We study Ising spin models on finitely connected random interaction graphs
which are drawn from an ensemble in which not only the degree distribution
$p(k)$ can be chosen arbitrarily, but which allows for further fine-tuning of
the topology via preferential attachment of edges on the basis of an arbitrary
function Q(k,k') of the degrees of the vertices involved. We solve these models
using finite connectivity equilibrium replica theory, within the replica
symmetric ansatz. In our ensemble of graphs, phase diagrams of the spin system
are found to depend no longer only on the chosen degree distribution, but also
on the choice made for Q(k,k'). The increased ability to control interaction
topology in solvable models beyond prescribing only the degree distribution of
the interaction graph enables a more accurate modeling of real-world
interacting particle systems by spin systems on suitably defined random graphs.
