We analyze the AC electro-osmotic motion of a 1:1 aqueous solution, taking
into account the difference in mobilities and diffusion coefficients between
positive and negative ions. This model serves to understand the behavior of
common systems as a solution of NaCl in water. We pay special attention to two
cases. First, the case of slightly different mobilities, that can model a KCl
solution. Second, the case of a strongly asymmetric solution, with an almost
vanishing mobility, applicable to the case of a salt where the negative ion is
much more massive than the positive one. For all the cases, we perform the
mathematical description and linear analysis of the problem, in order to
establish the dependence of the induced velocity with the frequency, wavelength
and amplitude of the applied voltage.
