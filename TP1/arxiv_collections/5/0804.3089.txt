The aim of this paper is to show that a probability measure concentrates
independently of the dimension like a gaussian measure if and only if it
verifies Talagrand's $\T_2$ transportation-cost inequality. This theorem
permits us to give a new and very short proof of a result of Otto and Villani.
Generalizations to other types of concentration are also considered. In
particular, one shows that the Poincar\'e inequality is equivalent to a certain
form of dimension free exponential concentration. The proofs of these results
rely on simple Large Deviations techniques.
