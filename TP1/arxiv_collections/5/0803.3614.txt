We construct time reversal invariant topological superconductors and
superfluids in two and three dimensions which are analogous to the recently
discovered quantum spin Hall and three-d $Z_2$ topological insulators
respectively. These states have a full pairing gap in the bulk, gapless
counter-propagating Majorana states at the boundary, and a pair of Majorana
zero modes associated with each vortex. We show that the time reversal symmetry
naturally emerges as a supersymmetry, which changes the parity of the fermion
number associated with each time-reversal invariant vortex. In the presence of
external T-breaking fields, non-local topological correlation is established
among these fields, which is an experimentally observable manifestation of the
emergent supersymmetry.
