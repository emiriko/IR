We introduce an approximate phase-space technique to simulate the quantum
dynamics of interacting bosons. With the future goal of treating Bose-Einstein
condensate systems, the method is designed for systems with a natural
separation into highly occupied (condensed) modes and lightly occupied modes.
The method self-consistently uses the Wigner representation to treat highly
occupied modes and the positive-P representation for lightly occupied modes. In
this method, truncation of higher-derivative terms from the Fokker-Planck
equation is usually necessary. However, at least in the cases investigated
here, the resulting systematic error, over a finite time, vanishes in the limit
of large Wigner occupation numbers. We tested the method on a system of two
interacting anharmonic oscillators, with high and low occupations,
respectively. The Hybrid method successfully predicted atomic quadratures to a
useful simulation time 60 times longer than that of the positive-P method. The
truncated Wigner method also performed well in this test. For the prediction of
the correlation in a quantum nondemolition measurement scheme, for this same
system, the Hybrid method gave excellent agreement with the exact result, while
the truncated Wigner method showed a large systematic error.
