The isolation lemma of Mulmuley et al \cite{MVV87} is an important tool in
the design of randomized algorithms and has played an important role in several
nontrivial complexity upper bounds. On the other hand, polynomial identity
testing is a well-studied algorithmic problem with efficient randomized
algorithms and the problem of obtaining efficient \emph{deterministic} identity
tests has received a lot of attention recently. The goal of this note is to
compare the isolation lemma with polynomial identity testing: 1. We show that
derandomizing reasonably restricted versions of the isolation lemma implies
circuit size lower bounds. We derive the circuit lower bounds by examining the
connection between the isolation lemma and polynomial identity testing. We give
a randomized polynomial-time identity test for noncommutative circuits of
polynomial degree based on the isolation lemma. Using this result, we show that
derandomizing the isolation lemma implies noncommutative circuit size lower
bounds. The restricted versions of the isolation lemma we consider are natural
and would suffice for the standard applications of the isolation lemma. 2. From
the result of Klivans-Spielman \cite{KS01} we observe that there is a
randomized polynomial-time identity test for commutative circuits of polynomial
degree, also based on a more general isolation lemma for linear forms.
Consequently, derandomization of (a suitable version of) this isolation lemma
also implies circuit size lower bounds in the commutative setting.
