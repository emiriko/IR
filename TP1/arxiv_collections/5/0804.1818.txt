We studied the effect of quantum confinement on the size of the band gap in
single layer epitaxial graphene. Samples with different graphene terrace sizes
are studied by using low energy electron microscopy (LEEM) and angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). The direct correlation between the terrace
size extracted from LEEM and the gap size extracted from ARPES shows that
quantum confinement alone cannot account for the large gap observed in
epitaxial graphene samples.
