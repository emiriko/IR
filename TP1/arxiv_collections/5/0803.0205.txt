We investigated the crystal structure of Rb$_2$Cu$_3$SnF$_{12}$ and its
magnetic properties using single crystals. This compound is composed of Kagome
layers of corner-sharing CuF$_{6}$ octahedra with a 2a x 2a enlarged cell as
compared with the proper Kagome layer. Rb$_2$Cu$_3$SnF$_{12}$ is magnetically
described as an $S$=1/2 modified Kagome antiferromagnet with four kinds of
neighboring exchange interaction. From magnetic susceptibility and high-field
magnetization measurements, it was found that the ground state is a disordered
singlet with the spin gap, as predicted from a recent theory. Exact
diagonalization for a 12-site Kagome cluster was performed to analyze the
magnetic susceptibility, and individual exchange interactions were evaluated.
