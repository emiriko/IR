The 24Mg(3He,t)24Al reaction has been studied at E(3He)=420 MeV. An energy
resolution of 35 keV was achieved. Gamow-Teller strengths to discrete levels in
24Al are extracted by using a recently developed empirical relationship for the
proportionality between Gamow-Teller strengths and differential cross sections
at zero momentum transfer. Except for small discrepancies for a few weak
excitations, good agreement with previous 24Mg(p,n) data and nuclear-structure
calculations using the USDA/B interactions in the sd shell-model space is
found. The excitation energy of several levels in 24Al of significance for
determination of the 23Mg(p,gamma)24Al thermonuclear reaction rate were
measured. Results are consistent with two of the three previous (3He,t)
measurements, performed at much lower beam energies. However, a new state at
Ex(24Al)=2.605(10) MeV was found and is the third state above the proton
separation energy.
