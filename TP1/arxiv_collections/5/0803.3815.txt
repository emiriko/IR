Using the language of h-Hopf algebroids which was introduced by Etingof and
Varchenko, we construct a dynamical quantum group, F_ell(GL(n)), from the
elliptic solution of the quantum dynamical Yang-Baxter equation with spectral
parameter associated to the Lie algebra sl_n. We apply the generalized FRST
construction and obtain an h-bialgebroid F_ell(M(n)). Natural analogs of the
exterior algebra and their matrix elements, elliptic minors, are defined and
studied. We show how to use the cobraiding to prove that the elliptic
determinant is central. Localizing at this determinant and constructing an
antipode we obtain the h-Hopf algebroid F_ell(GL(n)).
