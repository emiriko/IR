First, a condition for the Bose-Einstein transition in the superfluid liquid
helium is presented due to the creation of a free neutron spinless pairs in a
liquid helium and a dilute neutron gas mixture. We proposed a new model of
dilute Bose gas, where presence atoms in the condensate is a suppressor for the
collective modes as well as a creator for single-particle excitations On other
hand, it is shown that the terms, of the interaction between the excitations of
the Bose gas and the density modes of the neutron, meditate an attractive
interaction via the neutron modes, which in turn leads to a bound state on a
spinless neutron pair. The lambda transition is defined by a condition for the
Bose-Einstein transition, which transforms reflected neutron pair modes to
single neutron modes.
