In this paper we generalize our investigation of the unitarity of non-compact
WZNW models connected to Hermitian symmetric spaces to the N=1 world-sheet
supersymmetric extension of these models. We will prove that these models have
a unitary spectrum in a BRST approach for antidominant highest weight
representations if the level and weights of the gauged subalgebra are integers.
We will find new critical string theories in 7 and 9 space-time dimensions.
