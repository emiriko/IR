We propose here an explanation of the Pioneer anomaly which is not in
conflict with the cartography of the solar system. In our model, the spaceship
does not suffer any extra acceleration but follows the trajectory predicted by
standard gravitational theory. The observed acceleration is not real but
apparent and has the same observational footprint as a deceleration of
astronomical time with respect to atomic time. The details can be summarized as
follows: i) as we argued in a recent paper, there is an unavoidable coupling
between the background gravitation that pervades the universe and the quantum
vacuum because of the long range and universality of gravity; ii) via the
fourth Heisenberg relation, we show that this coupling causes a progressive
desynchronization of the astronomical and atomic clock-times, in such a way
that the former decelerates adiabatically with respect to the latter; and iii)
since gravitational theory uses astronomical time and the observers use atomic
time (they are using devices based on quantum physics), this desynchronization
necessarily causes a discrepancy between theory and observation, so that the
observed velocity of the spaceship is smaller than the predicted one, in such a
way that the Pioneer seems to lag behind its expected position. The discoverers
of the anomaly suggested "the possibility that the origin of the anomalous
signal is new physics" although they added "the most likely cause of the effect
is an unknown systematics," but also that "In the unlikely event that there is
new physics, one does not want to miss it because one had the wrong mind set."
