We use the Local Density Approximation in combination with the Dynamical Mean
Field Theory to investigate intermediate energy properties of the copper
oxides. We identify coherent and incoherent spectral features that results from
doping a charge transfer insulator, namely quasiparticles, Zhang-Rice singlet
band, and the upper and lower Hubbard bands. Angle resolving these features, we
identify a \emphasize{waterfall} like feature, between the quasiparticle part
and the incoherent part of the Zhang-Rice band. We investigate the assymetry
between particle and hole doping. On the hole doped side, there is a very rapid
transfer of spectral weight upon doping in the one particle spectra. The
optical spectral weight increases superlinearly on the hole doped side in
agreement with experiments.
