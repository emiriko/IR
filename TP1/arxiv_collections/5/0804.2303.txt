We reanalyze the data on the in-plane far infrared conductivity of underdoped
orthoII YBa$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$O$_{6.50}$ (YBCO$_{6.50}$) in terms of a model in
which a pseudogap opens on part of the Fermi surface with the remaining ungaped
piece proportional to the temperature. The motivation for our model comes from
recent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy data in underdoped
Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ (Bi-2212), which have revealed the existence
of arcs on the Fermi surface. We find the optical data to be consistent with
arc formation. In addition we find some evidence that the electronic states
lost below the pseudogap energy $\Delta_{pg}$ are recovered in the energy
region immediately above it at least for temperatures near $T_c$.
