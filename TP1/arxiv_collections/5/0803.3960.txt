In this work we perform the parameter tuning of three flavors of dynamical
clover quarks on anisotropic lattices. The fermion action uses
three-dimensional spatial stout-link smearing. The gauge anisotropy is
determined in a small box with Schr\"odinger background using Wilson-loop
ratios. The fermion anisotropy is obtained from studying the meson dispersion
relation with antiperiodic boundary conditions in the time direction. The
spatial and temporal clover coefficients are fixed to the tree-level
tadpole-improved values, and we demonstrate that they satisfy the
nonperturbative conditions as determined by the Schr\"odinger functional
method. For the desired lattice spacing $a_s\approx 0.12$ fm and renormalized
anisotropy $\xi=3.5$, we find the gauge and fermionic anisotropies can be fixed
to quark mass independent values up through the strange quark mass. This work
lays the foundation needed for further studies of the excited-state hadron
spectrum.
