We compute the next-to-leading order QCD corrections to the ``direct'' part
of the spin-dependent cross section for hadron-pair photoproduction. The
calculation is performed using largely analytical methods. We present a brief
phenomenological study of our results focussing on the $K$-factors and scale
dependence of the next-to-leading order cross sections. This process is
relevant for the extraction of the gluon polarization in present and future
spin-dependent lepton-nucleon scattering experiments.
