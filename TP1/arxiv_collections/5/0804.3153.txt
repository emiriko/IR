Thermodynamics of quasianti-Hermitian quaternionic systems with constant
number of particles in equilibrium is studied. A toy model is introduced and
the physically relevant quantities are derived. The energy fluctuation which
shows that for large N the relative r.m.s fluctuation in the values of E is
quite negligible is derived. The negative temperature for such systems is also
studied. Finally a physical example is discussed and physical explanations in
the context of quantum physics are given.
