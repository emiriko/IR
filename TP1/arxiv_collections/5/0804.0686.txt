The optimal exponential error rate for adaptive discrimination of two
channels is discussed. In this problem, adaptive choice of input signal is
allowed. This problem is discussed in various settings. It is proved that
adaptive choice does not improve the exponential error rate in these settings.
These results are applied to quantum state discrimination.
