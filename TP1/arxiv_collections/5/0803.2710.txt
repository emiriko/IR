In this article, we investigate the purity dynamics of entangled 2 two-level
atoms interacting with a single quantized electromagnetic field. We show that
the purity of the qubit pairs depends on the initial state of the atomic
system. It is found that the superposition case is the best choice to generate
entangled states with high purity and hence high entanglement. It is clear that
the purity of one qubit can be purified at the expense of the other pair
through the phenomena of purity swapping. The mean photon number plays an
important role in increasing the purity. The robustness of the quantum channel
is investigated in the presence of individual attacks, where we study the
separability of these channels and evaluate its fidelity. Finally, we use the
partial entangled states as quantum channels to perform the original coding
protocol. We find that Bob can obtain the coded information with reasonable
percentage. The inequality of security is tested, where we determine the
interval of times in which Alice and Bob can communicatesecurely. These
intervals depend on the type of error and the structure of the initial atomic
system
