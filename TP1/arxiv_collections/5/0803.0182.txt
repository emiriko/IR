We examine the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the staggered Dirac operator
on thermal ensembles created in QCD with two flavours of staggered quarks. We
see that across the phase transition a gap opens in the spectrum. For finite
volume lattices in the low-temperature phase the eigenvectors are extended, but
generic field configurations in the high temperature phase give rise to
localized eigenstates. We examine measures of the stability of such
localization and find that at finite volumes localization occurs through Mott's
mechanism of the formation of mobility edges. However, the band gap between the
localized and extended states seem to scale to zero in the limit of large
volume.
