Proper tuning of the orbital characteristics of the three spacecrafts that
constitute the usual triangular configuration of the space-borne
gravitational-wave detector LISA, could minimize the breathing mode of its
arm-lengths. Since the three spacecrafts form three pairs of interferometric
arms, we have the freedom to minimize whichever combination of arm-length
variations that might be useful in signal analysis. Thus for any kind of time
delay interferometry (TDI), that is chosen to be used in analysing the data,
the optimal orbital characteristics could be chosen accordingly, so as to
enhance the performance of the gravitational wave detector.
