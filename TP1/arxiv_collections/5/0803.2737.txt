We directly measure the chemical potential jump in the low-temperature limit
when the filling factor traverses the nu = 1/3 and nu = 2/5 fractional gaps in
two-dimensional (2D) electron system in GaAs/AlGaAs single heterojunctions. In
high magnetic fields B, both gaps are linear functions of B with slopes
proportional to the inverse fraction denominator, 1/q. The fractional gaps
close partially when the Fermi level lies outside. An empirical analysis
indicates that the chemical potential jump for an IDEAL 2D electron system, in
the highest accessible magnetic fields, is proportional to q^{-1}B^{1/2}.
