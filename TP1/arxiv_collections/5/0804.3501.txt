We review the recent literature on lattice simulations for few- and many-body
systems. We focus on methods and results that combine the framework of
effective field theory with computational lattice methods. Lattice effective
field theory is discussed for cold atoms as well as low-energy nucleons with
and without pions. A number of different lattice formulations and computational
algorithms are considered, and an effort is made to show common themes in
studies of cold atoms and low-energy nuclear physics as well as common themes
in work by different collaborations.
