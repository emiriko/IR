Crucial to an Evolutionary Algorithm's performance is its selection scheme.
We mathematically investigate the relation between polynomial rank and
probabilistic tournament methods which are (respectively) generalisations of
the popular linear ranking and tournament selection schemes. We show that every
probabilistic tournament is equivalent to a unique polynomial rank scheme. In
fact, we derived explicit operators for translating between these two types of
selection. Of particular importance is that most linear and most practical
quadratic rank schemes are probabilistic tournaments.
