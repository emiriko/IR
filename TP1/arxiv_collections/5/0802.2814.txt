We have produced high transmission sub-wavelength tapered optical fibers for
the purpose of whispering gallery mode coupling in fused silica microcavities
at 780 nm. A detailed analysis of the fiber transmittance evolution during
tapering is demonstrated to reflect precisely the mode coupling and cutoff in
the fiber. This allows to control the final size, the number of guided modes
and their effective index. These results are checked by evanescent wave mapping
measurements on the resulting taper.
