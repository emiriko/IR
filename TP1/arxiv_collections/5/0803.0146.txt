Partitioning and grouping of similar objects plays a fundamental role in
image segmentation and in clustering problems. In such problems a typical goal
is to group together similar objects, or pixels in the case of image
processing. At the same time another goal is to have each group distinctly
dissimilar from the rest and possibly to have the group size fairly large.
These goals are often combined as a ratio optimization problem. One example of
such problem is the normalized cut problem, another is the ratio regions
problem. We devise here the first polynomial time algorithms solving these
problems optimally. The algorithms are efficient and combinatorial. This
contrasts with the heuristic approaches used in the image segmentation
literature that formulate those problems as nonlinear optimization problems,
which are then relaxed and solved with spectral techniques in real numbers.
These approaches not only fail to deliver an optimal solution, but they are
also computationally expensive. The algorithms presented here use as a
subroutine a minimum $s,t-cut procedure on a related graph which is of
polynomial size. The output consists of the optimal solution to the respective
ratio problem, as well as a sequence of nested solution with respect to any
relative weighting of the objectives of the numerator and denominator.
  An extension of the results here to bi-criteria and multi-criteria objective
functions is presented in part II.
