We consider the problem of detecting and estimating the strength of
association between a trait of interest and alleles or haplotypes in a small
genomic region (e.g. a gene or a gene complex), when no direct information on
that region is available but the values of neighbouring DNA-markers are at
hand. We argue that the effects of the non-observable haplotypes of the genomic
regions can and should be represented by factors representing disjoint groups
of marker-alleles. A theoretical argument based on a hypothetical phylogenetic
tree supports this general claim.
  The techniques described allow to identify and to infer the number of
detectable haplotypes in the genomic region that are associated with a trait.
The methods proposed use an exhaustive combinatorial search coupled with the
maximization of a version of the likelihood function penalized for the number
of parameters. This procedure can easily be implemented with standard
statistical methods for a moderate number of marker-alleles.
