We present an independent short proof of the main result of arXiv:0706.3725
that the algebra of endomorphisms of a Weyl module of critical level is
isomorphic to the algebra of functions on the space of monodromy-free opers on
the disc with regular singularity and residue determined by the highest weight
of the Weyl module. We derive this from the results of arXiv:0712.1183 about
the shift of argument subalgebras.
