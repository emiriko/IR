We constructed a superconducting/ferromagnetic hybrid system in which the
ordering of the pinning potential landscape for flux quanta can be manipulated.
Flux pinning is induced by an array of magnetic nanodots in the magnetic vortex
state, and controlled by the magnetic history. This allows switching on and off
the collective pinning of the flux-lattice. In addition, we observed
field-induced superconductivity that originates from the annihilation of flux
quanta induced by the stray fields from the magnetic vortices.
