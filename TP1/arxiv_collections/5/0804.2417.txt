The MEDLEY setup based at The Svedberg Laboratory (TSL), Uppsala, Sweden has
previously been used to measure double-differential cross-sections for elastic
nd scattering, as well as light ion production reactions for various nuclei in
the interaction with neutrons around 95 MeV. When moved to the new beam line,
the first experimental campaign was on light-ion production from Ca at 94 MeV
in February 2005.
  These data sets have been analyzed for proton production in forward and
backward angles. The Delta E - Delta E - E technique have been used to identify
protons, and a cutoff as low as 2.5 MeV is achieved. Suppression of events
induced by neutrons in the low-energy tail of the neutron field is achieved by
time-of-flight techniques. The data are normalized relative to elastic np
scattering measured in the 20-degree telescope. Results from an accepted
neutron spectrum are presented and some methods to correct for events from low
energy neutrons are presented and evaluated. The data are compared with
calculations using the nuclear code TALYS. It was found that TALYS
systematically overestimates the compound part, and underestimates the
pre-equilibrium part of the cross-section.
