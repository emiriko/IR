Sparticle mass hierarchies will play an important role in the type of
signatures that will be visible at the Large Hadron Collider. We analyze these
hierarchies for the four lightest sparticles for a general class of
supergravity unified models including nonuniversalities in the soft breaking
sector. It is shown that out of nearly $10^4$ possibilities of sparticle mass
hierarchies, only a small number survives the rigorous constraints of radiative
electroweak symmetry breaking, relic density and other experimental
constraints. The signature space of these mass patterns at the Large Hadron
Collider is investigated using a large set of final states including
multi-leptonic states, hadronically decaying $\tau$s, tagged $b$ jets and other
hadronic jets. In all, we analyze more than 40 such lepton plus jet and missing
energy signatures along with several kinematical signatures such as missing
transverse momentum, effective mass, and invariant mass distributions of final
state observables. It is shown that a composite analysis can produce
significant discrimination among sparticle mass patterns allowing for a
possible identification of the source of soft breaking. While the analysis
given is for supergravity models, the techniques based on mass pattern analysis
are applicable to wide class of models including string and brane models.
