We present world average values for D0-D0bar mixing parameters x and y, CP
violation parameters |q/p| and Arg(q/p), and strong phase differences \delta
and \delta_{K\pi\pi}. These values are calculated by the Heavy Flavor Averaging
Group (HFAG) by performing a global fit to relevant experimental measurements.
The results for x and y differ significantly from zero and are inconsistent
with no mixing at the level of 6.7 sigma. The results for |q/p| and Arg(q/p)
are consistent with no CP violation. The strong phase difference \delta is less
than 45 degrees at 95% C.L.
