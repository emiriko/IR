We present results on transverse momentum correlations of charged particle
pairs produced in Pb-Au collisions at 158$A$ GeV/$c$ at the Super Proton
Synchrotron. The transverse momentum correlations have been studied as a
function of collision centrality, angular separation of the particle pairs,
transverse momentum and charge sign. We demonstrate that the results are in
agreement with previous findings in scale-independent analyses at the same beam
energy. Employing the two-particle momentum correlator $<\Delta p_{t,i}, \Delta
p_{t,j}>$ and the cumulative $p_t$ variable $x(p_t)$, we identify, using the
scale-dependent approach presented in this paper, different sources
contributing to the measured correlations, such as quantum and Coulomb
correlations, elliptic flow and mini-jet fragmentation.
