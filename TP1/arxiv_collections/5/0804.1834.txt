A model for the $p(e,e'\pi^+)n$ reaction which combines an improved treatment
of gauge invariant meson--exchange currents and hard deep--inelastic scattering
(DIS) of virtual photons off nucleons is proposed. It is shown that DIS
dominates and explains the transverse response at moderate and high photon
virtualities $Q^2$ whereas the longitudinal response is dominated by hadronic
degrees of freedom and the pion electromagnetic form factor. This leads to a
combined description of the longitudinal and transverse components of the cross
section in a wide range of photon virtuality $Q^2$ and momentum transfer to the
target $t$ and solves the longstanding problem of the observed large transverse
cross sections. The latter are shown to be sensitive to the intrinsic
transverse momentum distribution of partons.
