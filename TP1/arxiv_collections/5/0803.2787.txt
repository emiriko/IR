Investigation of the magnetism of Cu$_3$Mo$_2$O$_9$ single crystal, which has
antiferromagnetic (AF) linear chains interacting with AF dimers, reveals an AF
second-order phase transition at $T_{\rm N} = 7.9$ K. Although weak
ferromagnetic-like behavior appears at lower temperatures in low magnetic
fields, complete remanent magnetization cannot be detected down to 0.5 K.
However, a jump is observed in the magnetization below weak ferromagnetic (WF)
phase transition at $T_{\rm c} \simeq 2.5$ K when a tiny magnetic field along
the a axis is reversed, suggesting that the coercive force is very weak. A
component of magnetic moment parallel to the chain forms AF long-range order
(LRO) below $T_{\rm N}$, while a perpendicular component is disordered above
$T_{\rm c}$ at zero magnetic field and forms WF-LRO below $T_{\rm c}$.
Moreover, the WF-LRO is also realized with applying magnetic fields even
between $T_{\rm c}$ and $T_{\rm N}$. These results are explainable by both
magnetic frustration among symmetric exchange interactions and competition
between symmetric and asymmetric Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya exchange interactions.
