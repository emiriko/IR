Water is a unique compound with many anomalies and properties not fully
understood. Designing an experiment in the laboratory to study such anomalies,
we set up a series of experiments where a tube was placed inside a sealed
container with thermocouples attached to the outer surface of the tube and in
the air adjacent to the tube. Alternately, deionized water and other compounds
were added to the tube and cooled to freezing. Several of the thermocouples
suspended in the air and adjacent to the tube showed thermal oscillations as
the overall temperature of the container was decreasing. The temperature of the
thermocouples increased and decreased in a sinusoidal way during part of the
cool down to freezing. Thermal oscillations as large as 3 degrees Celsius were
recorded with typical frequencies of about 5 oscillations per minute.
