By analyzing about 33 $\rm pb^{-1}$ data sample collected at and around 3.773
GeV with the BES-II detector at the BEPC collider, we directly measure the
branching fractions for the neutral and charged $D$ inclusive semimuonic decays
to be $BF(D^0 \to \mu^+ X) =(6.8\pm 1.5\pm 0.7)%$ and $BF(D^+ \to \mu^+ X)
=(17.6 \pm 2.7 \pm 1.8)%$, and determine the ratio of the two branching
fractions to be $\frac{BF(D^+ \to \mu^+ X)}{BF(D^0 \to \mu^+ X)}=2.59\pm 0.70
\pm 0.25$.
