We have developed a 4-channel multi-anode MCP-PMT, SL10, which exhibits a
performance of sigma_TTS ~ 30 ps for single photons with G ~ 10^6 and QE=20%
under a magnetic field of B <= 1.5 T. The cross-talk among anodes has been
extensively studied. We have taken two measures to suppress it: one is to
configure the SL10 to an effectively independent 4 small pieces of MCP-PMT's by
segmenting an electrode of the second MCP-layer; the other is to use a constant
fractional discriminator. Remarkable improvement has been achieved.
