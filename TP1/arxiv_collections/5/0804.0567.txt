A theoretical comparison of the electronic excitation and ionisation
behaviour of molecular hydrogen oriented either parallel or perpendicular to a
linear polarised laser pulse is performed. The investigation is based on a
non-perturbative treatment that solves the full time-dependent Schr\"odinger
equation of both correlated electrons within the fixed-nuclei approximation and
the dipole. Results are shown for two different laser pulse lengths and
intensities as well as for a large variety of photon frequencies starting in
the 1- and reaching into the 6-photon regime. In order to investigate the
influence of the intrinsic diatomic two-center problem even further, two values
of the internuclear separation and a newly developed atomic model are
considered.
