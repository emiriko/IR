We study a dephasing channel with memory, modelled by a Markov chain. We show
that even weak memory effects have a detrimental impact on the performance of
quantum error correcting schemes designed for uncorrelated errors. We also
discuss an alternative scheme that takes advantage of memory effects to protect
quantum information.
