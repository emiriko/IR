In this survey, our aim is to emphasize the main known limitations to the use
of Wigner measures for Schrodinger equations. After a short review of
successful applications of Wigner measures to study the semi-classical limit of
solutions to Schrodinger equations, we list some examples where Wigner measures
cannot be a good tool to describe high frequency limits. Typically, the Wigner
measures may not capture effects which are not negligible at the pointwise
level, or the propagation of Wigner measures may be an ill-posed problem. In
the latter situation, two families of functions may have the same Wigner
measures at some initial time, but different Wigner measures for a larger time.
In the case of systems, this difficulty can partially be avoided by considering
more refined Wigner measures such as two-scale Wigner measures; however, we
give examples of situations where this quadratic approach fails.
