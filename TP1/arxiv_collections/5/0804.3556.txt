Let $X=G/K$ be an irreducible Hermitian symmetric space of the non-compact
type and let $S\in G^\mbb{C}$ be the associated compression semi-group. Let
$\Gamma$ be a discrete subgroup of $G$. We give a sufficient condition for
$\Gamma\backslash S$ to be a Stein manifold. Moreover, we show that in general
$\Gamma\backslash S$ is not Stein, which disproves a conjecture by Achab,
Betten and Kr\"otz.
