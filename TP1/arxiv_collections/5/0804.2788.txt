We consider the two-dimensional randomly site diluted Ising model and the
random-bond +-J Ising model (also called Edwards-Anderson model), and study
their critical behavior at the paramagnetic-ferromagnetic transition. The
critical behavior of thermodynamic quantities can be derived from a set of
renormalization-group equations, in which disorder is a marginally irrelevant
perturbation at the two-dimensional Ising fixed point. We discuss their
solutions, focusing in particular on the universality of the logarithmic
corrections arising from the presence of disorder. Then, we present a
finite-size scaling analysis of high-statistics Monte Carlo simulations. The
numerical results confirm the renormalization-group predictions, and in
particular the universality of the logarithmic corrections to the Ising
behavior due to quenched dilution.
