Selection rules governing Brillouin light scattering from the vibrational
eigenmodes of a homogeneous, free-surface submicron sphere have been derived
using group theory. The derivation is for the condition where the sphere
diameter is of the order of the excitation light wavelength. Well-resolved
spectral data obtained from Brillouin light scattering from submicron silica
spheres provide experimental verification of the selection rules.
