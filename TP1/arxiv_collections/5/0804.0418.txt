In the present paper kinetics of emission spectra of the high voltage erosive
water discharge at near ultraviolet and visible spectral ranges has been
investigated. Obtained results show a similarity of physical properties of this
discharge (and of corresponding plasmoids) to that of some other types of
erosional discharges which also result in the formation of dust-gas fireballs.
