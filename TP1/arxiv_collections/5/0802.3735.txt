We report the results of Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations and formal
modeling of the free energy surfaces and reaction rates of primary charge
separation in the reaction center of \textit{Rhodobacter sphaeroides}. Two
simulation protocols were used to produce MD trajectories. Standard force field
potentials were employed in the first protocol. In the second protocol, the
special pair was made polarizable to reproduce a high polarizability of its
photoexcited state observed by Stark spectroscopy. The charge distribution
between covalent and charge-transfer states of the special pair was dynamically
adjusted during the simulation run. We found from both protocols that the
breadth of electrostatic fluctuations of the protein/water environment far
exceeds previous estimates resulting in about 1.6 eV reorganization energy of
electron transfer in the first protocol and 2.5 eV in the second protocol. Most
of these electrostatic fluctuations become dynamically frozen on the time-scale
of primary charge separation resulting in much smaller solvation contributions
to the activation barrier. A non-ergodic formulation of the diffusion-reaction
electron transfer kinetics has allowed us to reproduce the experimental results
for both the temperature dependence of the rate and the non-exponential decay
of the population of the photoexcited special pair.
