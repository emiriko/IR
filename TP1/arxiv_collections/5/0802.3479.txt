Very little is known about the process by which end-user developers detect
and correct spreadsheet errors. Any research pertaining to the development of
spreadsheet testing methodologies or auditing tools would benefit from
information on how end-users perform the debugging process in practice.
Thirteen industry-based professionals and thirty-four accounting & finance
students took part in a current ongoing experiment designed to record and
analyse end-user behaviour in spreadsheet error detection and correction.
Professionals significantly outperformed students in correcting certain error
types. Time-based cell activity analysis showed that a strong correlation
exists between the percentage of cells inspected and the number of errors
corrected. The cell activity data was gathered through a purpose written VBA
Excel plug-in that records the time and detail of all cell selection and cell
change actions of individuals.
