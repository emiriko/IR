In this paper we discuss the interplay of quantum fluctuations and
dissipation in uniform superconducting nanowires. We consider a
phenomenological model with superconducting and normal components, and a finite
equilibration rate between these two-fluids. We find that phase-slip dipoles
proliferate in the wire, and decouple the two-fluids within its bulk. This
implies that the the normal fluid only couples to the superconductor fluid
through the leads at the edges of the wire, and the {\it local} dissipation is
unimportant. Therefore, while long wires have a superconductor-metal transition
tuned by local properties of the superconducting fluid, short wires have a
transition when the {\it total} resistance is $R_{total}=R_Q=h/4e^2$.
