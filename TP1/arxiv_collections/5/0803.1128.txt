We investigate energy transport in several two-level atom or spin-1/2 models
by a direct coupling to heat baths of different temperatures. The analysis is
carried out on the basis of a recently derived quantum master equation which
describes the nonequilibrium properties of internally weakly coupled systems
appropriately. For the computation of the stationary state of the dynamical
equations, we employ a Monte Carlo wave-function approach. The analysis
directly indicates normal diffusive or ballistic transport in finite models and
hints toward an extrapolation of the transport behavior of infinite models.
