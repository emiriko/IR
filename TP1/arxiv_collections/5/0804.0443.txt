We report the observation that thermoelectric thin-films of La-doped SrTiO3
grown on SrTiO3 substrates yield anomalously high values of thermopower to give
extraordinary values of power factor at 300K. Thin-films of Sr0.98La0.02TiO3,
grown via pulsed laser deposition at low temperature and low pressure (450C,
10-7Torr), do not yield similarly high values when grown on other substrates.
The thin-film growth induces oxygen reduction in the SrTiO3 crystals, doping
the substrate n-type. It is found that the backside resistance of the SrTiO3
substrates is as low (~12ohm/square) as it is on the film-side after film
growth.
