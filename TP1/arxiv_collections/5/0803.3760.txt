I discuss the robustness of the pumped cavity dynamics against phase
diffusion of the laser and conclude that opto-mechanical cooling has extreme
sensitivity compared to laser cooling of atoms. Certain proposals of ground
state opto-mechanical cooling by single cavity would require an unrealistic
sharp laser linewidth or equivalently, a very low level of phase noise. A
systematic way to cancel classical excess phase noise is the interferometric
twin-cavity pumping, initiated for optically trapped macro-mirrors of future
gravitational-wave detectors.
