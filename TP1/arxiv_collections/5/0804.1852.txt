We present exact analytical bright and dark (black and grey) solitary wave
solutions of a nonlinear Schrodinger-type equation describing the propagation
of spatial beams in media exhibiting a saturable nonlinearity (such as
centrosymmetric photorefractive materials). A qualitative study of the
stationary equation is carried out together with a discussion of the stability
of the solutions.
