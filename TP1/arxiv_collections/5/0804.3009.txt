The crossover behavior of various models exhibiting phase transition to
absorbing phase with parity conserving class has been investigated by numerical
simulations and cluster mean-field method. In case of models exhibiting Z_2
symmetric absorbing phases (the NEKIMCA and Grassberger's A stochastic cellular
automaton) the introduction of an external symmetry breaking field causes a
crossover to kink parity conserving models characterized by dynamical scaling
of the directed percolation (DP) and the crossover exponent: 1/\phi ~ 0.53(2).
In case an even offspringed branching and annihilating random walk model (dual
to NEKIMCA) the introduction of spontaneous particle decay destroys the parity
conservation and results in a crossover to the DP class characterized by the
crossover exponent: 1/\phi\simeq 0.205(5). The two different kinds of crossover
operators can't be mapped onto each other and the resulting models show a
diversity within the DP universality class in one dimension. These
'sub-classes' differ in cluster scaling exponents.
