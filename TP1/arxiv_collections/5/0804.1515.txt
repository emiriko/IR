We consider two properties of the set of quantum states as a convex
topological space and some their implications concerning the notions of a
convex hull and of a convex roof of a function defined on a subset of quantum
states.
  By using these results we analyze two infinite-dimensional versions (discrete
and continuous) of the convex roof construction of entanglement monotones,
which is widely used in finite dimensions. It is shown that the discrete
version may be 'false' in the sense that the resulting functions may not
possess the main property of entanglement monotones while the continuous
version can be considered as a 'true' generalized convex roof construction. We
give several examples of entanglement monotones produced by this construction.
In particular, we consider an infinite-dimensional generalization of the notion
of Entanglement of Formation and study its properties.
