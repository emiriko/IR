We propose a scheme to construct the most prominent Abelian and non-Abelian
fractional quantum Hall states from K-component Halperin wave functions. In
order to account for a one-component quantum Hall system, these SU(K) colors
are distributed over all particles by an appropriate symmetrization. Numerical
calculations corroborate the picture that the proposed scheme allows for a
unification of both Abelian and non-Abelian trial wave functions in the study
of one-component quantum Hall systems.
