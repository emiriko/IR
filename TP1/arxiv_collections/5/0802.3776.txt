We present a collection of eight data sets, from state-of-the-art experiments
and numerical simulations on turbulent velocity statistics along particle
trajectories obtained in different flows with Reynolds numbers in the range
$R_\lambda \in [120:740]$. Lagrangian structure functions from all data sets
are found to collapse onto each other on a wide range of time lags, revealing a
universal statistics, and calling for a unified theoretical description.
Parisi-Frisch Multifractal theory, suitable extended to the dissipative scales
and to the Lagrangian domain, is found to capture intermittency of velocity
statistics over the whole three decades of temporal scales here investigated.
