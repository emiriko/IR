We study the Kondo-Heisenberg model using a fermionic representation for the
localized spins. The mean-field phase diagram exhibits a zero temperature
quantum critical point separating a spin liquid phase where the f-conduction
hybridization vanishes, and a Kondo phase where it does not. Two solutions can
be stabilized in the Kondo phase, namely a uniform hybridization when the band
masses of the conduction electrons and the f spinons have the same sign, and a
modulated one when they have opposite sign. For the uniform case, we show that
above a very small Fermi liquid temperature scale (~1 mK), the critical
fluctuations associated with the vanishing hybridization have dynamical
exponent z=3, giving rise to a specific heat coefficient that diverges
logarithmically in temperature, as well as a conduction electron inverse
lifetime that has a T log T behavior. Because the f spinons do not carry
current, but act as an effective bath for the relaxation of the current carried
by the conduction electrons, the latter result also gives rise to a T log T
behavior in the resistivity. This behavior is consistent with observations in a
number of heavy fermion metals.
