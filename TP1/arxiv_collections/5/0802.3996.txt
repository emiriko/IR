The helicity amplitudes $A^{p}_{1/2}$ and $S^{p}_{1/2}$ for the
electromagnetic transition $\gamma^{*} N\to N^{*}(1535)$ are calculated in the
quark model that is extended to include the lowest lying $qqqq\bar{q}$
components in addition to the $qqq$ component. It is found that with admixture
of 5-quark components with a proportion of 20% in the nucleon and 25-65% in the
$N^{*}(1535)$ resonance the calculated helicity amplitude $A^{p}_{1/2}$
decreases at the photon point, $Q^{2}=0$ to the empirical range. The
$qqqq\bar{q}$ components contain $s\bar s$ pairs, which is consistent with the
substantial width for $N\eta$ decay of the $N^{*}(1535)$. The best description
of the momentum dependence of the empirical helicity amplitudes is obtained by
assuming that the $qqqq\bar{q}$ components are more compact than the $qqq$
component. However, this version of extended quark model still does not lead to
a satisfactory simultaneous description of both $A^{p}_{1/2}$ and $S^{p}_{1/2}$
although with significant improvement.
