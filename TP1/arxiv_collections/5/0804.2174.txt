This paper reports a detailed cryptanalysis of a recently proposed encryption
scheme based on the logistic map. Some problems are emphasized concerning the
key space definition and the implementation of the cryptosystem using
floating-point operations. It is also shown how it is possible to reduce
considerably the key space through a ciphertext-only attack. Moreover, a timing
attack allows the estimation of part of the key due to the existent
relationship between this part of the key and the encryption/decryption time.
As a result, the main features of the cryptosystem do not satisfy the demands
of secure communications. Some hints are offered to improve the cryptosystem
under study according to those requirements.
