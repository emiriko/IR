It is demonstrated how to represent asymptotically mean stationary (AMS)
random sources with values in standard spaces as mixtures of ergodic AMS
sources. This an extension of the well known decomposition of stationary
sources which has facilitated the generalization of prominent source coding
theorems to arbitrary, not necessarily ergodic, stationary sources. Asymptotic
mean stationarity generalizes the definition of stationarity and covers a much
larger variety of real-world examples of random sources of practical interest.
It is sketched how to obtain source coding and related theorems for arbitrary,
not necessarily ergodic, AMS sources, based on the presented ergodic
decomposition.
