The very significant growth of the wireless communication industry has
spawned tremendous interest in the development of high performances radio
frequencies (RF) components. Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS) are good
candidates to allow reconfigurable RF functions such as filters, oscillators or
antennas. This paper will focus on the MEMS electromechanical resonators which
show interesting performances to replace SAW filters or quartz reference
oscillators, allowing smaller integrated functions with lower power
consumption. The resonant frequency depends on the material properties, such as
Young's modulus and density, and on the movable mechanical structure dimensions
(beam length defined by photolithography). Thus, it is possible to obtain multi
frequencies resonators on a wafer. The resonator performance (frequency,
quality factor) strongly depends on the environment, like moisture or pressure,
which imply the need for a vacuum package. This paper will present first
resonator mechanisms and mechanical behaviors followed by state of the art
descriptions with applications and specifications overview. Then MEMS resonator
developments at STMicroelectronics including FEM analysis, technological
developments and characterization are detailed.
