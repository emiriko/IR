The (001) surfaces of polar perovskites BaTiO$_3$ and PbTiO$_3$ have been
studied from first principles at T=0 K. For both cases of polarization, the
most stable TiO-terminated interfaces show intrinsic ferroelectricity. In the
topmost layer, where the O atoms are $>$0.1 \AA above Ti, this leads to
metallic instead of the insulating behavior of the electronic states that may
have important implications for multiferroic tunneling junctions.
