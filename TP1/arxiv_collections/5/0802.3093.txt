A new Room Temperature (RT) 0-level vacuum package is demonstrated in this
work, using amorphous silicon (aSi) as sacrificial layer and SiO2 as structural
layer. The process is compatible with most of MEMS resonators and Resonant
Suspended-Gate MOSFET [1] fabrication processes. This paper presents a study on
the influence of releasing hole dimensions on the releasing time and hole
clogging. It discusses mass production compatibility in terms of packaging
stress during back-end plastic injection process. The packaging is done at room
temperature making it fully compatible with IC-processed wafers and avoiding
any subsequent degradation of the active devices.
