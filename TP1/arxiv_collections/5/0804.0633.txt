Let $p$ be a polynomial in the non-commuting variables
$(a,x)=(a_1,...,a_{g_a},x_1,...,x_{g_x})$. If $p$ is convex in the variables
$x$, then $p$ has degree two in $x$ and moreover, $p$ has the form $p = L +
\Lambda ^T \Lambda,$ where $L$ has degree at most one in $x$ and $\Lambda$ is a
(column) vector which is linear in $x,$ so that $\Lambda^T\Lambda$ is a both
sum of squares and homogeneous of degree two. Of course the converse is true
also. Further results involving various convexity hypotheses on the $x$ and $a$
variables separately are presented.
