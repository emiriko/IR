Using similarity transformations we construct explicit solutions of the
nonlinear Schrodinger equation with linear and nonlinear periodic potentials.
We present explicit forms of spatially localized and periodic solutions, and
study their properties. We put our results in the framework of the exploited
perturbation techniques and discuss their implications on the properties of
associated linear periodic potentials and on the possibilities of stabilization
of gap solitons using polychromatic lattices.
