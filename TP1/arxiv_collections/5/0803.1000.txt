The influence of correlation effects on the orbital moments for transition
metals and their alloys is studied by first-principle relativistic Density
Functional Theory in combination with the Dynamical Mean-Field Theory. In
contrast to the previous studies based on the orbital polarization corrections
we obtain an improved description of the orbital moments for wide range of
studied systems as bulk Fe, Co and Ni, Fe-Co disordered alloys and 3$d$
impurities in Au. The proposed scheme can give simultaneously a correct
dynamical description of the spectral function as well as static magnetic
properties of correlated disordered metals.
