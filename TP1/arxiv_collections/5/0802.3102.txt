The extensive research and development of micromechanical resonators is
trying to allow the use of these devices for highly sensitive applications.
Microcantilevers are some of the simplest MEMS structure and had been proved to
be a good platform due to its excellent mechanical properties. A cantilever
working in dynamic mode, adjust its resonance frequency depending on changes in
both the spring constant (k) and mass (m) of the resonator. The aim of this
work was to model a cantilever structure to determine the optimal dimensions in
which the resonance frequency would be a function dominated by mass changes and
not stiffness changes. In order to validate the model a set of microcantilevers
were fabricated and characterized.
