In type II seesaw utilized to explain the observed neutrino masses and
mixings, one extends the Standard Model (SM) by introducing scalar fields which
transform as a triplet under the electroweak gauge symmetry. New scalar
couplings involving the Higgs doublet then appear and, as we show, these have
important implications for the Higgs boson mass bounds obtained using vacuum
stability and perturbativity arguments. We identify, in particular, regions of
the parameter space which permit the SM Higgs boson to be as light as 114.4
GeV, the LEP2 bound. The triplet scalars include doubly charged particles whose
masses could, in principle, be in the few hundred GeV range, and so they may be
accessible at the LHC.
