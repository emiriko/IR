During the attempt to park a car in the city the drivers have to share
limited resources (the available roadside). We show that this fact leads to a
predictable distribution of the distances between the cars that depends on the
length of the street segment used for the collective parking. We demonstrate in
addition that the individual parking maneuver is guided by generic
psychophysical perceptual correlates. Both predictions are compared with the
actual parking data collected in the city of Hradec Kralove (Czech Republic).
