A computational scheme for the investigation of complex materials with
strongly interacting electrons is formulated which is able to treat atomic
displacements, and hence structural relaxation, caused by electronic
correlations. It combines ab initio band structure and dynamical mean-field
theory and is implemented in terms of plane-wave pseudopotentials. The
equilibrium Jahn-Teller distortion and antiferro-orbital order found for
paramagnetic KCuF3 agree well with experiment.
