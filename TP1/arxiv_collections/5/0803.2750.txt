We show that the bulk transport magnetic current is generated by the moving
magnetic kink crystal (chiral soliton lattice) formed in the chiral helimagnet
under the static magnetic field applied perpendicular to the helical axis. The
current is caused by the non-equilibrium transport momentum with the kink mass
being determined by the spin fluctuations around the kink crystal state. An
emergence of the transport magnetic currents is then a consequence of the
dynamical off-diagonal long range order along the helical axis. We derive an
explicit formula for the inertial mass of the kink crystal and the current in
the weak field limit.
