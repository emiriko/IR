This letter reports the results of a search for a stochastic background of
gravitational waves (GW) at 100 MHz by laser interferometry. We have developed
a GW detector, which is a pair of 75-cm baseline synchronous recycling
(resonant recycling) interferometers. Each interferometer has a strain
sensitivity of ~ 10^{-16} Hz^{-1/2} at 100 MHz. By cross-correlating the
outputs of the two interferometers within 1000 seconds, we found h_{100}^2
Omega_{gw} < 6 times 10^{25} to be an upper limit on the energy density
spectrum of the GW background in a 2-kHz bandwidth around 100 MHz, where a flat
spectrum is assumed.
