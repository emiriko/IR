We study some of the roles for unparticles in an inflationary universe.
Unparticles by themselves are not appropriate for generating the primordial
perturbations since their power spectrum does not match what has been inferred
from observations. In fact, when the scaling dimension for the unparticles
exceeds three-halves, the unparticle power spectrum diverges. However, when a
unparticle couples to an ordinary inflaton particle, loop corrections can
produce a slight enhancement of the inflaton's power spectrum at longer
wavelengths. We examine these loop corrections from unparticles in some detail
to learn how they scale in the wavelength of a perturbation and how they depend
on the scaling dimension of the field.
