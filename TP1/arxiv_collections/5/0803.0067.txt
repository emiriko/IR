Uniaxially anisotropic antiferromagnets in a field along the easy axis are
studied with the help of ground state considerations and Monte Carlo
simulations. For classical models, the XXZ model as well as variants, we
analyze the role of non-collinear spin configurations of biconical or
bidirectional type interpolating between the well-known antiferromagnetic and
spin-flop structures. Possible experimental applications to layered cuprate
antiferromagnets are discussed. Finally, results of quantum Monte Carlo
simulations for the S=1/2 XXZ model on a square lattice are presented, and
compared with previous findings.
