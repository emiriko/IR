Random variables equidistributed on convex bodies have received quite a lot
of attention in the last few years. In this paper we prove the negative
association property (which generalizes the subindependence of coordinate
slabs) for generalized Orlicz balls. This allows us to give a strong
concentration property, along with a few moment comparison inequalities. Also,
the theory of negatively associated variables is being developed in its own
right, which allows us to hope more results will be available. Moreover, a
simpler proof of a more general result for $\ell_p^n$ balls is given.
