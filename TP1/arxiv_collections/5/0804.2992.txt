In this paper we describe by a number of examples how to deduce one single
characterizing higher order differential equation for output quantities of an
analog circuit.
  In the linear case, we apply basic "symbolic" methods from linear algebra to
the system of differential equations which is used to model the analog circuit.
For nonlinear circuits and their corresponding nonlinear differential
equations, we show how to employ computer algebra tools implemented in Maple,
which are based on differential algebra.
