In this preprint, we explore a beautiful idea of Skinner and Wiles in the
context of GSp(4) over a totally real field. The main result provides
congruences between automorphic forms which are Iwahori-spherical at a certain
place w, and forms with a tamely ramified principal series at w. Thus, after
base change to a totally real finite solvable extension, one can often lower
the level at w. For the proof, we first establish an analogue of the
Jacquet-Langlands correspondence, using the stable trace formula. The
congruences are then obtained on inner forms, which are compact at infinity mod
center, and split at all finite places. The crucial ingredient allowing us to
do so, is an important result of Roche on types for principal series
representations of split reductive groups.
