We construct a model of an electrically charged magnetic dipole with
arbitrary N-extended world-line supersymmetry, which exhibits a supersymmetric
Zeeman effect. By including supersymmetric constraint terms, the ambient space
of the dipole may be tailored into an algebraic variety, and the supersymmetry
broken for almost all parameter values. The so exhibited obstruction to
supersymmetry breaking refines the standard one, based on the Witten index
alone.
