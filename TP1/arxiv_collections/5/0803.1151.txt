SU(5) gauge theory with massless left-handed fermions in the representation
5+15+40+45* (QUD) may have a bound-state S-Matrix that, uniquely, contains the
asymptotically unitary Critical Pomeron and which might also reproduce the full
Standard Model. If so, QUD would provide an underlying unification for the
Standard Model in which very similar massless fermion anomaly dynamics is
responsible for the physics of the strong and electroweak interactions and all
particle masses are generated dynamically. The color sextet quark sector,
responsible for both electroweak symmetry-breaking and dark matter in QUD, is
predicted to produce large cross-section effects at the LHC, with the pomeron
as a vital diagnostic - via TOTEM/CMS and FP420.
  In this talk, the multi-regge construction of high-energy QUD amplitudes is
outlined as is, briefly, the LHC pomeron physics. Surrounding motivational
issues (particularly outstanding QCD problems) and consequences are also
discussed. The S-Matrix anomaly physics is conceptually and philosophically
radical with respect to the current theory paradigm. As a consequence, QUD
could provide a welcome way out of the current ``Crisis in Fundamental
Physics'' with, potentially, it's novel physical applicability resolving a
variety of Standard Model and, perhaps also, cosmology problems - it has zero
vacuum energy.
