In theory, quantum key distribution (QKD) offers unconditional security based
on the laws of physics. However, as demonstrated in recent quantum hacking
theory and experimental papers, detection efficiency loophole can be fatal to
the security of practical QKD systems. Here, we describe the physical origin of
detection efficiency mismatch in various domains including spatial, spectral,
and time domains and in various experimental set-ups. More importantly, we
prove the unconditional security of QKD even with detection efficiency
mismatch. We explicitly show how the key generation rate is characterized by
the maximal detection efficiency ratio between the two detectors. Furthermore,
we prove that by randomly switching the bit assignments of the detectors, the
effect of detection efficiency mismatch can be completely eliminated.
