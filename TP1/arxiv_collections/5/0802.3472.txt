The semiclassical method is characterized by finite forces and smooth,
well-behaved trajectories, but also by multivalued representational functions
that are ill-behaved at turning points. In contrast, quantum trajectory
methods--based on Bohmian mechanics (quantum hydrodynamics)--are characterized
by infinite forces and erratic trajectories near nodes, but also well-behaved,
single-valued representational functions. In this paper, we unify these two
approaches into a single method that captures the best features of both, and in
addition, satisfies the correspondence principle. Stationary eigenstates in one
degree of freedom are the primary focus, but more general applications are also
anticipated.
