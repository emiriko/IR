There is an interesting property about multipartite entanglement, called the
monogamy of entanglement. The property can be shown by the monogamy inequality,
called the Coffman-Kundu-Wootters inequality [Phys. Rev. A {\bf 61}, 052306
(2000); Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 96}, 220503 (2006)], and more explicitly by the
monogamy equality in terms of the concurrence and the concurrence of
assistance, $\mathcal{C}_{A(BC)}^2=\mathcal{C}_{AB}^2+(\mathcal{C}_{AC}^a)^2$,
in the three-qubit system. In this paper, we consider the monogamy equality in
$2\otimes 2 \otimes d$ quantum systems. We show that
$\mathcal{C}_{A(BC)}=\mathcal{C}_{AB}$ if and only if $\mathcal{C}_{AC}^a=0$,
and also show that if $\mathcal{C}_{A(BC)}=\mathcal{C}_{AC}^a$ then
$\mathcal{C}_{AB}=0$, while there exists a state in a $2\otimes 2 \otimes d$
system such that $\mathcal{C}_{AB}=0$ but
$\mathcal{C}_{A(BC)}>\mathcal{C}_{AC}^a$.
