We describe the impact of the full one-loop Electro-Weak terms of
O($\alpha_s\alpha^3_{EM}$) entering the electron-positron into three-jet
cross-section. We include both factorisable and non-factorisable virtual
corrections, photon bremsstrahlung but not the real emission of $W^\pm$ and $Z$
bosons. We show preliminary results and we discuss the impact of the
Electro-Weak corrections on three-jet observables.
