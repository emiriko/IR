We report on the experimental observation of two-dimensional solitons at the
interface between square and hexagonal waveguide arrays. In addition to the
different symmetry of the lattices, the influence of a varying refractive index
modulation depth is investigated. Such variation strongly affects the
properties of surface solitons residing at different sides of the interface.
