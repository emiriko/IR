Within the framework of the dynamical recombination approach implemented in
the partonic/hadronic quark Molecular Dynamics (qMD) model, we investigate
numerous QGP signals constructed from the correlations and fluctuations of
conserved charges, namely charged particle ratio fluctuations, charge transfer
fluctuations as well as various ratios of susceptibilities. We argue that more
generally, the covariances and the variances of the conserved charges divided
by the number of charged particles are a measure of the quark number
susceptibilities and are thus sensitive to the phase of the system.
Computations carried within samples of central qMD events from low AGS energies
on ($E_{lab}=2$ AGeV) up to the highest RHIC energies available
($\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV) show that the final state calculations are always
compatible with the hadronic result. From analyses performed as a function of
time with our sample of events at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV, we find the
recombination-like hadronization process the qMD system undergoes to be
responsible for the vanishing of the early stage QGP correlations and
fluctuations. These results might explain the compatibility of the measurements
on charged particle ratio fluctuations with the hadronic expectations and leave
no room for the experimental observation of any QGP fluctuation/correlation
signals based upon the susceptibilities of the conserved charges.
