Selman and Kautz's work on ``knowledge compilation'' established how
approximation (strengthening and/or weakening) of a propositional
knowledge-base can be used to speed up query processing, at the expense of
completeness. In this classical approach, querying uses Horn over- and
under-approximations of a given knowledge-base, which is represented as a
propositional formula in conjunctive normal form (CNF). Along with the class of
Horn functions, one could imagine other Boolean function classes that might
serve the same purpose, owing to attractive deduction-computational properties
similar to those of the Horn functions. Indeed, Zanuttini has suggested that
the class of affine Boolean functions could be useful in knowledge compilation
and has presented an affine approximation algorithm. Since CNF is awkward for
presenting affine functions, Zanuttini considers both a sets-of-models
representation and the use of modulo 2 congruence equations. In this paper, we
propose an algorithm based on reduced ordered binary decision diagrams
(ROBDDs). This leads to a representation which is more compact than the sets of
models and, once we have established some useful properties of affine Boolean
functions, a more efficient algorithm.
