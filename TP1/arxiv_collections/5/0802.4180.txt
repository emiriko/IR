The gas-phase reactions between Ni+ (2D5/2) and aminoacetonitrile, a molecule
of prebiological interest as possible precursor of glycine, have been
investigated by means of mass spectrometry techniques. The mass-analyzed ion
kinetic energy (MIKE) spectrum reveals that the adduct ions [NCCH2NH2, Ni+]
spontaneously decompose by loosing HCN, H2, and H2CNH, the loss of hydrogen
cyanide being clearly dominant. The structures and bonding characteristics of
the aminoacetonitrile-Ni+ complexes as well as the different stationary points
of the corresponding potential energy surface (PES) have been theoretically
studied by density functional theory (DFT) calculations carried out at
B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) level. A cyclic intermediate, in which Ni+ is bisligated to
the cyano and the amino group, plays an important role in the unimolecular
reactivity of these ions, because it is the precursor for the observed losses
of HCN and H2CNH. In all mechanisms associated with the loss of H2, the metal
acts as hydrogen carrier favoring the formation of the H2 molecule. The
estimated bond dissociation energy of aminoacetonitrile-Ni+ complexes (291 kJ
mol-1) is larger than those measured for other nitrogen bases such as pyridine
or pyrimidine and only slightly smaller than that of adenine.
