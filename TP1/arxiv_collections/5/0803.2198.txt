We consider two risk-averse financial agents who negotiate the price of an
illiquid indivisible contingent claim in an incomplete semimartingale market
environment. Under the assumption that the agents are exponential utility
maximizers with non-traded random endowments, we provide necessary and
sufficient conditions for negotiation to be successful, i.e., for the trade to
occur. We also study the asymptotic case where the size of the claim is small
compared to the random endowments and we give a full characterization in this
case. Finally, we study a partial-equilibrium problem for a bundle of divisible
claims and establish existence and uniqueness. A number of technical results on
conditional indifference prices are provided.
