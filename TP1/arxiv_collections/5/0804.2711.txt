We dilate the scaling region of the lattice anharmonic oscillator at strong
coupling by introducing the parameter delta. Performing expansion in delta, the
calculation of the mass gap in the continuum limit via the series expansion
effective at large lattice spacings is then studied. We show that the dilation
on the mass parameter M recovers the scaling behavior of the hopping parameter
beta and allows for precise approximation of the mass gap.
