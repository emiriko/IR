We present strong theoretical evidence that a Larkin-Ovchinnikov (LOFF/FFLO)
pairing phase is favoured over the homogeneous superfluid and normal phases in
three-dimensional unitary Fermi systems. Using a Density Functional Theory
(DFT) based on the latest quantum Monte-Carlo calculations and experimental
results, we show that this phase is competitive over a large region of the
phase diagram. The oscillations in the number densities and pairing field have
a substantial amplitude, and a period some 3 to 10 times the average
interparticle separation. Within the DFT, the transition to a normal polarized
Fermi liquid at large polarizations is smooth, while the transition to a
fully-paired superfluid is abrupt.
