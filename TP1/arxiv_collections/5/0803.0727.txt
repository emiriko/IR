In this note we obtain lower bounds for $\P(\xi\geq 0)$ and $\P(\xi>0)$ under
assumptions on the moments of a centered random variable $\xi$. The obtained
estimates are shown to be optimal and improve results from the literature. The
results are applied to obtain probability lower bounds for second order
Rademacher chaos.
