In this paper, we propose a scheme to implement two-qubit logic gates with a
controllable and selective interaction in a scalable superconducting circuit of
charge qubits. A nanomechanical resonator is used as a data bus to connect
qubits. It is indicated that a controllable interaction between qubits can be
obtained by making use of the data bus. It is shown that a selective
interaction between qubits can be realized when many qubits are involved in the
system under our consideration.
