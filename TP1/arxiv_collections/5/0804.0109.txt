We realize a laser with a cloud of cold rubidium atoms as gain medium, placed
in a low-finesse cavity. Three different regimes of laser emission are observed
corresponding respectively to Mollow, Raman and Four Wave Mixing mechanisms. We
measure an output power of up to 300 $\mu$W and present the main properties of
these different lasers in each regime.
