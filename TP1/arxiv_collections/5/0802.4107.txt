Mechanical stress causes motion of defects in solids. We show that in a
type-II superconductor a moving dislocation generates a pattern of current that
exerts the depinning force on the surrounding vortex lattice. Concentration of
dislocations and the mechanical stress needed to produce critical depinning
currents are shown to be within practical range. When external magnetic field
and transport current are present this effect generates voltage across the
superconductor. Thus a superconductor can serve as an electrical sensor of the
mechanical stress.
