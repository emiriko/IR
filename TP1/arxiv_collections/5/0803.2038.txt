We calculate electronic single-particle properties of short-range ordered
stripe states, using Monte-Carlo simulations of collective charge-density wave
(CDW) order parameters coupled to fermions on a 2d square lattice. For
superconducting bond-centered stripes with a d-wave form factor, we find a
valence-bond "glass" which coexists with low-energy quasiparticles featuring
interference phenomena, in agreement with recent scanning-tunneling-microscopy
(STM) measurements on underdoped BSCCO and CaNaCuOCl. Together with earlier
work, our calculations provide a link between CDW features seen in STM and
those in magnetic neutron scattering.
