The commensurate phase of multiferroic HoMn2O5 was studied by X-ray magnetic
scattering, both off resonance and in resonant conditions at the Ho-L3 edge.
Below 40 K, magnetic ordering at the Ho sites is induced by the main Mn
magnetic order parameter, and its temperature dependence is well accounted for
by a simple Curie-Weiss susceptibility model. A lattice distortion of
periodicity twice that of the magnetic order is also evidenced. Azimuthal scans
confirm the model of the magnetic structure recently refined from neutron
diffraction data for both Mn and Ho sites, indicating that the two sublattices
interact via magnetic superexchange.
