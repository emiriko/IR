Due to the weak current non-conservation the diffractive excitation of charm
and strangeness dominates the longitudinal structure function $F_L(x,Q^2)$ of
neutrino DIS at small Bjorken $x$. Based on the color dipole BFKL approach we
report quantitative predictions for this effect in the kinematical range of the
CCFR/NuTeV experiment. We comment on the relevance of our findings to
experimental tests of PCAC.
