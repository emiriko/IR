The electronic and magnetic properties of TbMnO3 leading to its ferroelectric
(FE) polarization were investigated on the basis of relativistic density
functional theory (DFT) calculations. In agreement with experiment, we show
that the spin-spiral plane of TbMnO3 can be either the bc- or ab-plane, but not
the ac-plane. As for the mechanism of FE polarization, our work reveals that
the "pure electronic" model by Katsura, Nagaosa and Balatsky (KNB) is
inadequate in predicting the absolute direction of FE polarization. For the
ab-plane spin-spiral state of TbMnO3, the direction of FE polarization
predicted by the KNB model is opposite to that predicted by DFT calculations.
In determining the magnitude and the absolute direction of FE polarization in
spin-spiral states, it is found crucial to consider the displacements of the
ions from their ecntrosymmetric positions.
