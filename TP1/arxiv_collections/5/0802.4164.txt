Bounded charges induced by the polarization gradient in finite-size
ferroelectrics are known to produce the unfavorable depolarization electric
field that suppresses the uniform ferroelectric state. To reduce the
depolarization energy the non-uniform vortex (toroidal) state is formed inside
ferroelectric nano-particles, nano-disks, and nano-rods. Based on
self-consistent solution of Ginzburg-Landau equations coupled with
electrostatic equations, we study the multivortex toroidal states appearing in
the nanometric easy-plane ferroelectric cylinder. The geometrical textures,
critical temperatures and stability regions for these states are calculated.
