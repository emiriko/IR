We examine stabilities of our supersymmetry-breaking false vacuum in a
low-energy direct gauge mediation model of SUSY breaking. The stability
required in the high-temperature early universe leads to upperbounds on masses
of squarks and gluino as m_\tilde{q} \lesssim 1 TeV and m_\tilde{g} \lesssim 1
TeV for the light gravitino of mass m_{3/2} \lesssim 16 eV.
