We describe the Lorenz links generated by renormalizable Lorenz maps with
reducible kneading invariant $(K_f^-,K_f^+)=(X,Y)*(S,W)$, in terms of the links
corresponding to each factor. This gives one new kind of operation that permits
us to generate new knots and links from old. Using this result we obtain
explicit formulas for the genus and the braid index of this renormalizable
Lorenz knots and links. Then we obtain explicit formulas for sequences of these
invariants, associated to sequences of renormalizable Lorenz maps with kneading
invariant $(X,Y)*(S,W)^{*n}$, concluding that both grow exponentially. This is
specially relevant, since it is known that topological entropy is constant on
the archipelagoes of renormalization.
