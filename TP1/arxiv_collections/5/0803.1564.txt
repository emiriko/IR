We investigate the transition between the Cassie-Baxter and Wenzel states of
a slowly evaporating, micron-scale drop on a superhydrophobic surface. In two
dimensions analytical results show that there are two collapse mechanisms. For
long posts the drop collapses when it is able to overcome the free energy
barrier presented by the hydrophobic posts. For short posts, as the drop loses
volume, its curvature increases allowing it to touch the surface below the
posts. We emphasise the importance of the contact line retreating across the
surface as the drop becomes smaller: this often preempts the collapse. In a
quasi-three dimensional simulation we find similar behaviour, with the
additional feature that the drop can de-pin from all but the peripheral posts,
so that its base resembles an inverted bowl.
