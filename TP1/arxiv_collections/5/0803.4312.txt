The results of the second phase of the Super-Kamiokande solar neutrino
measurement are presented and compared to the first phase. The solar neutrino
flux spectrum and time-variation as well as oscillation results are
statistically consistent with the first phase and do not show spectral
distortion. The time-dependent flux measurement of the combined first and
second phases coincides with the full period of solar cycle 23 and shows no
correlation with solar activity. The measured boron 8 total flux is 2.38
+/-0.05(stat.) +0.16-0.15(sys.) X 10^6 cm^-2 sec^-1 and the day-night
difference is found to be -6.3 +/-4.2(stat.) +/-3.7(sys.) %. There is no
evidence of systematic tendencies between the first and second phases.
