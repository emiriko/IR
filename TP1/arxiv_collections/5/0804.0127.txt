In an incomplete Brownian-motion market setting, we propose a convex
monotonic pricing functional for nonattainable bounded contingent claims which
is compatible with prices for attainable claims. The pricing functional is
defined as the convex conjugate of a generalized entropy penalty functional and
an interpretation in terms of tracking with instantaneously vanishing risk can
be given.
