Electric field noise from fluctuating patch potentials is a significant
problem for a broad range of precision experiments, including trapped ion
quantum computation and single spin detection. Recent results demonstrated
strong suppression of this noise by cryogenic cooling, suggesting an underlying
thermal process. We present measurements characterizing the temperature and
frequency dependence of the noise from 7 to 100 K, using a single Sr+ ion
trapped 75 um above the surface of a gold plated surface electrode ion trap.
The noise amplitude is observed to have an approximate 1/f spectrum around 1
MHz, and grows rapidly with temperature as T^beta for beta from 2 to 4. The
data are consistent with microfabricated cantilever measurements of non-contact
friction but do not extrapolate to the DC measurements with neutral atoms or
contact potential probes.
