The Large Hadron Collider could be a discovery machine for the neutrino mass
pattern and its Majorana nature in the context of a well-motivated TeV scale
Type II seesaw model. This is achieved by identifying the flavor structure of
the lepton number violating decays of the charged Higgs bosons. The observation
of either H^+ --> tau^+ nubar or H^+ --> e^+ nubar will be particularly robust
to determine the neutrino spectra since they are independent of the unknown
Majorana phases, which could be probed via the H^{++} --> e^+_i e^+_j decays.
In a less favorable scenario when the leptonic channels are suppressed, one
needs to observe the decays H^+ --> W^+ H_1, and H^+ --> t bbar to confirm the
triplet-doublet mixing that implies the Type II relation. The associated
production H^{++} H^{-} is crucial in order to test the triplet nature of the
Higgs field.
