Quantum plasmas is a rapidly expanding field of research, with applications
ranging from nanoelectronics, nanoscale devices and ultracold plasmas, to
inertial confinement fusion and astrophysics. Here we give a short systematic
overview of quantum plasmas. In particular, we analyze the collective effects
due to spin using fluid models. The introduction of an intrinsic magnetization
due to the plasma electron (or positron) spin properties in the
magnetohydrodynamic limit is discussed. Finally, a discussion of the theory and
examples of applications is given.
