5$\mu$m thick SmCo films were deposited onto Si substrates using triode
sputtering. A study of the influence of deposition temperature (Tdep <= 600
degrees C) on the structural, magnetic and mechanical properties has shown that
optimum properties (highest degree of in-plane texture, maximum in-plane
coercivity and remanence (1.3 and 0.8 T, respectively), no film peel-off) are
achieved for films deposited at the relatively low temperature of 350 degrees
C. This temperature is compatible with film integration into
Micro-Electro-Mechanical-Systems (MEMS). The deposition rate was increased from
3.6 to 18 $\mu$m/h by increasing the surface area of the target from 7 to 81
cm2. Mechanically stable films could be prepared by deposition onto
pre-patterned films or deposition through holes in a mask.
