The size of the branching ratios for the $\tau \to \mu \gamma$ and $\tau \to
\mu \gamma \gamma$ decays induced by a lepton flavor violating Higgs
interaction $H\tau \mu$ is studied in the frame of effective field theories.
The best constraint on the $H\tau \mu$ vertex, derived from the know
measurement on the muon anomalous magnetic moment, is used to impose the upper
bounds $Br(\tau \to \mu \gamma)<2.5\times 10^{-10}$ and $Br(\tau \to \mu \gamma
\gamma)<2.3\times 10^{-12}$, which are more stringent than current experimental
limits on this class of transitions.
