We consider a measurement of finite-frequency current fluctuations, using a
resonance circuit as a model for the detector. We arrive at an expression for
the measurable response in terms of the current-current correlators which
differs from the standard (symmetrized) formula. The possibility of detection
of vacuum fluctuations is discussed.
