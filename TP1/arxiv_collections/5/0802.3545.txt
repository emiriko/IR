We consider the structure of Josephson vortices approaching the junction
boundary with vacuum in large area Josephson junctions with the Josephson
length $\lambda_J$ large relative to the London penetration depth $\lambda_L$.
Using the stability argument for one-dimentional solitons with respect to 2D
perturbations, it is shown that on the scale $\lambda_J$ the Josephson vortices
do not spread near the boundary in the direction of the junction. %, which is
in a striking difference with behavior of Abrikosov vortices exiting
superconductors. The field distribution in vacuum due to the Josephson vortex
is evaluated, the information needed for the Scanning SQUID Microscopy.
