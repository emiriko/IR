We study a subgap quasiparticle spectrum in a mesoscopic disk of chiral
superconductor. We find an exact expression for the spectrum of surface states
localized at the disk edge. Considering an Abrikosov vortex placed at the
center of a superconducting disk we investigate the spectrum transformation
near the intersection points of surface and vortex anomalous energy branches .
The resulting splitting of the anomalous branches due to the hybridization of
edge and vortex states is determined by an external magnetic field and can lead
in particular to the formation of a set of minigaps in the quasiparticle
spectrum. Tuning the external magnetic field makes it possible to control the
width of minigaps and the positions of corresponding density of states
singularities at the minigaps edges.
