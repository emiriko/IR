We study the five-dimensional SU(3)_c x U(1)_C gauge theory on the orbifold
S^1/Z_2 with a mixed Chern-Simons term. We particularly pay attention to the
realization of the dynamical rearrangement of the theta parameter for SU(3)_c.
It is shown that the physics remains invariant under a large gauge
transformation which even changes the action, completely removing the theta
parameter, because of the Hosotani mechanism for the U(1)_C gauge interactions.
In other words, we show that the theta parameter can be regarded as a boundary
condition for the orbifolding in light of the dynamical rearrangement.
