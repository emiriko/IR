Here we analyze the relationship between quantum contextuality and
decoherence in interference experiments with matter particles by means of a
simple reduced quantum-trajectory model, which attempts to simulate the
behavior of the projections of multi-dimensional, system-plus-environment
Bohmian trajectories onto the subspace of the reduced system. This model allows
us to understand the crossing of the subsystem trajectories as a combined
effect of interference quenching and erasure of ``which-way'' information,
which can be of utility to interpret decoherence effects in many-dimensional
systems where full Bohmian treatments become prohibitive computationally.
