We present a search for the B-> pi e^+ e^- and B-> pi \mu^+ \mu^- decays,
with a data sample of 657 million BBbar pairs collected with the Belle detector
at the KEKB $e^+e^-$ collider. Signal events are reconstructed from a charged
or a neutral pion candidate and a pair of oppositely charged electrons or
muons. No significant signal is observed and we set the upper limit on the
isospin-averaged branching fraction BF(B -> \pi \ell^+\ell^-) < 6.2x10^-8 at
the 90% confidence level.
