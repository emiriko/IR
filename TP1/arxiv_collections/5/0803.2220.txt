Engineering a Web search engine offering effective and efficient information
retrieval is a challenging task. This document presents our experiences from
designing and developing a Web search engine offering a wide spectrum of
functionalities and we report some interesting experimental results. A rather
peculiar design choice of the engine is that its index is based on a DBMS,
while some of the distinctive functionalities that are offered include advanced
Greek language stemming, real time result clustering, and advanced link
analysis techniques (also for spam page detection).
