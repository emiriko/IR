A survey is given summarizing the state of the art of describing information
processing in Quantum Decision Theory, which has been recently advanced as a
novel variant of decision making, based on the mathematical theory of separable
Hilbert spaces. This mathematical structure captures the effect of
superposition of composite prospects, including many incorporated intended
actions. The theory characterizes entangled decision making, non-commutativity
of subsequent decisions, and intention interference. The self-consistent
procedure of decision making, in the frame of the quantum decision theory,
takes into account both the available objective information as well as
subjective contextual effects. This quantum approach avoids any paradox typical
of classical decision theory. Conditional maximization of entropy, equivalent
to the minimization of an information functional, makes it possible to connect
the quantum and classical decision theories, showing that the latter is the
limit of the former under vanishing interference terms.
