In this note we derive enumerative formulas for several types of labelled
acyclic directed graphs by slight modifications of the familiar recursive
formula for simple acyclic digraphs. These considerations are motivated by, and
based upon, recent combinatorial results in geometric topology obtained by
S.Choi, who established exact correspondences between acyclic digraphs and
so-called small covers over hypercubes and related polytopes. In particular, we
show that the number of equivalence classes of small covers over the cartesian
product of $n$ copies of an $r$-simplex is equal to the number of acyclic
$(2^r-1)$-multidigraphs of order $n$. Asymptotics follows easily since the main
formula is represented by a simple equation in terms of special generating
functions.
