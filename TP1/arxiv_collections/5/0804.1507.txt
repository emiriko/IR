A simple one-dimensional cellular automaton model with threshold dynamics is
introduced. The cumulative distribution of the size of the relaxations is
analytically computed and behaves as a power law with an exponent equal to -1.
This coincides with the phenomenological Gutenberg-Richter behavior observed in
Seismology for the cumulative statistics of earthquakes at the regional or
global scale. The key point of the model is the zero-load state of the system
after the occurrence of any relaxation, no matter what its size. This leads to
an equipartition of probability between all possible load configurations in the
system during the successive loading cycles. Each cycle ends with the
occurrence of the greatest -or characteristic- relaxation in the system. The
duration of the cycles in the model is statistically distributed with a
coefficient of variation ranging from 0.5 to 1. The predictability of the
characteristic relaxations is evaluated by means of error diagrams. This model
illustrates the value of taking into account the refractory periods to obtain a
considerable gain in the quality of the predictions.
