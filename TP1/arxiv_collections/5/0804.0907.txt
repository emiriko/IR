In this article, we calculate the $B\to a_1(1260)$ form-factors $V_1(q^2)$,
$V_2(q^2)$, $V_3(q^2)$ and $A(q^2)$ with the $B$-meson light-cone QCD sum
rules. Those form-factors are basic parameters in studying the exclusive
non-leptonic two-body decays $B\to AP$ and semi-leptonic decays $B\to A l
\nu_l$, $B\to A \bar{l}l$. Our numerical results are consistent with the values
from the (light-cone) QCD sum rules. The main uncertainty comes from the
parameter $\omega_0$ (or $\lambda_B$), which determines the shapes of the
two-particle and three-particle light-cone distribution amplitudes of the $B$
meson, it is of great importance to refine this parameter.
