A thin fiber or sheet curled into a circular container has a detached region
whose shape and force ratios are independent of material properties and
container radius. We compute this shape and compare it with experiments. The
discrete forces acting at either end of the detached region have a ratio that
depends only on the length of the fiber or sheet relative to the circle radius.
We calculate this force ratio in three regimes of circle radius.
