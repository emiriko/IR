It is known that multiplication of linear differential operators over ground
fields of characteristic zero can be reduced to a constant number of matrix
products. We give a new algorithm by evaluation and interpolation which is
faster than the previously-known one by a constant factor, and prove that in
characteristic zero, multiplication of differential operators and of matrices
are computationally equivalent problems. In positive characteristic, we show
that differential operators can be multiplied in nearly optimal time.
Theoretical results are validated by intensive experiments.
