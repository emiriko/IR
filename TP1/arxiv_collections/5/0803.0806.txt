The Franck-Condon principle governing molecular electronic transitions is
utilized to study heavy-quark hadron decays. This provides a direct assessment
of the wavefunction of the parent hadron if the momentum distribution of the
open-flavor decay products is measured. Model-independent results include an
experimental distinction between quarkonium and exotica (hybrids,
tetraquarks...), an off-plane correlator signature for tetraquarks and a direct
probe of the sea quark orbital wavefunction relevant in the discussion of 3S_1
or 3P_0 decay mechanisms.
