Previous numerical investigations of the stability and bifurcation properties
of different nonlinear combination structures of spiral vortices in a
counterrotating Taylor-Couette system that were done for fixed axial
wavelengths are supplemented by exploring the dependence of the vortex
phenomena waves on their wavelength. This yields information about the
experimental and numerical accessability of the various bifurcation scenarios.
Also backwards bifurcating standing waves with oscillating amplitudes of the
constituent traveling waves are found.
