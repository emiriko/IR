Following a prior paper, we review the results for the energy and angular
momentum of a Kerr-Newman black hole, and then calculate the same properties
for the case of a generalised rotating dilaton of the type derived, without
rotation, by Garfinkle, Horowitz, and Strominger (1991; 1992). We show that
there is, as far as it refers only to the energy and angular momentum, an
interaction among the fields, so that, the gravitational and electromagnetic
fields may be obscured by the strength of the scalar field.
