We show that a gas-to-liquid phase transition at zero temperature may occur
in a coherent gas of bosons in the presence of competing nonlinear effects.
This situation can take place both in atomic systems like Bose-Einstein
Condensates in alkalii gases with two and three-body interactions of opposite
signs, as well as in laser beams which propagate through optical media with
Kerr (focusing) and higher order (defocusing) nonlinear responses. The
liquefaction process takes place in absence of any quantum effect and can be
formulated in the frame of a mean field theory, in terms of the minimization of
a thermodynamic potential. We also show numerically that the effect of linear
gain and three-body recombination also provides a rich dynamics with the
emergence of self-organization behaviour.
