Differential quantities, including normals, curvatures, principal directions,
and associated matrices, play a fundamental role in geometric processing and
physics-based modeling. Computing these differential quantities consistently on
surface meshes is important and challenging, and some existing methods often
produce inconsistent results and require ad hoc fixes. In this paper, we show
that the computation of the gradient and Hessian of a height function provides
the foundation for consistently computing the differential quantities. We
derive simple, explicit formulas for the transformations between the first- and
second-order differential quantities (i.e., normal vector and principal
curvature tensor) of a smooth surface and the first- and second-order
derivatives (i.e., gradient and Hessian) of its corresponding height function.
We then investigate a general, flexible numerical framework to estimate the
derivatives of the height function based on local polynomial fittings
formulated as weighted least squares approximations. We also propose an
iterative fitting scheme to improve accuracy. This framework generalizes
polynomial fitting and addresses some of its accuracy and stability issues, as
demonstrated by our theoretical analysis as well as experimental results.
