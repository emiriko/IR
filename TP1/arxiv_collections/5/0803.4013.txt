Spin of elementary particles is the only kinematic degree of freedom not
having classical corre- spondence. It arises when seeking for the
finite-dimensional representations of the Lorentz group, which is the only
symmetry group of relativistic quantum field theory acting on
multiple-component quantum fields non-unitarily. We study linear
transformations, acting on the space of spatial and proper-time velocities
rather than on coordinates. While ensuring the relativistic in- variance, they
avoid these two exceptions: they describe the spin degree of freedom of a
pointlike particle yet at a classical level and form a compact group hence with
unitary finite-dimensional rep- resentations. Within this approach changes of
the velocity modulus and direction can be accounted for by rotations of two
independent unit vectors. Dirac spinors just provide the quantum description of
these rotations.
