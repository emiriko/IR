We reveal a shape transition for a transient simple random walk forced to
realize an excess $q$-norm of the local times, as the parameter $q$ crosses the
value $q_c(d)=\frac{d}{d-2}$. Also, as an application of our approach, we
establish a central limit theorem for the $q$-norm of the local times in
dimension 4 or more.
