We extend a recent analysis of the pion electromagnetic form factor
constrained by the conformal symmetry to explore the time-like region. We show
explicitly that the time-like form factor obtained by the analytic continuation
of the space-like form factor correctly satisfies the dispersion relation. Our
results indicate that the quark spin and dynamical mass effects are crucial to
yield the realistic features of the vector meson dominance phenomena.
