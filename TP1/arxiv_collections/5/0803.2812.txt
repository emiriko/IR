The method of a linear high dynamic range imaging using solid-state
photosensors with Bayer colour filters array is provided in this paper. Using
information from neighbour pixels, it is possible to reconstruct linear images
with wide dynamic range from the oversaturated images. Bayer colour filters
array is considered as an array of neutral filters in a quasimonochromatic
light. If the camera's response function to the desirable light source is known
then one can calculate correction coefficients to reconstruct oversaturated
images. Reconstructed images are linearized in order to provide a linear high
dynamic range images for optical-digital imaging systems. The calibration
procedure for obtaining the camera's response function to the desired light
source is described. Experimental results of the reconstruction of the images
from the oversaturated images are presented for red, green, and blue
quasimonochromatic light sources. Quantitative analysis of the accuracy of the
reconstructed images is provided.
