One of the most central and controversial element of quantum mechanics is the
use of non zero vectors of a Hilbert space (or, more generally, of one
dimension subspaces) for representing the state of a quantum system. In
particular, the question whether such a representation is complete has been
debated since almost the early days of quantum mechanics. In this article, we
develop an alternate way to formalize knowledge about the state of quantum
systems, based solely on experimentally accessible elements, namely on outcomes
of finite measurements. We introduce what we call partial description which,
given a feasible measurement, indicates some outcomes which are known to be
impossible (i.e. known to have a probability equal to 0 to occur) and hence
have to be discarded. Then, we introduce partial states (which are partial
descriptions providing as much information as possible) and compare this way to
describe quantum states to the orthodox one, using vector rays. Finally, we
show that partial states allow to describe quantum states in a strictly more
expressive way that the orthodox description does.
