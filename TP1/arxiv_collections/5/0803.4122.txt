The denaturation dynamics of a long double-stranded DNA is studied by means
of a model of the Poland-Scheraga type. We note that the linking of the two
strands is a locally conserved quantity, hence we introduce local updates that
respect this symmetry. Linking dissipation via untwist is allowed only at the
two ends of the double strand. The result is a slow denaturation characterized
by two time scales that depend on the chain length $L$. In a regime up to a
first characteristic time $\tau_1\sim L^{2.15}$ the chain embodies an
increasing number of small bubbles. Then, in a second regime, bubbles coalesce
and form entropic barriers that effectively trap residual double-stranded
segments within the chain, slowing down the relaxation to fully molten
configurations, which takes place at $\tau_2\sim L^3$. This scenario is
different from the picture in which the helical constraints are neglected.
