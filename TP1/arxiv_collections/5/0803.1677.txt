We report on the reversible, nonvolatile and polarity dependent resistive
switching between superconductor and insulator states at the interfaces of a
Au/YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ (YBCO)/Au system. We show that the
superconducting state of YBCO in regions near the electrodes can be reversibly
removed and restored. The possible origin of the switching effect may be the
migration of oxygen or metallic ions along the grain boundaries that control
the intergrain superconducting coupling. Four-wire bulk resistance measurements
reveal that the migration is not restricted to interfaces and produce
significant bulk effects.
