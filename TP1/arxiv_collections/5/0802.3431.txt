The gauge-Higgs unification is one of influential scenarios to solve the
hierarchy problem in the Standard Model. Recently, the scenario on the warped
background attracts many attentions due to a large possibility to construct a
realistic model naturally in this framework. It is, however, well known that
the effective potential for the Higgs field, which is the most important
prediction of the scenario, is not easy to calculate on the warped background,
because masses of Kaluza-Klein particles are not obtained analytically. In this
article, we derive useful formulae for the effective potential. The formulae
allow us to calculate the Higgs mass easily, thus to construct a realistic
model in the gauge-Higgs unification scenario on the warped background. Using
obtained formulae, we calculate contributions from bulk fermions with several
boundary conditions. We also show bulk fermions, which have boundary conditions
not allowed in the orbifold picture, do not contribute to the effective
potential.
