Utilizing a complete Lorentz-covariant and local-gauge-invariant formulation,
we discuss graphene response to arbitrary external electric field. The
relation, which is called as Kramers-Kr(\ddot{o})nig relation in the paper,
between imaginary part and real part of ac conductivity is given. We point out
there exists an ambiguity in the conductivity computing, attributed to the wick
behavior at ultraviolet vicinity. We argue that to study electrical response of
graphene completely, non-perturbational contribution should be considered.
