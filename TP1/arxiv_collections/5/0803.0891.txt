By exploiting the polarization multistability of polaritons, we show that
polarized signals can be conducted in the plane of a semiconductor microcavity
along controlled channels or "neurons". Furthermore due to the interaction of
polaritons with opposite spins it is possible to realize binary logic gates
operating on the polarization degree of freedom. Multiple gates can be
integrated together to form an optical circuit contained in a single
semiconductor microcavity.
