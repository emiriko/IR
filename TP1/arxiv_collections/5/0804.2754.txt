Comparison of the total number of the radar astronomy transmissions with
respect to that used for sending messages to extra-terrestrial civilizations
reveals that the probability of detection of the radio signals to
extraterrestrials (ETs) is one million times smaller than that of the radar
signals used to study planets and asteroids in the Solar System.
