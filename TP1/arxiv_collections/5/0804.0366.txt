While developing an information system for the University of Bern, we were
faced with two major issues: managing software changes and adapting Business
Information Models. Software techniques well-suited to software development
teams exist, yet the models obtained are often too complex for the business
user. We will first highlight the conceptual problems encountered while
designing the Business Information Model. We will then propose merging class
diagrams and business process modeling to achieve a necessary transparency. We
will finally present a modeling tool we developed which, using pilot case
studies, helps to show some of the advantages of a dual model approach.
