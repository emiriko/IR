We study the spin-1/2 Ising model on a Bethe lattice in the mean-field limit,
with the interaction constants following two deterministic aperiodic sequences:
Fibonacci or period-doubling ones. New algorithms of sequence generation were
implemented, which were fundamental in obtaining long sequences and, therefore,
precise results. We calculate the exact critical temperature for both
sequences, as well as the critical exponent $\beta$, $\gamma$ and $\delta$. For
the Fibonacci sequence, the exponents are classical, while for the
period-doubling one they depend on the ratio between the two exchange
constants. The usual relations between critical exponents are satisfied, within
error bars, for the period-doubling sequence. Therefore, we show that
mean-field-like procedures may lead to nonclassical critical exponents.
