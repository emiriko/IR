Recently, it was pointed out that the mixing phase in the Bs-Bsbar system is
large, contrary to the expectations in the Standard Model as well as in minimal
flavour violation models. The leptonic decay widths of the D_s meson are also
found to be larger than expected. We show how a minimal set of four R-parity
violating lambda-prime type couplings can explain both these anomalies. We also
point out other phenomenological implications of such new physics.
