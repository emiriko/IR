We study possible crossing of the phantom divided barrier in a Lorentz
invariance violating dark energy model. Lorentz invariance violation which is
achieved by introducing a vector field in the action, incorporates directly in
the dynamics of the scalar field and equation of state. This interesting
feature allows us to study phantom divided barrier crossing in the context of
Lorentz invariance violation. We show that for suitable choice of parameter
space, equation of state can cross phantom divided barrier just by one scalar
field and Lorentz violating vector field controls this crossing.
