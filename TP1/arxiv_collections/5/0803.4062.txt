We consider the ultradiscretization of a solvable one-dimensional chaotic map
which arises from the duplication formula of the elliptic functions. It is
shown that ultradiscrete limit of the map and its solution yield the tent map
and its solution simultaneously. A geometric interpretation of the dynamics of
the tent map is given in terms of the tropical Jacobian of a certain tropical
curve. Generalization to the maps corresponding to the $m$-th multiplication
formula of the elliptic functions is also discussed.
