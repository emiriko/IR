This paper describes a series of model-checking experiments to verify
optimistic replication algorithms based on Operational Transformation (OT)
approach used for supporting collaborative edition. We formally define, using
tool UPPAAL, the behavior and the main consistency requirement (i.e.
convergence property) of the collaborative editing systems, as well as the
abstract behavior of the environment where these systems are supposed to
operate. Due to data replication and the unpredictable nature of user
interactions, such systems have infinitely many states. So, we show how to
exploit some features of the UPPAAL specification language to attenuate the
severe state explosion problem. Two models are proposed. The first one, called
concrete model, is very close to the system implementation but runs up against
a severe explosion of states. The second model, called symbolic model, aims to
overcome the limitation of the concrete model by delaying the effective
selection and execution of editing operations until the construction of
symbolic execution traces of all sites is completed. Experimental results have
shown that the symbolic model allows a significant gain in both space and time.
Using the symbolic model, we have been able to show that if the number of sites
exceeds 2 then the convergence property is not satisfied for all OT algorithms
considered here. A counterexample is provided for every algorithm.
