We calculate the strength of the electroweak phase transition in a
supersymmetric model with four chiral generations. The additional chiral
fermions (and scalar partners) lower the critical temperature and thus
strengthen the first-order phase transition. The scalar partners stabilize the
potential, leading to an effective theory that is bounded from below. We
identify the ensemble of parameters where phi_c/T_c \gsim 1 simultaneous with
obtaining a large enough Higgs mass. Our calculations focus on a subset of the
full four generational supersymmetric parameter space: We take the pseudoscalar
heavy, tan(beta)=1, and neglect all subleading contributions to the effective
potential. We find that the region of parameter space with a strong first-order
phase transition requires m_tilde{q}'/m_q' \lsim 1.1 while the constraint on
the lightest Higgs mass requires m_tilde{q}'/m_q' /gsim 1 with m_q' \gsim 300
GeV. We are led to an intriguing prediction of quarks and squarks just beyond
the current Tevatron direct search limits that are poised to be discovered
quickly at the LHC.
