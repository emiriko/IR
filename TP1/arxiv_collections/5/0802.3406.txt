As in an acoustic black hole where the fluid is moving faster than the speed
of sound and where the sound waves are swept along, in an Alfven black hole the
plasma is moving faster than the Alfven velocity, with the Alfven waves swept
along and eliminated as the cause of the magneto hydrodynamic instabilities. To
realize an Alfven black hole, it is proposed to bring a plasma into rapid
rotation by radially arranged lumped parameter transmission lines intersecting
the plasma under an oblique angle. The rotating plasma slides frictionless over
magnetic mirror fields directed towards the rotating plasma, with the mirror
fields generated by magnetic solenoids positioned at the end of each
transmission line. It is then shown that, with this configuration one can
realize a thermonuclear dynamo, which also can serve as the analogue of a
magnetar.
