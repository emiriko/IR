This paper is devoted to a prediction of new effect - the occurrence of a
heat flow perpendicular both to temperature gradient and magnetic field in
molecular dielectric where rotary degrees of freedom of molecules are defrozen.
The method of the moments considering processes of phonon scattering on
molecules with their rotary condition changing is developed.
