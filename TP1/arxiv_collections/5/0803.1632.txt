The effect of a measurement time duration on the parameters of magnetization
curves for an ensemble of identical noninteracting single-domain particles with
equally oriented axes under the uniaxial anisotropy has been specifed for
different experiment modes, in particular for the cases of relaxation
measurements and the continuous sweep of a static magnetic field. The relation
between a blocking temperature and experiment characteristics has been found
for these modes. A recursion method to calculate the magnetization reversal
curves for such an ensemble of particles is proposed. By comparing the results
of calculations of the magnetic properties by the recursion and Monte-Carlo
methods, an algorithm to establish the relation between the equivalent
measurement time and such parameters of the Monte-Carlo method as the number of
steps and the value of aperture is suggested.
