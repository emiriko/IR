We report on the discovery of a lead-free morphotropic phase boundary in Sm
doped BiFeO3 with a simple perovskite structure using the combinatorial thin
film strategy. The boundary is a rhombohedral to pseudo-orthorhombic structural
transition which exhibits a ferroelectric (FE) to antiferroelectric (AFE)
transition at approximately Bi0.86Sm0.14FeO3 with dielectric constant and
out-of-plane piezoelectric coefficient comparable to those of epitaxial (001)
oriented Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 (PZT) thin films at the MPB. The discovered composition
may be a strong candidate of a Pb-free piezoelectric replacement of PZT.
