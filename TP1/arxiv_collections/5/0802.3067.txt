This paper presents a polycrystalline silicon germanium (poly-SiGe)
thermopile specially designed for thermoelectric generators used on human body.
Both the design of the single thermocouple and the arrangement of the
thermocouple array have been described. A rim structure has been introduced in
order to increase the temperature difference across the thermocouple junctions.
The modeling of the thermocouple and the thermopile has been performed
analytically and numerically. An output power of about 1 $\mu$W at an output
voltage of more than 1 V is expected from the current design of thermopiles in
a watch-size generator. The key material properties of the poly-SiGe have been
measured. The thermopile has been fabricated and tested. Experimental results
clearly demonstrate the advantage of the rim structure in increasing output
voltage. In presence of forced convection, the output voltage of a non-released
thermopile can increase from about 53 mV/K/cm2 to about 130 mV/K/cm2 after the
rim structure is formed. A larger output voltage from the thermopile is
expected upon process completion.
