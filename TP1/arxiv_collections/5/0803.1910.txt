Based on a general unitary operation of two-qubit system, we investigate the
dynamics of entanglement, entropy and purity. Distinctive features in the
different initial states settings of an interacting bipartite system are
explored. The striking effects of initial product states on entanglement shows
that zeros entanglement can be obtained during the development of the
interaction.
