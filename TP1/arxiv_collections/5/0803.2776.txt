We investigate an optimal regime of negative-valued conductance, emerging in
a resistively and capacitively shunted Josephson junction, which is driven
simultaneously by both, a time-periodic (ac) and a constant (dc) current. We
analyze the current-voltage characteristics in the regime of absolute negative
conductance. We additionally explore the stability of the negative response
with respect to the ac-current frequency.
