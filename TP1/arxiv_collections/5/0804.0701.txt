In this paper, we discuss the recognition problem for A_k-type singularities
on wave fronts. We give computable and simple criteria of these singularities,
which will play a fundamental role in generalizing the authors' previous work
"the geometry of fronts" for surfaces. The crucial point to prove our criteria
for A_k-singularities is to introduce a suitable parametrization of the
singularities called the "k-th KRSUY-coordinates". Using them, we can directly
construct a versal unfolding for a given singularity. As an application, we
prove that a given nondegenerate singular point p on a real (resp. complex)
hypersurface (as a wave front) in R^{n+1} (resp. C^{n+1}) is differentiably
(resp. holomorphically) right-left equivalent to the A_{k+1}-type singular
point if and only if the linear projection of the singular set around p into a
generic hyperplane R^n (resp. C^n) is right-left equivalent to the A_k-type
singular point in R^n (resp. C^{n}). Moreover, we show that the restriction of
a C-infinity-map f:R^n --> R^n to its Morin singular set gives a wave front
consisting of only A_k-type singularities. Furthermore, we shall give a
relationship between the normal curvature map and the zig-zag numbers (the
Maslov indices) of wave fronts.
