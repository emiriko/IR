We report on thermodynamic and optical measurements of the condensation
process of $^4$He in three silica aerogels of different microstructures. For
the two base-catalysed aerogels, the temperature dependence of the shape of
adsorption isotherms and of the morphology of the condensation process show
evidence of a disorder driven transition, in agreement with recent theoretical
predictions. This transition is not observed for a neutral-catalysed aerogel,
which we interpret as due to a larger disorder in this case.
