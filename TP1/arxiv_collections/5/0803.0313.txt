In this work there are proposed several new 6D brane worlds based on exact
topological solutions to the vortex equations for the Abelian Higgs model, with
suitable boundary conditions and symmetry breaking potentials similar to the
mexican hat. Just as happens for RS domain wall brane worlds, it is shown that
the massless mode of linearized gravity is localized in the neighborhood of the
string-vortex solution while there are not massive bounded states. The
correction to the newtonian limit of the effective 4D gravity is calculated.
