We investigate the determination of the $\sigma$ pole from $\pi\pi$
scattering data below the $K\bar{K}$ threshold, including the new precise
results obtained from $K_{e4}$ decay by NA48/2 Collaboration. We discuss also
the experimental status of the threshold parameters $a_0^0$ and $b_0^0$ and the
phase shift $\delta_0^0$. In order to reduce the theoretical bias, we use a
large class of analytic parametrizations of the isoscalar $S$-wave, based on
expansions in powers of conformal variables. The $\sigma$ pole obtained with
this method is consistent with the prediction based on ChPT and Roy equations.
However, the theoretical uncertainties are now larger, reflecting the
sensitivity of the pole position to the specific parametrizations valid in the
physical region. We conclude that Roy equations offer the most precise method
for the determination of the $\sigma$ pole from $\pi\pi$ elastic scattering.
