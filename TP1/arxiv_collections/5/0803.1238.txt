By means of the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method, the
static spin structure factors and the magnetization plateaus of the trimerized
Heisenberg ferromagnet-ferromagnet-antiferromagnet and
antiferromagnet-antiferromagnet-ferromagnet spin chains in the presence of a
magnetic field are elaborately studied. It is found that in the plateau states,
the static structure factor with three peaks does not vary with the external
magnetic field as well as the exchange couplings; the spin correlation function
behaves as a perfect sequence and has a simple relation with the magnetization
per site. An approximate wave function for the plateau states is proposed, and
a picture based on the valence-bond-solid states is presented in order to
understand the origin and the total number of the magnetization plateaus, which
are shown to be in agreement with the DMRG results.
