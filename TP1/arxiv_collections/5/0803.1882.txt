Cross sections of the e+e- annihilation into one photon plus two vector
mesons, such as J/psi rho, J/psi phi, and rho phi at the center of mass energy
\sqrt{s}=10.58GeV are calculated. These shed light on the measurement of the
e+e- annihilation cross section via radiative return in B-factories. At another
center of mass energy \sqrt{s}=3.097GeV, namely the J/psi resonance peak, the
processes e+e- --> gamma VV and e+e- --> gamma gamma V (with V being rho,
omega, or phi) are calculated with similar method. These calculations give
estimation of the background levels in the study of radiative or double
radiative decays of J/psi.
