We demonstrate that atoms in magnetically insensitive hyperfine states (m=0)
can be trapped efficiently by a Bose-Einstein Condensate of the same atomic
species occupying a different hyperfine state. The latter is trapped
magnetically. Hyperfine state changing collisions, and therefore loss of the
trapped (m=0) atoms, are shown to be strongly inhibited in case of a low
density of the confined atomic cloud. We monitor the transition from a 'soft'
to a 'hard' effective potential by studying the backaction of the trapped (m=0)
atoms onto the condensate which provides their confinement. The controlled
outcoupling of the trapped atoms by shaping the condensate's wavefunction is
explored. We observe a pulsed emission of atoms from the trapping region
reminiscent of an atom laser.
