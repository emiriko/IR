Interaction driven integer quantum Hall effects are anticipated in graphene
bilayers because of the near-degeneracy of the eight Landau levels which appear
near the neutral system Fermi level. We predict that an intra-Landau-level
cyclotron resonance signal will appear at some odd-integer filling factors,
accompanied by collective modes which are nearly gapless and have approximate
$k^{3/2}$ dispersion. We speculate on the possibility of unususal localization
physics associated with these modes.
