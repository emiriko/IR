Magnetic field induced ferroelectric hysteresis loop observed in
Bi0.75Sr0.25FeO3-delta is of prime importance. The coexistence of
antiferromagnetism and weak ferromagnetism is responsible for the original
magnetoelastic and magnetoferroelectric properties. Upon external magnetic
field application, the existence of a magnetostrictive effect supports a
structural transition towards a homogeneous antiferromagnetic and ferroelectric
phase. The magnetic field induced polarization is among the highest reported
for BiFeO3 based systems in either thin film or bulk forms (Pr=96 microC/cm2 at
10T) while the ferroelectric coercive field is among the lowest reported
(Hc=661(V/cm) at 10T). These properties make this material very attractive for
technical applications.
