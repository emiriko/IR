The dynamics of a vesicle suspension in a shear flow between parallel plates
has been investigated under microgravity conditions, where vesicles are only
submitted to hydrodynamic effects such as lift forces due to the presence of
walls and drag forces. The temporal evolution of the spatial distribution of
the vesicles has been recorded thanks to digital holographic microscopy, during
parabolic flights and under normal gravity conditions. The collected data
demonstrates that vesicles are pushed away from the walls with a lift velocity
proportional to $\dot{\gamma} R^3/z^2$ where $\dot{\gamma}$ is the shear rate,
$R$ the vesicle radius and $z$ its distance from the wall. This scaling as well
as the dependence of the lift velocity upon vesicle aspect ratio are consistent
with theoretical predictions by Olla [J. Phys. II France {\bf 7}, 1533--1540
(1997)].
