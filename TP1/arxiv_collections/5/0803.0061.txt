We consider meson radiative decays within the framework of $U_0(1)\times
U(1)\times SU(2)$ gauge symmetry. This approach is based on the linear
sigma-model extended by the gauge and quark-meson interactions. Physical
content and parameters of the model are discussed. Theoretical predictions for
some radiative decays of vector mesons are in a good agreement with the
experimental data.
