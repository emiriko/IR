Mesoscopic conductors are electronic systems of sizes in between nano- and
micrometers, and often of reduced dimensionality. In the phase-coherent regime
at low temperatures, the conductance of these devices is governed by quantum
interference effects, such as the Aharonov-Bohm effect and conductance
fluctuations as prominent examples. While first measurements of quantum charge
transport date back to the 1980s, spin phenomena in mesoscopic transport have
moved only recently into the focus of attention, as one branch of the field of
spintronics. The interplay between quantum coherence with confinement-,
disorder- or interaction-effects gives rise to a variety of unexpected spin
phenomena in mesoscopic conductors and allows moreover to control and engineer
the spin of the charge carriers: spin interference is often the basis for
spin-valves, -filters, -switches or -pumps. Their underlying mechanisms may
gain relevance on the way to possible future semiconductor-based spin devices.
  A quantitative theoretical understanding of spin-dependent mesoscopic
transport calls for developing efficient and flexible numerical algorithms,
including matrix-reordering techniques within Green function approaches, which
we will explain, review and employ.
