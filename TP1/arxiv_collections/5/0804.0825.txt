The dissertation contains 4 original chapters:
  1) Parametric excitation of Soret-driven convection of binary mixture in a
horizontal porous layer.
  2) Soret-driven convection in a horizontal porous layer from a heat or
concentration source.
  3) Localization of convective flows under randomly inhomogeneous heating.
  4) Synchrony of nonlinear systems driven by common noise.
