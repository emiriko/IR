The authors introduce a general mechanism, based on electrostatic and
magnetostatic considerations, for designing three-dimensional isotopic
metamaterials that possess an enhanced refractive index over an extremely large
frequency range. The mechanism allows nearly independent control of effective
electric permittivity and magnetic permeability without the use of resonant
elements.
