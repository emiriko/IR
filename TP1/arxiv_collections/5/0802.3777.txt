The dynamical phase diagram of the fractional Langevin equation is
investigated for harmonically bound particle. It is shown that critical
exponents mark dynamical transitions in the behavior of the system. Four
different critical exponents are found. (i) $\alpha_c=0.402\pm 0.002$ marks a
transition to a non-monotonic under-damped phase, (ii) $\alpha_R=0.441...$
marks a transition to a resonance phase when an external oscillating field
drives the system, (iii) $\alpha_{\chi_1}=0.527...$ and (iv)
$\alpha_{\chi_2}=0.707...$ marks transition to a double peak phase of the
"loss" when such an oscillating field present. As a physical explanation we
present a cage effect, where the medium induces an elastic type of friction.
Phase diagrams describing over-damped, under-damped regimes, motion and
resonances, show behaviors different from normal.
