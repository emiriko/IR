In this paper we derive two expressions for the Hurwitz zeta function
involving the complete Bell polynomials in the restricted case where q is a
positive integer greater than 1. The arguments of the complete Bell polynomials
comprise the generalised harmonic number functions. These in turn give rise to
Euler-Hurwitz series which may then be used to determine identities for
combinations of both linear and non-linear Euler sums.
