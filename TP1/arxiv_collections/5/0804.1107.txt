The process ppbar -> photon + jet + X is studied using 1.0 fb^-1 of data
collected by the D0 detector at the Fermilab Tevatron ppbar collider at a
center-of-mass energy sqrt(s)=1.96 TeV. Photons are reconstructed in the
central rapidity region |y_gamma|<1.0 with transverse momenta in the range
30<Pt_gamma<400 GeV while jets are reconstructed in either the central
|y_jet|<0.8 or forward 1.5<|y_jet|<2.5 rapidity intervals with Pt_jet>15 GeV.
The differential cross section d^3sigma/dPt_gamma dy_gamma dy_jet is measured
as a function of Pt_gamma in four regions, differing by the relative
orientations of the photon and the jet in rapidity. Ratios between the
differential cross sections in each region are also presented. Next-to-leading
order QCD predictions using different parameterizations of parton distribution
functions and theoretical scale choices are compared to the data. The
predictions do not simultaneously describe the measured normalization and
Pt_gamma dependence of the cross section in any of the four measured regions.
