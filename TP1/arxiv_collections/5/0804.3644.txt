We report an ab-initio comparative study of the electric-field-gradient
tensor (EFG) and structural relaxations introduced by acceptor (Cd) and donor
(Ta) impurities when they replace cations in a series of binary oxides: TiO2,
SnO2, and In2O3. Calculations were performed with the Full-Potential
Linearized-Augmented Plane Waves method that allows us to treat the electronic
structure and the atomic relaxations in a fully self-consistent way. We
considered different charge states for each impurity and studied the dependence
on these charge states of the electronic properties and the structural
relaxations. Our results are compared with available data coming from PAC
experiments and previous calculations, allowing us to obtain a new insight on
the role that metal impurities play in oxide semiconductors. It is clear from
our results that simple models can not describe the measured EFGs at impurities
in oxides even approximately.
