We present a systematic characterization of the radio frequency (RF) spectra
of homogeneous, paired atomic Fermi gases at finite temperatures, $T$, in the
presence of final state interactions. The spectra, consisting of possible bound
states and positive as well as negative detuning ($\nu$) continua, satisfy
exactly the zeroth- and first-moment sum rules at all $T$. We show how to
detect the $\nu < 0$ continuum arising from thermally excited quasiparticles,
which has not yet been seen experimentally. We explain semi-quantitatively
recent RF experiments on "bound-bound" transitions and, thereby, predict the
associated effects of varying temperature.
