We report a continuous-wave, singly resonant optical parametric oscillator
(SRO) at 3.3 \mu m by using a MgO:PPLN crystal as the gain medium and a
Yb-fiber laser at 1.064 \mu m as the pump source. At 25-W pump power, the SRO
generated 7.4 and 0.2-W powers at 1.57 and 3.3 \mu m, respectively. The 3.3-\mu
m SRO has a single-longitudinal-mode output with a ~5-MHz linewidth. We
observed thermally induced optical bistability in the SRO due to the slight
absorption of the 3.3-\mu m wave in the MgO:PPLN crystal. Pump depletion was
clamped at 60% while spectral hole burning was observed in the depleted pump.
