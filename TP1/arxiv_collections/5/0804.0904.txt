We analyse descriptions of electroweak symmetry breaking in terms of
ultralocal antisymmetric tensor fields and gauge-singlet geometric variables,
respectively; in particular, the Weinberg--Salam model and, ultimately,
dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking by technicolour theories with enhanced
symmetry groups. Our motivation is to unveil the manifestly gauge invariant
structure of the different realisations. We find, for example, parallels to
different types of torsion.
