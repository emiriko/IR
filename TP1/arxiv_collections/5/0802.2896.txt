We study the decays of the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) in models
with spontaneously broken R-parity. We focus on the two cases that the LSP is
either a bino or a neutral singlet lepton. We work out the most important
phenomenological differences between these two scenarios and discuss also how
they might be distinguished from explicit R-Parity breaking models. In both
cases we find that certain ratios of decay branching ratios are correlated with
either the solar or the atmospheric (and reactor) neutrino angle. The
hypothesis that spontaneous R-Parity violation is the source of the observed
neutrino masses is therefore potentially testable at the LHC.
