Based on theoretical and experimental consideration of the first (the Twomey
effect) and second indirect aerosol effects the quasianalytic description of
physical connection between the galactic cosmic rays intensity and the Earth's
cloud cover is obtained. It is shown that the basic equation of the Earth's
climate energy-balance model is described by the bifurcation equation (with
respect to the temperature of the Earth's surface) in the form of assembly-type
catastrophe with the two governing parameters defining the variations of
insolation and Earth's magnetic field (or the galactic cosmic rays intensity in
the atmosphere), respectively. The principle of hierarchical climatic models
construction, which consists in the structural invariance of balance equations
of these models evolving on different time scales, is described.
