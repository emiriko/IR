The cornerstone of any algorithm computing all repetitions in a string of
length n in O(n) time is the fact that the number of runs (or maximal
repetitions) is O(n). We give a simple proof of this result. As a consequence
of our approach, the stronger result concerning the linearity of the sum of
exponents of all runs follows easily.
