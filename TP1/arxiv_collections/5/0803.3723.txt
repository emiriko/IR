We study Dirac-harmonic maps from degenerating spin surfaces with uniformly
bounded energy and show the so-called generalized energy identity in the case
that the domain converges to a spin surface with only Neveu-Schwarz type nodes.
We find condition that is both necessary and sufficient for the $W^{1,2} \times
L^{4}$ modulo bubbles compactness of a sequence of such maps.
