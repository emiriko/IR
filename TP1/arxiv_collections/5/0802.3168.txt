We report first-principles GW-Bethe Salpeter Equation and Quantum Monte Carlo
calculations of the optical and electronic properties of molecular and
crystalline rubrene (C$_{42}$H$_{28}$). Many-body effects dominate the optical
spectrum and quasi-particle gap of molecular crystals. We interpret the
observed yellow-green photoluminescence in rubrene microcrystals as a result of
the formation of intermolecular, charge-transfer spin-singlet excitons. In
contrast, spin-triplet excitons are localized and intramolecular with a
predicted phosphorescence at the red end of the optical spectrum. We find that
the exchange energy plays a fundamental role in raising the energy of
intramolecular spin-singlet excitons above the intermolecular ones. Exciton
binding energies are predicted to be around 0.5 eV (spin singlet) to 1 eV (spin
triplet). The calculated electronic gap is 2.8 eV. The theoretical absorption
spectrum agrees very well with recent ellipsometry data.
