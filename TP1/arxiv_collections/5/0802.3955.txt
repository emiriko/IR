Jet cross sections were measured in charged current deep inelastic e+-p
scattering at high boson virtualities Q^2 with the ZEUS detector at HERA II
using an integrated luminosity of 0.36 fb^-1. Differential cross sections are
presented for inclusive-jet production as functions of Q^2, Bjorken x and the
jet transverse energy and pseudorapidity. The dijet invariant mass cross
section is also presented. Observation of three- and four-jet events in
charged-current e+-p processes is reported for the first time. The predictions
of next-to-leading-order (NLO) QCD calculations are compared to the
measurements. The measured inclusive-jet cross sections are well described in
shape and normalization by the NLO predictions. The data have the potential to
constrain the u and d valence quark distributions in the proton if included as
input to global fits.
