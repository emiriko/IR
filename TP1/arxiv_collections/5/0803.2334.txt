Following the prescription of Ref. \cite{PST} in which perfect state
transference (PST) of a qubit over distance regular spin networks was
discussed, in this paper PST of an arbitrary $d$-level quantum state (qudit)
over antipodes of more general networks called pseudo distance-regular
networks, is investigated. In fact, the spectral analysis techniques used in
the previous work \cite{PST}, and algebraic structures of pseudo
distance-regular graphs are employed to give an explicit formula for suitable
coupling constants in the Hamiltonians so that the state of a particular qudit
initially encoded on one site will evolve freely to the opposite site without
any dynamical control, i.e., we show that how to derive the parameters of the
system so that PST can be achieved.
