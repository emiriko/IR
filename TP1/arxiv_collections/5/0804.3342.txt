On the basis of ab initio density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we
derive the underlying microscopic model Hamiltonian for TiOCl, a unique system
that shows two consecutive phase transitions from a Mott insulator to a
spin-Peierls insulator through a structurally incommensurate phase. We show
with our model that the presence of magnetic frustration in TiOCl leads to a
competition with the spin-Peierls distortion, which results in the novel
incommensurate phase. In addition, our calculations indicate that the
spin-Peierls state is triggered by adiabatic phonons, which is essential for
understanding the nature of the phase transition.
