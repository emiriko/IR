The before-before experiment demonstrates that quantum randomness can be
controlled by influences from outside spacetime, and therefore by immaterial
free will. Rather than looking at quantum physics as the model for explaining
free will, one should look at free will as a primitive principle for explaining
why the laws of Nature are quantum.
