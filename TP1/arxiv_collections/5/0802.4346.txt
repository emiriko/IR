The aim of this paper is to discuss some basic notions regarding generic
glass forming systems composed of particles interacting via soft potentials.
Excluding explicitly hard-core interaction we discuss the so called `glass
transition' in which super-cooled amorphous state is formed, accompanied with a
spectacular slowing down of relaxation to equilibrium, when the temperature is
changed over a relatively small interval. Using the classical example of a
50-50 binary liquid of N particles with different interaction length-scales we
show that (i) the system remains ergodic at all temperatures. (ii) the number
of topologically distinct configurations can be computed, is temperature
independent, and is exponential in N. (iii) Any two configurations in phase
space can be connected using elementary moves whose number is polynomially
bounded in N, showing that the graph of configurations has the `small world'
property. (iv) The entropy of the system can be estimated at any temperature
(or energy), and there is no Kauzmann crisis at any positive temperature. (v)
The mechanism for the super-Arrhenius temperature dependence of the relaxation
time is explained, connecting it to an entropic squeeze at the glass
transition. (vi) There is no Vogel-Fulcher crisis at any finite temperature T>0
