To provide a more accurate description of the driving behaviors in vehicle
queues, a namely Markov-Gap cellular automata model is proposed in this paper.
It views the variation of the gap between two consequent vehicles as a Markov
process whose stationary distribution corresponds to the observed distribution
of practical gaps. The multiformity of this Markov process provides the model
enough flexibility to describe various driving behaviors. Two examples are
given to show how to specialize it for different scenarios: usually mentioned
flows on freeways and start-up flows at signalized intersections. The agreement
between the empirical observations and the simulation results suggests the
soundness of this new approach.
