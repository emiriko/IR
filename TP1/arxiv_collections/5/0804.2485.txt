From the theory of quantum $LC$ circuits with discrete charge, and {\em
semiclassical} considerations, we obtain approximate energy eigenvalues,
depending on the parameter $q_e^2/h$. Next, we include electrical resistance
for the quantum $RLC$ circuit, obtaining a relation that strongly reminds us of
the Landauer formula.
