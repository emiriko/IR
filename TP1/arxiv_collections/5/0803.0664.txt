We study the coarsening dynamics of the three-dimensional random field Ising
model using Monte Carlo numerical simulations. We test the dynamic scaling and
super-scaling properties of global and local two-time observables. We treat in
parallel the three-dimensional Edward-Anderson spin-glass and we recall results
on Lennard-Jones mixtures and colloidal suspensions to highlight the common and
different out of equilibrium properties of these glassy systems.
