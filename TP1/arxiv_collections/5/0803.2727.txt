I show that the so-called causality paradox of time-dependent density
functional theory arises from an incorrect formulation of the variational
principle for the time evolution of the density. The correct formulation not
only resolves the paradox in real time, but also leads to a new expression for
the causal exchange-correlation kernel in terms of Berry curvature.
Furthermore, I show that all the results that were previously derived from
symmetries of the action functional remain valid in the present formulation.
Finally, I develop a model functional theory which explicitly demonstrates the
workings of the new formulation.
