We propose a survey of those oxadiazole compounds, which are mesogenic. We
will see that they can have bend-shaped molecules, a biaxial nematic phase, or
other interesting peculiarities in the nematic and smectic phase. With large
electric dipoles and luminescent properties, these materials are also very
appealing for technological applications.
