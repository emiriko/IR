String theory has been initially derived from motivations coming from strong
interaction phenomenology,but its application faced deep conceptual and
practical difficulties. The strong interactions found their theoretical
foundation elsewhere, namely on QCD, the quantum gauge field theory of quarks
and gluons. Recently, the Gauge/Gravity correspondence allowed to initiate a
reformulation of the connection between strings and gauge field theories,
avoiding some of the initial drawbacks and opening the way to new insights on
the gauge theory at strong coupling and eventually QCD. Among others, the
recent applications of the Gauge/Gravity correspondence to the formation of the
QGP, the quark-gluon plasma, in heavy-ion reactions seem to provide a
physically interesting insight on phenomenological features of the reactions.
In these lectures we will give a simplified introduction to those aspects of
string theory which, at the origin and in the recent developments, are
connected to strong interactions, for those students which are starting to
learn QCD and QGP physics from an experimental or phenomenological point of
view.
