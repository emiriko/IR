From a logic point of view this is the third in the series to solve the
problem of absence of detailed balance. This paper will be denoted as SDS III.
The existence of a dynamical potential with both local and global meanings in
general nonequilibrium processes has been controversial. Following an earlier
explicit construction by one of us (Ao, J. Phys. {\bf A37}, L25 '04,
arXiv:0803.4356, referred to as SDS II), in the present paper we show
rigorously its existence for a generic class of situations in physical and
biological sciences. The local dynamical meaning of this potential function is
demonstrated via a special stochastic differential equation and its global
steady-state meaning via a novel and explicit form of Fokker-Planck equation,
the zero mass limit. We also give a procedure to obtain the special stochastic
differential equation for any given Fokker-Planck equation. No detailed balance
condition is required in our demonstration. For the first time we obtain here a
formula to describe the noise induced shift in drift force comparing to the
steady state distribution, a phenomenon extensively observed in numerical
studies. The comparison to two well known stochastic integration methods, Ito
and Stratonovich, are made ready. Such comparison was made elsewhere (Ao, Phys.
Life Rev. {\bf 2} (2005) 117. q-bio/0605020).
