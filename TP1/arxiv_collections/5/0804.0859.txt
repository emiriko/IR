Dynamin is a ubiquitous GTPase that tubulates lipid bilayers and is
implicated in many membrane severing processes in eukaryotic cells. Setting the
grounds for a better understanding of this biological function, we develop a
generalized hydrodynamics description of the conformational change of large
dynamin-membrane tubes taking into account GTP consumption as a free energy
source. On observable time scales, dissipation is dominated by an effective
dynamin/membrane friction and the deformation field of the tube has a simple
diffusive behavior, which could be tested experimentally. A more involved,
semi-microscopic model yields complete predictions for the dynamics of the tube
and possibly accounts for contradictory experimental results concerning its
change of conformation as well as for plectonemic supercoiling.
