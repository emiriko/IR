We present a thermal activated solvent bonding technique for the formation of
embedded microstrucutres in polymer. It is based on the temperature dependent
solubility of polymer in a liquid that is not a solvent at room temperature.
With thermal activation, the liquid is transformed into a solvent of the
polymer, creating a bonding capability through segmental or chain
interdiffusion at the bonding interface. The technique has advantages over the
more commonly used thermal bonding due to its much lower operation temperature
(30 degrees C lower than the material's Tg), lower load, as well as shorter
time. Lap shear test indicated bonding shear strength of up to 2.9 MPa. Leak
test based on the bubble emission technique showed that the bonded microfluidic
device can withstand at least 6 bars (87 psi) of internal pressure (gauge) in
the microchannel. This technique can be applied to other systems of polymer and
solvent.
