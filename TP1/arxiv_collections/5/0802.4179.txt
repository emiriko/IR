The string relaxation equation (SRE) of the string model for the glass
transition contains the well-known Debye and Rouse-Zimm relaxation equations.
However, its initial condition, necessary to the model predictions of glassy
dynamics, such as the mechanism of the universal primary alpha- and
Johari-Goldstein beta-relaxations in glassformers, has not been solved. In this
paper, the special initial condition (SIC) of the SRE of straight strings for
dielectric spectrum technique, which is one of the most common methods to
measure the glassy dynamics, was tentatively calculated by a direct calculation
method, finding that the method has not any practical feasibility. However, a
recursive calculation method was developed that allows to obtain the SIC
exactly. It should be expected that the obtained SIC would benefit the thorough
solution of the general initial condition of the SRE of the string model for
stochastically spatially configurating strings, as will be described in
separate publications.
