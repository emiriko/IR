We show that conjugation by an automorphism of the complex numbers (as an
abstract field) may change the topological fundamental group of a locally
symmetric variety over C. As a consequence, we obtain a large class of
algebraic varieties defined over number fields with the property that different
embeddings of the number field into C give complex varieties with nonisomorphic
fundamental groups.
