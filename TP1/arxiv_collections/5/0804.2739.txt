The optical response of materials based on gold nanoparticle assemblies
depends on many parameters regarding both material morphology and light
excitation characteristics. In this paper, the interplay between the optical
and thermal responses of such media is particularly investigated under its
theoretical aspect. Both conventional and original modeling approaches are
presented and applied to concrete cases. We first show how the interaction of
light with matrix-embedded gold nanoparticles can result in the generation of
thermal excitations through different energy exchange mechanisms. We then
describe how thermal processes can affect the optical response of a
nanoparticle assembly. Finally, we connect both aspects and point out their
involvement in the nonlinear optical response of nanocomposite media. This
allows us to tackle two key issues in the field of third-order nonlinear
properties of gold nanoparticles: The influence of the generalized thermal lens
in the long laser pulse regime and the hot electron contribution to the gold
particle intrinsic third-order susceptibility, including its spectral
dispersion and intensity-dependence. Additionally, we demonstrate the possible
significant influence of the heat carrier ballistic regime and phonon
rarefaction in the cooling dynamics of an embedded gold nanoparticle subsequent
to ultrafast pulsed laser excitation.
