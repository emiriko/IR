We study the nonlinear dynamics of two delay-coupled neural systems each
modelled by excitable dynamics of FitzHugh-Nagumo type and demonstrate that
bistability between the stable fixed point and limit cycle oscillations occurs
for sufficiently large delay times and coupling strength. As the mechanism for
these delay-induced oscillations we identify a saddle-node bifurcation of limit
cycles.
