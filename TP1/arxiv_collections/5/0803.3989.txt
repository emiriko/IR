Amorphous chalcogenide thin film deposition can be achieved by a spin-coating
technique from proper solutions of the corresponding glass. Films produced in
this way exhibit certain grain texture, which is presumably related to the
cluster size in solution. This paper deals with the search of such a
correlation between grain size of surface morphology of as-deposited
spin-coated As33S67 chalcogenide thin films and cluster size of the glass in
butylamine solutions. Optical absorption spectroscopy and dynamic light
scattering were employed to study optical properties and cluster size
distributions in the solutions at various glass concentrations. Atomic force
microscopy is used to study the surface morphology of the surface of
as-deposited and thermally stabilized spin-coated films. Dynamic light
scattering revealed a concentration dependence of cluster size in solution.
Spectral-dependence dynamic light scattering studies showed an interesting
athermal photo-aggregation effect in the liquid state.
