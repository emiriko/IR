This article reviews the new developments in Tip-enhanced Raman scattering
(TERS). The fundamental mechanisms underlying the Raman enhancement are
discussed, including the role of the plasmonic character of the metallic tips,
the nature of the optical tip-sample coupling and the resulting local-field
confinement responsible for ultrahigh spatial resolution down to just several
nanometers. Criteria for the distinction of near-field signature from far-field
imaging artifacts are addressed and TERS results of molecules and
nanostructures are presented. With enhancement factors as high as 10$^9$,
single molecule spectroscopy is demonstrated. Spatially resolved vibrational
mapping of crystalline nanostructures and determination of crystallographic
orientation and domains is shown making use of the unique symmetry properties
of the tip in conjunction with the intrinsic Raman selection rules.
