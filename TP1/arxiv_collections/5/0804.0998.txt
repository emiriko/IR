The electric dipole moment (EDM) of paramagnetic atoms is sensitive to the
intrinsic EDM contribution from that of its constituent electrons and a
scalar--pseudo-scalar (S-PS) electron-nucleus interactions. The electron EDM
and the S-PS EDM contribution to atomic EDM scales as Z^3. Thus, the heavy
paramagnetic atomic systems will exhibit large enhancement factors. However,
the nature of the coupling is so small that it becomes an interest of high
precision atomic experiments. In this work, we have computed the EDM
enhancement factors of the ground states of Rb and Cs due to both the electron
EDM and the S-PS EDM using the relativistic coupled-cluster (RCC) theory. The
importance of obtaining the precise enhancement factors and the experimental
results in deducing a reliable limit on the electron EDM is emphasized.
