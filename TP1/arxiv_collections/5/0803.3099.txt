There are many different models of concurrent processes. The goal of this
work is to introduce a common formalized framework for current research in this
area and to eliminate shortcomings of existing models of concurrency. Following
up the previous research of the authors and other researchers on concurrency,
here we build a high-level metamodel EAP (event-action-process) for concurrent
processes. This metamodel comprises a variety of other models of concurrent
processes. We shape mathematical models for, and study events, actions, and
processes in relation to important practical problems, such as communication in
networks, concurrent programming, and distributed computations. In the third
section of the work, a three-level algebra of events, actions and processes is
constructed and studied as a new stage of algebra for concurrent processes.
Relations between EAP process algebra and other models of concurrency are
considered in the fourth section of this work.
