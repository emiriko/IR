We study theoretically the zero temperature phase transition in two
dimensions from a Fermi liquid to a paramagnetic Mott insulator with a spinon
Fermi surface. We show that the approach to the bandwidth controlled Mott
transition from the metallic side is accompanied by a vanishing quasiparticle
residue and a diverging effective mass. The Landau parameters $F^0_s, F^0_a$
also diverge. Right at the quantum critical point there is a sharply defined
`critical Fermi surface' but no Landau quasiparticle. The critical point has a
$Tln\frac{1}{T}$ specific heat and a non-zero $T = 0$ resistivity. We predict
an interesting {\em universal resistivity jump} in the residual resistivity at
the critical point as the transition is approached from the metallic side. The
crossovers out of the critical region are also studied. Remarkably the initial
crossover out of criticality on the metallic side is to a Marginal Fermi Liquid
metal. At much lower temperatures there is a further crossover into the Landau
Fermi liquid. The ratio of the two crossover scales vanishes on approaching the
critical point. Similar phenomena are found in the insulating side. The filling
controlled Mott transition is also studied. Implications for experiments on the
layered triangular lattice organic material $\kappa-(ET)_2Cu_2(CN)_3$ are
discussed.
