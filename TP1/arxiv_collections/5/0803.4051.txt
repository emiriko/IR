We present a method to compute pairing fluctuations on top of the Gutzwiller
approximation (GA). Our investigations are based on a charge-rotational
invariant GA energy functional which is expanded up to second order in the pair
fluctuations. Equations of motion for the fluctuations lead to a renormalized
ladder type approximation. Both spectral functions and corrections to static
quantities, like the ground-state energy, are computed. The quality of the
method is examined for the single-band Hubbard model where we compare the
dynamical pairing correlations for s- and d-wave symmetries with exact
diagonalizations and find a significant improvement with respect to analogous
calculations done within the standard Hartree-Fock ladder approximation. The
technique has potential applications in the theory of Auger spectroscopy,
superconductivity, and cold atom physics.
