We investigate the vector transition form factors of the nucleon and vector
meson K^* to the pentaquark baryon Theta^+ within the framework of the SU(3)
chiral quark-soliton model. We take into account the rotational 1/N_c and
linear $m_{\rm s}$ corrections, assuming isospin symmetry and employing the
symmetry-conserving quantization. It turns out that the leading-order
contributions to the form factors are almost cancelled by the rotational
corrections. Because of this, the flavor SU(3) symmetry-breaking terms yield
sizeable effects on the vector transition form factors. In particular, the main
contribution to the electric-like transition form factor comes from the
wave-function corrections, which is a consequence of the generalized
Ademollo-Gatto theorem derived in the present work. We estimate with the help
of the vector meson dominance the K^* vector and tensor coupling constants for
the Theta^+: $g_{K^{*}N\Theta}=0.74 - 0.87$ and $f_{K^{*}N\Theta}=0.53 - 1.16$.
We argue that the outcome of the present work is consistent with the null
results of the CLAS experiments in the reactions gamma n -> K^- Theta^+ and
gamma p ->bar{K}^0 Theta^+. The results of the present work are also consistent
with the recent experiments at KEK. In addition, we present the results of the
$\Sigma_{\bar{10}}\to N\bar{K}^*$ transition form factors and its
$\bar{K}^*N\Sigma_{\bar{10}}$ coupling constants.
