New data on the decays of the charmed particles $D^0$, $D^+$, and $D_s$ to
pairs of light pseudoscalar mesons $P$ allow the testing of flavor symmetry and
the extraction of key amplitudes. Information on relative strong phases is
obtained. One sees evidence for the expected interference between
Cabibbo-favored and doubly-Cabibbo-suppressed decays in the differing patterns
of $D^0 \to K_{S,L} \pi^0$ and $D^+ \to K_{S,L} \pi^+$ decays.
