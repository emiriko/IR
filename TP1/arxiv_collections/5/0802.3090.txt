Micro-scanners have been widely used in many optical applications. The
micro-scanner presented in this paper uses multimorph-type bending actuators to
tilt a square plate mirror. This paper presents a complete analytical model of
the piezoelectric micro-scanner. This theoretical model based on strength of
material equations calculates the force generated by the multimorphs on the
mirror, the profile of the structure and the angular deflection of the mirror.
The proposed model, used to optimize the design of the piezoelectric silicon
micro-scanner, is intended for further HDL integration, allowing in this way
system level simulation and optimization.
