Large black holes in an asymptotically AdS spacetime have a dual description
in terms of approximately thermal states in the boundary CFT. The reflecting
boundary conditions of AdS prevent such black holes from evaporating
completely. On the other hand, the formulation of the information paradox
becomes more stringent when a black hole is allowed to evaporate. In order to
address the information loss problem from the AdS/CFT perspective we then need
the boundary to become partially absorptive. We present a simple model that
produces the necessary changes on the boundary by coupling a bulk scalar field
to the evaporon, an external field propagating in one extra spatial dimension.
The interaction is localized at the boundary of AdS and leads to partial
transmission into the additional space. The transmission coefficient is
computed in the planar limit and perturbatively in the coupling constant.
Evaporation of the large black hole corresponds to cooling down the CFT by
transferring energy to an external sector.
