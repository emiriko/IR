The polemical term "interaction-free measurement" (IFM) is analyzed in its
interpretative nature. Two seminal works proposing the term are revisited and
their underlying interpretations are assessed. The role played by nonlocal
quantum correlations (entanglement) is formally discussed and some
controversial conceptions in the original treatments are identified. As a
result the term IFM is shown to be consistent neither with the standard
interpretation of quantum mechanics nor with the lessons provided by the EPR
debate.
