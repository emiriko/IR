Since the discovery of copper oxide superconductor in 1986 [1], extensive
efforts have been devoted to the search of new high-Tc superconducting
materials, especially high-Tc systems other than cuprates. The recently
discovered quaternary superconductor La[O1-xFx]FeAs with the superconducting
critical transition Tc of 26 K [2], which has a much simple layered structure
compared with cuprates, has attracted quick enthusiasm and is going to become a
new high-Tc system [3-6]. Here we report the discovery of bulk
superconductivity in the praseodymium-arsenide oxides Pr[O1-xFx]FeAs with an
onset drop of resistivity as high as 52 K, and the unambiguous zero-resistivity
and Meissner transition at low temperature, which will place these quaternary
compounds to another high-Tc superconducting system explicitly.
