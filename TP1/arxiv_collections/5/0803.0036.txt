The weak form factors of the nucleon, including the induced pseudoscalar form
factor and second class terms, are constrained using a microscopic calculation
of the weak capture process $^3He(\mu^{-},\nu_\mu)^3{H}$. The calculation is
parameter free, and yields a rate of 1499(16) Hz, in agreement with the
remarkable experimental measurement 1496(4) Hz. The nuclear wave functions are
obtained using the EIHH method with the Argonne V18 nucleon--nucleon potential
and the Urbana-IX three nucleon force. The weak currents in the nuclei are
described using HB$\chi$PT formalism. The induced pseudoscalar form factor is
found to agree with HB$\chi$PT prediction. The result is compatible with
vanishing second class currents, with the tightest constraint to date on the
conservation of vector current (CVC) hypothesis.
