A completely model-independent method of obtaining information on the spin
using the quantum interference effect among various helicity states was
proposed in a recent paper. Here we point out that this effect should be
demonstrable in the existing data on e^-e^+ \to W^+ W^- at LEP-II and p \bar{p}
\to Z^0 + j at Tevatron.
