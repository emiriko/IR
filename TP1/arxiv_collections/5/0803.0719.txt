General aspects of the Fluctuation-Dissipation Relation (FDR), and Response
Theory are considered. After analyzing the conceptual and historical relevance
of fluctuations in statistical mechanics, we illustrate the relation between
the relaxation of spontaneous fluctuations, and the response to an external
perturbation. These studies date back to Einstein's work on Brownian Motion,
were continued by Nyquist and Onsager and culminated in Kubo's linear response
theory.
  The FDR has been originally developed in the framework of statistical
mechanics of Hamiltonian systems, nevertheless a generalized FDR holds under
rather general hypotheses, regardless of the Hamiltonian, or equilibrium nature
of the system. In the last decade, this subject was revived by the works on
Fluctuation Relations (FR) concerning far from equilibrium systems. The
connection of these works with large deviation theory is analyzed.
  Some examples, beyond the standard applications of statistical mechanics,
where fluctuations play a major role are discussed: fluids, granular media,
nano-systems and biological systems.
