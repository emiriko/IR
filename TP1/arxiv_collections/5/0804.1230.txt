We report on the charge kinetics of La_2CuO_4 lightly doped with Li and Sr.
Impedance spectroscopy measurements down to 25mK and from 20Hz to 500kHz reveal
evidence for low energy charge dynamics, which slow down with decreasing
temperature. Both systems are acutely sensitive to stoichiometry. In the case
of Sr substitution, which at higher carrier concentration evolves to a high
temperature superconductor, the ground state in the pseudogap-doping regime is
one of spatially segregated, dynamic charge domains. The charge carriers slow
down at substantially lower temperatures than their spin counterparts and the
dynamics are particularly sensitive to crystallographic direction. This is
contrasted with the case of Li-doping.
