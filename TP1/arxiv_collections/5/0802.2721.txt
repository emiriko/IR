In this paper we prove the asymptotic formula for the moments of Minkowski
question mark function, which describes the distribution of rationals in the
Farey tree. The main idea is to demonstrate that certain a variation of a
Laplace method is applicable in this problem, hence the task reduces to a
number of technical calculations.
