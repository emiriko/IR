We consider the statistics of volume fluctuations in a one-dimensional
classical gas of non-interacting particles confined by a piston, and subjected
to an arbitrary external potential. We show that despite the absence of
interactions between particles, volume fluctuations of the gas are
non-Gaussian, and are described by generalized extreme value distributions. The
continuous shape parameter of these distributions is related to the ratio
between the force acting on the piston, and the force acting on the particles.
Gaussian fluctuations are recovered in the strong compression limit, when the
effect of the external potential becomes negligible. Consequences for the
thermodynamics are also discussed.
