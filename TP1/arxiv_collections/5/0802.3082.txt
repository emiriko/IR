Microtechnology becomes a versatile tool for biological and biomedical
applications. Microwells have been established long but remained
non-intelligent up to now. Merging new fabrication techniques and handling
concepts with microelectronics enables to realize intelligent microwells
suitable for future improved cancer treatment. The described technology depicts
the basis for the fabrication of a elecronically enhanced microwell. Thin
aluminium sheets are structured by laser micro machining and laminated
successively to obtain registration tolerances of the respective layers of
5..10\^A$\mu$m. The microwells lasermachined into the laminate are with
50..80\^A$\mu$m diameter, allowing to hold individual cells within the well.
The individual process steps are described and results on the microstructuring
are given.
