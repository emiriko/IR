In this paper we continue the work begun in 2002 on the identification of the
analytical expressions of Feynman integrals which require the evaluation of
multiple elliptic integrals. We rewrite and simplify the analytical expression
of the 3-loop self-mass integral with three equal masses and on-shell external
momentum. We collect and analyze a number of results on double and triple
elliptic integrals. By using very high-precision numerical fits, for the first
time we are able to identify a very compact analytical expression for the
4-loop on-shell self-mass integral with 4 equal masses, that is one of the
master integrals of the 4-loop electron g-2. Moreover, we fit the analytical
expressions of some integrals which appear in lattice perturbation theory, and
in particular the 4-dimensional generalized Watson integral.
