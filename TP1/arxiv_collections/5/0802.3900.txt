We examine the influence of quenched disorder on the superconductor-metal
transition, as described by a theory of overdamped Cooper pairs which repel
each other. The self-consistent pairing eigenmodes of a quasi-one dimensional
wire are determined numerically. Our results support the recent proposal by
Hoyos et al. (arXiv:0705.1865) that the transition is characterized by the same
strong disorder fixed point describing the onset of ferromagnetism in the
random quantum Ising chain in a transverse field.
