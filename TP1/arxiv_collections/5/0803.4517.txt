Our aim in this paper is to take quite seriously Heinz Post's claim that the
non-individuality and the indiscernibility of quantum objects should be
introduced right at the start, and not made a posteriori by introducing
symmetry conditions. Using a different mathematical framework, namely,
quasi-set theory, we avoid working within a
label-tensor-product-vector-space-formalism, to use Redhead and Teller's words,
and get a more intuitive way of dealing with the formalism of quantum
mechanics, although the underlying logic should be modified. Thus, this paper
can be regarded as a tentative to follow and enlarge Heinsenberg's suggestion
that new phenomena require the formation of a new "closed" (that is, axiomatic)
theory, coping also with the physical theory's underlying logic and
mathematics.
