A protocol is proposed to generate atomic entangled states in a cavity QED
system. It utilizes Raman transitions or stimulated Raman adiabatic passages
between two systems to entangle the ground states of two three-state
$\Lambda$-type atoms trapped in a single mode cavity. It does not need the
measurements on cavity field nor atomic detection and can be implemented in a
deterministic fashion. Since the present protocol is insensitive to both cavity
decay and atomic spontaneous emission, the produced entangled states may have
some interesting applications in quantum information processing.
