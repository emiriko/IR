The deposition of a metal on a foreign substrate is studied by means of grand
canonical Monte Carlo simulations and a lattice-gas model with pair potential
interactions between nearest neighbors. The influence of temperature and
surface defects on adsorption isotherms and differential heat of adsorption is
considered. The general trends can be explained in terms of the relative
interactions between adsorbate atoms and substrate atoms. The systems
Ag/Au(100), Ag/Pt(100), Au/Ag(100) and Pt/Ag(100) are analyzed as examples.
