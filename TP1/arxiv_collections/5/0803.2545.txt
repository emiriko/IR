In this paper I discuss some string inspired exotic colored matter particles
that could be produced at the LHC, as well as the experimental signature for
the observation of such states. Their most easily identifiable signature of
this scenario is that many of these exotic particles would decay into standard
model particles only via higher dimension operators in the effective field
theory at a TeV scale. Some of these particles would only have three body
decays into standard model particles.
