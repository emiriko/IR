Coupling of the quark-gluon plasma from the early stage of heavy-ion
collisions is argued to be weaker at LHC than at RHIC. For this reason, the
role of instabilities - the pre-equilibrium plasma is unstable with respect to
chromomagnetic modes - will be enhanced. The instabilities isotropize the
system and speed up the process of equilibration. A possibility to observe
direct signals of the instabilities is considered.
