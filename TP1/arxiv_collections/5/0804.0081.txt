If the LHC discovers a $Z'$-like state the extraction of its couplings to the
particles of the Standard Model becomes mandatory in order to determine the
nature of the underlying new physics theory. It has been well-known for some
time that the direct measurements performed at the LHC in the Drell-Yan channel
cannot determine these parameters uniquely in a model-independent manner even
if large integrated luminosities, $\sim 100 fb^{-1}$, become available and the
$Z'$ is relatively light $\lsim 1.5$ TeV. Here we examine the possibility that
a proposed $e_{L,R}^\pm p$ collider upgrade at the LHC, the LHeC, with $\sqrt
s=1.5-2$ TeV could be helpful with such coupling determinations in the years
before a Linear Collider is constructed. We show that the polarization and
charge asymmetries constructed from the cross sections for these processes can
be useful in this regard depending upon the specific values of the particular
$Z'$ model parameters.
