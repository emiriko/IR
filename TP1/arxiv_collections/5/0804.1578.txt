We observe a singularity in the temperature derivative $d\rho/dT$ of
resistivity at the Curie point of high-quality (Ga,Mn)As ferromagnetic
semiconductors with $T_c$'s ranging from approximately 80 to 185 K. The
character of the anomaly is sharply distinct from the critical contribution to
transport in conventional dense-moment magnetic semiconductors and is
reminiscent of the $d\rho/dT$ singularity in transition metal ferromagnets.
Within the critical region accessible in our experiments, the temperature
dependence on the ferromagnetic side can be explained by dominant scattering
from uncorrelated spin fluctuations. The singular behavior of $d\rho/dT$ on the
paramagnetic side points to the important role of short-range correlated spin
fluctuations.
