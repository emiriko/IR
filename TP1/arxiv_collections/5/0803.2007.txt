I present an experimental realization of a coherent-feedback control system
that was recently proposed for testing basic principles of linear quantum
stochastic control theory [M. R. James, H. I. Nurdin and I. R. Petersen, to
appear in IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control (2008),
arXiv:quant-ph/0703150v2]. For a dynamical plant consisting of an optical
ring-resonator, I demonstrate ~ 7 dB broadband disturbance rejection of
injected laser signals via all-optical feedback with a tailored dynamic
compensator. Comparison of the results with a transfer function model pinpoints
critical parameters that determine the coherent-feedback control system's
performance.
