We study the dimensional dependence of the interplay between correlation and
disorder in two dimension at half filling using 2D $t-t'$ disordered Hubbard
model with deterministic disorder both at zero and finite temperatures.
Inclusion of $t'$ without disorder leads to a metallic phase at half filling
below a certain critical value of $U$. Above this critical value $U_c$
correlation favours antiferromagnetic phase. Since disorder leads to double
occupancy over the lower energy site, the competition between Hubbard $U$ and
disorder leads to the emergence of a metallic phase, which can be quantified by
the calculation of Kubo conductivity, gap at half-filling, density of states,
spin order parameter, Inverse participation ratio (IPR) and bandwidth. We have
studied the effect of disorder on the system in a very novel way through a
deterministic disorder which follows a Fibonacci sequence. Behaviour of
different parameters show interesting features on going from a two to quasi one
dimensional system.
