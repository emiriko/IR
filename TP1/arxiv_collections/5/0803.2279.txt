Electronic transport through a single-wall metallic carbon nanotube weakly
coupled to one ferromagnetic and one nonmagnetic lead is analyzed in the
sequential tunneling limit. It is shown that both the spin and charge currents
flowing through such systems are highly asymmetric with respect to the bias
reversal. As a consequence, nanotubes coupled to one nonmagnetic and one
ferromagnetic lead can be effectively used as spin diodes whose functionality
can be additionally controlled by a gate voltage.
