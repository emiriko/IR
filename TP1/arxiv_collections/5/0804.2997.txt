We calculate the helicity and polarization correlation functions in the
Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen-type experiments with relativistic vector bosons. We
show that the linear polarization correlation function in the appriopriately
chosen state in the massless limit is the same as the correlation function in
the scalar two-photon state. We show also that the polarization correlation
function violate the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality and that the degree
of this violation can increase with the particle momentum.
