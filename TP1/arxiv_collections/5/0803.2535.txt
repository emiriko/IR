The processes of merging and splitting dilute-gas Bose-Einstein condensates
are studied in the nonadiabatic, high-density regime. Rich dynamics are found.
Depending on the experimental parameters, uniform soliton trains containing
more than ten solitons or the formation of a high-density bulge as well as
quantum (or dispersive) shock waves are observed experimentally within merged
BECs. Our numerical simulations indicate the formation of many vortex rings. In
the case of splitting a BEC, the transition from sound-wave formation to
dispersive shock-wave formation is studied by use of increasingly stronger
splitting barriers. These experiments realize prototypical dispersive shock
situations.
