The angular motion of a few-body system is described with global vectors
which depend on the positions of the particles. The previous study using a
single global vector is extended to make it possible to describe both natural
and unnatural parity states. Numerical examples include three- and four-nucleon
systems interacting via nucleon-nucleon potentials of AV8 type and a 3$\alpha$
system with a nonlocal $\alpha\alpha$ potential. The results using the
explicitly correlated Gaussian basis with the global vectors are shown to be in
good agreement with those of other methods. A unique role of the unnatural
parity component, caused by the tensor force, is clarified in the $0^-_1$ state
of $^4$He. Two-particle correlation function is calculated in the coordinate
and momentum spaces to show different characteristics of the interactions
employed.
