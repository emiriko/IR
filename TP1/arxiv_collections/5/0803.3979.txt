A comparison is made of various searching procedures, based upon different
entanglement measures or entanglement indicators, for highly entangled
multi-qubits states. In particular, our present results are compared with those
recently reported by Brown et al. [J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 38 (2005) 1119]. The
statistical distribution of entanglement values for the aforementioned
multi-qubit systems is also explored.
