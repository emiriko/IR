For a symmetric bounded measurable function W on [0,1]^2, "moments" of W can
be defined as values t(F,W) indexed by simple graphs. We prove that every such
function is determined by its moments up to a measure preserving transformation
of the variables. This implies that the limit of a convergent dense graph
sequence is unique up to measure preserving transformation.
