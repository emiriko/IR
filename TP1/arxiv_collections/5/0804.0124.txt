We study a modification of the five-dimensional description of dynamical
electro-weak symmetry breaking inspired by the AdS/CFT correspondence.
Conformal symmetry is broken in the low-energy region near the IR brane by a
power-law departure from the pure AdS background. Such a modification--while
not spoiling the identification of the IR brane with the scale of confinement--
has a dramatic effect on both the coupling of the first composite states to the
standard model currents and their self-couplings. Chiral symmetry breaking can
take place at a scale larger than the IR cut-off. This study shows that
observables, such as the precision parameter $\hat{S}$, which depend on the
couplings of the lightest composite states to the currents are very sensitive
to the details of the dynamics in the low energy region where conformal
symmetry is lost and electro-weak symmetry is broken just above the scale of
confinement. Therefore results of calculations of these observables in AdS/CFT
inspired scenarios should be interpreted conservatively. The most important
phenomenological consequence for physics at the LHC is that the bound on the
mass scale of the heavy excitations (technirho mesons) in a realistic model is
in general lower than in the pure AdS background with a simple hard-wall cut
off in the IR.
