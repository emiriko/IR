The energy spectra of mesoscopic, i.e. few-body quantum systems are of great
interest in several areas of physics such as nuclear physics, cluster physics
or magnetism. One way to obtain an approximate spectrum is to diagonalize with
reduced but carefully chosen basis sets. In this Letter we propose for the case
of mesoscopic antiferromagnets to use the eigenstates of the rotational band
Hamiltonian for this purpose. These states are not only well adapted, they can
also be easily constructed.
