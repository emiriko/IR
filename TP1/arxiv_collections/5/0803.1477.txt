We prove some variants of the exponential formula and apply them to the
multivariate Tutte polynomials (also known as Potts-model partition functions)
of graphs. We also prove some further identities for the multivariate Tutte
polynomial, which generalize an identity for counting connected graphs found by
Riordan, Nijenhuis, Wilf and Kreweras and in more general form by Leroux and
Gessel, and an identity for the inversion enumerator of trees found by Mallows,
Riordan and Kreweras. Finally, we prove a generalization of Mobius inversion on
the partition lattice.
