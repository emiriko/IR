The divergence of the photon self - energy diagram in spinor quantum
electrodynamics in $(2+1)$ dimensional space time- $(QED_3)$ is studied by the
Pauli - Villars regularization and dimensional regularization. Results obtained
by two different methods are coincided if the gauge invariant of theory is
considered carefully step by step in these calculations.
