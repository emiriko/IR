The two-body open charm decays $Z^+(4430)\to D^{+}\bar{D}^{*0},
D^{*+}\bar{D}^{0}, D^{*+}\bar{D}^{*0}$ occur through the re-scattering
mechanism and their branching ratios are strongly suppressed if $Z^+(4430)$ is
a $D_1\bar D^*$ molecular state. In contrast, $Z^+(4430)$ falls apart into
these modes easily with large phase space and they become the main decay modes
if $Z^+(4430)$ is a tetraquark state. Experimental search of these two-body
open charm modes and the hidden charm mode $\chi_{cJ}\rho$ will help
distinguish different theoretical schemes.
