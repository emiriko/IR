We investigate repulsive Casimir force between slabs containing left-handed
materials with controllable electromagnetic properties. The sign of Casimir
force is determined by the electric and magnetic properties of the materials,
and it is shown that the formation of the repulsive force is related to the
wave impedances of two slabs. The sign change of the Casimir force as a
function of the distance is studied. Special emphasis is put on the restoring
Casimir force which may be found to exist between perfectly conducting material
and metamaterial slabs. This restoring force is a natural power for the system
oscillation in vacuum and also can be used for system stabilization.
