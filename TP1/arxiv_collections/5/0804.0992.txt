We consider the realization of quantum Fredkin gate with only linear optics
and single photons. First we construct a heralded Fredkin gate using four
heralded controlled-not (CNOT) gates. Then we simplify this method to a
post-selected one utilizing only two CNOT gates. We also give a possible
realization of this method which is feasible with current experimental
technology. Another post-selected scheme requires time entanglement of the
input photons but needs no ancillary photons.
