In [Gi3] Givental introduced and studied a space of formal genus zero
Gromov-Witten theories $GW_0$, i.e. functions satisfying string and dilaton
equations and topological recursion relations. A central role in the theory
plays the geometry of certain Lagrangian cones and a twisted symplectic group
of hidden symmetries. In this note we show that the Lagrangian cones
description of the action of this group coincides with the genus zero part of
Givental's quantum Hamiltonian formalism. As an application we identify
explicitly the space of $N=1$ formal genus zero GW theories with
lower-triangular twisted symplectic group modulo the string flow.
