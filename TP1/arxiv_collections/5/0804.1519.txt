Within the idealized scheme of a 1-dimensional Frenkel-Kontorova-like model,
a special "quantized" sliding state was found for a solid lubricant confined
between two periodic layers [PRL 97, 056101 (2006)]. This state, characterized
by a nontrivial geometrically fixed ratio of the mean lubricant drift velocity
<v_cm> and the externally imposed translational velocity v_ext, was understood
as due to the kinks (or solitons), formed by the lubricant due to
incommensuracy with one of the substrates, pinning to the other sliding
substrate. A quantized sliding state of the same nature is demonstrated here
for a substantially less idealized 2-dimensional model, where atoms are allowed
to move perpendicularly to the sliding direction and interact via Lennard-Jones
potentials. Clear evidence for quantized sliding at finite temperature is
provided, even with a confined solid lubricant composed of multiple (up to 6)
lubricant layers. Characteristic backward lubricant motion produced by the
presence of "anti-kinks" is also shown in this more realistic context.
