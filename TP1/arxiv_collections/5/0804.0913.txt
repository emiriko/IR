A simplified version of 3d BL theory is considered, which allows any number N
of M2 branes in d=11. The underlying 3-algebra structure is provided by
degenerate U(N) Nambu bracket [X,Y,Z] = tr(X) [Y,Z] + tr(Y) [Z,X] + tr(Z)
[X,Y], the corresponding f^{abcd} is not totally antisymmetric and extended
supersymmetry of the action remains to be checked. All the fields, including
auxiliary non-propagating gauge fields, are in adjoint representation of SU(N)
and the only remnant of 3-algebra structure is an octuple of gauge singlets,
acquiring vacuum expectation value in transition to D2 branes in d=10.
