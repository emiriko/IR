One of the basics tasks in computer systems is the control of access of
resources. Basically, there is a finite amount of resources that can be, for
example, the CPU, memory or I/O ports, and several processes requiring those
resources. If there is not enough resource in order to attend the demand, some
kind of control access has to be employed. In this work, recognizing the
resource sharing problem as a competition, we employ a simplified multiplayer
quantum game as an access controller. The proposed quantum game can be employed
in the architecture of quantum computers.
