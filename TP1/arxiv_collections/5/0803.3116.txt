We compute derived quantities for various values of the model parameter of
the Cornell potential model for the S-wave heavy quarkonia with radial quantum
numbers n=1, 2, and 3. Our results can be used to determine leading and
relative-order-v^2 nonrelativistic quantum chromodynamics matrix elements for
S-wave charmonia and bottomonia such as psi(2S), eta_c(2S), and Upsilon(nS) for
n=1, 2, and 3. These matrix elements will be essential ingredients for
resumming relativistic corrections to processes involving those S-wave heavy
quarkonium states.
