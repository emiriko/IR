Recent theoretical work has shown that radiation pressure effects can in
principle cool a mechanical degree of freedom to its ground state. In this
paper, we apply this theory to our realization of an opto-mechanical system in
which the motion of mechanical oscillator modulates the resonance frequency of
a superconducting microwave circuit. We present experimental data demonstrating
the large mechanical quality factors possible with metallic, nanomechanical
beams at 20 mK. Further measurements also show damping and cooling effects on
the mechanical oscillator due to the microwave radiation field. These data
motivate the prospects for employing this dynamical backaction technique to
cool a mechanical mode entirely to its quantum ground state.
