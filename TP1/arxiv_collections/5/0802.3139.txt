A Lagrangian study of two-dimensional turbulence for two different
geometries, a periodic and a confined circular geometry, is presented to
investigate the influence of solid boundaries on the Lagrangian dynamics. It is
found that the Lagrangian acceleration is even more intermittent in the
confined domain than in the periodic domain. The flatness of the Lagrangian
acceleration as a function of the radius shows that the influence of the wall
on the Lagrangian dynamics becomes negligible in the center of the domain and
it also reveals that the wall is responsible for the increased intermittency.
The transition in the Lagrangian statistics between this region, not directly
influenced by the walls, and a critical radius which defines a Lagrangian
boundary layer, is shown to be very sharp with a sudden increase of the
acceleration flatness from about 5 to about 20.
