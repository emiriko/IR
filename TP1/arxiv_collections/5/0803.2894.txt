We study the sizes and thermal properties of glueballs in a three dimensional
compact Abelian gauge model on improved lattice. We predict the radii of $\sim
0.60$ and $\sim 1.12$ in the units of string tension, or $\sim 0.28$ and $\sim
0.52$ fm, for the scalar and tensor glueballs, respectively. We perform a well
controlled extrapolation of the radii to the continuum limit and observe that
our results agree with the predicted values. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we
extract the pole-mass of the lowest scalar and tensor glueballs from the
temporal correlators at finite temperature. We see a clear evidence of the
deconfined phase, and the transition appears to be similar to that of the
two-dimensional XY model as expected from universality arguments. Our results
show no significant changes in the glueball wave functions and masses in the
deconfined phase.
