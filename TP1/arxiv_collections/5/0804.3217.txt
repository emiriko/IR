Gradual transformation of the epidermal stem cells to corneocytes involves a
chain of chronologically well-arranged events that mostly stimulated locally by
their neighbors. Cell diversity that observed during the differentiation
through the different epidermal cell layers included the consisted changes of
cell shape, intercellular contacts and proliferation. However, the most
dramatically these changes appeared at the molecular level through gene
expression, catalysis and intraprotein interactions. The proposed review
explains these changes by switching systemic transcription factors that unlike
their counterparts those role is limited to a contribution to gene expression
also prepare cells to the next step of differentiation via modification of the
chromatin pattern . Since primary epidermal keratinocytes are one of the most
easy available type of the stem cells, a better understanding of the epidermal
differentiation will benefit the research in the other areas by a discovery of
basic coordinating mechanisms that stand behind such distinct molecular events
as cell signaling and gene expression, and formulate basic principles for a
smart therapeutic correction of the metabolism.
