Hartle and Srednicki have suggested that standard quantum theory does not
favor our typicality. Here an alternative version is proposed in which
typicality is likely, Eventual Quantum Mechanics. This version allows one to
calculate normalized probabilities for alternatives obeying what I call the
Principle of Observational Discrimination, that each possible complete
observation or data set should uniquely distinguish one element from the set of
alternatives.
