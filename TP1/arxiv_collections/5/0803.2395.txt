Summary: In anticipation of the individualized proteomics era and the need to
integrate knowledge from disease studies, we have augmented our peptide
identification software RAId DbS to take into account annotated single amino
acid polymorphisms, post-translational modifications, and their documented
disease associations while analyzing a tandem mass spectrum. To facilitate new
discoveries, RAId DbS allows users to conduct searches permitting novel
polymorphisms. Availability: The webserver link is http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
/CBBResearch/qmbp/raid dbs/index.html. The relevant databases and binaries of
RAId DbS for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X are available from the same web page.
