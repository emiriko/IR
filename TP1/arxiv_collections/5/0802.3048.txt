Silicon-MEMS gyroscope is an important part of MEMS (Micro Electrical
Mechanical System). There are some disturb ignored in traditional gyroscope
that must be evaluated newly because of its smaller size (reach the level of
micron). In these disturb, the air pressure largely influences the performance
of MEMS gyroscope. Different air pressure causes different gas damping
coefficient for the MEMS comb linear vibration gyroscope and different gas
damping coefficient influences the quality factor of the gyroscope directive.
The quality factor influences the dynamic working bandwidth of the MEMS comb
linear vibration gyroscope, so it is influences the output characteristic of
the MEMS comb linear vibration gyroscope. The paper shows the relationship
between the air pressure and the output amplified and phase of the detecting
axis through analyzing the air pressure influence on the MEMS comb linear
vibration gyroscope. It discusses the influence on the frequency distribute and
quality factor of the MEMS comb linear vibration gyroscope for different air
pressure.
