We apply the fidelity metric approach to analyze two recently introduced
models that exhibit a quantum phase transition to a topologically ordered
phase. These quantum models have a known connection to classical statistical
mechanical models; we exploit this mapping to obtain the scaling of the
fidelity metric tensor near criticality. The topological phase transitions
manifest themselves in divergences of the fidelity metric across the phase
boundaries. These results provide evidence that the fidelity approach is a
valuable tool to investigate novel phases lacking a clear characterization in
terms of local order parameters.
