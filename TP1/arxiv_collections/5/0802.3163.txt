Anyons are particlelike excitations of strongly correlated phases of matter
with fractional statistics, characterized by nontrivial changes in the wave
function, generalizing Bose and Fermi statistics, when two of them are
interchanged. This can be used to perform quantum computations [A. Yu. Kitaev,
Ann. Phys. (N.Y.) 303, 2 (2003)]. We show how to simulate the creation and
manipulation of Abelian and non- Abelian anyons in topological lattice models
using trapped atoms in optical lattices. Our proposal, feasible with present
technology, requires an ancilla particle which can undergo single-particle
gates, be moved close to each constituent of the lattice and undergo a simple
quantum gate, and be detected.
