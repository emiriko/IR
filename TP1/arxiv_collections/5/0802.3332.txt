We describe a search underway for periodic gravitational waves from the
central compact object in the supernova remnant Cassiopeia A. The object is the
youngest likely neutron star in the Galaxy. Its position is well known, but the
object does not pulse in any electromagnetic radiation band and thus presents a
challenge in searching the parameter space of frequency and frequency
derivatives. We estimate that a fully coherent search can, with a reasonable
amount of time on a computing cluster, achieve a sensitivity at which it is
theoretically possible (though not likely) to observe a signal even with the
initial LIGO noise spectrum. Cassiopeia A is only the second object after the
Crab pulsar for which this is true. The search method described here can also
obtain interesting results for similar objects with current LIGO sensitivity.
