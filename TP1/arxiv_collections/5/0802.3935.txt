A detailed study of the electric field gradient (EFG) across the Pr1-xCaxMnO3
phase diagram and its temperature dependence is given. Clearly, distinct EFG
behaviours for samples outside/inside the charge order (CO) region are
observed. The EFG temperature dependence evidences a new phase transition
occurring over the broad CO region of the phase diagram. This transition is
discontinuous and occurs at temperatures between the charge ordering and the
Neel temperatures. The features observed in the EFG are associated with polar
atomic vibrations which eventually lead to a spontaneous local electric
polarization below CO transition.
