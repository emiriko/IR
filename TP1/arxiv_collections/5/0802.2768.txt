In this paper, we analyze vibration-assisted sequential tunneling (including
current-voltage characteristics and zero-frequency shot noise) through a
molecular quantum dot with two electronic orbitals asymmetrically coupled to
the internal vibration. We employ rate equations for the case of equilibrated
phonons, and strong Coulomb blockade. We find that a system with a strongly
phonon-coupled ground state orbital and weakly phonon-coupled excited state
orbital exhibits strong negative differential conductance; and it also shows
super-Poissonian current noise. We discuss in detail the reasons and conditions
for the appearance of negative differential conductance.
