We have measured the thermal conductivity of the one-dimensional (1D) S=1/2
Heisenberg antiferromagnetic spin system of Sr2Cu1-xPdxO3 single crystals
including nonmagnetic impurities of Pd2+. It has been found that the mean free
path of spinons along the 1D spin chain at low temperatures is very close to
the average length of finite spin chains between spin defects estimated from
the magnetic susceptibility measurements. This proves that the thermal
conduction due to spinons at low temperatures in Sr2CuO3 is ballistic as
theoretically expected [Zotos et al.: Phys. Rev. Lett. 55 (1997) 11029].
