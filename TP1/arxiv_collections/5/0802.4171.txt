We suggest a new approach for the automatic and fully numerical evaluation of
one-loop scattering amplitudes in perturbative quantum field theory. We use
suitably formulated dispersion relations to perform the calculation as a
convolution of tree-level amplitudes. This allows to take advantage of the
iterative numerical algorithms for the evaluation of leading order matrix
elements.
