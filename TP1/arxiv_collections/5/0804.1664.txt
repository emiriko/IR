The water-graphite interaction potential proposed recently (Gonz\'alez et
al.\emph{J. Phys. Chem. C} \textbf{2007}, \emph{111}, 14862), the three TIP$N$P
($N=3,\:4,\:5$) water-water interaction models, and basin-hopping global
optimization are used to find the likely candidates for the global potential
energy minima of (H$_{2}$O)$_{n}$ clusters with $n\leq21$ on the (0001)-surface
of graphite and to perform a comparative study of these minima. We show that,
except for the smaller clusters ($n<6$), for which ab-initio results are
available, the three water-water potential models provide mostly inequivalent
conformations. While TIP3P seems to favor monolayer water structures for
$n<18$, TIP4P and TIP5P favor bilayer or volume structures for $n>6$. These $n$
values determine the threshold of dominance of the hydrophobic nature of the
water-graphite interaction at the nanoscopic scale for these potential models.
