The nature of phase separation in $Pr_{0.5}Sr_{0.5}MnO_3$ has been probed by
linear as well as nonlinear magnetic susceptibilities and resistivity
measurements across the 2nd order paramagnetic to ferromagnetic transition
($T_C$) and 1st order ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic transition ($T_N$). We
found that the ferromagnetic (metallic) clusters, which form with the onset of
long-range order in the system at $T_C$, continuously decrease their size with
the decrease in temperature and coexist with non-ferromagnetic (insulating)
clusters. These non-ferromagnetic clusters are identified to be
antiferromagnetic. Significantly, it is shown that they do not arise because of
the superheating effect of the lower temperature 1st order transition. Thus
reveals unique phase coexistence in a manganite around half-doping encompassing
two long-range order transitions. Both the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic
clusters form at $T_C$ and persist much below $T_N$. Substitution of quenched
disorder (Ga) at Mn-site promotes antiferromagnetism at the cost of
ferromagnetism without adding any magnetic interaction or introducing any
significant lattice distortion. Moreover, increase in disorder decreases the
ferromagnetic cluster size and with 7.5% Ga substitution clusters size reduces
to the single domain limit. Yet, all the samples show significant short-range
ferromagnetic interaction much above $T_C$. Resistivity measurements also
reveal the novel phase coexistence identified from the magnetic measurements.
It is significant that, increase in disorder up to 7.5% increases the
resistivity of the low temperature antiferromagnetic phase by about four
orders.
