Gravitation is considered to be one of the four fundamental interactions in
nature. However, one has so far failed to observe the graviton, the quantum
particle that is believed to transmit the gravitational force at a distance -
the analogue to the photon in electromagnetism. Maybe it is now time to
re-evaluate the status of the gravitation as a fundamental interaction. Here,
we propose a completely new interpretation of gravitation. In this description
the gravitational force is no longer a fundamental force. It is an induced
force, a dispersion force, and the analogue to the Casimir force in
electromagnetism. The fundamental force is in our description a force between
particles with a parabolic interaction potential. In our model the nucleons are
made up from these particles. We find the retarded dispersion force between
these composite particles has the correct distance dependence, 1/r. If this
interpretation is correct it has a broad range of implications. Our view on the
fundamental concept mass is altered; our view on the expansion of the Universe
may change.
