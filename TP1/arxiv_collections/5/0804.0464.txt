Theoretical analysis is given for a two-photon subtraction from a continuous
wave (CW) squeezed vacuum with finite time separation between two detection
events. In the CW photon subtraction process, the generated states are
inevitably described by temporal mutimode states. Our approach is based on
Schr\"{o}dinger picture which provides mathematically simple forms and an
intuitive understanding of its multimode structure. We show that, in our
process, the photon subtracted squeezed vacuum is generated in two temporal
modes and one of these modes acts as an ancillary mode to make the other one a
large amplitude coherent state superposition.
