Population dynamics in weakly-excited clouds of ultracold $^{87}$Rb Rydberg
atoms were studied by means of trap loss, fluorescence detection, and state
dependent stimulated emission. Rydberg atoms were excited to various nl Rydberg
states via continuous two-photon excitation from a magneto-optical trap. A
stimulated emission probe laser was then used to bring the Rydberg atoms down
to the 6P$_{3/2}$ state, allowing state-dependent detection of the Rydberg
atoms. Measurements of trap loss and fluorescent emission reveal information
about the evolution of the Rydberg populations. In particular, population in
the initial Rydberg state quickly transfers to other Rydberg states by a
non-collisional mechanism, likely superradiant emission. The trap-loss
measurements are consistent with black-body ionization as the dominant loss
mechanism.
