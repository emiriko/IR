We explore the extended framework of the generalized quantum mechanics and
discuss various aspects of neighborhood in the construction of space in search
of origin of cosmological constant. We propose to expand definition of the
volume of the phase space in eight dimensions with an overall constraint in the
form of uncertainty relation as: $(\Delta p_{x}\Delta p_{y}\Delta p_{z}\Delta
E)(\Delta x\Delta y\Delta z\Delta t)\sim h^{4}$. We argue that the phase space
volume in the eight dimensions is an appropriate representation that it should
be, and the relation $(\Delta \Lambda)(\Delta V)\sim h$ again brings it down to
the reduced phase space.
