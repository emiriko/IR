After five years of operating, two Aerogel counters: A1 and A2, taking data
in Hall A at Jefferson Lab, suffered a loss of performance. In this note
possible causes of degradation have been studied. In particular, various
chemical and physical analyses have been carried out on several Aerogel tiles
and on adhesive tape in order to reveal the presence of contaminants.
