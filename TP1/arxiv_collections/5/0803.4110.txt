The dynamics of fermionic unparticles is developed from first principles. It
is shown that any unparticle, whether fermionic or bosonic, can be recast in
terms of a canonically quantized field, but with non-local interaction terms.
We further develop a possible gauge theory for fermionic unparticles. Computing
the consequent contribution of un-fermions to the $\beta$ function of the
theory, it is shown that this can be viewed as the sum of two contributions,
one fermion-like and the other scalar-like. However, if full conformal
invariance is imposed, the latter vanishes identically. We discuss the
consequences thereof as well as some general phenomenological issues.
