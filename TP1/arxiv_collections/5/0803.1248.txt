We define an analytic version of the graph property testing problem, which
can be formulated as studying an unknown 2-variable symmetric function through
sampling from its domain and studying the random graph obtained when using the
function values as edge probabilities. We give a characterization of properties
testable this way, and extend a number of results about ``large graphs'' to
this setting. These results can be applied to the original graph-theoretic
property testing.
