Given a set equipped with a transitive action of a group, we define the
notion of an almost invariant coloring of the set. We consider the mapping
class group orbit of a multicurve on a compact surface, and prove that in the
case of genus at least two, no such almost invariant coloring exists.
Conversely, in the case of a closed torus, one may find almost invariant
colorings using arbitrarily many colors.
