We calculate resonances which are formed by a particle in a potential which
is either Coulombian or quadratic when the particle is strongly coupled to a
massless boson, taking only two energy levels into consideration. From these
calculations we derive how the moving away of the particle from its attraction
center goes together with the energy lowering of hybrid states that this
particle forms with the field. We study the width of these states and we show
that stable states may also appear in the coupling.
