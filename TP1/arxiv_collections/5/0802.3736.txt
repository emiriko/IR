The mass of an electroweakly charged lepton consists of the two components of
electric and weak nature, and regardless of the difference in masses, all
leptons have an equal charge, the same charge radius as well as an identical
magnetic moment. Between these currents there appear the most diverse
connections, for example, in their interactions with an electroweak field of
spinless nuclei. We derive the united equations which relate the structural
parts of mass to charge, charge radius and magnetic moment of each lepton as a
consequence of the ideas of flavor symmetry laws. Therefore, these ideas
require the verification of the lepton universality from the point of view of a
constancy of the size implied from the multiplication of a weak mass of lepton
by its electric mass. Such a principle gives the possibility to define the
lepton weak masses. If this picture does not change, leptons universally
interact not only with the photon or the weak boson but also with any of the
corresponding types of gauge fields.
