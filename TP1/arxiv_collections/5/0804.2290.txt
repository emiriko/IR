While Ising-type interactions are ideal for implementing controlled phase
flip gates in one-way quantum computing, natural interactions between
solid-state qubits are most often described by either the XY or the Heisenberg
models. We show an efficient way of generating cluster states directly using
either the iSWAP gate for the XY model, or the $\sqrt{\rm SWAP}$ gate for the
Heisenberg model. Our approach thus makes one-way quantum computing more
feasible for solid-state devices.
