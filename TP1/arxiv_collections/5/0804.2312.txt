We present measurements of the local tunneling density of states in the low
temperature ordered state of PrFe4P12. The temperature dependencies of the
Fermi level density of states and of the integrated density of states at low
bias voltages show anomalies at T=6.5 K, the onset of multipolar ordering as
detected by specific heat and other macroscopic measurements. In the ordered
phase, we find a local density of states with a V-shape form, indicating a
partial gap opening over the Fermi surface. The size of the gap according to
the tunneling spectra is about 2 meV.
