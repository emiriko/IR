Twist grain boundaries are widely observed in lamellar phases of block
copolymers. A mesoscopic model of the copolymer is used to obtain stationary
configurations that include a twist grain boundary, and to analyze their
stability against long wavelength perturbations. The analysis presented is
valid in the weak segregation regime, and includes direct numerical solution of
the governing equations as well as a multiple scale analysis. We find that a
twist boundary configuration with arbitrary misorientation angle can be well
described by two modes, and obtain the equations for their slowly varying
amplitudes. The width of the boundary region is seen to scale as
$\epsilon^{-1/4}$, with $\epsilon$ being the dimensionless distance to the
order-disorder transition. We finally present the results of the linear
stability analysis of the planar boundary.
