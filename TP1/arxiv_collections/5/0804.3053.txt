A new release of the Monte Carlo program Herwig++ (version 2.2) is now
available. This version includes a number of improvements including: matrix
elements for the production of an electroweak gauge boson, W and Z, in
association with a jet; several new processes for Higgs production in
association with an electroweak gauge boson; and the matrix element correction
for QCD radiation in Higgs production via gluon fusion.
