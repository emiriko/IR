We consider a class of inhomogeneous media known as composite media that is
often encountered in experimental sciences and investigate the persistence
probability of a random walker in such a system. Analytical and numerical
results for the crossover time scales has been obtained for a composite system
with two homogeneous components and three homogeneous components respectively.
