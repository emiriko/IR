Atom optics, a field which takes much inspiration from traditional optics,
has advanced to the point that some of the fundamental experiments of quantum
optics, involving photon correlations, have found atomic analogs. We discuss
some recent experiments on atom bunching and anti-bunching as well as some
prospects for extending them to the field of many body physics.
