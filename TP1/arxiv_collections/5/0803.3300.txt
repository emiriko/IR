Elementary particles possess quantized values of charge and internal angular
momentum or spin. These characteristics do not change when the particles
interact with other particles or fields as long as they preserve their
entities. Quantum theory does not explain this quantization. It is introduced
into the theory a priori. An interacting particle is an open system and thus
does not obey conservation laws. However, an open system may create dynamically
stable states with unchanged dynamical variables via self-organization. In
self-organized systems stability is achieved through the interplay of
nonlinearity and dissipation. Can self-organization be responsible for particle
formation? In this paper we develop and analyze a particle model based on
qualitative dynamics and the Feigenbaum universality. This model demonstrates
that elementary particles can be described as self-organized dynamical systems
belonging to a wide class of systems characterized by a hierarchy of
period-doubling bifurcations. This semi-qualitative heuristic model gives
possible explanations for charge and action quantization, and the origination
and interrelation between the strong, weak, and electromagnetic forces, as well
as SU(2) symmetry. It also provides a basis for particle taxonomy endorsed by
the Standard Model. The key result is the discovery that the Planck constant is
intimately related to elementary charge.
