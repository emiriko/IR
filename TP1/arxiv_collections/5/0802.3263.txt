It has been shown that 5-dimensional general relativity action extended by
appropriate quadratic terms admits a singular superconducting cosmic string
solution. We search for cosmic strings endowed with similar and extended
physical properties by directly integrating the non-linear matrix field
equations thus avoiding the perturbative approach by which we constructed the
above-mentioned \textsl{exact} solution. The most general superconducting
cosmic string, subject to some constraints, will be derived and shown to be
mathematically \textsl{unique} up to linear coordinate transformations mixing
its Killing vectors. The most general solution, however, is not globally
equivalent to the old one due to the existence of Killing vectors with closed
orbits.
