We show that the optical transparency of suspended graphene is defined by the
fine structure constant, alpha, the parameter that describes coupling between
light and relativistic electrons and is traditionally associated with quantum
electrodynamics rather than condensed matter physics. Despite being only one
atom thick, graphene is found to absorb a significant (pi times alpha=2.3%)
fraction of incident white light, which is a consequence of graphene's unique
electronic structure. This value translates into universal dynamic conductivity
G =e^2/4h_bar within a few percent accuracy.
