We study NbTiN resonators by measurements of the temperature dependent
resonance frequency and frequency noise. Additionally, resonators are studied
covered with SiOx dielectric layers of various thicknesses. The resonance
frequency develops a non-monotonic temperature dependence with increasing SiOx
layer thickness. The increase in the noise is independent of the SiOx
thickness, demonstrating that the noise is not dominantly related to the low
temperature resonance frequency deviations.
