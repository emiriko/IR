We introduce the no-core full configuration (NCFC) approach and present
results for $^4$He, $^{12}$C and $^{14}$F with the realistic NN interaction,
JISP16. We obtain ground state energies and their uncertainties through
exponential extrapolations that we demonstrate are reliable in $^4$He where
fully converged results are obtained. We find $^{12}$C is overbound by 1.7 MeV
and we predict the yet-to-be-measured binding energy of $^{14}$F to be $68.1
\pm 2.7$ MeV. The extrapolated spectrum of $^{14}$F is in reasonable agreement
with known features of the $^{14}$B spectrum.
