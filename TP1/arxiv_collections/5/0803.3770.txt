In their ground states, atomic nuclei are quantum Fermi liquids. At finite
temperatures and low densities, these nuclei may undergo a phase change similar
to, but substantially different from, a classical liquid gas phase transition.
As in the classical case, temperature is the control parameter while density
and pressure are the conjugate variables. At variance with the classical case,
in the nucleus the difference between the proton and neutron concentrations
acts as an additional order parameter, for which the symmetry potential is the
conjugate variable. Different ratios of the neutron to proton concentrations
lead to different critical points for the phase transition. This is analogous
to the phase transitions occurring in $^{4}$He-$^{3}$He liquid mixtures. We
present experimental results which reveal the N/Z dependence of the phase
transition and discuss possible implications of these observations in terms of
the Landau Free Energy description of critical phenomena.
