We observed a strong modulation in the current-voltage characteristics of
SrRuO$_3$/Nb:SrTiO$_3$ Schottky junctions by Mn substitution in SrRuO$_3$,
which induces a metal-insulator transition in bulk. The temperature dependence
of the junction ideality factor indicates an increased spatial inhomogeneity of
the interface potential with substitution. Furthermore, negative differential
resistance was observed at low temperatures, indicating the formation of a
resonant state by Mn substitution. By spatially varying the position of the Mn
dopants across the interface with single unit cell control, we can isolate the
origin of this resonant state to the interface SrRuO$_3$ layer. These results
demonstrate a conceptually different approach to controlling interface states
by utilizing the highly sensitive response of conducting perovskites to
impurities.
