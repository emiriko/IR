In this paper, we present a novel dual gap tuneable capacitor process based
on the profile of the sacrificial layer. This profile involves a tri-layer
photo-resist process with only one mask level. This realization is based on a
special profile of the sacrificial layer designed by two picks. The mechanism
of the sacrificial layer realisation is dependent on resist thickness, resist
formulation (viscosity, type of polymer and/or solvent, additives...), design
of the patterned layer (size or width) and the conditions under which this
layer is prepared: thermal treatment, etch back processes... In this
communication we demonstrate influence of the later parameters and discuss how
a dual pick profile was achieved.
