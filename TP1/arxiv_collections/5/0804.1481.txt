We apply the model introduced in Phys. Rev. B 75, 064202 (2007),
cond-mat/0610469, to calculate the anisotropy effect in the interaction of two
level systems with phonons in disordered crystals. We particularize our
calculations to cubic crystals and compare them with the available experimental
data to extract the parameters of the model. With these parameters we calculate
the interaction of the dynamical defects in the disordered crystal with phonons
(or sound waves) propagating along other crystalographic directions, providing
in this way a method to investigate if the anisotropy comes from the two-level
systems being preferably oriented in a certain direction or solely from the
lattice anisotropy with the two-level systems being isotropically oriented.
