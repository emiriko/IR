Consider the set Q of quantum correlation vectors for two observers, each
with two possible binary measurements. Quadric (hyperbolic) inequalities which
are satisfied by every vector in Q are proved, and equality holds on a two
dimensional manifold consisting of the local boxes, and all the quantum
correlation vectors that maximally violate the Clauser, Horne, Shimony, and
Holt (CHSH) inequality. The quadric inequalities are tightly related to CHSH,
they are their iterated versions (equation 20). Consequently, it is proved that
Q is contained in a hyperbolic cube whose axes lie along the non-local
(Popescu, Rohrlich) boxes. As an application, a tight constraint on the rate of
local boxes that must be present in every quantum correlation is derived. The
inequalities allow testing the validity of quantum mechanics on the basis of
data available from experiments which test the violation of CHSH. It is noted
how these results can be generalized to the case of n sites, each with two
possible binary measurements.
