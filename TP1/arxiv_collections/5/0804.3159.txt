We introduce a suit of simple entangling protocols for generating tripartite
GHZ and W states in systems with anisotropic exchange interaction
g(XX+YY)+g'ZZ. An interesting example is provided by macroscopic entanglement
in Josephson phase qubits with capacitive (g'=0) and inductive (0<|g'/g|<0.1)
couplings.
