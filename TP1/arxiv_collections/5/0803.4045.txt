To describe the ground (gr) and excited states of even-even deformed nuclei
with the phenomenological model, which takes into account the mixing ground
$(gr)$, $0^{+}_{2}(\beta_1)$--, $0^{+}_{3}(\beta_2)$--,
$2^{+}_{1}(\gamma_1)$--, $2^{+}_{2}(\gamma_2)$-- and $K^{\pi}=1^{+}_{\nu}$
rotational bands the calculation has been done for the isotope $^{172}Yb$. The
energy specterum is described. The reduced probability of electric quadrupole,
monopole and dipole magnetic transitions from the states $0^{+}_{\nu}$ and
$2^{+}_{\nu}$ - bands to the ground $(gr)$ state band is calculated. A non
adiabatic effect in the energy and electromagnetic characteristics is
discussed.
