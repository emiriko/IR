The derivative of the associated Legendre function of the first kind of
integer degree with respect to its order, $\partial
P_{n}^{\mu}(z)/\partial\mu$, is studied. After deriving and investigating
general formulas for $\mu$ arbitrary complex, a detailed discussion of
$[\partial P_{n}^{\mu}(z)/\partial\mu]_{\mu=\pm m}$, where $m$ is a
non-negative integer, is carried out. The results are applied to obtain several
explicit expressions for the associated Legendre function of the second kind of
integer degree and order, $Q_{n}^{\pm m}(z)$. In particular, we arrive at
formulas which generalize to the case of $Q_{n}^{\pm m}(z)$ ($0\leqslant
m\leqslant n$) the well-known Christoffel's representation of the Legendre
function of the second kind, $Q_{n}(z)$. The derivatives $[\partial^{2}
P_{n}^{\mu}(z)/\partial\mu^{2}]_{\mu=m}$, $[\partial
Q_{n}^{\mu}(z)/\partial\mu]_{\mu=m}$ and $[\partial
Q_{-n-1}^{\mu}(z)/\partial\mu]_{\mu=m}$, all with $m>n$, are also evaluated.
