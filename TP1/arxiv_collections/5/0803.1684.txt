We give a derivation of the Einstein equation for gravity which employs a
definition of the local energy density of the gravitational field as a
symmetric second rank tensor whose value for each observer gives the trace of
the spatial part of the energy-stress tensor as seen by that observer. We give
a physical motivation for this choice using light pressure.
