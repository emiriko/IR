A general approach for the description of spin systems on hierarchial
lattices with coordination number $q$ as a dynamical variable is proposed. The
ferromagnetic Ising model on the Bethe lattice was studied as a simple example
demonstrating our method. The annealed and partly annealed versions of disorder
concerned with the lattice coordination number are invented and discussed.
Recurrent relations are obtained for the evaluation of magnetization. The
magnetization is calculated for the particular disorder choices, $q=2,3$ and
$q=3,4$. A nontrivial localization of critical point is revealed.
