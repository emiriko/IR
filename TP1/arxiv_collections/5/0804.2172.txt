In two recent reactions by Belle producing $D\bar D$ and $D\bar D^*$ meson
pairs, peaks above threshold have been measured in the differential cross
sections, possibly indicating new resonances in these channels. We want to
study such reactions from the point of view that the $D$ meson pairs are
produced from already known or predicted resonances below threshold. Our study
shows that the peak in the $D\bar D^*$ production is not likely to be caused by
the X(3872) resonance, but the peak seen in $D\bar D$ invariant mass can be
well described if the $D\bar D$ pair comes from the already predicted scalar
X(3700) resonance.
