At certain quantum critical points in metals an entire Fermi surface may
disappear. A crucial question is the nature of the electronic excitations at
the critical point. Here we provide arguments showing that at such quantum
critical points the Fermi surface remains sharply defined even though the
Landau quasiparticle is absent. The presence of such a critical Fermi surface
has a number of consequences for the universal phenomena near the quantum
critical point which are discussed. In particular the structure of scaling of
the universal critical singularities can be significantly modified from more
familiar criticality. Scaling hypotheses appropriate to a critical fermi
surface are proposed. Implications for experiments on heavy fermion critical
points are discussed. Various phenomena in the normal state of the cuprates are
also examined from this perspective. We suggest that a phase transition that
involves a dramatic reconstruction of the Fermi surface might underlie a number
of strange observations in the metallic states above the superconducting dome.
