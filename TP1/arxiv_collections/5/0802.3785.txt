We present an analysis designed to search for Lorentz and CPT violations as
predicted by the SME framework using the charged current neutrino events in the
MINOS near detector. In particular we develop methods to identify periodic
variations in the normalized number of charged current neutrino events as a
function of sidereal phase. To test these methods, we simulated a set of 1,000
experiments without Lorentz and CPT violation signals using the standard MINOS
Monte Carlo. We performed an FFT on each of the simulated experiments to find
the distribution of powers in the sidereal phase diagram without a signal. We
then injected a signal of increasing strength into the sidereal neutrino
oscillation probability until we found a 5$\sigma$ deviation from the mean in
the FFT power spectrum. By this method, we can establish upper limits for the
Lorentz and CPT violating terms in the SME.
