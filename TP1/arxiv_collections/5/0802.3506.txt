We solve the (2+1)D nonlinear Helmholtz equation (NLH) for input beams that
collapse in the simpler NLS model. Thereby, we provide the first ever numerical
evidence that nonparaxiality and backscattering can arrest the collapse. We
also solve the (1+1)D NLH and show that solitons with radius of only half the
wavelength can propagate over forty diffraction lengths with no distortions. In
both cases we calculate the backscattered field, which has not been done
previously. Finally, we compute the dynamics of counter-propagating solitons
using the NLH model, which is more comprehensive than the previously used
coupled NLS model.
