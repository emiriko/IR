We investigate two-magnon Raman scattering from the $S=1/2$ Heisenberg
antiferromagnet on the triangular lattice, considering both the effect of
renormalization of the one-magnon spectrum by 1/S corrections and final-state
magnon-magnon interactions. The bare Raman intensity displays two peaks related
to one-magnon van-Hove singularities. We find that 1/S self-energy corrections
to the one-magnon spectrum strongly modify this intensity profile. The central
Raman-peak is significantly enhanced due to plateaus in the magnon dispersion,
the high frequency peak is suppressed due to magnon damping, and the overall
spectral support narrows considerably. Additionally we investigate final-state
interactions by solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation to $O(1/S)$. In contrast to
collinear antiferromagnets, the non-collinear nature of the magnetic ground
state leads to an irreducible magnon scattering which is retarded and
non-separable already to lowest order. We show that final-state interactions
lead to a rather broad Raman-continuum centered around approximately twice the
'roton'-energy. We also discuss the dependence on the scattering geometry.
