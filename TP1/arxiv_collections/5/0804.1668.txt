The asymptotic behavior of open plane sections of triply periodic surfaces is
dictated, for an open dense set of plane directions, by an integer second
homology class of the three-torus. The dependence of this homology class on the
direction can have a rather rich structure, leading in special cases to a
fractal. In this paper we present in detail the results for the skew polyhedron
{4,6|4} and in particular we show that in this case a fractal arises and that
such a fractal can be generated through an elementary algorithm, which in turn
allows us to verify for this case a conjecture of S.P.Novikov that such
fractals have zero measure.
