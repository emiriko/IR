Introducing an H-Hopf algebroid structure into U_{q,p}(\widedhat{sl}_2), we
investigate the vertex operators of the elliptic quantum group
U_{q,p}(\widedhat{sl}_2) defined as intertwining operators of infinite
dimensional U_{q,p}(\widedhat{sl}_2)-modules. We show that the vertex operators
coincide with the previous results obtained indirectly by using the quasi-Hopf
algebra B_{q,\lambda}(\hat{sl}_2). This shows a consistency of our H-Hopf
algebroid structure even in the case with non-zero central element.
