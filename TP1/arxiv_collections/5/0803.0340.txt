We investigate dynamic creation of fractionalized half-quantum vortices in
Bose-Einstein condensates of sodium atoms. Our simulations show that both
individual half-quantum vortices and vortex lattices can be created in rotating
optical traps when additional pulsed magnetic trapping potentials are applied.
We also find that a distinct periodically modulated spin-density-wave spatial
structure is always embedded in square half-quantum vortex lattices; this
structure can be conveniently probed by taking absorption images of
ballistically expanding cold atoms in a Stern-Gerlach field.
