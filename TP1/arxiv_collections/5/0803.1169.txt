In this paper we reconsider the Mass Action Law (MAL) for the anomalous
reversible reaction $A\rightleftarrows B$ with diffusion. We provide a
mesoscopic description of this reaction when the transitions between two states
$A$ and $B$ are governed by anomalous (heavy-tailed) waiting-time
distributions. We derive the set of mesoscopic integro-differential equations
for the mean densities of reacting and diffusing particles in both states. We
show that the effective reaction rate memory kernels in these equations and the
uniform asymptotic states depend on transport characteristics such as jumping
rates. This is in contradiction with the classical picture of MAL. We find that
transport can even induce an extinction of the particles such that the density
of particles $A$ or $B$ tends asymptotically to zero. We verify analytical
results by Monte Carlo simulations and show that the mesoscopic densities
exhibit a transient growth before decay.
