We quantize an inhomogeneous cosmological model using techniques that include
polymeric quantization. More explicitly, we construct well defined operators to
represent the constraints and find the physical Hilbert space formed by their
solutions, which reproduces the conventional Fock quantization for the
inhomogeneities. The initial singularity is resolved in this inhomogeneous
model in an extremely simple way and without imposing special boundary
conditions, thus ensuring the robustness and generality of this resolution.
Furthermore this quantization constitutes a well founded step towards the
extraction of physical results and consequences from loop quantum cosmology,
given the central role of the inhomogeneities in modern cosmology.
