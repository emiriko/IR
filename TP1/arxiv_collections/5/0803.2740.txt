We argue that the newly discovered superconductivity in a nearly magnetic,
Fe-based layered compound is unconventional and mediated by antiferromagnetic
spin fluctuations, though different from the usual superexchange and specific
to this compound. This resulting state is an example of extended s-wave pairing
with a sign reversal of the order parameter between different Fermi surface
sheets. The main role of doping in this scenario is to lower the density of
states and suppress the pair-breaking ferromagnetic fluctuations.
