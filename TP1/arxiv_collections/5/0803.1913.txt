Within the context of earthquake-resistant design of shallow foundations, the
present study is concerned with the determination of the seismic bearing
capacity of a circular footing resting on the surface of a heterogene-ous
purely cohesive semi-infinite soil layer. In the first part of the paper, a
database, containing case histories of civil engineering structures that
sustained a foundation seismic bearing capacity failure, is briefly pre-sented,
aiming at a better understanding of the studied phenomenon and offering a
number of case studies useful for validation of theoretical computations. In
the second part of the paper, the aforementioned problem is addressed using the
kinematic approach of the Yield Design theory, thus establishing optimal upper
bounds for the ultimate seismic loads supported by the soil-footing system. The
results lead to the establishment of some very simple guidelines that extend
the existing formulae for the seismic bearing capacity contained in the
European norms (proposed for strip footings on homogeneous soils) to the case
of circular footings and to that of heterogeneous cohesive soils.
