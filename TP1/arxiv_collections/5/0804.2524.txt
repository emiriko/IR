The steady-state of a generalized coagulation-decoagulation model on a
one-dimensional lattice with reflecting boundaries is studied using a
matrix-product approach. It is shown that the quadratic algebra of the model
has a four-dimensional representation provided that some constraints on the
microscopic reaction rates are fulfilled. The dynamics of a product shock
measure with two shock fronts, generated by the Hamiltonian of this model, is
also studied. It turns out that the shock fronts move on the lattice as two
simple random walkers which repel each other provided that the same constraints
on the microscopic reaction rates are satisfied.
