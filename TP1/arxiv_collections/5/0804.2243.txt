Here we use highly sensitive magnetisation measurements performed using a
Hall probe sensor on single crystals of highly anisotropic high temperature
superconductors $Bi_{2}Sr_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{8}$ to study the dynamic interactions
between the two species of vortices that exist in such superconductors. We
observe a remarkable and clearly delineated high temperature regime that
mirrors the underlying vortex phase diagram. Our results map out the parameter
space over which these dynamic interaction processes can be used to create
vortex ratchets, pumps and other fluxonic devices.
