Highly polarized mixtures of atomic Fermi gases constitute a novel Fermi
liquid. We demonstrate how information on thermodynamic properties may be used
to calculate quasiparticle scattering amplitudes even when the interaction is
resonant and apply the results to evaluate the damping of the spin dipole mode.
We estimate that under current experimental conditions, the mode would be
intermediate between the hydrodynamic and collisionless limits.
