We construct new explicit compact supersymmetric valid solutions with
non-zero field strength, non-flat instanton and constant dilaton to the
heterotic equations of motion in dimension six. We present balanced Hermitian
structures on compact nilmanifolds in dimension six satisfying the heterotic
supersymmetry equations with non-zero flux, non-flat instanton and constant
dilaton which obey the three-form Bianchi identity with curvature term taken
with respect to either the Levi-Civita, the (+)-connection or the Chern
connection. Among them, all our solutions with respect to the (+)-connection on
the compact nilmanifold $M_3$ satisfy the heterotic equations of motion.
