Here, we report the existence of large remnant polarization and dielectric
constant in PbTiO3 buffered polycrystalline (BiFeO_3)_{1-x} (PbTiO_3)_x thin
films of composition x = 0.25, 0.30 and 0.35 around the morphotropic phase
boundary. The films were deposited by chemical solution deposition on
platinized silicon substrates. Films reveal a perovskite structure with a
tendency to retain rhombohedral structure even at higher PbTiO_3 content than
that reported in bulk. We observe very large remnant polarization, ~75
microC/cm^2, and high dielectric constant, ~2400 at 1 kHz for x = 0.3, which
lies in the MPB composition range. The unbuffered films show less than 1
microC/cm^2 for the same composition.
