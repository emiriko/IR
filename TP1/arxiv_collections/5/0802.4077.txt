We give a practical method to exactly compute black hole entropy in the
framework of Loop Quantum Gravity. Along the way we provide a complete
characterization of the relevant sector of the spectrum of the area operator,
including degeneracies, and determine the number of solutions to the projection
constraint analytically. We use a computer implementation of the proposed
algorithm to confirm and extend previous results on the detailed structure of
the black hole degeneracy spectrum.
