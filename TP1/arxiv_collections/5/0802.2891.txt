Group theoretic method for the systematic study of five-quark states with
meson-baryon ($q\bar{q}-q^3$) configuration is developed. The calculation of
matrix elements of many body Hamiltonian is simplified by transforming the
physical bases (meson-baryon quark cluster bases) to symmetry bases (group
chain classified bases), where the fractional parentage expansion method can be
used. Three quark models, the naive Glashow-Isgur model, Salamanca chiral quark
model and quark delocalization color screening model, are used to show the
general applicability of the method and general results of constituent quark
models for five-quark states are given. The method can also be useful in the
calculation of meson-baryon scattering and the study of the five-quark
components effect in baryon structure. The physical contents of different model
configurations for the same multi-quark system can also be compared through the
transformation between different physical bases to the same set of symmetry
bases.
