An electronic band with quasi-one dimensional dispersion is found at the
interface between a monolayer of a charge-transfer complex (TTF-TCNQ) and a
Au(111) surface. Combined local spectroscopy and numerical calculations show
that the band results from a complex mixing of metal and molecular states. The
molecular layer folds the underlying metal states and mixes with them
selectively, through the TTF component, giving rise to anisotropic hybrid
bands. Our results suggest that, by tuning the components of such molecular
layers, the dimensionality and dispersion of organic-metal interface states can
be engineered.
