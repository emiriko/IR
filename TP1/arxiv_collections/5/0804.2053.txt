Here we report the superconductivity in the iron-based oxyarsenide
Sm[O1-xFx]FeAs, with the onset resistivity transition temperature at 55.0 K and
Meissner transition at 54.6 K. This compound has the same crystal structure as
LaOFeAs with shrunk crystal lattices, and becomes the superconductor with the
highest critical temperature among all materials besides copper oxides.
