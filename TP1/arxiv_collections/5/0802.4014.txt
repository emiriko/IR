We investigate phase-coherent transport in InN nanowires of various diameters
and lengths. The nanowires were grown by means of plasma-assisted molecular
beam epitaxy. Information on the phase-coherent transport is gained by
analyzing the characteristic fluctuation pattern in the magneto-conductance.
For a magnetic field oriented parallel to the wire axis we found that the
correlation field mainly depends on the wire cross section, while the
fluctuation amplitude is governed by the wire length. In contrast, if the
magnetic field is oriented perpendicularly, for wires longer than approximately
200 nm the correlation field is limited by the phase coherence length. Further
insight into the orientation dependence of the correlation field is gained by
measuring the conductance fluctuations at various tilt angles of the magnetic
field.
