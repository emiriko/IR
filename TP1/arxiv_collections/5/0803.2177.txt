The fractal structure of high-temperature graphs of the three-dimensional
Ising and XY models is investigated by simulating these graphs directly on a
cubic lattice and analyzing them with the help of percolation observables. The
Ising graphs are shown to percolate right at the Curie critical point. The
diverging length scale relevant to the graphs in the vicinity of the
percolation threshold is shown to be provided by the spin correlation length.
The fractal dimension of the high-temperature graphs at criticality is
estimated to be $D = 1.7349(65)$ for the Ising and $D = 1.7626(66)$ for the XY
model.
