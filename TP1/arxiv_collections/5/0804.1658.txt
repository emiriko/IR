If E is a non-isotrivial elliptic curve over a global function field F of odd
characteristic we show that certain Mordell-Weil groups of E have 1-dimensional
eigenspace relative to a fixed complex ring class character provided that the
projection onto this eigenspace of a suitable Drinfeld-Heegner point is
nonzero. This represents the analogue in the function field setting of a
theorem for rational elliptic curves due to Bertolini and Darmon, and at the
same time is a generalization of the main result proved by Brown in his
monograph on Heegner modules. As in the number field case, our proof employs
Kolyvagin-type arguments, and the cohomological machinery is started up by the
control on the Galois structure of the torsion of E provided by classical
results of Igusa in positive characteristic.
