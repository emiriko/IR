We performed a neutron-scattering experiment to investigate the effect of
distortion of CuO2 planes on the low-energy spin correlation of
La1.94-xSrxCe0.06CuO4 (LSCCO). Due to the carrier-compensation effect by
co-doping of Sr and Ce, LSCCO has a smaller orthorhombic lattice distortion
compared to La2-xSrxCuO4 (LSCO) with comparable hole concentration p. A clear
gap with the edge-energy of 6~7 meV was observed in the energy spectrum of
local dynamical susceptibility c"(w) for both x=0.18 (p~0.14) and x=0.24
(p~0.20) samples as observed for optimally-doped LSCO (x=0.15~0.18). For the
x=0.14 (p~0.10) sample, in addition to the gap-like structure in c"(w) we
observed a low-energy component within the gap which develops below 2~3meV with
decreasing the energy. The low-energy component possibly coincides with the
static magnetic correlation observed in this sample. These results are
discussed from a view point of relationship between the stability of low-energy
spin fluctuations and the distortion of CuO2 planes.
