The goal of this paper is to introduce ideas and methodology of the generic
case complexity to cryptography community. This relatively new approach allows
one to analyze the behavior of an algorithm on ''most'' inputs in a simple and
intuitive fashion which has some practical advantages over classical methods
based on averaging. We present an alternative definition of one-way function
using the concepts of generic case complexity and show its equivalence to the
standard definition. In addition we demonstrate the convenience of the new
approach by giving a short proof that extending adversaries to a larger class
of partial algorithms with errors does not change the strength of the security
assumption.
