We show how some classical r-matrices for the D=4 Poincare algebra can be
supersymmetrized by an addition of part depending on odd supercharges. These
r-matrices for D=4 super-Poincare algebra can be presented as a sum of the
so-called subordinated r-matrices of super-Abelian and super-Jordanian type.
Corresponding twists describing quantum deformations are obtained in an
explicit form. These twists are the super-extensions of twists obtained in the
paper arXiv:0712.3962.
