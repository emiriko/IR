A density-functional formalism for superconductivity {\em and} magnetism is
presented. The resulting relations unify previously derived Kohn-Sham equations
for superconductors and for non-collinear magnetism. The formalism, which
discriminates Cooper pair singlets from triplets, is applied to two quantum
liquids coupled by tunneling through a barrier. An exact expression is derived,
relating the eigenstates and eigenvalues of the Kohn-Sham equations,
unperturbed by tunneling, on one side of the barrier to the proximity-induced
ordering potential on the other.
