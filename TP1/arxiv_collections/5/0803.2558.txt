We have found an exact phase diagram of the Potts model with next nearest
neighbor interactions on the Bethe lattice of order two. The diagram consists
of five phases: ferromagnetic, paramagnetic, modulated, antiphase and
paramodulated, all meeting at the Lifshitz point i.e. $p=1/3$. We report on a
new phase which we denote as paramodulated, found at low temperatures and
characterized by 2-periodic points of an one dimensional dynamical system lying
inside the modulated phase. Such a phase, inherent in the Potts model has no
analogues in the Ising setting.
