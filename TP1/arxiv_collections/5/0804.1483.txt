Electron spin dynamics is investigated in n-i-n GaAs/AlGaAs coupled quantum
wells. The electron spin dephasing time is measured as a function of an
external electrical bias under resonant excitation of the 1sHH intrawell
exciton using a time-resolved Kerr rotation technique. It is found a strong
electron spin dephasing time anisotropy caused by an interference of the
structure inversion asymmetry and the bulk inversion asymmetry. This anisotropy
is shown to be controlled by an electrical bias. A theoretical analysis of
electron spin dephasing time anisotropy is developed. The ratio of Rashba and
Dresselhaus spin splittings is studied as a function of applied bias.
