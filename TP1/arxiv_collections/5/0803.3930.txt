Simple derivation of the classical generalized Moller-Wu-Lee transformations
from general master equation is presented.We will argue that in fact we can
implement Born's notion of rigid motion in both flat spacetime and arbitrary
curved non-holonomic spacetimes containing classical and Colombeau's
distributional sources.
