We have developed a method 'time-frequency (TF) clustering' to find the burst
gravitational waves for TAMA data analysis. TF clustering method on sonogram
(spectrogram) shows some characteristics of short duration signal. Using
parameters which represent the cluster shape, we can efficiently identify some
predicted gravitational wave forms and can exclude typical unstable spike like
noises due to detector instruments. The requirement of some parameters of
cluster achieved roughly 50% average efficiency for injected DFM waveforms of
$h_{rss}\sim 2 \times 10^{-19}$ for type I burst. Also the reduction for signal
by spike noises are more than one order improvement for the SNR$>$100.
