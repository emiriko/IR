Several cellular automata (CA) models have been developed to simulate
self-organization of multiple levels of structures. However, they do not obey
microscopic reversibility and conservation laws. In this paper, we describe the
construction of a reversible lattice molecular automata (RLMA) model, which
simulates molecular interaction and self-organization of higher-order
structures. The model's strict reversibility entails physically relevant
conservation laws, and thus opens a way to precise application and validation
of the methods from statistical physics in studying the necessary conditions
for such multiple levels of self-organization.
