We study the effects that the gravitational interaction of $f(R)$ theories of
gravity in Palatini formalism has on the stationary states of the Hydrogen
atom. We show that the role of gravity in this system is very important for
lagrangians $f(R)$ with terms that grow at low curvatures, which have been
proposed to explain the accelerated expansion rate of the universe. We find
that new gravitationally induced terms in the atomic Hamiltonian generate a
strong backreaction that is incompatible with the very existence of bound
states. In fact, in the 1/R model, Hydrogen disintegrates in less than two
hours. The universe that we observe is, therefore, incompatible with that kind
of gravitational interaction. Lagrangians with high curvature corrections do
not lead to such instabilities.
