Many mathematical models of physical phenomena that have been proposed in
recent years require more general spaces than manifolds. When taking into
account the symmetry group of the model, we get a reduced model on the
(singular) orbit space of the symmetry group action. We investigate
quantization of singular spaces obtained as leaf closure spaces of regular
Riemannian foliations on compact manifolds. These contain the orbit spaces of
compact group actions and orbifolds. Our method uses foliation theory as a
desingularization technique for such singular spaces. A quantization procedure
on the orbit space of the symmetry group - that commutes with reduction - can
be obtained from constructions which combine different geometries associated
with foliations and new techniques originated in Equivariant Quantization. The
present paper contains the first of two steps needed to achieve these just
detailed goals.
