We intend to demonstrate the innate problems with existing spreadsheet
products and to show how to tackle these issues using a new type of spreadsheet
program called Resolver. It addresses the issues head-on and thereby moves the
1980's "VisiCalc paradigm" on to match the advances in computer languages and
user requirements. Continuous display of the spreadsheet grid and the
equivalent computer program, together with the ability to interact and add code
through either interface, provides a number of new methodologies for
spreadsheet development.
