Sector decomposition is a constructive method to isolate divergences from
parameter integrals occurring in perturbative quantum field theory. We explain
the general algorithm in detail and review its application to multi-loop
Feynman parameter integrals as well as infrared divergent phase-space integrals
over real radiation matrix elements.
