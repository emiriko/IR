A detailed description of the CUORICINO $^{130}Te$ neutrinoless double-beta
($\nbb$) decay experiment is given and recent results are reported. CUORICINO
is an array of 62 tellurium oxide ($TeO_{2}$) bolometers with an active mass of
40.7 kg. It is cooled to $\sim 8-10$ mK by a dilution refrigerator shielded
from environmental radioactivity and energetic neutrons. It is running in the
Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso (LNGS) in Assergi, Italy. These data
represent an exposure of $11.83\textrm{kg}...\textrm{y}$ or 91 mole-years of
$^{130}Te$. No evidence for $\nbb$-decay was observed and a limit of
$T^{0\nu}_{1/2}(^{130}Te)\geq3.0\times10^{24}$ y (90% C.L.) is set. This
corresponds to an upper limit on the effective mass, $< m_{\nu}>$, between 0.19
and 0.68 eV when analyzed with the many published nuclear structure
calculations. In the context of these nuclear models, the values fall within
the range corresponding to the claim of evidence of $\nbb$-decay by H.V.

data.
