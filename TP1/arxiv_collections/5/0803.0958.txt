We present a measurement protocol for a flux qubit coupled to a
dc-Superconducting QUantum Interference Device (SQUID), representative of any
two-state system with a controllable coupling to an harmonic oscillator
quadrature, which consists of two steps. First, the qubit state is imprinted
onto the SQUID via a very short and strong interaction. We show that at the end
of this step the qubit dephases completely, although the perturbation of the
measured qubit observable during this step is weak. In the second step,
information about the qubit is extracted by measuring the SQUID. This step can
have arbitrarily long duration, since it no longer induces qubit errors.
