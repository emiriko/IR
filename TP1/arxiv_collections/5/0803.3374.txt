The supercooled state of bulk water is largely hidden by unavoidable
crystallization, which creates an experimentally inaccessible temperature
regime - a 'no man's land'. We address this and circumvent the crystallization
problem by systematically studying the supercooled dynamics of hydrogen bonded
oligomeric liquids (glycols), where water corresponds to the chain-ends alone.
This novel approach permits a 'dilution of water' by altering the hydrogen bond
concentration via variations in chain length. We observe a dynamic crossover in
the temperature dependence of the structural relaxation time for all glycols,
consistent with the common behavior of most supercooled liquids. We find that
the crossover becomes more pronounced for increasing hydrogen bond
concentrations, which leads to the prediction of a marked dynamic transition
for water within 'no man's land' at T~220 K. Interestingly, the predicted
transition thus takes place at a temperature where a so called 'strong-fragile'
transition has previously been suggested. Our results, however, imply that the
dynamic transition of supercooled water is analogous to that commonly observed
in supercooled liquids. Moreover, we find support also for the existence of a
secondary relaxation of water with behavior analogous to that of the secondary
relaxation observed for the glycols.
