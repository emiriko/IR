We consistently formalize the probabilistic description of multipartite joint
measurements performed on systems of any nature. This allows us: (1) to specify
in probabilistic terms the difference between nonsignaling, the Einstein-
Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) locality and Bell's locality; (2) to introduce the notion
of an LHV model for an S_{1}x...xS_{N}-setting N-partite correlation
experiment, with outcomes of any spectral type, discrete or continuous, and to
prove both general and specific "quantum" statements on an LHV simulation in an
arbitrary multipartite case; (3) to classify LHV models for a multipartite
quantum state, in particular, to show that any N-partite quantum state, pure or
mixed, admits an Sx1x...x1 -setting LHV description; (4) to evaluate a
threshold visibility for a noisy bipartite quantum state to admit an S_{1}xS_
{2}-setting LHV description under any generalized quantum measurements of two
parties. In a sequel to this paper, we shall introduce a single general
representation incorporating in a unique manner all Bell-type inequalities for
either joint probabilities or correlation functions that have been introduced
or will be introduced in the literature.
