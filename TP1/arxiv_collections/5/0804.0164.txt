In this paper we consider an abelian Chern-Simons theory with plane boundary
and we show, following Symankiz's quite general approach, how the known results
for edge states in the Laughlin series can be derived in a systematic way by
the separability condition. Moreover we show that the conserved boundary
currents find a natural and explicit interpretation in terms of the continuity
equation and the Tomonaga-Luttinger commutation relation for electronic density
is recovered.
