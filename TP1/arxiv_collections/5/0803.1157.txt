We analyze a (symmetrical) two-sensor arrangement with a joint boundary line
between the sensors for fluctuation-enhanced sensing. We show a way to separate
the adsorption-desorption signal components from the diffusive signal
component. Thus the method generates two independent output spectra which
doubles the sensor information for pattern recognition.
