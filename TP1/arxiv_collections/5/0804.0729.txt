We propose a many-qubit network with cavity QED by encoding qubits in
decoherence-free subspace, based on which we can implement many-logic-qubit
conditional gates by means of cavity assisted interaction with single-photon
pulses. Our scheme could not only resist collective dephasing errors, but also
much reduce the implementational steps compared to conventional methods doing
the same job, and we can also complete communications between two arbitrary
nodes. We show the details by implementing a three-logic-qubit Toffoli gate,
and explore the experimental feasibility and challenge based on currently
achievable cavity QED technologies.
