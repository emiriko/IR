Analytical non-perturbative study of the three-dimensional nonlinear
stochastic partial differential equation with additive thermal noise, analogous
to that proposed by V.N. Nikolaevskii [1]-[5]to describe longitudinal seismic
waves, is presented. The equation has a threshold of short-wave instability and
symmetry, providing long wave dynamics. New mechanism of quantum chaos
generating in nonlinear dynamical systems with infinite number of degrees of
freedom is proposed. The hypothesis is said, that physical turbulence could be
identified with quantum chaos of considered type. It is shown that the additive
thermal noise destabilizes dramatically the ground state of the Nikolaevskii
system thus causing it to make a direct transition from a spatially uniform to
a turbulent state.
