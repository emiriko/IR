We investigate limitations imposed by detector dead-times on the performance
of sequential attacks against a differential-phase-shift (DPS) quantum key
distribution (QKD) protocol with weak coherent pulses. In particular, we
analyze sequential attacks based on unambiguous state discrimination of the
signal states emitted by the source and we obtain ultimate upper bounds on the
maximal distance achievable by a DPS QKD scheme both in the so-called trusted
and untrusted device scenarios, respectively.
