We introduce a model of attractive penetrable spheres by adding a short range
attractive square well outside a penetrable core, and we provide a detailed
analysis of structural and thermodynamical properties in one dimension using
the exact impenetrable counterpart as a starting point. The model is expected
to describe star polymers in regimes of good and moderate solvent under dilute
conditions. We derive the exact coefficients of a low density expansion up to
second order for the radial distribution function and up to fourth order in the
virial expansion. These exact results are used as a benchmark to test the
reliability of approximate theories (Percus-Yevick and hypernetted chain).
Notwithstanding the lack of an exact solution for arbitrary densities, our
results are expected to be rather precise within a wide range of temperatures
and densities. A detailed analysis of some limiting cases is carried out. In
particular we provide a complete solution of the sticky penetrable-sphere model
in one dimension up to the same order in density. The issue of Ruelle's
thermodynamics stability is analyzed and the region of a well defined
thermodynamic limit is identified.
