The Law of Large Numbers tells us that as the sample size (N) is increased,
the sample mean converges on the population mean, provided that the latter
exists. In this paper, we investigate the opposite effect: keeping the sample
size fixed while increasing the number of outcomes (M) available to a discrete
random variable. We establish sufficient conditions for the variance of the
sample mean to increase monotonically with the number of outcomes, such that
the sample mean ``diverges'' from the population mean, acting like an
``reverse'' to the law of large numbers. These results, we believe, are
relevant to many situations which require sampling of statistics of certain
finite discrete random variables.
