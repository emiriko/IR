The general description of formation the cellular structure in the system of
interacting particles is proposed. Interactions between particles are
presumably well-understood and the phase transition in which can be studied in
the scale of particle resolution. We presented analytical results of possible
cellular structures for suspension of colloidal particles, in system particles
immersed in liquid crystal and gravitational system. We have shown that
cellular structure formation can occur in system of interacting particles for
realistic values of temperature and particles concentration.
