The resonance strength of the two-step process of nuclear excitation by
electron capture followed by $\gamma$ decay of the nucleus can be significantly
increased in highly charged ions if the resonant capture proceeds via an
excited electronic state with subsequent fast x-ray emission. For fully ionized
$^{238}_{92}\mathrm{U}$ and $^{232}_{90}\mathrm{Th}$, the {x-ray} decay
stabilizes the system against internal conversion of the captured electron,
with an increase of both nuclear lifetimes and resonance strengths of up to two
orders of magnitude compared with the case when occupied atomic orbitals
prevent the x-ray de-excitation. Applications of this effect to the measurement
of the not yet experimentally observed nuclear excitation by electron capture
and to dense astrophysical plasmas are discussed.
