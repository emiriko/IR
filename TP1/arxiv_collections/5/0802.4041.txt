Recently Andrei Teleman considered instanton moduli spaces over negative
definite four-manifolds $X$ with $b_2(X) \geq 1$. If $b_2(X)$ is divisible by
four and $b_1(X) =1$ a gauge-theoretic invariant can be defined; it is a count
of flat connections modulo the gauge group. Our first result shows that if such
a moduli space is non-empty and the manifold admits a connected sum
decomposition $X \cong X_1 # X_2$ then both $b_2(X_1)$ and $b_2(X_2)$ are
divisible by four; this rules out a previously natural appearing source of
4-manifolds with non-empty moduli space. We give in some detail a construction
of negative definite 4-manifolds which we expect will eventually provide
examples of manifolds with non-empty moduli space.
