We have proposed a simple scheme to entangle two distant qutrits trapped in
separate optical cavities. The quantum information of each qutrit is skillfully
encoded on the degenerate ground states of a pair of atoms, hence the
entanglement between them is relatively stable against spontaneous emission. In
Lamb-Dicke limits, it is not necessary to require coincidence detections, which
will relax the conditions for the experimental realization. The scheme is
robust against the inefficient detections.
