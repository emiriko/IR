We study the existence of vortices of the Klein-Gordon-Maxwell equations in
the two dimensional case. In particular we find sufficient conditions for the
existence of vortices in the magneto-static case, i.e when the electric
potential $\phi=0$. This result, due to the lack of suitable embedding theorems
for the vector potential $\A$ is achieved with the help of a penalization
method.
