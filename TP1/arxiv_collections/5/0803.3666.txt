The BCS theory has been extended by us to the strong-coupling regime where
carriers are small lattice polarons and bipolarons. Here I review the
multi-polaron strong-coupling theory of superconductivity. Attractive electron
correlations, prerequisite to any superconductivity, are caused by an almost
unretarded electron-phonon interaction sufficient to overcome the direct
Coulomb repulsion in this regime. Low energy physics is that of small polarons
and bipolarons, which are itinerant quasiparticles existing in the Bloch states
at temperatures below the characteristic phonon frequency. I identify the
long-range Froehlich electron-phonon interaction with c-axis polarised optical
phonons as the most essential for pairing in superconducting cuprates. A number
of key observations have been predicted or explained with polarons and
bipolarons including unusual isotope effects and upper critical fields, normal
state (pseudo)gaps, kinetic properties and diamagnetism, and giant proximity
effects. These and some other observations provide strong evidence for a novel
state of electronic matter in layered cuprates, which is a charged Bose-liquid
of small mobile bipolarons.
