We show that the dynamics of supercooled liquids, analyzed from computer
simulations of the binary mixture Lennard-Jones system, can be described in
terms of a continuous time random walk (CTRW). The required discretization
comes from mapping the dynamics on transitions between metabasins. This
comparison involves verifying the conditions of the CTRW as well as a
quantitative test of the predictions. In particular it is possible to express
the wave vector-dependence of the relaxation time as well as the degree of
non-exponentiality in terms of the first three moments of the waiting time
distribution.
