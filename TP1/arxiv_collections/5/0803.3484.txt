Open string field theory in the level truncation approximation is considered.
It is shown that the energy conservation law determines the existence of
rolling tachyon solution. The coupling of the open string field theory action
to a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker metric is considered and as a result the new
time dependent rolling tachyon solution is presented and possible cosmological
consequences are discussed.
