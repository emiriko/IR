Electron tunneling through a two stage Kondo system constituted by a double
quantum-dot molecule side coupled to a quantum wire, under the effect of a
finite external potential is studied. We found that $I$-$V$ characteristic
shows a negative differential conductance region induced by the electronic
correlation. This phenomenon is a consequence of the properties of the two
stage Kondo regime under the effect of an external applied potential that takes
the system out of equilibrium. The problem is solved using the mean-field
finite-$U$ slave-boson formalism.
