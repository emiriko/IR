Given a diffeomorphism of the interval, consider the uniform norm of the
derivative of its n-th iteration. We get a sequence of real numbers called the
growth sequence. Its asymptotic behavior is an invariant which naturally
appears both in smooth dynamics and in geometry of the diffeomorphisms groups.
We find sharp estimates for the growth sequence of a given diffeomorphism in
terms of the modulus of continuity of its derivative. These estimates extend
previous results of Polterovich and Sodin, and Borichev.
