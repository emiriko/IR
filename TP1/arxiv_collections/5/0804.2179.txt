We describe a possible implementation of the nanomechanical quantum
superposition generation and detection scheme described in the preceding,
companion paper [Armour A D and Blencowe M P 2008 New. J. Phys. Submitted]. The
implementation is based on the circuit quantum electrodynamics (QED) set-up,
with the addition of a mechanical degree of freedom formed out of a suspended,
doubly-clamped segment of the superconducting loop of a dc SQUID located
directly opposite the centre conductor of a coplanar waveguide (CPW). The
relative merits of two SQUID based qubit realizations are addressed, in
particular a capacitively coupled charge qubit and inductively coupled flux
qubit. It is found that both realizations are equally promising, with
comparable qubit-mechanical resonator mode as well as qubit-microwave resonator
mode coupling strengths.
