We use the vacuum expectation value of a Wegner-Wilson loop representing a
fast moving quark-antiquark pair to derive the light cone Hamiltonian for a
$q\bar q$ meson. We solve the corresponding Schr\"odinger equation for various
trial wave functions. The result shows how confinement determines the meson
mass and wave function for valence quarks on the light cone. We also
parametrize the effect of the spin-dependent splitting for a light meson and
charmonium. The correct chiral-symmetry breaking pattern for the pion mass is
obtained due to the self-energy of the quark.
