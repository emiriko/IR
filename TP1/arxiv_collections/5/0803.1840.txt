The wave function was proposed for description of quantum phenomena on the
atomic level. But now it is well known that quantum phenomena are observed not
only on atomic level and the wave function is used for description of
macroscopic quantum phenomena, such as superconductivity. The essence of the
wave function on level elementary particles was and is the subject of heated
argument among founders of quantum mechanics and other physicists. This essence
seems more clear in superconductor. But impossibility of probabilistic
interpretation of wave function in this case results to obvious contradiction
of quantum principles with some fundamental principles of physics.
