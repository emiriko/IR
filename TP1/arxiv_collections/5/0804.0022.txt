We give a mathematical framework for manipulating indeterminate-length
quantum bit strings. In particular, we define prefixes, fragments, tensor
products and concatenation of such strings of qubits, and study their
properties and relationships.
  The results are then used to define prefix-free Hilbert spaces in a more
general way than in previous work, without assuming the existence of a basis of
length eigenstates. We prove a quantum analogue of the Kraft inequality,
illustrate the results with some examples and discuss the relevance of
prefix-free Hilbert spaces for lossless compression.
