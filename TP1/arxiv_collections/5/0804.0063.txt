Two novel (and proprietary) strategies for the structural identification of a
nanocrystal from either a single high-resolution (HR) transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) image or a single precession electron diffraction pattern are
proposed and their advantages discussed in comparison to structural
fingerprinting from powder X-ray diffraction patterns. Simulations for cubic
magnetite and maghemite nanocrystals are used as examples. This is an expanded
and updated version of a conference paper that has been published in Suppl.
Proc. of TMS 2008, 137th Annual Meeting & Exhibition, Volume 1, Materials
Processing and Properties, pp. 25-32.
