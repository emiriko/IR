We study discretization effects in a mixed-action lattice theory with
domain-wall valence quarks and Asqtad-improved staggered sea quarks. At the
level of the chiral effective Lagrangian, discretization effects in the
mixed-action theory give rise to two new parameters as compared to the lowest
order Lagrangian for staggered fermions -- the residual quark mass, m_res, and
the mixed valence-sea meson mass-splitting, Delta_mix. We find that the size of
m_res is approximately four times smaller than our lightest valence quark mass
on our coarser lattice spacing, and comparable to that of simulations by RBC
and UKQCD. We also find that the size of Delta_mix is comparable to the
smallest of the staggered meson taste-splittings measured by MILC. Because
lattice artifacts are different in the valence and sea sectors of the
mixed-action theory, they give rise to unitarity-violating effects that
disappear in the continuum limit. Such effects are expected to be mild for many
quantities of interest, but are significant in the case of the isovector scalar
(a_0) correlator. Specifically, once m_res, Delta_mix, and two other parameters
that can be determined from the light pseudoscalar spectrum are known, the
two-particle intermediate state "bubble" contribution to the scalar correlator
is completely predicted within mixed-action chiral perturbation theory
(MAChPT). We find that the behavior of the scalar meson correlator is
quantitatively consistent with the MAChPT prediction; this supports the claim
that MAChPT describes the dominant unitarity-violating effects in the
mixed-action theory and can be used to remove lattice artifacts and recover
physical quantities.
