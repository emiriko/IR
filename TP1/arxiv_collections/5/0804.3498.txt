Critical points of semiclassical expansions of solutions to the dispersionful
Toda hierarchy are considered and a double scaling limit method of
regularization is formulated. The analogues of the critical points
characterized by the strong conditions in the Hermitian matrix model are
analyzed and the property of doubling of equations is proved. A wide family of
sets of critical points is introduced and the corresponding double scaling
limit expansions are discussed.
