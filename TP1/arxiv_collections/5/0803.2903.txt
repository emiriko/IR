Electron plasmas confined by an external magnetic field exhibit variations in
a two-dimensional plane orthogonal to the confining magnetic field. A nonlinear
fluid simulation code to investigate the properties of 2-D electron plasma wave
turbulence in a nonuniform magnetoplasma has been developed. It is found that
the presence of the density gradient convection by mean electric fields
considerably influence the characteristic nonlinear interaction processes, such
as the energy cascades and the cross-field electron transport. The initial
random turbulent state evolves towards an intermittent state where forward
cascade of vorticity coexists with an inverse cascade of electric potential
fluctuations. The latter lead to the formation of large scale entities in 2D
electron plasmas and can be alternatively understood by seeking exact nonlinear
coherent vortex solutions in the form of a dipolar-like configuration. The
energy cascades are governed typically by the Kolmogorov-like $k^{-5/3}$
spectrum. In agreement with the experimental observations, we find that the
electron transport is improved significantly by the application of an
externally imposed electric field.
