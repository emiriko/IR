We calculated the Dirac Particles' Hawking radiation from the outer horizon
of BTZ black hole via tunneling formalism. Applying WKB approximation to the
Dirac equation in (2+1) dimensional BTZ spacetime background, we obtain the
radiation spectrum for fermions and Hawking temperature of BTZ black hole. The
results obtained by taking the fermion tunneling into account is consistent
with the previous literatures.
