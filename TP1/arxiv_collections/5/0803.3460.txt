We demonstrate the existence of different density-density functionals
designed to retain selected properties of the many-body ground state in a
non-interacting solution starting from the standard density functional theory
ground state. We focus on diffusion quantum Monte Carlo applications that
require trial wave functions with optimal Fermion nodes. The theory is
extensible and can be used to understand current practices in several
electronic structure methods within a generalized density functional framework.
The theory justifies and stimulates the search of optimal empirical density
functionals and effective potentials for accurate calculations of the
properties of real materials, but also cautions on the limits of their
applicability. The concepts are tested and validated with a near-analytic
model.
