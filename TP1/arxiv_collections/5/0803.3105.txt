In the preceding paper arXiv:0802.3252 [quant-ph] we treated a model given by
a master equation with generalized Lindblad form, and examined the algebraic
structure related to some Lie algebras and constructed an approximate solution.
  In this paper we apply a unitary transformation by the squeezing operator to
the master equation. Then the generalized Lindblad form is tranformed to the
usual Lindblad one, while the (original) Hamiltonian is tranformed to somewhat
complicated one.
  As a result we have two different representations based on the Lie algebra
su(1,1). We examine new algebraic structure and construct some approximate
solution.
