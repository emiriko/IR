We report the polarized Raman spectra of undoped ReOFeAs (Re = Sm, La)
collected at room temperature from $ab$ surfaces of impurity free
microcrystals. The spectra exhibit sharp phonon lines on very weak electronic
scattering background. The frequency and symmetry of the four Raman phonons
involving out-of-plane atomic vibrations are found at 170 cm-1 (A1g, Sm), 201
cm-1 (A1g, As), 208 cm-1 (B1g, Fe), 345 cm-1(B1g, O) for SmOFeAs, and 162 cm-1
(A1g, La), 208 cm-1 (A1g, As), 201 cm-1 (B1g, Fe), 316 cm-1 (B1g, O) for
LaOFeAs.
