This paper reports the experimental determination of the phase-breaking
length L of conduction electrons in graphene using Raman spectroscopy. Based on
the double-resonance model, we extract L from the spatial dependence of the D
band susceptibility near the graphene edge. By using prior knowledge of sample
properties and the excitation point-spread function we are able to determine
the spatial variation of the Raman susceptibilities with high accuracy, and the
results reveal a phase-breaking length L~40nm near the graphene edge.
