The electronic structure of the Cr ions in the diluted ferromagnetic
semiconductor Zn$_{1-x}$Cr$_x$Te ($x=0.03$ and 0.15) thin films has been
investigated using x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) and photoemission
spectroscopy (PES). Magnetic-field ($H$) and temperature ($T$) dependences of
the Cr $2p$ XMCD spectra well correspond to the magnetization measured by a
SQUID magnetometer. The line shape of the Cr $2p$ XMCD spectra is independent
of $H$, $T$, and $x$, indicating that the ferromagnetism is originated from the
same electronic states of the Cr ion. Cluster-model analysis indicates that
although there are two or more kinds of Cr ions in the Zn$_{1-x}$Cr$_x$Te
samples, the ferromagnetic XMCD signal is originated from Cr ions substituted
for the Zn site. The Cr 3d partial density of states extracted using Cr $2p \to
3d$ resonant PES shows a broad feature near the top of the valence band,
suggesting strong $s$,$p$-$d$ hybridization. No density of states is detected
at the Fermi level, consistent with their insulating behavior. Based on these
findings, we conclude that double exchange mechanism cannot explain the
ferromagnetism in Zn$_{1-x}$Cr$_{x}$Te.
