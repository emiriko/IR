The first use of the stretched exponential function to describe the time
evolution of a non-equilibrium quantity is usually credited to Rudolph
Kohlrausch (1809-1858), who in 1854 applied it to the discharge of a capacitor.
Attention is drawn to a set of pioneering works on the Kohlrausch function, one
of which published 101 years ago, and that are not mentioned by Cardona,
Chamberlin, and Marx in Ann. Phys. (Leipzig) 16, 842 (2007).
