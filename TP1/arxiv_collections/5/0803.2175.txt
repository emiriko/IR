In the presence of spatial variation of the magnetization direction, electric
current noise causes a fluctuating spin-transfer torque that increases the
fluctuations of the ferromagnetic order parameter. By the
fluctuation-dissipation theorem, the equilibrium fluctuations are related to
the magnetization damping, which in non-uniform ferromagnets acquires a
nonlocal tensor structure. In biased ferromagnets, shot noise can become the
dominant contribution to the magnetization noise at low temperatures.
Considering spin spirals as a simple example, we show that the current-induced
noise and damping is significant.
