Using a dual-mode STM-AFM microscope operating below 50mK we measured the
Local Density of States (LDoS) along small normal wires connected at both ends
to superconductors with different phases. We observe that a uniform minigap can
develop in the whole normal wire and in the superconductors near the
interfaces. The minigap depends periodically on the phase difference. The
quasiclassical theory of superconductivity applied to a simplified 1D model
geometry accounts well for the data.
