Compressive sampling offers a new paradigm for acquiring signals that are
compressible with respect to an orthonormal basis. The major algorithmic
challenge in compressive sampling is to approximate a compressible signal from
noisy samples. This paper describes a new iterative recovery algorithm called
CoSaMP that delivers the same guarantees as the best optimization-based
approaches. Moreover, this algorithm offers rigorous bounds on computational
cost and storage. It is likely to be extremely efficient for practical problems
because it requires only matrix-vector multiplies with the sampling matrix. For
many cases of interest, the running time is just O(N*log^2(N)), where N is the
length of the signal.
