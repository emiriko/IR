We report the initial results from a systematic study of the hyperfine (HF)
structure of antiprotonic helium (n,l) = (37,~35) carried out at the Antiproton
Decelerator (AD) at CERN. We performed a laser-microwave-laser resonance
spectroscopy using a continuous wave (cw) pulse-amplified laser system and
microwave cavity to measure the HF transition frequencies. Improvements in the
spectral linewidth and stability of our laser system have increased the
precision of these measurements by a factor of five and reduced the line width
by a factor of three compared to our previous results. A comparison of the
experimentally measured transition frequencies with three body QED calculations
can be used to determine the antiproton spin magnetic moment, leading towards a
test of CPT invariance.
