Batting average is one of the principle performance measures for an
individual baseball player. It is natural to statistically model this as a
binomial-variable proportion, with a given (observed) number of qualifying
attempts (called ``at-bats''), an observed number of successes (``hits'')
distributed according to the binomial distribution, and with a true (but
unknown) value of $p_i$ that represents the player's latent ability. This is a
common data structure in many statistical applications; and so the
methodological study here has implications for such a range of applications. We
look at batting records for each Major League player over the course of a
single season (2005). The primary focus is on using only the batting records
from an earlier part of the season (e.g., the first 3 months) in order to
estimate the batter's latent ability, $p_i$, and consequently, also to predict
their batting-average performance for the remainder of the season. Since we are
using a season that has already concluded, we can then validate our estimation
performance by comparing the estimated values to the actual values for the
remainder of the season. The prediction methods to be investigated are
motivated from empirical Bayes and hierarchical Bayes interpretations. A newly
proposed nonparametric empirical Bayes procedure performs particularly well in
the basic analysis of the full data set, though less well with analyses
involving more homogeneous subsets of the data. In those more homogeneous
situations better performance is obtained from appropriate versions of more
familiar methods. In all situations the poorest performing choice is the
na\"{{\i}}ve predictor which directly uses the current average to predict the
future average.
