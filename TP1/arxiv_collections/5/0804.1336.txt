We have investigated the magnetic properties of a piezoelectric
actuator/ferromagnetic semiconductor hybrid structure. Using a GaMnAs epilayer
as the ferromagnetic semiconductor and applying the piezo-stress along its
[110] direction, we quantify the magnetic anisotropy as a function of the
voltage V_p applied to the piezoelectric actuator using anisotropic
magnetoresistance techniques. We find that the easy axis of the strain-induced
uniaxial magnetic anisotropy contribution can be inverted from the [110] to the
[1-10] direction via the application of appropriate voltages V_p. At T=5K the
magnetoelastic term is a minor contribution to the magnetic anisotropy.
Nevertheless, we show that the switching fields of rho(H) loops are shifted as
a function of V_p at this temperature. At 50K - where the magnetoelastic term
dominates the magnetic anisotropy - we are able to tune the magnetization
orientation by about 70 degree solely by means of the electrical voltage V_p
applied. Furthermore, we derive the magnetostrictive constant lambda_111 as a
function of temperature and find values consistent with earlier results. We
argue that the piezo-voltage control of magnetization orientation is directly
transferable to other ferromagnetic/piezoelectric hybrid structures, paving the
way to innovative multifunctional device concepts. As an example, we
demonstrate piezo-voltage induced irreversible magnetization switching at
T=40K, which constitutes the basic principle of a nonvolatile memory element.
