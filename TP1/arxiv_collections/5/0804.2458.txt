We consider the weakly asymmetric exclusion process on a bounded interval
with particle reservoirs at the endpoints. The hydrodynamic limit for the
empirical density, obtained in the diffusive scaling, is given by the viscous
Burgers equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions. We prove the associated
dynamical large deviations principle.
