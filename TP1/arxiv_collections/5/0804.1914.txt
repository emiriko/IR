Motivated by the recent construction of a translation-invariant
renormalizable non-commutative model for a scalar field (see arXiv:0802.0791
[math-ph]), we introduce models for non-commutative U(1) gauge fields along the
same lines. More precisely, we include some extra terms into the action with
the aim of getting rid of the UV/IR mixing.
