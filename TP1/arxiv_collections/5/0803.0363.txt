The purpose of this paper is to find maximal and primitive elements of baby
Verma modules for a quantum group of type $B_2$. As a consequence the
composition factors of the baby Verma modules are determined. Similar approach
can be used to find find maximal and primitive elements of Weyl modules for
type $B_2$.
