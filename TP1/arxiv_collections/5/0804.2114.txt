We study the isospectral deformations of the Eguchi-Hanson spaces along a
torus isometric action in the noncompact noncommutative geometry. We
concentrate on locality, smoothness and summability conditions of the nonunital
spectral triples, and relate them to the geometric conditions to be
noncommutative spin manifolds.
