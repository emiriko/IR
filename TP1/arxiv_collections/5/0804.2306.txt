We demonstrate optical nonlinearities due to the interaction of weak optical
fields with the collective motion of a strongly dispersive ultracold gas. The
combination of a recoil-induced resonance (RIR) in the high gain regime and
optical waveguiding within the dispersive medium enables us to achieve a
collective atomic cooperativity of $275 \pm 50$ even in the absence of a
cavity. As a result, we observe optical bistability at input powers as low as
20 pW. The present scheme allows for dynamic optical control of the dispersive
properties of the ultracold gas using very weak pulses of light. The
experimental observations are in good agreement with a theoretical model.
