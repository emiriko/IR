We consider (2+1)-dimensional Yang-Mills theory on $S^1 \times S^1 \times
{\bf R}$ in the framework of a Hamiltonian approach developed by Karabali, Kim
and Nair. The deconfining limit in the theory can be discussed in terms of one
of the $S^1$ radii of the torus ($S^1 \times S^1$), while the other radius goes
to infinity. We find that the limit agrees with the previously known result for
a dynamical propagator mass of a gluon. We also make comparisons with numerical
data.
