In toroidal geometry, and prior to the establishment of a fully developed
turbulent state, the so-called topological instability of the
pressure-gradient-driven turbulence is observed. In this intermediate state, a
narrow spectral band of modes dominates the dynamics, giving rise to the
formation of iso-surfaces of electric potential with a complicated topology.
Since E x B advection of tracer particles takes place along these iso-surfaces,
their topological complexity affects the characteristic features of radial and
poloidal transport dramatically. In particular, they both become strongly
non-diffusive and non-Gaussian. Since radial transport determines the system
confinement properties and poloidal transport controls the equilibration
dynamics (on any magnetic surface), the development of non-diffusive models in
both directions is thus of physical interest. In previous work, a fractional
model to describe radial transport was constructed by the authors. In this
contribution, recent results on periodic fractional models are exploited for
the construction of an effective model of poloidal transport. Numerical
computations using a three-dimensional reduced magnetohydrodynamic set of
equations are compared with analytical solutions of the fractional periodic
model. It is shown that the aforementioned analytical solutions accurately
describe poloidal transport, which turns out to be superdiffusive with index
$\alpha=1$.
