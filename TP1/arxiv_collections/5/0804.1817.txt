Recent experiments [I.V. Grigorieva et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 96, 077005
(2006)] on visualization of vortices using the Bitter decoration technique
revealed vortex shells in mesoscopic superconducting Nb disks containing up to
L=40 vortices. Some of the found configurations did not agree with those
predicted theoretically. We show here that this discrepancy can be traced back
to the larger disks with radii R ~ 1 to 2.5\mu m, i.e., R ~ 50-100\xi(0) used
in the experiment, while in previous theoretical studies vortex states with
vorticity L < 40 were analyzed for smaller disks with R ~ 5-20\xi(0). The
present analysis is done for thin disks (mesoscopic regime) and for thick
(macroscopic) disks where the London screening is taken into account. We found
that the radius of the superconducting disk has a pronounced influence on the
vortex configuration in contrast to, e.g., the case of parabolic confined
charged particles. The missing vortex configurations and the region of their
stability are found, which are in agreement with those observed in the
experiment.
