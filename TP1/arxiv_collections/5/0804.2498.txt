We investigate the quantum kicked rotor in resonance subjected to momentum
measurements with a L\'evy waiting time distribution. We find that the system
has a sub-ballistic behavior. We obtain an analytical expression for the
exponent of the power law of the variance as a function of the characteristic
parameter of the L\'evy distribution and connect this anomalous diffusion with
a fractional dynamics.
