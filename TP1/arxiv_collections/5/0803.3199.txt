I present and discuss a model for the free-for-all passenger boarding which
is employed by some discount air carriers. The model is based on the principles
of statistical mechanics where each seat in the aircraft has an associated
energy which reflects the preferences of the population of air travelers. As
each passenger enters the airplane they select their seats using Boltzmann
statistics, proceed to that location, load their luggage, sit down, and the
partition function seen by remaining passengers is modified to reflect this
fact. I discuss the various model parameters and make qualitative comparisons
of this passenger boarding model with models which involve assigned seats. This
model can also be used to predict the probability that certain seats will be
occupied at different times during the boarding process. These results may be
of value to industry professionals as a useful description of this boarding
method. However, it also has significant value as a pedagogical tool since it
is a relatively unusual application of undergraduate level physics and it
describes a situation with which many students and faculty may be familiar.
