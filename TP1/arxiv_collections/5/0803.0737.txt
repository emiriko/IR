We find the finite-width, i.e., the layer thickness, of experimental
quasi-two dimensional systems produces a physical environment sufficient to
stabilize the Moore-Read Pfaffian state thought to describe the fractional
quantum Hall effect at filling factor $\nu=5/2$. This conclusion is based on
exact calculations performed in the spherical and torus geometries, studying
wavefunction overlap and ground state degeneracy
