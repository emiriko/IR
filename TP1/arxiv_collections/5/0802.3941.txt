We investigate a class of one-dimensional, exactly solvable anisotropic XY
spin-1/2 models in an alternating transverse magnetic field from an
entanglement perspective. We find that a physically motivated Lie-algebraic
generalized entanglement measure faithfully portraits the static phase diagram
-- including second- and fourth-order quantum phase transitions belonging to
distinct universality classes. In the simplest time-dependent scenario of a
slow quench across a quantum critical point, we identify parameter regimes
where entanglement exhibits universal dynamical scaling relative to the static
limit.
