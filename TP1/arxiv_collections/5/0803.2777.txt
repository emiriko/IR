The effect of finite-coupling corrections to the drag force on a moving heavy
quark in the Super Yang-Mills plasma is investigated. These corrections are
related to curvature-squared corrections in the corresponding gravity dual. The
results are compared with the dual gauge theory. It is shown that
curvature-squared corrections affect the drag force. It is shown that
corrections to the drag force depend on the velocity of the heavy quark. The
diffusion coefficient of non-relativistic heavy quarks is calculated from the
drag force. In addition, we also calculate the drag force on a moving heavy
quark in the Gauss-Bonnet background.
