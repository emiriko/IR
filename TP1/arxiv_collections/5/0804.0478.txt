This note is concerned with a natural generalization of the Mullineux
involution for Ariki-Koike algebras. Using a result of Fayers together with
previous results by the authors, we give an efficient algorithm for computing
this generalized Mullineux involution. Our algorithm notably does not involve
the determination of paths in affine crystals.
