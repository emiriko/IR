We present measurements of the temperature and power dependence of the
resonance frequency and frequency noise of superconducting niobium thin-film
coplanar waveguide resonators, carried out at temperatures well below the
superconducting transition (T_{c}=9.2 K). The noise decreases by nearly two
orders of magnitude as the temperature is increased from 120 to 1200 mK, while
the variation of the resonance frequency with temperature over this range
agrees well with the standard two-level system (TLS) model for amorphous
dielectrics. These results support the hypothesis that TLS are responsible for
the noise in superconducting microresonators, and have important implications
for resonator applications such as qubits and photon detectors.
