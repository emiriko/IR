Synchrotron infrared measurements were conducted over the range 100 to 8000
cm-1 on a self-doped LaxMnO3-d (x~~0.8) film. From these measurements we
determined the conductivity, the effective number of free carriers, and the
specific phonon modes as a function of frequency. While the metal-insulator
transition temperature (TMI) and the magnetic ordering temperature (TC)
approximately coincide, the free carrier density onset occurs at a
significantly lower temperature (~~45 K below). This suggests that local
distortions exist below TMI and TC which trap the eg conduction electrons.
These regions with local distortions constitute an insulating phase which
persists for temperatures significantly below TMI and TC. The initial large
drop in resistivity is due to the enhanced magnetic ordering while further
drops correspond to reductions in the insulating phase which increase the
number of free carriers.
