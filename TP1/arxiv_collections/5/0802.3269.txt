We study the conductance and current noise of a superconductor/ferromagnet
(S/F) single channel Quantum Point Contact (QPC) as a function of the QPC bias
voltage, using a scattering approach. We show that the Spin-Dependence of
Interfacial Phase Shifts (SDIPS) acquired by electrons upon scattering by the
QPC can strongly modify these signals. For a weakly transparent contact, the
SDIPS induces sub-gap resonances in the conductance and differential Fano
factor curves of the QPC. For high transparencies, these resonances are
smoothed, but the shape of the signals remain extremely sensitive to the SDIPS.
We show that noise measurements could help to gain more information on the
device, e.g. in cases where the SDIPS modifies qualitatively the differential
Fano factor of the QPC but not the conductance.
