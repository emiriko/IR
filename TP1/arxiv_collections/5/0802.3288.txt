This paper presents some aspects related to test process of an advanced video
system used in remote IP surveillance. The system is based on a Pentium
compatible architecture using the industrial standard PC104+. First the overall
architecture of the system is presented, involving both hardware or software
aspects. The acquisition board which is developed in a special, nonstandard
architecture, is also briefly presented. The main purpose of this research was
to set a coherent set of procedures in order to test all the aspects of the
video acquisition board. To accomplish this, it was necessary to set-up a
procedure in two steps: stand alone video board test (functional test) and an
in-system test procedure verifying the compatibility with both OS: Linux and
Windows. The paper presents also the results obtained using this procedure.
