We theoretically investigate the kinetics of the folding transition of a
single semiflexible polymer. In the folding transition, the growth rate
decrease with an increase in the number of monomers in a collapsed domain,
suggesting that the main contribution to dissipation is from the motion of the
domain. In the unfolding transition, dynamic scaling exponents, 1/8 and 1/4,
were determined for disentanglement and relaxation steps, respectively. We
performed Langevin dynamics simulations to test our theory. It is found that
our theory is in good agreement with simulations. We also propose the kinetics
of the transitions in the presence of the hydrodynamic interaction.
