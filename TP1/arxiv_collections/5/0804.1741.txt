We study the inhomogeneous generalization of a 1-dimensional AKLT spin chain
model. Spins at each lattice site could be different. Under certain conditions,
the ground state of this AKLT model is unique and is described by the
Valence-Bond-Solid (VBS) state. We calculate the density matrix of a contiguous
block of bulk spins in this ground state. The density matrix is independent of
spins outside the block. It is diagonalized and shown to be a projector onto a
subspace. We prove that for large block the density matrix behaves as the
identity in the subspace. The von Neumann entropy coincides with Renyi entropy
and is equal to the saturated value.
