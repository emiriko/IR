In this paper we propose a scheme for partially teleporting entangled atomic
states. Our scheme can be implemented using only four two-level atoms
interacting either resonantly or off-resonantly with a single cavity-QED. The
estimative of losses occurring during this partial teleportation process is
accomplished through the phenomenological operator approach technique.
