An analytical device model for a graphene nanoribbon phototransistor (GNR-PT)
is presented. GNR-PT is based on an array of graphene nanoribbons with the side
source and drain contacts, which is sandwiched between the highly conducting
substrate and the top gate. Using the developed model, we derive the explicit
analytical relationships for the source-drain current as a function of the
intensity and frequency of the incident radiation and find the detector
responsivity. It is shown that GNR-PTs can be rather effective photodetectors
in infrared and terahertz ranges of spectrum.
