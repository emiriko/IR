A generalization of the Yang-Lee and Fisher zeros on far-from-equilibrium
systems coupled with two thermal baths is proposed. The Yang-Lee zeros were
obtained for minimal models which exhibit complicated behavior in the context
of the partition function zeros and provide an analitycal treatment. This type
of models may be considered as a simplest one and analogous to Ising model for
equilibrium. The obtained distributions of generalized Yang-Lee zeros show
nontrivial behavior for these simple models.
