Traditional Stueckelberg Mechanism is shown equivalent to set up a gauged
U(1) chiral Lagrangian and fix special gauge. With this mechanism, the original
electro-weak chiral Lagrangian is inlarged by including an extra U(1) symmetry
to represent physics for $Z'$ boson. We build up complete list of electro-weak
chiral Lagrangian up to order of $p^4$ including $Z'$ and higgs bosons. The
most general mixing among neutral gauge bosons is diagonalized completely and
the connections among these operators to triple, quartic couplings involving
$Z'$ boson and to that in traditional electro-weak chiral Lagrangian are made.
