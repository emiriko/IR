We introduce four algorithms for packet transport in complex networks. These
algorithms use deterministic rules which depend, in different ways, on the
degree of the node, the number of packets posted down each edge, the mean
delivery time of packets sent down each edge to each destination and the time
since an edge last transmitted a packet. On scale-free networks all our
algorithms are considerably more efficient and can handle a larger load than
the random walk algorithm. We consider in detail various attributes of our
algorithms, for instance we show that an algorithm that bases its decisions on
the mean delivery time jams unless it incorporates information about the degree
of the destination node.
