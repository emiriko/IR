In most natural sciences there is currently the insight that it is necessary
to bridge gaps between different processes which can be observed on different
scales. This is especially true in the field of chemical reactions where the
abilities to form bonds between different types of atoms and molecules create
much of the properties we experience in our everyday life, especially in all
biological activity. There are essentially two types of processes related to
biochemical reaction networks, the interactions among molecules and
interactions involving their conformational changes, so in a sense, their
internal state. The first type of processes can be conveniently approximated by
the so-called mass-action kinetics, but this is not necessarily so for the
second kind where molecular states do not define any kind of density or
concentration. In this paper we demonstrate the necessity to study reaction
networks in a stochastic formulation for which we can construct a coherent
approximation in terms of specific space-time scales and the number of
particles. The continuum limit procedure naturally creates equations of
Fokker-Planck type where the evolution of the concentration occurs on a slower
time scale when compared to the evolution of the conformational changes, for
example triggered by binding or unbinding events with other (typically smaller)
molecules. We apply the asymptotic theory to derive the effective, i.e.
macroscopic dynamics of the biochemical reaction system. The theory can also be
applied to other processes where entities can be described by finitely many
internal states, with changes of states occuring by arrival of other entities
described by a birth-death process.
