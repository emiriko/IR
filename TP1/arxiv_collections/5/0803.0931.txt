A homogenization result is given for a material having brittle inclusions
arranged in a periodic structure. According to the relation between the
softness parameter and the size of the microstructure, three different limit
models are deduced via Gamma-convergence. In particular, damage is obtained as
limit of periodically distributed microfractures.
