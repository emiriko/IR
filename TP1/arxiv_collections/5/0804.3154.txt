The variety of multi-partite entangled states enables numerous applications
in novel quantum information tasks. In order to compare the suitability of
different states from a theoretical point of view classifications have been
introduced. Accordingly, here we derive criteria and demonstrate how to
experimentally discriminate an observed state against the ones of certain other
classes of multi-partite entangled states. Our method, originating in Bell
inequalities, adds an important tool for the characterization of multi-party
entanglement.
