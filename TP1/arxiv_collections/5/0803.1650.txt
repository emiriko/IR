In this article we describe the formulation of null geodesics as null
conformal geodesics and their description in the tractor formalism. A conformal
extension theorem through an isotropic singularity is proven by requiring the
boundedness of the tractor curvature and its derivatives to sufficient order
along a congruence of null conformal geodesic. This article extends earlier
work by Tod and Luebbe.
