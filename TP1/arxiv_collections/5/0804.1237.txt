As an addendum to our previous evaluation of the weak-interaction corrections
to hadronic top-quark pair production we determine the leading weak-interaction
contributions due to the subprocesses $b {\bar b} \to t {\bar t}$ and $g q
({\bar q}) \to t {\bar t} q ({\bar q})$. For several distributions in $t {\bar
t}$ production at the LHC we find that these contributions are non-negligible
as compared to the weak corrections from the other partonic subprocesses.
