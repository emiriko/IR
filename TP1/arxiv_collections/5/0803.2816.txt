We study the infrared conductivity of graphene at finite chemical potential
and temperature taking into account the effect of phonons and disorder due to
charged impurities and unitary scatterers. The screening of the long-range
Coulomb potential is treated using the random phase approximation coupled to
the coherent potential approximation. The effect of the electron-phonon
coupling is studied in second-order perturbation theory. The theory has
essentially one free parameter, namely, the number of charge impurities per
carbon, n^{{\rm C}}_i. We find an anomalous enhancement of the conductivity in
a frequency region that is blocked by Pauli exclusion and an impurity
broadening of the conductivity threshold. We also find that phonons induce
Stokes and anti-Stokes lines that produce an excess conductivity, when compared
to the far infrared value of \sigma_0 = (\pi/2) e^2/h.
