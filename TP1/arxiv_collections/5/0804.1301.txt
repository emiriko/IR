We derive the generalized Fokker-Planck equation associated with a Langevin
equation driven by arbitrary additive white noise. We apply our result to study
the distribution of symmetric and asymmetric L\'{e}vy flights in an infinitely
deep potential well. The fractional Fokker-Planck equation for L\'{e}vy flights
is derived and solved analytically in the steady state. It is shown that
L\'{e}vy flights are distributed according to the beta distribution, whose
probability density becomes singular at the boundaries of the well. The origin
of the preferred concentration of flying objects near the boundaries in
nonequilibrium systems is clarified.
