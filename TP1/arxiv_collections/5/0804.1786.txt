The study of optical parametric amplifiers (OPAs) has been successful in
describing and creating nonclassical light for use in fields such as quantum
metrology and quantum lithography [Agarwal, et al., J. Opt. Soc. Am. B, 24, 2
(2007)]. In this paper we present the theory of an OPA scheme utilizing an
entangled state input. The scheme involves two identical OPAs seeded with the
maximally path-entangled N00N state (|2,0>+|0,2>)/sqrt{2}. The stimulated
amplification results in output state probability amplitudes that have a
dependence on the number of photons in each mode, which differs greatly from
two-mode squeezed vacuum. The output contains a family of entangled states
directly applicable to quantum key distribution. Specific output states allow
for the heralded creation of N=4 N00N states, which may be used for quantum
lithography, to write sub-Rayleigh fringe patterns, and for quantum
interferometry, to achieve Heisenberg-limited phase measurement sensitivity.
