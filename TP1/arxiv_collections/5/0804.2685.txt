Two extreme members of the cobaltite series, LaCoO3 and DyCoO3, were
investigated by the electrical resistivity and thermopower measurements up to
800-1000 K. Special attention was given to effects of extra holes or electrons,
introduced by light doping of Co sites by Mg2+ or Ti4+ ions. The experiments on
the La based compounds were complemented with magnetic measurements. The study
shows that both kinds of charge carriers induce magnetic states on surrounding
CoIII sites and form thus thermally stable polarons of large total spin. Their
itinerancy is characterized by low temperature resistivity, which is of
Arrhenius type r~exp(EA/kT) for the hole (CoIV) doped samples, while an unusual
dependence r~1/Tn (n=8-10) is observed for the electron (CoII) doped samples.
At higher temperatures, additional hole carriers are massively populated in the
CoIII background, leading to a resistivity drop. This transition become evident
at ~300 K and 450 K and culminates at TI-M=540 and 780 K for the La and Dy
based samples, respectively.
  The electronic behaviours of the cobaltites are explained considering two
excitation processes in parent compounds. The first one is related to a local
excitation from the diamagnetic LS CoIII to close-lying paramagnetic HS CoIII
state. Secondarily, a metallic phase of the IS CoIII character is formed
through a charge transfer mechanism between LS/HS pairs. The magnetic polarons
associated with doped carriers are interpreted as droplets of such IS phase.
