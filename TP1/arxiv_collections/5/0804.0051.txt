We consider the N=1 supersymmetric gauge theories with product gauge groups.
The two kinds of D6-branes in the electric theory are both displaced and
rotated respectively where these deformations are interpreted as the mass terms
and quartic terms for the two kinds of flavors. Then we apply the Seiberg dual
to the whole gauge group factors by moving the branes and obtain the
corresponding dual gauge theories. By analyzing the magnetic superpotentials
consisting of an interaction term between a magnetic meson field and dual
matters as well as the above deformations for each gauge group, we present the
type IIA nonsupersymmetric meta-stable brane configurations.
