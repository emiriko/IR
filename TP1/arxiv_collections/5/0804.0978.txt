Let $KG$ be the group ring of a group $G$ over a commutative ring $K$ with
unity. The rings $KG$ are described for which $xx^\sigma=x^\sigma x$ for all
$x=\sum_{g\in G}\alpha_gg\in KG$, where \quad $x\mapsto x^\sigma=~\sum_{g\in
G}\alpha_gf(g)\sigma(g)$\quad is an involution of $KG$; here $f: G\to U(K)$ is
a homomorphism and $\sigma$ is an anti-automorphism of order two of $G$.
