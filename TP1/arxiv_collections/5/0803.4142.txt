Without the use of cameras to record 2D motion and an appropriate analysis
tool, creating a laboratory activity for students to experience the vector
nature of momentum can be challenging. Even with appropriate measurement tools,
it is difficult to predict the final velocities of the objects in the system
unless you know the impact parameter. For accurately predicting the final
velocities, the typical momentum experiment involves colliding gliders on an
air track or colliding low-friction carts on a track. These one-dimensional
experiments require the vector nature of momentum for correct analysis but do
not require breaking the momentum vector into components.
  In this work we present another experiment, using this aforementioned
equipment, which only requires a stopwatch, ruler, and mass balance yet
requires the two-dimensional analysis of the momentum vector.
