Recent observation of proximity effect \cite{Morpurgo:2007} has ignited
interest in superconductivity in graphene and its derivatives. We consider
Ca-intercalated graphene bilayer and argue that it is a superconductor, and
likely with a sizeable $T_{c}$. We find substantial and suggestive similarities
between Ca-intercalated bilayer (C$_{6}$CaC$_{6}$), and CaC$_{6} $, an
established superconductor with $T_{c}$ = 11.5 K. In particular, the nearly
free electron band, proven to be instrumental for superconductivity in
intercalated graphites, does cross the chemical potential in (C$_{6}$CaC$%
_{6}$), despite the twice smaller doping level, satisfying the so-called
\textquotedblleft Cambridge criterion\textquotedblright . Calculated properties
of zone-center phonons are very similar to those of CaC$%_{6}.$ This suggests
that the critical temperature would probably be on the same scale as in
CaC$_{6}$.
