We study the geometry of the inextensible string (the whip) and its discrete
approximation (the chain). In the absence of gravity, both motions represent
geodesic motions on certain manifolds. We show how the motion of the chain
converges to that of a whip, and how the curvature of the chain's configuration
space converges to that of the whip's configuration space. Finally we speculate
on the analogous approximation of an incompressible fluid by a discrete system.
