Clustering analysis is one of the most widely used statistical tools in many
emerging areas such as microarray data analysis. For microarray and other
high-dimensional data, the presence of many noise variables may mask underlying
clustering structures. Hence removing noise variables via variable selection is
necessary. For simultaneous variable selection and parameter estimation,
existing penalized likelihood approaches in model-based clustering analysis all
assume a common diagonal covariance matrix across clusters, which however may
not hold in practice. To analyze high-dimensional data, particularly those with
relatively low sample sizes, this article introduces a novel approach that
shrinks the variances together with means, in a more general situation with
cluster-specific (diagonal) covariance matrices. Furthermore, selection of
grouped variables via inclusion or exclusion of a group of variables altogether
is permitted by a specific form of penalty, which facilitates incorporating
subject-matter knowledge, such as gene functions in clustering microarray
samples for disease subtype discovery. For implementation, EM algorithms are
derived for parameter estimation, in which the M-steps clearly demonstrate the
effects of shrinkage and thresholding. Numerical examples, including an
application to acute leukemia subtype discovery with microarray gene expression
data, are provided to demonstrate the utility and advantage of the proposed
method.
