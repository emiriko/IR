Several technologies are emerging that provide new ways to capture, store,
present and use knowledge. This book is the first to provide a comprehensive
introduction to five of the most important of these technologies: Knowledge
Engineering, Knowledge Based Engineering, Knowledge Webs, Ontologies and
Semantic Webs. For each of these, answers are given to a number of key
questions (What is it? How does it operate? How is a system developed? What can
it be used for? What tools are available? What are the main issues?). The book
is aimed at students, researchers and practitioners interested in Knowledge
Management, Artificial Intelligence, Design Engineering and Web Technologies.
  During the 1990s, Nick worked at the University of Nottingham on the
application of AI techniques to knowledge management and on various knowledge
acquisition projects to develop expert systems for military applications. In
1999, he joined Epistemics where he worked on numerous knowledge projects and
helped establish knowledge management programmes at large organisations in the
engineering, technology and legal sectors. He is author of the book "Knowledge
Acquisition in Practice", which describes a step-by-step procedure for
acquiring and implementing expertise. He maintains strong links with leading
research organisations working on knowledge technologies, such as
knowledge-based engineering, ontologies and semantic technologies.
