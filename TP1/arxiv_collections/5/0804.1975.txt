The lowest Landau level of graphene is studied numerically by considering a
tight-binding Hamiltonian with disorder. The Hall conductance
$\sigma_\mathrm{xy}$ and the longitudinal conductance $\sigma_\mathrm{xx}$ are
computed. We demonstrate that bond disorder can produce a plateau-like feature
centered at $\nu=0$, while the longitudinal conductance is nonzero in the same
region, reflecting a band of extended states between $\pm E_{c}$, whose
magnitude depends on the disorder strength. The critical exponent corresponding
to the localization length at the edges of this band is found to be $2.47\pm
0.04$. When both bond disorder and a finite mass term exist the localization
length exponent varies continuously between $\sim 1.0$ and $\sim 7/3$.
