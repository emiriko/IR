A theoretical framework is presented to treat hadronic observables within
analytic perturbative QCD beyond the leading order of the coupling and for more
than one single large momentum scale. The approach generalizes and extends the
pioneering work of Shirkov and Solovtsov on an analytic strong running
coupling. Some applications to hadronic observables at the partonic level are
also discussed.
