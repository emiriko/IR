The phenomenon of unipolar induction consists in generating electric field by
uniformly rotating permanent magnets made of either conducting or dielectric
substance. The origin of the field around conducting magnets is explained and
calculated in Sect. 1. Dielectrics are considered in Sect. 2, where the role of
the electric moment due to moving magnetic dipole moment is clarified. Sect. 3
is devoted to the description of the effect in the corotating frame of
reference. In Sect. 4 the theory is applied to the Earth core and it is shown
that the calculated electric field falls precisely into the range of the
ambient electric field observed in the Tethered Satellite System mission of
NASA. In the last paragraph I reflect on whether flyby anomaly might be
attributed to an electric effect.
