KLOE has measured most decay branching ratios of Ks, Kl and K+/- mesons. It
has also measured the Kl and the K+- lifetime and determined the shape of the
form factors involved in kaon semileptonic decays. We present in the following
a description of the above measurements and a well organized compendium of all
of our data, with particular attention to correlations. These data provide the
basis for the determination of the CKM parameter Vus and a test of the
unitarity of the quark flavor mixing matrix. We also test lepton universality
and place bounds on new physics using measurements of Vus from Kl2 and Kl3
decays.
