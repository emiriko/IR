The intensity of scintillation light emission from liquid xenon at room
temperature was measured. The scintillation light yield at 1 deg. was measured
to be 0.64 +/- 0.02 (stat.) +/- 0.06 (sys.) of that at -100 deg. Using the
reported light yield at -100 deg. (46 photons/keV), the measured light yield at
1 deg. corresponds to 29 photons/keV. This result shows that liquid xenon
scintillator gives high light yield even at room temperature.
