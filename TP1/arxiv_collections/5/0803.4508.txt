Here we discuss the annealing behavior of an infinite-range $\pm J$ Ising
spin glass in presence of a transverse field using a zero-temperature quantum
Monte Carlo. Within the simulation scheme, we demonstrate that quantum
annealing not only helps finding the ground state of a classical spin glass,
but can also help simulating the ground state of a quantum spin glass, in
particularly, when the transverse field is low, much more efficiently.
