We report a theoretical study on the spin and electron transport in the
nonlocal lateral spin valve with non-collinear magnetic configuration. The
nonlocal magnetoresistance, defined as the voltage difference on the detection
lead over the injected current, is derived analytically. The spin transfer
torques on the detection lead are calculated. It is found that spin transfer
torques are symmetrical for parallel and antiparallel magnetic configurations,
which is different from that in conventional sandwiched spin valve.
