This work investigates the influence of low temperature and broadened Landau
levels on the thermodynamic properties of two-dimensional electron systems. The
interplay between these two physical parameters on the magnetic field
dependence of the chemical potential, the specific heat and the magnetization
is calculated. In the absence of a complete theory that explains the Landau
level broadening, experimental and theoretical studies in literature perform
different model calculations of this parameter. Here it is presented that
different broadening parameters of Gaussian-shaped Landau levels cause width
variations in their contributions to interlevel and intralevel excitations.
Below a characteristic temperature, the interlevel excitations become
negligible. Likewise, at this temperature range, the effect of the Landau level
broadening vanishes.
