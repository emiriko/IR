In this work the charge transport properties of charge ordered (CO)
La1-xCaxMnO3 (LCMO) (x= 0.55, 0.67) epitaxial thin films and polycrystals are
discussed following the recent controversy of localised electron states vs.
weakly or de- localised charge density wave (CDW) states in CO manganites. The
transport properties were investigated by current vs. voltage, direct current
resistivity vs. temperature, local activation energy vs. temperature,
magnetoresistance and admittance spectroscopy measurements, which all indicated
a localised electronic structure in the single CO phase. Delocalised charge
anomalies observed previously may be restricted to phase separated materials.
