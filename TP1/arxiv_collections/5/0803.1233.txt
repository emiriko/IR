We report electronic structure and electric field modulation calculations in
the width direction for armchair graphene nanoribbons (acGNRs) using a
semi-empirical extended Huckel theory. Important band structure parameters are
computed, e.g. effectives masses, velocities and bandgaps. For the three types
of acGNRs, the pz orbital tight-binding parameters are extracted if feasible.
Furthermore, the effect of electric field in the width direction on acGNRs
dispersion is explored. It is shown that for the two types of semiconducting
acGNRs, an external electric field can reduce the bandgap to a few meV with
different quantitative behavior.
