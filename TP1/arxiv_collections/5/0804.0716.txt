Here we demonstrate, for the first time, violation of Bell's inequality using
a triggered quantum dot photon-pair source without post-selection. Furthermore,
the fidelity to the expected Bell state can be increased above 90% using
temporal gating to reject photons emitted at times when collection of
uncorrelated light is more probable. A direct measurement of a CHSH Bell
inequality is made showing a clear violation, highlighting that a quantum dot
entangled photon source is suitable for communication exploiting non-local
quantum correlations.
