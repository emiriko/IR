The measurement of distance between two objects is generalized to the case
where the objects are no longer points but are one-dimensional. Additional
concepts such as non-extensibility, curvature constraints, and non-crossing
become central to the notion of distance. Analytical and numerical results are
given for some specific examples, and applications to biopolymers are
discussed.
