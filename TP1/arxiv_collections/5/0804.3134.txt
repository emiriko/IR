We prove a vanishing theorem for one forms on the moduli stack of principally
polarized abelian varieties of genus g>1 with level structure N over fields of
characteristic p different from two. This is used to compute the Picard groups
of these stacks. As an application we obtain results one congruences between
integral Siegel modular forms.
