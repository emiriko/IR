I define models of quantum loops and nets which have ground states with
topological order. These make possible excited states comprised of deconfined
anyons with non-abelian braiding. With the appropriate inner product, these
quantum loop models are equivalent to net models whose topological weight
involves the chromatic polynomial. A useful consequence is that the models have
a quantum self-duality, making it possible to find a simple Hamiltonian
preserving the topological order. For the square lattice, this Hamiltonian has
only four-spin interactions.
