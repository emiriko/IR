Electric field enhanced electron spin coherence is characterized using
time-resolved Faraday rotation spectroscopy in n-type ZnO epilayers grown by
molecular beam epitaxy. An in-plane dc electric field E almost doubles the
transverse spin lifetime at 20 K, without affecting the effective g-factor.
This effect persists till high temperatures, but decreases with increasing
carrier concentration. Comparisons of the variations in the spin lifetime, the
carrier recombination lifetime and photoluminescence lifetimes indicate that
the applied E enhances the radiative recombination rate. All observed effects
are independent of crystal directionality and are performed at low magnetic
fields (B < 0.2 T).
