The paper presents an analysis on the use of integrals defined for
non-additive measures (or capacities) as the Choquet and the \Sipos{} integral,
and the multilinear model, all seen as extensions of pseudo-Boolean functions,
and used as a means to model interaction between criteria in a multicriteria
decision making problem. The emphasis is put on the use, besides classical
comparative information, of information about difference of attractiveness
between acts, and on the existence, for each point of view, of a ``neutral
level'', allowing to introduce the absolute notion of attractive or repulsive
act. It is shown that in this case, the Sipos integral is a suitable solution,
although not unique. Properties of the Sipos integral as a new way of
aggregating criteria are shown, with emphasis on the interaction among
criteria.
