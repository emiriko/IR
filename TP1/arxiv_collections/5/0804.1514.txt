Motivated by the large interest in the non-equilibrium dynamics of
low-dimensional quantum many-body systems, we present a fully-microscopic
theoretical and numerical study of the "charge" and "spin" dynamics in a
one-dimensional ultracold Fermi gas following a quench. Our approach, which is
based on time-dependent current-density-functional theory, is applicable well
beyond the linear-response regime and produces both spin-charge separation and
spin-drag-induced broadening of the spin packets.
