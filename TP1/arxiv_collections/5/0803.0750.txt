We have obtained a determinant representation for the time- and
temperature-dependent field-field correlation function of the impenetrable
Lieb-Liniger gas of anyons through direct summation of the form factors. In the
static case, the obtained results are shown to be equivalent to those that
follow from the anyonic generalization of Lenard's formula.
