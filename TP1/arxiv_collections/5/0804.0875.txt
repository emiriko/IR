We report the direct observation of the spin-singlet dark excitonic state in
individual single-walled carbon nanotubes through low-temperature
micro-photoluminescence spectroscopy in magnetic fields. A magnetic field up to
5 T, applied along the nanotube axis, brightened the dark state, leading to the
emergence of a new emission peak. The peak rapidly grew in intensity with
increasing field at the expense of the originally-dominant bright exciton peak
and finally became dominant at fields $>$3 T. This behavior, universally
observed for more than 50 nanotubes of different chiralities, can be
quantitatively explained through a model incorporating the Aharonov-Bohm effect
and intervalley Coulomb mixing, unambiguously proving the existence of dark
excitons. The directly measured dark-bright splitting values were 1-4 meV for
tube diameters 1.0-1.3 nm. Scatter in the splitting value emphasizes the role
of the local environment surrounding a nanotube in determining the excitonic
fine structure of single-walled carbon nanotubes.
