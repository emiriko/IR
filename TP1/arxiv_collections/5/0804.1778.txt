We report an approach to synthesize high quality graphene by surface
segregation and substrate transfer. Graphene was segregated from Ni surface
under the ambient pressure by dissolving carbon in Ni at high temperatures
followed by cooling down with various rates. Different cooling rates led to
different segregation behaviors, strongly affecting the thickness and quality
of the graphene films. Electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy indicated
that the graphene films synthesized with medium cooling rates have high quality
crystalline structure and well-controlled thicknesses. The graphene films were
transferred to insulating substrates by wet etching and found to maintain their
high quality.
