The spatial profiles and the dissipation characteristics of spin-wave
quasi-eigenmodes are investigated in small magnetic Ni$_{81}$Fe$_{19}$ ring
structures using Brillouin light scattering microscopy. It is found, that the
decay constant of a mode decreases with increasing mode frequency. Indications
for a contribution of three-magnon processes to the dissipation of higher-order
spin-wave quasi-eigenmodes are found.
