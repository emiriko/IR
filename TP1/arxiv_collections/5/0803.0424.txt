Brane inflation and the production of topological defects at the end of the
inflationary phase are discussed. After a description of the inflationary setup
we discuss the properties of the cosmic strings produced at the end of
inflation. Specific examples of brane inflation are described: $D-\bar D$
inflation, $D3/D7$ inflation and modular inflation
