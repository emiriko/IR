A systematic analysis of the A-dependence of phi-meson production in
proton-nucleus collisions is presented. We apply different formalisms for the
evaluation of the phi-meson distortion in nuclei and discuss the theoretical
uncertainties of the data analysis. The corresponding results are compared to
theoretical predictions. We also discuss the interpretation of the extracted
results with respect to different observables and provide relations between
frequently used definitions. The perspectives of future experiments are
evaluated and estimates based on our systematical study are given.
