We report the synthesizing and characterization of the hole doped Ni-based
superconductor ($La_{1-x}Sr_{x})ONiAs$. By substituting La with Sr, the
superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ is increased from 2.75 K of the
parent phase $LaONiAs$ to 3.7 K at the doping levels x= 0.1 - 0.2. The curve
$T_c$ versus hole concentration shows a symmetric behavior as the electron
doped samples $La(O_{1-x}F_{x})NiAs$. The normal state resistivity in Ni-based
samples shows a good metallic behavior and reveals the absence of an anomaly
which appears in the Fe-based system at about 150 K, suggesting that this
anomaly is not a common feature for all systems. Hall effect measurements
indicate that the electron conduction in the parent phase $LaONiAs$ is
dominated by electron-like charge carriers, while with more Sr doping, a
hole-like band will emerge and finally prevail over the conduction, and
accordingly the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ increases.
