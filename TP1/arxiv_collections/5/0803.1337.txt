We present a detailed analysis of the incident-photon-energy and polarization
dependences of the resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) spectra at the Cu
$K$ edge in La$_{2}$CuO$_{4}$. Our analysis is based on the formula developed
by Nomura and Igarashi, which describes the spectra by a product of an
incident-photon-dependent factor and a density-density correlation function for
3d states. We calculate the former factor using the $4p$ density of states from
an ab initio band structure calculation and the latter using a multiorbital
tight-binding model within the Hartree-Fock approximation and the random phase
approximation. We obtain spectra with rich structures in the energy-loss range
2-5 eV, which vary with varying momentum and incident-photon energy, in
semi-quantitative agreement with recent experiments. We clarify the origin of
such changes as a combined effect of the incident-photon-dependent factor and
the density-density correlation function.
