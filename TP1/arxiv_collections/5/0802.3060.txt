Harvesting energy from ambient vibration is proposed as an alternative to
storage based power supplies for autonomous systems. The system presented
converts the mechanical energy of a vibration into electrical energy by means
of a variable capacitor, which is polarized by an electret. A lumped element
model is used to study the generator and design a prototype. The device has
been micromachined in silicon, based on a two-wafer process. The prototype was
successfully tested, both using an external polarization source and an
electret.
