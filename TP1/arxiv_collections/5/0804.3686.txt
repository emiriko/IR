A recent article of Colbeck and Renner tackled the problem whether
entanglements may be explained by combined models of local and non-local hidden
variables. To the difference from previous works they considered models in
which each pair of entangled particles behaves in the same way, and the
particles in the pair are equivalent, i.e. each of them produces its response
to a measurement according to both local and non-local hidden variables. Their
article aimed at proving that the local hidden variable component in such
models has no effect on the measurement results, i.e. only the non-local
variables are relevant. However, their proof deals with a very restrictive case
and assumes questionable constraints on the hidden variables. The present text
studies the Colbeck and Renner class of models on a less restrictive case and
under no constraints on the hidden variables. It is shown again that the local
component cannot have any influence on the results. However, the Colbeck and
Renner class of models is not the only one possible. A different class is
described, and it admits local hidden variables by the side of the non-local
influence. This class presents a couple of advantages.
