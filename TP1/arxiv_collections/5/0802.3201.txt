The potential of a Super Flavor Factory (SFF) for searches of New Physics is
reviewed. While very high luminosity B physics is assumed to be at the core of
the program, its scope for extensive charm and tau studies are also emphasized.
The possibility to run at the Upsilon(5S) is also very briefly discussed; in
principle, this could provide very clean measurements of B_s decays. The
strength and reach of a SFF is most notably due to the possibility of examining
an impressive array of very clean observables. The angles and the sides of the
unitarity triangle can be determined with unprecedented accuracy. These serve
as a reference for New Physics (NP) sensitive decays such as B^+ ->tau^+ nu and
penguin dominated hadronic decay modes, providing tests of generic NP scenarios
with an accuracy of a few percent. Besides, very precise studies of direct and
time dependent CP asymmetries in radiative B decays and forward-backward
asymmetry studies in B-> X_s l^+ l^- and numerous null tests using B, charm and
tau decays are also likely to provide powerful insights into NP. The dramatic
increase in luminosity at a SFF will also open up entirely new avenues for
probing NP observables, e.g. by allowing sensitive studies using theoretically
clean processes such as B -> X_s nu nubar. The SFF is envisioned to be a
crucial tool for essential studies of flavor in the LHC era, and will extend
the reach of the LHC in many important ways.
