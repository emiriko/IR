By applying the conformal SO(2,4) transformations to the folded rotating
string configuration with two spins given by a certain limit from the helical
string solution in AdS_3 x S^1, we construct new string solutions whose
energy-spin relations are characterized by the boost parameter. When two
SO(2,4) transformations are performed with two boost parameters suitably
chosen, the straight folded rotating string solution with one spin in AdS_3 is
transformed in the long string limit into the long spiky string solution whose
expression is given from the helical string solution in AdS_3 by making a limit
that the modulus parameter becomes unity.
