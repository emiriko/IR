We explore in detail the consequences of the CP-violating phases residing in
the supersymmetric and soft SUSY breaking parameters in the approximation that
family flavour mixings are ignored. We allow for non-universal boundary
conditions and in such a consideration the model is described by twelve
independent CP-violating phases and one angle which misaligns the vacuum
expectation values (VEVs) of the Higgs scalars. We run two-loop renormalization
group equations (RGEs), for all parameters involved, including phases, and we
properly treat the minimization conditions using the one-loop effective
potential with CP-violating phases included. We show that the two-loop running
of phases may induce sizable effects for the electric dipole moments (EDMs)
that are absent in the one-loop RGE analysis. Also important corrections to the
EDMs are induced by the Higgs VEVs misalignment angle which are sizable in the
large tanb region. Scanning the available parameter space we seek regions
compatible with accelerator and cosmological data with emphasis on rapid
neutralino annihilations through a Higgs resonance. It is shown that large
CP-violating phases, as required in Baryogenesis scenarios, can be tuned to
obtain agreement with WMAP3 cold dark matter constraints, EDMs and all
available accelerator data, in extended regions of the parameter space which
may be accessible to LHC.
