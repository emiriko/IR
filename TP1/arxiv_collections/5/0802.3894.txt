Regular pattern formation is ubiquitous in nature; it occurs in biological,
physical, and materials science systems. Here we propose a set of experiments
with ultracold atoms that show how to examine different types of pattern
formation. In particular, we show how one can see the analog of labyrinthine
patterns (so-called quantum emulsions) in mixtures of light and heavy atoms
(that tend to phase separate) by tuning the trap potential and we show how
complex geometrically ordered patterns emerge (when the mixtures do not phase
separate), which could be employed for low-temperature thermometry. The complex
physical mechanisms for the pattern formation at zero temperature are
understood within a theoretical analysis called the local density
approximation.
