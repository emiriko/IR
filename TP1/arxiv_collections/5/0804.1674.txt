Special relativity corresponds to hyperbolic geometry at constant velocity
while the so-called general relativity corresponds to hyperbolic geometry of
uniformly accelerated systems. Generalized expressions for angular momentum,
centrifugal and Coriolis forces are found in hyperbolic space, which reduce to
the usual expressions of Euclidean space when the absolute constant tends to
infinity. Gravity enters only in the specification of the absolute constant. A
uniformly rotating disc corresponds exactly to hyperbolic geometry with a
constant negative Gaussian curvature. The angle defect is related to Lorentz
contraction of objects normal to the radial direction. Lobachevsky's angle of
parallelism accounts for the apparent relativistic distortion of moving objects
and would provide a testing ground to measure a positive defect by replacing
large distances by high speeds that are comparable with that of light.
