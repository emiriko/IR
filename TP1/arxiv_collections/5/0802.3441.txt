The new vision presented is aimed to overcome the logic overhead issues that
previous works exhibit when applying GALS techniques to programmable logic
devices. The proposed new view relies in a 2-phase, bundled data parity based
protocol for data transfer and clock generation tasks. The ability of the
introduced methodology for smart real-time delay selection allows the
implementation of a variety of new methodologies for electromagnetic
interference mitigation and device environment changes adaptation.
