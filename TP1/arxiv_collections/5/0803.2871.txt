We measure the microwave signals produced by spin-torque-driven magnetization
dynamics in patterned magnetic multilayer devices at room temperature, as a
function of the angle of a magnetic field applied in the sample plane. We find
strong variations in the frequency linewidth of the signals, with a decrease by
more than a factor of 20 as the field is rotated from the magnetic easy axis to
the in-plane hard axis. Based on micromagnetic simulations, we identify these
variations as due to a transition from spatially incoherent to coherent
precession.
