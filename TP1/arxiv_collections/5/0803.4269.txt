It is shown that the use of a high power $\alpha$ of the Laplacian in the
dissipative term of hydrodynamical equations leads asymptotically to truncated
inviscid \textit{conservative} dynamics with a finite range of spatial Fourier
modes. Those at large wavenumbers thermalize, whereas modes at small
wavenumbers obey ordinary viscous dynamics [C. Cichowlas et al. Phys. Rev.
Lett. 95, 264502 (2005)]. The energy bottleneck observed for finite $\alpha$
may be interpreted as incomplete thermalization. Artifacts arising from models
with $\alpha > 1$ are discussed.
