Fueled by the hydrolysis of ATP, the motor protein kinesin literally walks on
two legs along the biopolymer microtubule. The number of accidental backsteps
that kinesin takes appears to be much larger than what one would expect given
the amount of free energy that ATP hydrolysis makes available. This is puzzling
as more than a billion years of natural selection should have optimized the
motor protein for its speed and efficiency. But more backstepping allows for
the production of more entropy. Such entropy production will make free energy
available. With this additional free energy, the catalytic cycle of the kinesin
can be speeded up. We show how measured backstep percentages represent an
optimum at which maximal net forward speed is achieved.
