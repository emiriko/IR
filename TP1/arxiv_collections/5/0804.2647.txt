Collective Ampere law interactions producing magnetic flux tubes piercing
through sunspots into and then out of the solar corona allow for low energy
nuclear reactions in a steady state and high energy particle reactions if a
magnetic flux tube explodes in a violent event such as a solar flare.
Filamentous flux tubes themselves are vortices of Ampere currents circulating
around in a tornado fashion in a roughly cylindrical geometry. The magnetic
field lines are parallel to and largely confined within the core of the vortex.
The vortices may thereby be viewed as long current carrying coils surrounding
magnetic flux and subject to inductive Faraday and Ampere laws. These laws set
the energy scales of (i) low energy solar nuclear reactions which may regularly
occur and (ii) high energy electro-weak interactions which occur when magnetic
flux coils explode into violent episodic events such as solar flares or coronal
mass ejections.
