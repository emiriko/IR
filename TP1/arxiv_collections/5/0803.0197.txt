This paper describes an experimental system designed for development of real
time voice synthesis applications. The system is composed from a DSP
coprocessor card, equipped with an TMS320C25 or TMS320C50 chip, voice
acquisition module (ADDA2),host computer (IBM-PC compatible), software specific
tools.
