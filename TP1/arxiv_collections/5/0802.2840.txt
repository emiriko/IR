We use a local scale invariance of a classical Hamiltonian and describe how
to construct six different formulations of quantum mechanics in spaces with two
time-like dimensions. All these six formulations have the same classical limit
described by the same Hamiltonian. One of these formulations is used as a basis
for a complementation of the usual quantum mechanics when in the presence of
gravity.
