Numerically we simulate the effect of optimized coherent control pulses with
a finite duration on a qubit in a bath of spins. The pulses of finite duration
are compared with ideal instantaneous pulses. In particular, we show that
properly designed short pulses can approximate ideal instantaneous pulses up to
a certain order in the shortness of the pulse. We provide examples of such
pulses, quantify the discrepancy from the ideal case and compare their effect
for various ranges of the coupling constants.
