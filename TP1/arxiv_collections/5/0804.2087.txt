Starting from the edge reconstructed Pfaffian state and the anti-Pfaffian
state for the filling fraction $\nu={5/2}$ fractional quantum Hall (FQH) state
with the filled Landau levels included, we find that interactions between
counterpropagating edge modes can induce phase transitions on the edge. In the
new `Majorana-gapped' phases, a pair of counter propagating neutral Majorana
modes becomes gapped. The quasiparticle tunneling exponent changes from $g=1/4$
to $g=1/2$ for the edge reconstructed Pfaffian state, and changes from $g=1/2$
to $g=0.55-0.75$ for the anti-Pfaffian state, in the new Majorana-gapped
phases. The new phases are candidate states for the observed $\nu={5/2}$ state.
Furthermore, Majorana-gapped phases provide examples that non-trivial quantum
phase transitions can happen on the edge of a FQH state without any change in
bulk topological order.
