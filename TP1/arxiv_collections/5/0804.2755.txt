We reveal fundamental analogies between soliton dynamics in light-induced
random photonic lattices and Brownian motion of particles. In particular, we
discover that the average squared soliton displacement increases linearly with
distance after an initial ballistic regime of propagation. We also find that in
shallow lattices the average soliton displacement grows linearly with
increasing lattice depth.
