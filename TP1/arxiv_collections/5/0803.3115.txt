The aim of this work is to understand the influence of chaotic states in
control problems involving strong fields. Towards this end, we numerically
construct and study the strong field control landscape of a bichromatically
driven double well. A novel measure based on correlating the overlap
intensities between Floquet states and an initial phase space coherent state
with the parametric motion of the quasienergies is used to construct and
interpret the landscape features. "Walls" of no control, robust under
variations of the relative phase between the fields, are seen on the control
landscape and associated with multilevel interactions involving chaotic Floquet
states.
