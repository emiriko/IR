A data word is a sequence of pairs of a letter from a finite alphabet and an
element from an infinite set, where the latter can only be compared for
equality. Safety one-way alternating automata with one register on infinite
data words are considered, their nonemptiness is shown EXPSPACE-complete, and
their inclusion decidable but not primitive recursive. The same complexity
bounds are obtained for satisfiability and refinement, respectively, for the
safety fragment of linear temporal logic with freeze quantification. Dropping
the safety restriction, adding past temporal operators, or adding one more
register, each causes undecidability.
