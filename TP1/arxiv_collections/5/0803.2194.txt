In general relativity, quasi-local energy-momentum expressions have been
constructed from various formulae. However, Newtonian theory of gravity gives a
well known and an unique quasi-local mass expression (surface integration).
Since geometrical formulation of Newtonian gravity has been established in the
covariant Newtonian space-time, it provides a covariant approximation from
relativistic to Newtonian theories. By using this approximation, we calculate
Komar integral, Brown-York quasi-local energy and Dougan-Mason quasi-local mass
in the covariant Newtonian space-time. It turns out that Komar integral
naturally gives the Newtonian quasi-local mass expression, however, further
conditions (spherical symmetry) need to be made for Brown-York and Dougan-Mason
expressions.
