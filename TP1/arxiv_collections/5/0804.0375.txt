A theoretical study of the transport properties of zigzag and armchair
graphene nanoribbons with a magnetic barrier on top is presented. The magnetic
barrier modifies the energy spectrum of the nanoribbons locally, which results
in an energy shift of the conductance steps towards higher energies. The
magnetic barrier also induces Fabry-Perot type oscillations, provided the edges
of the barrier are sufficiently sharp. The lowest propagating state present in
zigzag and metallic armchair nanoribbons prevent confinement of the charge
carriers by the magnetic barrier. Disordered edges in nanoribbons tend to
localize the lowest propagating state, which get delocalized in the magnetic
barrier region. Thus, in sharp contrast to the case of two-dimensional
graphene, the charge carriers in graphene nanoribbons cannot be confined by
magnetic barriers. We also present a novel method based on the Green's function
technique for the calculation of the magnetosubband structure, Bloch states and
magnetoconductance of the graphene nanoribbons in a perpendicular magnetic
field. Utilization of this method greatly facilitates the conductance
calculations, because, in contrast to excising methods, the present method does
not require self-consistent calculations for the surface Green's function.
