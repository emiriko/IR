We prove that Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model is an exact description of infrared
QCD deriving it from QCD Lagrangian. The model we obtain is renormalizable and
confining but, taking very small momenta fixes completely all the parameters of
the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model through those of QCD. The choice of the infrared
propagator is done consistently with recent numerical results from lattice and
Dyson-Schwinger equations for Yang-Mills theory. The model we get coincides,
once the ultraviolet contribution is removed, with the one proposed by
Langfeld, Kettner and Reinhardt [Nucl. Phys. A {\bf 608}, 331 (1996)].
