Using the WKBJ approximation we obtain numerical plots of the power emission
spectrum for the evaporation of massless bulk Dirac fermions from six
dimensional black holes off a tense 3-brane with codimension two. We also
present the multiplicity factors for eigenvalues of the deficit four sphere and
show that these reduce to the usual case in the tenseless limit.
