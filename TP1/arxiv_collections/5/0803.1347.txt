The energy source of the radiation in Unruh/Hawking process is investigated
with emphasis on the particle number definition based on conservation laws. It
has been shown that the particle radiation is not the result of pair creation
by the gravitational force, but the result of difference in the conservation
laws to define the particle number. The origin of the radiated energy in the
distant future corresponds to the zero point oscillations with infinitely large
wave numbers. This result implies the need of reconsideration on the scenario
of black hole evaporation.
