We report a fully inclusive measurement of the flavor changing neutral
current decay $B\to X_s\gamma$ in the energy range $1.7 \GeV\le
E^\mathrm{c.m.s}_\gamma\le 2.8 \GeV$, covering 97% of the total spectrum, where
c.m.s is the center of mass system. Using $605\ifb$ of data, we obtain in the
rest frame of the $B$-meson ${\mathcal B}(B\to X_s\gamma : E^B_\gamma>1.7
\mathrm{GeV})= (3.31 \pm 0.19 \pm 0.37 \pm 0.01)\times 10^{-4}$, where the
errors are statistical, systematic and from the boost correction needed to
transform from the rest frame of the $\Upsilon(4S)$ (c.m.s) to that of the
$B$-meson, respectively. We also measure the first and second moments of the
photon energy spectrum as functions of various energy thresholds, which extend
down to $1.7 \GeV$. The results are preliminary.
