Quantum games have proposed a new point of view for the solution of the
classical problems and dilemmas in game theory. Certain quantization
relationships can be proposed with the objective that a game can be generalized
into a quantum domain where the linear superposition of actions is allowed.
This quantization let us describe and solution problems originated by
conflicting or cooperative behaviors among the members of a system from the
point of view of quantum mechanical interactions. This leads us to interesting
aspects which only can be observed through the quantization of a game like the
possibility of the entanglement between players, the definition of a
socioeconomical temperature in a system, the collective welfare principle,the
analysis of a game through elements of quantum information theory and the
globalization process. The relationships between quantum mechanics and game
theory are also studied and its shown how although both systems analyzed are
described through two theories apparently different (quantum mechanics and game
theory) both are analogous and thus exactly equivalents.
