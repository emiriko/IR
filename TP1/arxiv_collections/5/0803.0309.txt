In a recent series of papers [J. Chem. Phys. 121 4501 (2004), J. Chem. Phys.
124 034115 (2006), J. Chem. Phys. 124 034116 (2006)] a bipolar
counter-propagating wave decomposition, Psi = Psi+ + Psi-, was presented for
stationary bound states Psi of the one-dimensional Shrodinger equation, such
that the components Psi+- approach their semiclassical WKB analogs in the large
action limit. The corresponding bipolar quantum trajectories are classical-like
and well-behaved, even when Psi has many nodes, or is wildly oscillatory. In
this paper, the earlier results are used to construct a universal ``black-box''
algorithm, numerically robust, stable and efficient, for computing accurate
scattering quantities of any quantum dynamical system in one degree of freedom.
