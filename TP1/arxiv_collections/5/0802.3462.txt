Because graphene is an atomically two-dimensional gapless semiconductor with
nearly identical conduction and valence bands, graphene-based bilayers are
attractive candidates for high-temperature electron-hole pair condensation. We
present estimates which suggest that the Kosterlitz-Thouless temperatures of
these two-dimensional counterflow superfluids can approach room temperature.
