The linear and nonlinear surface waves propagating along the interface
separating isotropic conventional and uniaxially anisotropic left-handed
materials is investigated. The conditions of the existence of surface TM-modes
is determined. It is shown that surface waves can be formed when the components
of the permittivity and permeability tensors of the uniaxially anisotropic
left-handed materials are simultaneously negative. A transition layer
sandwiched between connected media is described using a model of a
two-dimensional gas of quantum dots. Explicit analytical expressions for a
surface optical soliton of self-induced transparency in the presence of single
and biexciton transitions depends on the magnetic permeability of the
left-handed medium, are given with realistic parameters which can be reached in
current experiments. It is shown that the sign of the total energy flow of the
surface soliton depends on the parameters of the quantum dots and connected
media.
