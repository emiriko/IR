The multiphoton quantum superposition generated by a quantum-injected optical
parametric amplifier (QI-OPA) seeded by a single-photon belonging to an EPR
entangled pair is made to interact with a Mirror-BEC shaped as a Bragg
interference structure. The effect can be greatly enhanced if the mirror is
part of a cavity structure or is used within an optical interferometer. The
overall process will realize an Entangled Macroscopic Quantum Superposition
involving a ''microscopic'' singe-photon state of polarization and the coherent
''macroscopic'' displacement of the BEC structure acting in space-like
separated distant places.
