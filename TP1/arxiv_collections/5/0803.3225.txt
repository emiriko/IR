New techniques, both for generating and detecting turbulence in the helium
superfluids 3He-B and 4He, have recently given insight in how turbulence is
started, what the dissipation mechanisms are, and how turbulence decays when it
appears as a transient state or when externally applied turbulent pumping is
switched off. Important simplifications are obtained by using 3He-B as working
fluid, where the highly viscous normal component is practically always in a
state of laminar flow, or by cooling 4He to low temperatures where the normal
fraction becomes vanishingly small. We describe recent studies from the low
temperature regime, where mutual friction becomes small or practically
vanishes. This allows us to elucidate the mechanisms at work in quantum
turbulence on approaching the zero temperature limit.
