We present a way to accomodate relic graviton production via worm hole
transitions of prior universe thermal / energy density values to our present
universe. This is done in the context of providing a mechanism for thermally
driven relic gravitons, and also to explain how Park's 2003 observation as to
how a thermally scaled vacuum energy value plays a role in forming the early
universe emergent field dynamics
