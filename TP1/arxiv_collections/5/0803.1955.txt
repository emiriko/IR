Elastic effects due to lattice strain modify the local equilibrium condition
at the solid-solid interface compared to the classical dendritic growth. Both,
the thermal and the elastic fields are eliminated by the Green's function
techniques and a closed nonlinear integro-differential equation for the
evolution of the interface is derived. In the case of pure dilatation, the
elastic effects lead only to a trivial shift of the transition temperature
while in the case of shear transitions, dendritic patterns are found even for
isotropic surface energy.
