In this paper we examine the connection among the themes: the cosmological
constant, the weak interaction and the neutrino mass. Our main propose is to
review and modify the ideas first proposed by Hayakawa [ Prog. Theor.
Phys.Suppl.,532(1965).], in the light of the new-fashioned features of
contemporary physics. Assuming the pressure of a Fermi gas of neutrinos should
be balanced by its gravitational attraction, we evaluate the mass of the
background neutrino and its number.The neutrino mass here evaluated is
compatible with the known value for the cosmological constant (or dark
energy).Taking in account the role played by the weak forces experimented by
the neutrinos, we also determined a value for the electroweak mixing angle. For
sake of comparison, an alternative evaluation of the neutrino mass is also
done.
