Single crystal magnetic studies combined with a theoretical analysis show
that cancellation of the magnetic moments in the trinuclear Dy3+ cluster
[Dy3(OH)2L3Cl(H2O)5]Cl3, resulting in a non-magnetic ground doublet, originates
from the non-collinearity of the single ion easy axes of magnetization of the
Dy3+ ions that lie in the plane of the triangle at 120 (deg.) one from each
other. This gives rise to a peculiar chiral nature of the ground non-magnetic
doublet and to slow relaxation of the magnetization with abrupt accelerations
at the crossings of the discrete energy levels.
