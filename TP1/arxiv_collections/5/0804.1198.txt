A search for the various double beta decay modes of 124Sn and 112Sn has been
performed on 75 kg.days of data. New half-life limits for excited states in
124Sn have been obtained including a lower limit for the decay into the first
excited 2+ state of 124Te of T_half > 0.87e20 yrs (90% CL) and into the first
excited 0+ state of T_half > 1.08e20 yrs (90% CL). Ground state and excited
state transitions of 112Sn have also been experimentally explored. A limit for
the 2 neutrino double electron capture of T_half > 1.8e19 yrs (90% CL) is
obtained. The non-observation of de-excitation gammas from the 0+ at 1888.5keV
results in a lower half-life limit on the 0 neutrino double electron capture
decay of 112Sn of T_half > 0.8e19 yrs (90% CL), despite a possible resonant
enhancement of the decay rate due to degenerated states.
