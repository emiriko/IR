We study the problems related to the renormalization of propagators in
Resonance Chiral Theory, concentrating on the case of vector $1^{--}$
resonances in the antisymmetric tensor formalism. We have found that
renormalization of the divergences of the self-energy graphs needs new type of
kinetic counterterms with two derivatives which are not present in the original
leading order Lagrangian. The general form of the propagator for antisymmetric
tensor fields could then contain not only poles corresponding to the original
$1^{--}$ resonance states but also to the additional states with opposite
parity which decouple in the free field limit. In some cases, these dynamically
generated additional states might be negative norm ghosts or tachyons.
