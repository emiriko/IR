In this paper, we describe a novel proactive recovery scheme based on service
migration for long-running Byzantine fault tolerant systems. Proactive recovery
is an essential method for ensuring long term reliability of fault tolerant
systems that are under continuous threats from malicious adversaries. The
primary benefit of our proactive recovery scheme is a reduced vulnerability
window. This is achieved by removing the time-consuming reboot step from the
critical path of proactive recovery. Our migration-based proactive recovery is
coordinated among the replicas, therefore, it can automatically adjust to
different system loads and avoid the problem of excessive concurrent proactive
recoveries that may occur in previous work with fixed watchdog timeouts.
Moreover, the fast proactive recovery also significantly improves the system
availability in the presence of faults.
