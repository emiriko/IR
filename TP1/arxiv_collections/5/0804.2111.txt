In this paper, we consider the physics performance of a single far detector
composed of a 100 kton next generation Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber
(LAr TPC) possibly located at shallow depth, coupled to the J-PARC neutrino
beam facility with a realistic 1.66 MW operation of the Main Ring. The new far
detector could be located in the region of Okinoshima islands (baseline $L\sim
658$ km). Our emphasis is based on the measurement of the $\theta_{13}$ and
$\delta_{CP}$ parameters, possibly following indications for a non-vanishing
$\theta_{13}$ in T2K, and relies on the opportunity offered by the LAr TPC to
reconstruct the incoming neutrino energy with high precision compared to other
large detector technologies. We mention other possible baselines like for
example J-PARC-Kamioka (baseline $L\sim 295$ km), or J-PARC-Eastern Korean
coast (baseline $L\sim 1025$ km). Such a detector would also further explore
the existence of proton decays.
