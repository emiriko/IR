We have performed Raman scattering investigations on the high energy magnetic
excitations in a BiFeO$_3$ single crystal as a function of both temperature and
laser excitation energy. A strong feature observed at 1250 cm$^{-1}$ in the
Raman spectra has been previously assigned to two phonon overtone. We show here
that its unusual frequency shift with the excitation energy and its asymmetric
temperature dependent Fano lineshape reveal a strong coupling to magnetic
excitations. In the same energy range, we have also identified the two-magnon
excitation with a temperature dependence very similar to $\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$
hematite.
