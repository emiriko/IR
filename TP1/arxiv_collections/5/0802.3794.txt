We investigate the transmission and reflection of Bose-condensate excitations
in the low energy limit across a potential barrier separating two condensates
with different densities. The Bogoliubov excitation in the low energy limit has
the incident angle where the perfect transmission occurs. This condition
corresponds to the Brewster's law for the electromagnetic wave. The total
internal reflection of the Bogoliubov excitation is found to occur at a large
incident angle in the low energy limit. The anomalous tunneling named by Kagan
et al. [Yu. Kagan et al., Phys. Rev. Lett., 90, 130402 (2003)] can be
understood in terms of the impedance matching. In the case of the normal
incidence, comparison with the results in Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids is made.
