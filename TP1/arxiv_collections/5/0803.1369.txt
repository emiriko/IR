Baryons in the massive Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model in 1+1 dimensions (the
massive chiral Gross-Neveu model) are studied in the limit of an infinite
number of flavors. The baryon mass is evaluated for a wide range of bare
fermion masses and filling fractions, combining analytical asymptotic
expansions with a full numerical Hartree-Fock calculation.
