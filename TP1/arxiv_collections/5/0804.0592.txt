We present a general phenomenological framework for dialing between gravity
mediation, gauge mediation, and anomaly mediation. The approach is motivated
from recent developments in moduli stabilization, which suggest that gravity
mediated terms can be effectively loop suppressed and thus comparable to gauge
and anomaly mediated terms. The gauginos exhibit a mirage unification behavior
at a "deflected" scale, and gluinos are often the lightest colored sparticles.
The approach provides a rich setting in which to explore generalized
supersymmetry breaking at the LHC.
