We introduce a minimal model description for the dynamics of transcriptional
regulatory networks. It is studied within a mean-field approximation, i.e., by
deterministic ode's representing the reaction kinetics, and by stochastic
simulations employing the Gillespie algorithm. We elucidate the different
results both approaches can deliver, depending on the network under study, and
in particular depending on the level of detail retained in the respective
description. Two examples are addressed in detail: the repressilator, a
transcriptional clock based on a three-gene network realized experimentally in
E. coli, and a bistable two-gene circuit under external driving, a
transcriptional network motif recently proposed to play a role in cellular
development.
