Recently, by analyzing the measurement data of Nikuradze, it has been
proposed (N. Goldenfeld, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf{96}}, 044503, 2006) that the
friction factor, $f$, of rough pipe flow obeys a scaling law in the turbulent
regime. Here, we provide a phenomenological scaling argument to explain this
law and demonstrate how intermittency modifies the scaling form, thereby
relating $f$ to the intermittency exponent, $\eta$. By statistically analyzing
the measurement data of $f$, we infer a satisfactory estimate for $\eta$
($\approx 0.02$), the inclusion of which is shown to improve the data-collapse
curve. This provides empirical evidence for intermittency other than the direct
measurement of velocity fluctuations.
