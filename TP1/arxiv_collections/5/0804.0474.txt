The most difficult aspect of the realistic modeling of granular materials is
how to capture the real shape of the particles. Here we present a method to
simulate granular materials with complex-shaped particles. The particle shape
is represented by the classical concept of a Minkowski sum, which permits the
representation of complex shapes without the need to define the object as a
composite of spherical or convex particles. A well defined interaction force
between these bodies is derived. The algorithm for identification of neighbor
particles reduces force calculations to O(N), where $N$ is the number of
particles. The algorithm is much more efficient, accurate and easier to
implement than other models. We investigate the existence of a statistical
equilibrium in granular systems with circular non-spherical particles in the
collisional. regime. We also investigate the limit state of dissipative
granular materials using biaxial test simulations. The results are consistent
with the classical assumption of the statistical mechanics for non-dissipative
systems, and the critical state theory of soils mechanics for dissipative
granular materials.
