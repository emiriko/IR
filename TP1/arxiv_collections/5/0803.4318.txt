We review our recent study of the pion mass dependence of the rho and sigma
resonances, generated from one-loop SU(2) Chiral Perturbation Theory (ChPT)
with the Inverse Amplitude Method (IAM). In order to properly account for the
Adler zero region, we also review the recently obtained modified version of the
IAM; which is based on analyticity, elastic unitarity and ChPT at low energies,
thus yielding the correct pion mass dependence of the resonance pole positions
up to next-to-leading order in ChPT. As main results we find that the rho-pi-pi
coupling constant is almost pion mass independent and that the rho mass shows a
smooth pion mass dependence while that of the sigma shows a strong
non-analyticity. These findings are important for studies of the meson spectrum
on the lattice.
