The leading-log QCD corrections to K-Kbar mixing in R-symmetric
supersymmetric models are computed using effective field theory techniques. The
spectrum topology where the gluino is significantly heavier than the squarks is
motivated and focused on. It is found that, like in the MSSM, QCD corrections
can tighten the kaon mass difference bound by roughly a factor of three. CP
violation is also briefly considered, where QCD corrections can constrain
phases to be as much as a factor of ten smaller than the uncorrected value.
