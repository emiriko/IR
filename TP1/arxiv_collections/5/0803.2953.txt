This paper studies the Yang-Lee singularity of the 2-dimensional Ising model
on the cylinder via transfer matrix and finite-size scaling techniques. These
techniques enable a measurement of the 2-point and 3-point correlations and a
comparison of a measurement of a corresponding universal amplitude with a
prediction for the amplitude from the (A4,A1) minimal conformal field theory.
