Initial results from new calculations of interacting anti-parallel Euler
vortices are presented with the objective of understanding the origins of
singular scaling presented by Kerr (1993) and the lack thereof by Hou and Li
(2006). Core profiles designed to reproduce the two results are presented, new
more robust analysis is proposed, and new criteria for when calculations should
be terminated are introduced and compared with classical resolution studies and
spectral convergence tests. Most of the analysis is on a $512 \times 128 \times
2048$ mesh, with new analysis on a just completed $1024 \times 256 \times 2048$
used to confirm trends. One might hypothesize that there is a finite-time
singularity with enstrophy growth like $\Omega \sim (T_c-t)^{-\gamma_\Omega}$
and vorticity growth like $||\omega||_\infty \sim (T_c-t)^{-\gamma}$. The new
analysis would then support $\gamma_\Omega \approx 1/2$ and $\gamma > 1$. These
represent modifications of the conclusions of Kerr (1993). Issues that might
arise at higher resolution are discussed.
