We construct and study two frustrated quantum spin-1/2 models on square
lattice, which are like the antiferromagnetic $J_1$-$J_2$ model with some
additional four-spin exchange interactions. These models admit an exactly
solvable case in which the ground state consists of four degenerate
columnar-dimer singlet (CDS) configurations. Away from the exact case, we
employ bond-operator mean-field theory to investigate the evolution of the
ground state by varying the interaction parameters. The mean-field calculation
reveals a quantum phase diagram in which the CDS phase undergoes a continuous
phase transition to either N\'eel or collinear ordered antiferromagnetic
phases.
