The notions of self-organised criticality (SOC) and turbulence are
traditionally considered to be applicable to disjoint classes of phenomena.
Nevertheless, scale-free burst statistics is a feature shared by turbulent as
well as self-organised critical dynamics. It has also been suggested that
another shared feature is universal non-gaussian probability density functions
(PDFs) of global fluctuations. Here, we elucidate the unifying aspects through
analysis of data from a laboratory dusty plasma monolayer. We compare analysis
of experimental data with simulations of a two-dimensional (2D) many-body
system, of 2D fluid turbulence, and a 2D SOC model, all subject to random
forcing at small scales. The scale-free vortex cascade is apparent from
structure functions as well as spatio-temporal avalanche analysis, the latter
giving similar results for the experimental and all model systems studied. The
experiment exhibits global fluctuation statistics consistent with a
non-gaussian universal PDF, but the model systems yield this result only in a
restricted range of forcing conditions.
