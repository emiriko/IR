A general unifying framework for integrable soliton-like systems on time
scales is introduced. The $R$-matrix formalism is applied to the algebra of
$\delta$-differential operators in terms of which one can construct infinite
hierarchy of commuting vector fields. The theory is illustrated by two
infinite-field integrable hierarchies on time scales which are difference
counterparts of KP and mKP. The difference counterparts of AKNS and Kaup-Broer
soliton systems are constructed as related finite-field restrictions.
