A new method of solution of the Bethe-Salpeter equation for a pseudoscalar
quark-antiquark bound state is proposed. With the help of an integral
representation, the results are directly obtained in Minkowski space. Dressing
of Green's functions is naturally taken into account, thus providing the
possible inclusion of a running coupling constant as well as quark propagators.
First numerical results are presented for a simplified ladder approximation.
