A fully consistent model to study electrodynamics for superconductors in the
stationary and non-stationary regime has been developed based on Proca
equations and a massive photon. In particular, this approach has been applied
to study the electric field penetration depth in superconductors. The model
shows a deviation from the charge contribution to an internal electric field
compared to previous approaches.
