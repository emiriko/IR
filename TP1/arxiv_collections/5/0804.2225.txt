We theoretically report that, at a sharp electrostatic step potential in
graphene, massless Dirac fermions can obtain Goos-H\"{a}nchen-like shifts under
total internal reflection. Based on these results, we study the coherent
propagation of the quasiparticles along a sharp graphene \emph{p-n-p} waveguide
and derive novel dispersion relations for the guided modes. Consequently,
coherent graphene devices (e.g. movable mirrors, buffers and memories) induced
only by the electric field effect can be proposed.
