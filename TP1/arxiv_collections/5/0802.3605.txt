The problem of the effective mass scaling in the single particle spectra
calculated within the Skyrme energy density functional (EDF) method is studied.
It is demonstrated that for specific pairs of orbitals the commonly anticipated
isoscalar effective mass (m*) scaling of the single-particle level splittings
is almost canceled by an implicit m*-scaling due to other parameters in the
Skyrme EDF. This holds in particular for an indirect m*-scaling of the two-body
spin-orbit strength making the theory essentially unpredictable with respect to
single particle energies. It is argued that this unphysical property of the
Skyrme EDF is a mere consequence of the strategies and datasets used to fit
these functionals. The inclusion of certain single-particle spin-orbit
splittings to fit the two-body spin-orbit and the tensor interaction strengths
reinstates the conventional m*-scaling and improves the performance of the
Skyrme EDF.
