We study nuclear shadowing at small Bjorken x < 0.01 in the color dipole
approach. Such a light-cone quantum-chromodynamics formalism based on the Green
function technique incorporates naturally color transparency and coherence
length effects. The nuclear shadowing for the barq-q Fock component of the
photon is calculated using exact numerical solution of the evolution equation
for the Green function. At x < 0.01 we demonstrate that a contribution of
higher Fock states containing gluons to overall nuclear shadowing becomes
effective. Numerical results for nuclear shadowing are compared with available
data from the E665 and NMC collaborations. Model calculations are finally
tested with the results obtained from other models.
