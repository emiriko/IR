We have developed a numerical approach to compute real-time path integral
expressions for quantum transport problems out of equilibrium. The scheme is
based on a deterministic iterative summation of the path integral (ISPI) for
the generating function of the nonequilibrium current. Self-energies due to the
leads, being non-local in time, are fully taken into account within a finite
memory time, thereby including non-Markovian effects, and numerical results are
extrapolated both to vanishing (Trotter) time discretization and to infinite
memory time. This extrapolation scheme converges except at very low
temperatures, and the results are then numerically exact. The method is applied
to nonequilibrium transport through an Anderson dot.
