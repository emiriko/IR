We apply the atom counting theory to strongly correlated Fermi systems and
spin models, which can be realized with ultracold atoms. The counting
distributions are typically sub-Poissonian and remain smooth at quantum phase
transitions, but their moments exhibit critical behavior, and characterize
quantum statistical properties of the system. Moreover, more detailed
characterizations are obtained with experimentally feasible spatially resolved
counting distributions.
