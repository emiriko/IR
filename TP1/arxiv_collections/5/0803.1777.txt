We derive dual parameterization for the DVCS amplitude to the twist-3
accuracy. The relation of the dual parameterization to the Abel transform
tomography for amplitudes of hard exclusive processes is elaborated. We prove
dispersion relations for the twist-3 DVCS amplitude in the Wandzura -- Wilczek
approximation and show that the subtraction constant is given by the D-term
form factor. The same as in the case of twist-2 DVCS amplitude.
