Interior solutions of Einstein's equations with a non-zero cosmological
constant are given for static and spherically symmetric configurations of
uniform density. The metric tensor and pressure are determined for both
positive and negative values of the cosmological constant. Limits on the outer
radius of the interior solutions are established. It is shown that, contrary to
the cases of the limits on the interior Schwarzschild and Reissner--Nordstr\"om
solutions with a zero cosmological constant, these limits do not fully coincide
with the conditions of embeddability of the optical reference geometry
associated with the exterior (vacuum) Schwarzschild--de Sitter spacetime.
