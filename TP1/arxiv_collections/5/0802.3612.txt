We consider the model of quantum computer, which is represented as a Ising
spin lattice, where qubits (spin-half systems) are separated by the isolators
(two spin-half systems). In the idle mode or at the single bit operations the
total spin of isolators is 0. There are no need of complicated protocols for
correcting the phase and probability errors due to permanent interaction
between the qubits. We present protocols for implementation of universal
quantum gates with the rectangular radio-frequency pulses.
