A star-like isotopy for oriented links in 3-space is an isotopy which uses
only Reidemeister II moves with opposite orientations and Reidemeister III
moves with alternating orientations when checking the strands clockwise (or
anticlockwise). We define a link polynomial derived from the Jones polynomial
which is, in general, only invariant under star-like isotopies and we
categorify it.
