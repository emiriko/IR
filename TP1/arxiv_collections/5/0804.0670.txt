We present a detailed study of the interface morphology of an
electro-deposited (ED) Ni/Cu bilayer film by using off-specular (diffuse)
neutron reflectivity technique and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). The Ni/Cu
bilayer has been electro-deposited on seed layers of Ti/Cu. These two seed
layers were deposited by magnetron sputtering. The depth profile of density in
the sample has been obtained from specular neutron reflectivity data. AFM image
of the air-film interface shows that the surface is covered by globular islands
of different sizes. The AFM height distribution of the surface clearly shows
two peaks [Fig. 3] and the relief structure (islands) on the surface in the
film can be treated as a quasi-two-level random rough surface structure. We
have demonstrated that the detailed morphology of air-film interfaces, the
quasi-two level surface structure as well as morphology of the buried
interfaces can be obtained from off-specular neutron reflectivity data. We have
shown from AFM and off-specular neutron reflectivity data that the morphologies
of electro-deposited surface is distinctly different from that of
sputter-deposited interface in this sample. To the best of our knowledge this
is the first attempt to microscopically quantify the differences in
morphologies of metallic interfaces deposited by two different techniques viz.
electro-deposition and sputtering.
