Theoretical investigation of thermodynamic properties of electrically
modulated monolayer graphene in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field
B is presented.This work is aimed at determining the modulation induced effects
on the thermodynamic properties of electrically modulated graphene.The results
obtained are compared with those of the conventional 2DEG. The one-dimensional
periodic potential due to electric modulation lifts the degeneracy of the
Landau Levels and converts them into bands whose width oscillates as a function
of B. We find Weiss type oscillations for small values of B and dHvA type
oscillations at larger values values of $B$. We find that the modulation
induced effects on the thermodynamic properties are enhanced and less damped
with temperature in graphene compared with conventional 2DEG system.
