We evaluate the effect of diffraction-limited resolution of the optical
system on the estimates of the coherence length of 2D excitons deduced from the
interferometric study of the exciton emission. The results are applied for
refining our earlier estimates of the coherence length of a cold gas of
indirect excitons in coupled quantum wells [S. Yang et al., Phys. Rev. Lett.
97, 187402(2006)]. We show that the apparent coherence length is well
approximated by the quadratic sum of the actual exciton coherence length and
the diffraction correction given by the conventional Abbe limit divided by
3.14. In practice, accounting for diffraction is necessary only when the
coherence length is smaller than about one wavelength. The earlier conclusions
regarding the strong enhancement of the exciton coherence length at low
temperatures remain intact.
