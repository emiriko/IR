We find a codimension one lump solution of closed bosonic string field
theory. We consider vertices up to quartic order and include in the string
field the tachyon, the ghost dilaton, and a metric fluctuation. While the
tachyon profile clearly is that of a lump, we observe that the ghost dilaton is
roughly constant in the direction transverse to the lump, equal to the value it
takes in the nonperturbative tachyon vacuum. We explain, with a simple model,
why this should be expected.
