We discuss Bohmian paths of the two-level atoms moving in a waveguide through
an external resonance-producing field, perpendicular to the waveguide, and
localized in a region of finite diameter. The time spent by a particle in a
potential region is not well-defined in the standard quantum mechanics, but it
is well-defined in the Bohmian mechanics. Bohm's theory is used for calculating
the average time spent by a transmitted particle inside the field region and
the arrival-time distributions at the edges of the field region. Using the
Runge-Kutta method for the integration of the guidance law, some Bohmian
trajectories were also calculated. Numerical results are presented for the
special case of a Gaussian wave packet.
