We study relativistic collisions between helium-like uranium ions initially
in the ground state and atoms in which, in a single collision event, one of the
electrons of the ion is emitted and the other is transferred into an excited
state of the residual hydrogen-like ion. We consider this two-electron process
at not very high impact energies, where the action of the atom on the electrons
of the ion can be well approximated as occurring solely due to the interaction
with the nucleus of the atom and, hence, the process can be regarded as a
four-body problem. Using the independent electron model we show that a very
substantial improvement in the calculated cross sections is obtained if,
instead of the first order approximation, the relativistic symmetric eikonal
and continuum-distorted-wave-eikonal-initial-state models are employed to
describe the single-electron probabilities for the excitation and loss,
respectively.
