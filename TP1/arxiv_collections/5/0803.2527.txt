There is no denying that spreadsheets have become critical for all
operational processes including financial reporting, budgeting, forecasting,
and analysis. Microsoft Excel has essentially become a scratch pad and a data
browser that can quickly be put to use for information gathering and
decision-making. However, there is little control in how data comes into Excel,
and how it gets updated. The information supply chain feeding into Excel
remains ad hoc and without any centralized IT control. This paper discusses
some of the pitfalls of the data collection and maintenance process in Excel.
It then suggests service-oriented architecture (SOA) based information
gathering and control techniques to ameliorate the pitfalls of this scratch pad
while improving the integrity of data, boosting the productivity of the
business users, and building controls to satisfy the requirements of Section
404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
