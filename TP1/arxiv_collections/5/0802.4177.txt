I will present a short review of recent achievements in understanding the
origin of the statistical properties versus the thermodynamical ones for Anti
De Sitter space--time, ADS$_{n+1}$ from the point of view of the "dual" field
theory defined on the boundary of ADS$_{{n+1}}$ conformal invariant, CFT$_n$.
  We try to convince the audience that the symmetries of Quantum Field Theory
at the critical points are, on one side, at the basis of the thermodynamical
properties of Black Hole solution, i.e. the Hawking temperature $T_H$ and the
entropy $S_H$; on the other side the CFT$_n$ in Euclidean time determines the
statistical properties of BH.
