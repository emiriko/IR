The relation between the scattering cross section and the scattering angle
under different energy condition of the incident rays is analyzed. From Compton
scattering total cross section, a formula of quasi-parallel incident gamma ray
Compton scattering response function versus to thickness of oil crust target is
derived and analyzed. Numerical fitting result shows that there exists cubic
relation between response function of gamma ray and thickness of oil crust. Key
words: Gamma ray, Compton scattering, oil crust
