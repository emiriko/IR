We extend the theory for laser cooling in a near-resonant optical lattice to
include multiple excited hyperfine states. Simulations are performed treating
the external degrees of freedom of the atom, i.e., position and momentum,
classically, while the internal atomic states are treated quantum mechanically,
allowing for arbitrary superpositions. Whereas theoretical treatments including
only a single excited hyperfine state predict that the temperature should be a
function of lattice depth only, except close to resonance, experiments have
shown that the minimum temperature achieved depends also on the detuning from
resonance of the lattice light. Our results resolve this discrepancy.
