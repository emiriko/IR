We discuss ILC measurements for a specific MSSM scenario with CP phases,
where the lightest neutralino is a good candidate for dark matter, annihilating
efficiently through t-channel exchange of light staus. These prospective
(CP-even) ILC measurements are then used to fit the underlying model
parameters. A collider prediction of the relic density of the neutralino from
this fit gives 0.116<Omega h^2<0.19 at 95% CL. CP-odd observables, while being
a direct signal of CP violation, do not help in further constraining Omega h^2.
The interplay with (in)direct detection of dark matter and with measurements of
electric dipole moments is also discussed. Finally we comment on collider
measurements at higher energies for refining the prediction of Omega h^2.
