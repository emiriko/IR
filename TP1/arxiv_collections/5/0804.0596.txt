Recently S.A. Merkulov established a link between differential geometry and
homological algebra by giving descriptions of several differential geometric
structures in terms of minimal resolutions of props. In particular he described
the prop profile of Poisson geometry. In this paper we define a prop such that
representations of its minimal resolution in a vector space V are in a
one-to-one correspondence with bi-Hamiltonian structures, i.e. pairs of
compatible Poisson structures, on the formal manifold associated to V.
