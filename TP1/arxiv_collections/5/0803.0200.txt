Angular momentum densities of electromagnetic beams are connected to helicity
(circular polarization) and topological charge (azimuthal phase shift and
vorticity). Computing the electromagnetic fields emitted by a circular antenna
array, analytic expressions are found for the densities of energy, linear and
angular momentum in terms of helicity and vorticity. It is found that the
angular momentum density can be separated into spin and orbital parts, a result
that is known to be true in a beam geometry. The results are of importance for
information-rich radio astronomy and space physics as well as novel radio,
radar, and wireless communication concepts.
