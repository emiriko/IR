On the basis of the balance equations for energy-momentum, spin, particle and
entropy density, an approach is considered which represents a comparatively
general framework for special- and general-relativistic continuum
thermodynamics. In the first part of the paper, a general entropy density
4-vector, containing particle, energy-momentum, and spin density contributions,
is introduced which makes it possible, firstly, to judge special assumptions
for the entropy density 4-vector made by other authors with respect to their
generality and validity and, secondly, to determine entropy supply and entropy
production. Using this entropy density 4-vector, in the second part,
material-independent equilibrium conditions are discussed. While in literature,
at least if one works in the theory of irreversible thermodynamics assuming a
Riemann space-time structure, generally thermodynamic equilibrium is determined
by introducing a variety of conditions by hand, the present approach proceeds
as follows: For a comparatively wide class of space-time geometries the
necessary equilibrium conditions of vanishing entropy supply and entropy
production are exploited and, afterwards, supplementary conditions are assumed
which are motivated by the requirement that thermodynamic equilibrium
quantities have to be determined uniquely.
