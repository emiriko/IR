We report new measurements of the neutron charge form factor at low momentum
transfer using quasielastic electrodisintegration of the deuteron.
Longitudinally polarized electrons at an energy of 850 MeV were scattered from
an isotopically pure, highly polarized deuterium gas target. The scattered
electrons and coincident neutrons were measured by the Bates Large Acceptance
Spectrometer Toroid (BLAST) detector. The neutron form factor ratio
$G^{n}_{E}/G^{n}_{M}$ was extracted from the beam-target vector asymmetry
$A_{ed}^{V}$ at four-momentum transfers $Q^{2}=0.14$, 0.20, 0.29 and 0.42
(GeV/c)$^{2}$.
