A deformed relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov (DRHB) model is developed aiming
at a proper description of exotic nuclei, particularly deformed ones with large
spatial extension. In order to give an adequate description of both the
contribution of the continuum and the large spatial distribution in exotic
nuclei, the DRHB equations are solved in a Woods-Saxon basis in which the
radial wave functions have proper asymptotic behaviors at large distance from
the nuclear center which is crucial for the formation of halo. The formalism
and the numerical procedure of the DRHB model in a Woods-Saxon basis are
briefly presented.
