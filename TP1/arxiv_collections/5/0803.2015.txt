We use a two-color lattice to break the homogeneous site occupation of an
atomic Mott Insulator of bosonic 87Rb. We detect the disruption of the ordered
Mott domains via noise correlation analysis of the atomic density distribution
after time-of-flight. The appearance of additional correlation peaks evidences
the redistribution of the atoms into a strongly inhomogeneous insulating state,
in quantitative agreement with the predictions.
