We discuss the structure of the non-anticommutative N=2 non-linear
sigma-model in two dimensions, constructing differential operators which
implement the deformed supersymmetry generators and using them to reproduce the
classical action. We then compute the one-loop quantum corrections and express
them in a more compact form using the differential operators.
