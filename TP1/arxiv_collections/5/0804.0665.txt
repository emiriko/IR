According to Pruessner and Peters [Phys. Rev. E {\bf 73}, 025106(R) (2006)],
the finite size scaling exponents of the order parameter in sandpile models
depend on the tuning of driving and dissipation rates with system size. We
point out that the same is not true for {\em avalanches} in the slow driving
limit.
