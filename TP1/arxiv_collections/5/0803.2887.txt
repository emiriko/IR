A simple algebraic procedure is described for deriving Maxwell-Bloch-type
equations from single-atom cavity quantum electrodynamics (cavity QED) master
equations via orthogonal projection onto a manifold of semiclassical states. In
particular the usual Maxwell-Bloch Equations are obtained--up to a
state-dependent correction factor of order unity--straightforwardly from the
unconditional Jaynes-Cummings master equation. The technique of projecting onto
a semiclassical manifold can also be applied with conditional master equations
(quantum filters), leading to stochastic simulation models that include
multiplicative noise terms associated with fluctuations of the atomic dipole.
The utility of such models is briefly explored in the context of single-atom
absorptive bistability.
