We have investigated the extreme quantum limit of photogenerated electrons in
quantum paraelectric SrTiO3. This regime is distinct from conventional
semiconductors, due to the large electron effective mass and large lattice
dielectric constant. At low temperature, the magnetoresistance and Hall
resistivity saturate at high magnetic field, deviating from conventional
behavior. As a result, the Hall coefficient vanishes on the scale of the ratio
of the Landau level splitting to the thermal energy, indicating the essential
role of lowest Landau level occupancy, as limited by thermal broadening.
