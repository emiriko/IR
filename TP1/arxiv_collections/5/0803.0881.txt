This letter reports on the growth, structure and luminescent properties of
individual multiple quantum well (MQW) AlGaAs nanowires (NWs). The composition
modulations (MQWs) are obtained by alternating the elemental flux of Al and Ga
during the molecular beam epitaxy growth of the AlGaAs wire on GaAs (111)B
substrates. Transmission electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray
spectroscopy performed on individual NWs are consistent with a configuration
composed of conical segments stacked along the NW axis. Micro-photoluminescence
measurements and confocal microscopy showed enhanced light emission from the
MQW NWs as compared to non-segmented NWs due to carrier confinement and
sidewall passivation.
