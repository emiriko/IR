We study the effect of chargeable monomers on the conformation of dendrimers
of low generation by computer simulations, employing bare Coulomb interactions.
The presence of the latter leads to an increase in size of the dendrimer due to
a combined effect of electrostatic repulsion and the presence of counterions
within the dendrimer, and also enhances a shell-like structure for the monomers
of different generations. In the resulting structures the bond-length between
monomers, especially near the center, will increase to facilitate a more
effective usage of space in the outer-regions of the dendrimer.
