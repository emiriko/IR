We introduce an adaptation algorithm by which an ensemble of coupled
oscillators with attractive and repulsive interactions is induced to adopt a
prescribed synchronized state. While the performance of adaptation is
controlled by measuring a macroscopic quantity, which characterizes the
achieved degree of synchronization, adaptive changes are introduced at the
microscopic level of the interaction network, by modifying the configuration of
repulsive interactions. This scheme emulates the distinct levels of selection
and mutation in biological evolution and learning.
