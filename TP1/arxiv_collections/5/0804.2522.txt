A randomized clinical trial comparing an experimental new treatment to a
standard therapy for a life-threatening medical condition should be stopped
early on ethical grounds, in either of the following scenarios: (1) it has
become overwhelmingly clear that the new treatment is better than the standard;
(2) it has become overwhelmingly clear that the trial is not going to show that
the new treatment is any better than the standard. The trial is continued in
the third scenario: (3) there is a reasonable chance that the new treatment
will finally turn out to be better than the standard, but we aren't sure yet.
  However, the (blinded) data monitoring committee in the "PROPATRIA" trial of
an experimental probiotica treatment for patients with acute pancreatitis
allowed the trial to continue at the half way interim analysis, in effect
because there was still a good chance of proving that the probiotica treatment
was very harmful to their patients. The committee did not know whether
treatment A was the probiotica treatment or the placebo. In itself this should
not have caused a problem, since it could easily have determined the
appropriate decision under both scenarios. Were the decisions in the two
scenarios different, then the data would have to be de-blinded, in order to
determine the appropriate decision. The committee mis-read the output of SPSS,
which reports the smaller of two one-sided p-values, without informing the user
what it is doing. It seems that about 5 lives were sacrificed to the chance of
getting a significant result that the probiotica treatment was bad for the
patients in the trial.
