We study the factorised steady state of a general class of mass transport
models in which mass, a conserved quantity, is transferred stochastically
between sites. Condensation in such models is exhibited when above a critical
mass density the marginal distribution for the mass at a single site develops a
bump, $p_{\rm cond}(m)$, at large mass $m$. This bump corresponds to a
condensate site carrying a finite fraction of the mass in the system. Here, we
study the condensation transition from a different aspect, that of extreme
value statistics. We consider the cumulative distribution of the largest mass
in the system and compute its asymptotic behaviour. We show 3 distinct
behaviours: at subcritical densities the distribution is Gumbel; at the
critical density the distribution is Fr\'echet, and above the critical density
a different distribution emerges. We relate $p_{\rm cond}(m)$ to the
probability density of the largest mass in the system.
