The dynamics of Vlasov kinetic moments is shown to be Lie-Poisson on the dual
Lie algebra of symmetric contravariant tensor fields. The corresponding Lie
bracket is identified with the symmetric Schouten bracket and the moment Lie
algebra is related with a bundle of bosonic Fock spaces, where creation and
annihilation operators are used to construct the cold plasma closure. Kinetic
moments are also shown to define a momentum map, which is infinitesimally
equivariant. This momentum map is the dual of a Lie algebra homomorphism,
defined through the Schouten bracket. Finally the moment Lie-Poisson bracket is
extended to anisotropic interactions.
