In this paper we present the parton level Monte Carlo program TeVJet, a
direct implementation of the dipole subtraction method for calculating jet
cross sections in NLO QCD. It has been written so as to allow the inclusion of
new processes in as straightforward a way as possible. The user must provide
the usual ingredients for an NLO calculation and from these the
process-independent parts required to make the phase space integrals finite in
4 dimensions are automatically generated. These integrals are then performed
using Monte Carlo techniques. We present the results for a few example
processes.
