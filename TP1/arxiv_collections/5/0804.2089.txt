We report on an improved measurement of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa {\it
CP}-violating phase $\gamma$ through a Dalitz plot analysis of neutral $D$
meson decays to $K_S^0 \pi^+ \pi^-$ and $K_S^0 K^+ K^-$ in the processes $B^\mp
\to D K^\mp$, $B^\mp \to D^* K^\mp$ with $D^* \to D\pi^0,D\gamma$, and $B^\mp
\to D K^{*\mp}$ with $K^{*\mp} \to K_S^0 \pi^\mp$. Using a sample of 383
million $B\bar{B}$ pairs collected by the BABAR detector, we measure
$\gamma=(76 \pm 22 \pm 5 \pm 5)^\circ$ (mod $180^\circ$), where the first error
is statistical, the second is the experimental systematic uncertainty and the
third reflects the uncertainty on the description of the Dalitz plot
distributions. The corresponding two standard deviation region is $29^\circ <
\gamma < 122^\circ$. This result has a significance of direct {\it CP}
violation ($\gamma \ne 0$) of 3.0 standard deviations.
