We derive compact multiple integral formulas for several physical spin
correlation functions in the semi-infinite XXZ chain with a longitudinal
boundary magnetic field. Our formulas follow from several effective
re-summations of the multiple integral representation for the elementary blocks
obtained in our previous article (I). In the free fermion point we compute the
local magnetization as well as the density of energy profiles. These
quantities, in addition to their bulk behavior, exhibit Friedel type
oscillations induced by the boundary; their amplitudes depend on the boundary
magnetic field and decay algebraically in terms of the distance to the
boundary.
