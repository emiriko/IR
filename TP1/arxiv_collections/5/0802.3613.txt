This paper deals with the optimal control of systems governed by nonlinear
systems of conservation laws at junctions. The applications considered range
from gas compressors in pipelines to open channels management. The existence of
an optimal control is proved. From the analytical point of view, these results
are based on the well posedness of a suitable initial boundary value problem
and on techniques for quasidifferential equations in a metric space.
