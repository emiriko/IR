A single crystal of 7% Fe-doped
(La$_{0.7}$Pr$_{0.3}$)$_{0.65}$Ca$_{0.35}$MnO$_3$ shows up as a typical relaxor
ferromagnet, where ferromagnetic metallic and charge-orbital-ordered insulating
clusters coexist with controllable volume fraction by external stimuli. There,
the persistent ferromagnetic metallic state can be produced by an
electric-current excitation as the filamentary region, the magnetization in
which is increased by ~0.4$\mu_{\rm B}$ per Mn. A clear distinction from the
current heating effect in a magnetic field, which conversely leads to a
decrease in ferromagnetic fraction, enables us to bi-directionally switch both
the magnetization and resistance by applying the voltages with different
magnitudes.
