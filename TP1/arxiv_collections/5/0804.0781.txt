Polymer chains adsorbed onto oppositely charged spherical colloidal particles
can significantly modify the particle-particle interactions. For sufficient
amounts of added polymers, the original electrostatic repulsion can even turn
into an effective attraction and relatively large kinetically stable aggregates
can form which display several unexpected and interesting peculiarities and
some intriguing biotechnological implications. The attractive interaction
contribution between two oppositely particles arises from the correlated
adsorption of polyions at the oppositely charged particle surfaces, resulting
in a non-homogeneous surface charge distribution. Here, we investigate the
aggregation kinetics of polyion-induced colloidal complexes through Monte Carlo
simulation, in which the effect of charge anisotropy is taken into account by a
DLVO-like intra-particle potential, as recentely proposed by Velegol and Thwar
[D. Velegol and P.K. Thwar, Langmuir, 17, 2001]. The results reveal that in the
presence of a charge heterogeneity the aggregation process slows down due to
the progressive increase of the potential barrier height upon clustering.
Within this framework, the experimentally observed cluster phases in
polyelectrolyte-liposomes solutions should be considered as a kinetic arrested
state.
