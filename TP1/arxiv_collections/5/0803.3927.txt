We applied our recently proposed empirical formula, a formula quite
successful in describing essential trends of the lowest excitation energies of
the natural parity even multipole states, to the lowest excitation energies of
the natural parity odd multipole states in even-even nuclei throughout the
entire periodic table. Even though the systematic behavior of the lowest
excitation energies of odd multipole states is quite different from those of
even multipole states, we have shown that the same empirical formula also holds
reasonably well for the odd multipole states with the exception of a few
certain instances.
