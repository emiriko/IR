Motivation: Recent studies of genomic-scale regulatory networks suggested
that a feed-forward loop (FFL) circuitry is a key component of many such
networks. This led to a study of the functional properties of different FFL
types, where the regulatory elements are transcription factors.
  Results: Here we investigate these properties when the mediating regulatory
element of the loop is a microRNA. We find that many of the FFL properties are
enhanced within this setup. We then proceed to identify all such FFLs in the D.
Melanogaster regulatory network. We observe that in FFLs rooted at the same
transcription factor there are significant correlations between the number of
predicted binding sites for the transcription factor and for the microRNA.
  Conclusions: Based on a modeling approach we suggest that these correlations
may be an outcome of the type of FFL preferred by the transcription factor.
This may help elucidate the type of regulation the TF confers.
