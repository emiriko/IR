We study the radio-frequency diagonal conductivities of the anisotropic
stripe phases of higher Landau levels near half integer fillings. In the hard
direction, in which larger dc resistivity occurs, the spectrum exhibits a
striking resonance, while in the orthogonal, easy direction, no resonance is
discernable. The resonance is interpreted as a pinning mode of the stripe
phase.
