In this paper, an architecture designed for electrical measurement of the
quality factor of MEMS resonators is proposed. An estimation of the measurement
performance is made using PSPICE simulations taking into account the
component's non-idealities. An error on the measured Q value of only several
percent is achievable, at a small integration cost, for sufficiently high
quality factor values (Q > 100).
