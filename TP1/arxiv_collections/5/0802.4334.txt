We study the structure of the confining string in Yang-Mills theory using the
method of the field strength correlators. The method allows us to demonstrate
that both the local fluctuations of the topological charge and the gluon
condensate are suppressed in the vicinity of the string axis in agreement with
results of lattice simulations.
