Using the Lanczos exact-diagonalization and density-matrix renormalization
group methods, we study the extended Hubbard model at quarter filling defined
on the anisotropic triangular lattice. We focus on charge ordering (CO)
phenomena induced by onsite and intersite Coulomb interactions. We determine
the ground-state phase diagram including three CO phases, i.e., diagonal,
vertical, and three-fold CO phases, based on the calculated results of the hole
density and double occupancy. We also calculate the dynamical density-density
correlation functions and find possible coexistence of the diagonal and
three-fold charge fluctuations in a certain parameter region where the onsite
and intersite interactions compete. Furthermore, the characteristic features of
the optical conductivity for each CO phase are discussed.
