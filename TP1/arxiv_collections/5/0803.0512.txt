The measured rate for D_s -> l nu decays, where l is a muon or tau, is larger
than the standard model prediction, which relies on lattice QCD, at the 3.8
sigma level. We discuss how robust the theoretical prediction is, and we show
that the discrepancy with experiment may be explained by a charged Higgs boson
or a leptoquark.
