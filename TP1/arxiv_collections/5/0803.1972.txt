A theory describing above-threshold ionization of atoms and ions in a strong
electromagnetic field is presented. It is based on the widely known strong
field approximation and incorporates the Coulomb interaction between the
photoelectron and the nucleus using the method of complex classical
trajectories. A central result of the theory is the Coulomb-corrected
ionization amplitude whose evaluation requires little extra numerical effort.
By comparing our predictions with the results of ab initio numerical solutions
for two examples we show that the new theory provides a significant improvement
of the Coulomb-free strong field approximation. For the case of above-threshold
ionization in elliptically polarized fields a comparison with available
experimental data is also presented.
