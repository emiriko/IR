We address the question of how small can the quasiparticle decay rate be at
low energies in undoped graphene, where kinematical constraints are known to
prevent the decay into particle-hole excitations. For this purpose, we study
the renormalization of the phonon dispersion by many-body effects, which turns
out to be very strong in the case of the out-of-plane phonons at the K point of
the spectrum. We show that these evolve into a branch of very soft modes that
provide the relevant channel for quasiparticle decay, at energies below the
scale of the optical phonon modes. In this regime, we find that the decay rate
is proportional to the cube of the quasiparticle energy. This implies that a
crossover should be observed in transport properties from the linear dependence
characteristic of the high-energy regime to the much slower decay rate due to
the soft phonon modes.
