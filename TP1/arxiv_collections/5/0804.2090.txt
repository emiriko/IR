The possible production processes of the antiK-NN are explored. We derive
microscopically, with the RGM, the microscopic derivation of the K-N and
antiK-N interactions. We discuss the binding or not binding of the different
antiK-N and antiK-NN systems. When binding occurs, the respective decay widths
are also discussed.
