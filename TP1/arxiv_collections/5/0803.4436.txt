Given a finite associative ring with unity, $R$, any free (left) cyclic
submodule (FCS) generated by a $uni$modular ($n+1$)-tuple of elements of $R$
represents a point of the $n$-dimensional projective space over $R$. Suppose
that $R$ also features FCSs generated by ($n+1$)-tuples that are $not$
unimodular: what kind of geometry can be ascribed to such FCSs? Here, we
(partially) answer this question for $n=2$ when $R$ is the (unique)
non-commutative ring of order eight. The corresponding geometry is dubbed a
"Fano-Snowflake" due to its diagrammatic appearance and the fact that it
contains the Fano plane in its center. There exist, in fact, two such
configurations -- each being tied to either of the two maximal ideals of the
ring -- which have the Fano plane in common and can, therefore, be viewed as
twins. Potential relevance of these noteworthy configurations to quantum
information theory and stringy black holes is also outlined.
