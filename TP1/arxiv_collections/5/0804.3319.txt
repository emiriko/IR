Promoting and increasing energy efficiency is a promising method of reducing
CO2 emissions and avoiding the potentially devastating effects of climate
change. The question is: How do we induce a cultural or behavioural change
whereby people nationally and globally adopt more energy efficient lifestyles?
  We propose a new family of mathematical models, based on a statistical
mechanics extension of discrete choice theory, that offer a set of formal tools
to systematically analyse and quantify this problem. An application example
could be to predict the percentage of people choosing to buy new energy
efficient light bulbs instead of the traditional incandescent versions. Through
statistical evaluation of survey responses, the models can identify the key
driving factors in the decision-making process; for example, the extent to
which people imitate each other. These models allow us to incorporate the
effect of social interactions could help us identify 'tipping points' at a
societal level. This knowledge could be used to trigger structural changes in
our society. The results may provide tangible and deliverable evidence-based
policy options to decision-makers.
  We believe that these models offer an opportunity for the research
community-in both the social and physical sciences-and decision-makers in the
private and public sectors to work together towards preventing the potentially
devastating social, economic and environmental effects of climate change.
