A model proposed by Sornette, Takayasu, and Zhou for describing
hyperinflation regimes based on adaptive expectations expressed in terms of a
power law which leads to a finite-time singularity is revisited. It is
suggested to express the price index evolution explicitly in terms of the
parameters introduced along the theoretical formulation avoiding any
combination of them used in the original work. This procedure allows to study
unambiguously the uncertainties of such parameters when an error is assigned to
the measurement of the price index. In this way, it is possible to determine an
uncertainty in the critical time at which the singularity occurs. For this
purpose, Monte Carlo simulation techniques are applied. The hyperinflation
episodes of Peru (1969-90) and Weimar Germany (1920-3) are reexamined. The
first analyses performed within this framework of the very extreme
hyper-inflations occurred in Greece (1941-4) and Yugoslavia (1991-4) are
reported. The study of the hyperinflation spiral experienced just nowadays in
Zimbabwe predicts a singularity, i.e., a complete economic crash within two
years.
