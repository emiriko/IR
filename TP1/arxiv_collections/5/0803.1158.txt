We describe an experimental and computational investigation of the ordered
and disordered phases of a vibrating thin, dense granular layer composed of
identical metal spheres. We compare the results from spheres with different
amounts of inelasticity and show that inelasticity has a strong effect on the
phase diagram. We also report the melting of an ordered phase to a homogeneous
disordered liquid phase at high vibration amplitude or at large inelasticities.
Our results show that dissipation has a strong effect on ordering and that in
this system ordered phases are absent entirely in highly inelastic materials.
