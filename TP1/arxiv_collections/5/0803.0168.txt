We developed an internet-based questionnaire on spreadsheet use that we
administered to a large number of users in several companies and organizations
to document how spreadsheets are currently being developed and used in
business. In this paper, we discuss the results drawn from of a comparison of
responses from individuals with the most experience and expertise with those
from individuals with the least. These results describe two views of
spreadsheet design and use in organizations, and reflect gaps between these two
groups and between these groups and the entire population of nearly 1600
respondents. Moreover, our results indicate that these gaps have multiple
dimensions: they reflect not only the context, skill, and practices of
individual users but also the policies of large organizations.
