We present a search for direct CP violation in $B^{\pm} \to J/\psi
K^{\pm}(\pi^{\pm})$ decays. The event sample is selected from 2.8 fb$^{-1}$ of
$p\bar{p}$ collisions recorded by D0 experiment in Run II of the Fermilab
Tevatron Collider. The charge asymmetry $A_{CP}(B^+ \to J/\psi K^+) = +0.0075
\pm 0.0061$(stat.)$\pm 0.0027$(syst.) is obtained using a sample of
approximately 40 thousand $B^{\pm} \to J/\psi K^{\pm}$ decays. The achieved
precision is of the same level as the expected deviation predicted by some
extensions of the standard model. We also measured the charge asymmetry
$A_{CP}(B^+ \to J/\psi \pi^+) = -0.09 \pm 0.08$(stat.)$\pm 0.03$(syst.).
