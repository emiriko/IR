For a Bose-Einstein condensate loaded into a weak traveling optical
superlattice it is demonstrated that under a stochastic initial set and in a
given parameter region the solitonic chaos appears with a certain probability.
Effects of the lattice depths and wave vectors on the chaos probability are
investigated analytically and numerically, and different chaotic regions
associated with different chaos probabilities are found. The results suggest a
feasible method for eliminating or strengthening chaos by modulating the moving
superlattice experimentally.
