Gap opening in graphene is usually discussed in terms of a
semiconducting-like spectrum, where the appearance of a finite gap at the Dirac
point is accompanied by a finite mass for the fermions. In this Letter we
propose a gap scenario from graphene which preserves the massless characters of
the carriers. This approach explains recent spectroscopic measurements carried
out in epitaxially-grown graphene, ranging from photoemission to optical
transmission.
