Many small countries are in need of additional territory. They build
landfills and expensive artificial islands. The ocean covers 71 per cent of the
Earth surface. Those countries (or persons of wealth) starting the early
colonization of the ocean may obtain advantages through additional territory or
creating their own independent state. An old idea is building a big ship. The
best solution to this problem, however, is the provision of floating cities,
islands, and states. The author idea is to use for floating cities, islands,
and states a cheap floating platform created from a natural ice field taken
from the Arctic or Antarctic oceans. These cheap platforms protected by
air-film (bottom and sides) and a conventional insulating cover (top) and
having a cooling system can exist for an unlimited time. They can be increased
in number or size at any time, float in warm oceans, travel to different
continents and countries, serve as artificial airports, harbors and other
marine improvements, as well as floating cities and industrial bases for
virtually any use.
  Author researches and computes parameters of these ice floating platforms,
other methods of building such floating territory, compares them and shows that
the offered method is the most cheap and efficient means of ocean colonization.
