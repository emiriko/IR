We consider a network of sensors deployed to sense a spatio-temporal field
and estimate a parameter of interest. We are interested in the case where the
temporal process sensed by each sensor can be modeled as a state-space process
that is perturbed by random noise and parametrized by an unknown parameter. To
estimate the unknown parameter from the measurements that the sensors
sequentially collect, we propose a distributed and recursive estimation
algorithm, which we refer to as the incremental recursive prediction error
algorithm. This algorithm has the distributed property of incremental gradient
algorithms and the on-line property of recursive prediction error algorithms.
We study the convergence behavior of the algorithm and provide sufficient
conditions for its convergence. Our convergence result is rather general and
contains as special cases the known convergence results for the incremental
versions of the least-mean square algorithm. Finally, we use the algorithm
developed in this paper to identify the source of a gas-leak (diffusing source)
in a closed warehouse and also report numerical simulations to verify
convergence.
