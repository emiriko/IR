We study a two-level atom coupled to a Bose-Einstein condensate. We show that
the rules governing the decoherence of mesoscopic superpositions involving
different classical-like states of the condensate can be probed using this
system. This scheme is applicable irrespective of whether the condensate is
initially in a coherent, thermal or more generally in any mixture of coherent
states. The effects of atom loss and finite temperature to the decoherence can
therefore be studied. We also discuss the various noise sources causing the
decoherence.
