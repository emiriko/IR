We provide a model-independent determination of the quantity B_0(m_d-m_u).
Our approach rests only on chiral symmetry and data from the decay of the eta
into three neutral pions. Since the low-energy prediction at next-to-leading
order fails to reproduce the experimental results, we keep the strong
interaction correction as an unknown parameter. As a first step, we relate this
parameter to the quark mass difference using data from the Dalitz plot. A
similar relation is obtained using data from the decay width. Combining both
relations we obtain B_0(m_d-m_u)=(4495+/-440) MeV^2. The preceding value,
combined with lattice determinations, leads to the values m_u(2
GeV)=(2.9+/-0.8) MeV and m_d(2 GeV)=(4.7+/-0.8) MeV.
