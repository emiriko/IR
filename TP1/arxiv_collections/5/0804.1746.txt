Experimental measurements of angular correlations in three-jet final states
have recently been performed in DIS.
  Next-to-leading-order QCD results for these observables are affected by large
theoretical uncertainties in the kinematic region of the data. We discuss the
effects of multiple QCD radiation at higher order using parton-shower methods
based on transverse-momentum dependent parton distributions and matrix
elements. We present Monte-Carlo results for azimuthal two-jet and three-jet
distributions, and discuss the comparison with experimental data.
