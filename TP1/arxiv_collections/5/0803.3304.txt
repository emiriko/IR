The basic concepts and mathematical constructions of the Maxwell--Lorentz
electrodynamics in flat spacetime of an arbitrary even dimension $d=2n$ are
briefly reviewed. We show that the retarded field strength ${\cal
F}^{(2n)}_{\mu\nu}$ due to a point charge living in a $2n$-dimensional world
can be algebraically expressed in terms of the retarded vector potentials
${\cal A}^{(2m)}_{\mu}$ generated by this charge as if it were accommodated in
$2m$-dimensional worlds nearby, $2\le m\le n+1$. With this finding, the rate of
radiated energy-momentum of the electromagnetic field takes a compact form.
