We present ideas about creating a next generation Intrusion Detection System
based on the latest immunological theories. The central challenge with computer
security is determining the difference between normal and potentially harmful
activity. For half a century, developers have protected their systems by coding
rules that identify and block specific events. However, the nature of current
and future threats in conjunction with ever larger IT systems urgently requires
the development of automated and adaptive defensive tools. A promising solution
is emerging in the form of Artificial Immune Systems. The Human Immune System
can detect and defend against harmful and previously unseen invaders, so can we
not build a similar Intrusion Detection System for our computers.
