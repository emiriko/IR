In the study of equisingularity of isolated singularities we have the
classical theorem of Briancon, Speder and Teissier which states that a family
of isolated hypersurface singularities is Whitney equisingular if and only if
the mu^*-sequence for a hypersurface is constant in the family.
  In this paper we generalize to non-isolated hypersurface singularities. By
assuming non-contractibility of strata of a Whitney stratification of the
non-isolated singularities outside the origin we show that Whitney
equisingularity of a family is equivalent to constancy of a certain selection
of invariants from two distinct generalizations of the mu^*-sequence.
Applications of this theorem to equisingularity of more general mappings are
given.
