A spinning rough disk moves through a rarefied medium on the plane. The
roughness is formed by small cavities on the disk boundary. The medium is so
rare that mutual interaction of particles can be neglected. All collisions of
particles with the disk are perfectly elastic; there may happen multiple
collisions in the cavities. We calculate the force of resistance acting on the
body and examine how it depends on the kind of roughness (shape of the
cavities). We show that the nonzero transversal component of the force
generally appears, resulting in deflection of the disk trajectory. In several
simple cases the trajectory is determined. We compare our results with the ones
known in the literature. It is known that there is a transversal force acting
on a spinning body (most often a sphere or a cylinder) moving in a rarefied
gas, due to nonelastic interaction of gas particles with the body. We propose
another mechanism of creating the transversal force, resulting from multiple
reflections of particles from the body.
