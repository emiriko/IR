The intense beam-beam effect at the interaction point of the International
Linear Collider (ILC) causes large disruption of the beams and the production
of photons. These photons, arising dominantly through beamstrahlung emission,
are problematic for the machine design as they need to be transported and
dumped in a controlled way. In this work, we perform simulations of the
beam-beam interaction to predict photon production rates and distributions for
the different beam parameters considered at ILC. The results are expressed in
terms of a set of cones of excluded power, allowing to define the
beam-stay-clear requirements relevant for different cases and contexts. A
comparison is also made with theoretical expectations. The suggested photon
cone half-opening angles are 0.75 and 0.85 mrad in the horizontal and vertical
planes, respectively. These cones cover all machine energies and parameter
sets, and include the low power Compton photons.
