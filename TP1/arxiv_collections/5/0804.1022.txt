Geometric phase (GP) independent of energy and time rely only on the geometry
of state space. It has been argued to have potential fault tolerance and plays
an important role in quantum information and quantum computation. We present
the first experiment for producing and measuring an Abelian geometric phase
shift in a three-level system by using NMR interferometry. In contrast to
existing experiments, based on the geometry of $S^2$, our experiment concerns
the geometric phase with the geometry of $SU(3)/U(2)$. Two interacting qubits
have been used to provide such a three-dimensional Hilbert space.
