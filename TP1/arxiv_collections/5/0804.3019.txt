In an additive group (G,+), a three-dimensional corner is the four points g,
g+d(1,0,0), g+d(0,1,0), g+d(0,0,1), where g is in G^3, and d is a non-zero
element of G. The Ramsey number of interest is R_3(G) the maximal cardinality
of a subset of G^3 that does not contain a three-dimensional corner.
Furstenberg and Katznelson have shown R_3(Z_N) is little-o of N^3, and in fact
the corresponding result holds in all dimensions, a result that is a far
reaching extension of the Szemeredi Theorem. We give a new proof of the finite
field version of this fact, a proof that is a common generalization of the
Gowers proof of Szemeredi's Theorem for four term progressions, and the result
of Shkredov on two-dimensional corners. The principal tool are the Gowers Box
Norms.
