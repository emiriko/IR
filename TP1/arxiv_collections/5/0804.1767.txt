Due to solvation, excess charge carriers on 1d semiconductor nanostructures
immersed in polar solvents undergo self-localization into polaronic states.
Using a simplified theoretical model for small-diameter structures, we study
low-frequency properties of resulting 1d adiabatic polarons. The combined
microscopic dynamics of the electronic charge density and the solvent leads to
macroscopic Langevin dynamics of a polaron and to the appearance of local
dielectric relaxation modes. Polaron mobility is evaluated as a function of
system parameters. Numerical estimates indicate that the solvated carriers can
have mobilities orders of magnitude lower than the intrinsic values.
