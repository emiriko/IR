We present a systematic study of two-particle angular correlations in p+p,
Cu+Cu and Au+Au collisions over a broad range of pseudorapidity and azimuthal
angle. The PHOBOS detector has a uniquely large angular coverage for inclusive
charged particles, which allows for the study of correlations on both long- and
short-range scales. A complex two-dimensional correlation structure emerges
which is interpreted in the context of a cluster model. The cluster size and
its decay width are extracted from the two-particle pseudorapidity correlation
function. The cluster size found in semi-central Cu+Cu and Au+Au collisions is
comparable to that found in p+p but a non-trivial increase of cluster size with
decreasing centrality is observed. Moreover, the comparison between Cu+Cu and
Au+Au systems shows an interesting scaling of the cluster size with the
measured fraction of total cross section (which is related to $b/2R$),
suggesting a geometric origin. These results should provide insight into the
hadronization stage of the hot and dense medium created in heavy ion
collisions.
