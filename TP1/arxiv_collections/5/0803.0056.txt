We present a numerical solution on a 5-dimensional spherically symmetric
space time, in Einstein-Yang-Mills-Gauss-Bonnet theory using a two point
boundary value routine. It turns out that the Gauss-Bonnet contribution has a
profound influence on the behaviour of the particle-like solution: it increases
the number of nodes of the YM field. When a negative cosmological constant in
incorporated in the model, it turns out that there is no horizon and no
singular behaviour of the model. For positive cosmological constant the model
has singular behaviour.
