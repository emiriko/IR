Experimental methods and procedures required for precision measurements of
the Casimir force are presented. In particular, the best practices for
obtaining stable cantilevers, calibration of the cantilever, correction of
thermal and mechanical drift, measuring the contact separation, sphere radius
and the roughness are discussed.
