The continuous spontaneous localization (CSL) theory of dynamical wave
function collapse is an experimentally testable alternative to non-relativistic
quantum mechanics. In it, collapse occurs because particles interact with a
classical random field. However, particles gain energy from this field, i.e.,
particle energy is not conserved. Recently, it has been shown how to construct
a theory dubbed "completely quantized collapse" (CQC) which is predictively
equivalent to CSL. In CQC, a quantized random field is introduced, and CSL's
classical random field becomes its eigenvalue. In CQC, energy is conserved,
which allows one to understand that energy is conserved in CSL, as the
particle's energy gain is compensated by the random field's energy loss. Since
the random field has energy, it should have gravitational consequences. For
that, one needs to know the random field's energy density. In this paper, it is
shown how to construct a symmetric, conserved, energy-momentum-stress-density
tensor associated with the quantized random field, even though this field obeys
no dynamical equation and has no Lagrangian. Then, three examples are given
involving the random field's energy density. One considers interacting
particles, the second treats a "cosmological" particle creation model, the
third involves the gravity of the random field.
