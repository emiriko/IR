The pure spin currents, i.e., the counterflow of particles with opposite spin
orientations, can be optically injected in semiconductors. Here, we develop a
phenomenological theory, which describes the polarization dependencies of spin
currents excited by linearly polarized light in bulk semiconductors and quantum
well structures of various symmetries. We present microscopic descriptions of
the pure spin photocurrents for interband optical transitions in undoped
quantum wells as well as for direct intersubband and indirect intrasubband
(Drude-like) transitions in n-doped quantum well structures. We also
demonstrate that pure spin currents can be generated in structures of
sufficiently low symmetries by simple electron gas heating. The theoretical
results are compared with recent experimental observations.
