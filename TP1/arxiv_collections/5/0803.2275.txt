We argue that charges in underdoped La$_{2-x}$Sr$_{x}$CuO$_{4}$ move in a
dissipative environment of strong spatial and temporal fluctuations. The
unusual temperature dependence of the Hall angle known as "the separation of
lifetimes" is reinterpreted and attributed to the appearance of the thermally
activated component in the effective number of carriers with the temperature
increase. We consider the temperature interval above $T_{c}$ where localization
effects can be neglected.
