We revisit the dynamics of a gene repressed by its own protein in the case
where the transcription rate does not adapt instantaneously to protein
concentration but is a dynamical variable. We derive analytical criteria for
the appearance of sustained oscillations and find that they require degradation
mechanisms much less nonlinear than for infinitely fast regulation.
Deterministic predictions are also compared with stochastic simulations of this
minimal genetic oscillator.
