A trapped polariton condensate with continuous pumping and decay is analyzed
using a generalized Gross-Pitaevskii model. Whereas an equilibrium condensate
is characterized by a macroscopic occupation of a ground state, here the
steady-states take more general forms. Some are characterized by a large
population in an excited state, and others by large populations in several
states. In the latter case, the highly-populated states synchronize to a common
frequency above a critical density. Estimates for the critical density of this
synchronization transition are consistent with experiments.
