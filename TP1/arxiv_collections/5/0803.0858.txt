Given a planar graph $G$, we consider drawings of $G$ in the plane where
edges are represented by straight line segments (which possibly intersect).
Such a drawing is specified by an injective embedding $\pi$ of the vertex set
of $G$ into the plane. We prove that a wheel graph $W_n$ admits a drawing $\pi$
such that, if one wants to eliminate edge crossings by shifting vertices to new
positions in the plane, then at most $(2+o(1))\sqrt n$ of all $n$ vertices can
stay fixed. Moreover, such a drawing $\pi$ exists even if it is presupposed
that the vertices occupy any prescribed set of points in the plane. Similar
questions are discussed for other families of planar graphs.
