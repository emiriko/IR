We review the generalized monopole in the five-dimensional Euclidean space. A
numerical solution with the Hedge-Hog ansatz is studied. The Bogomol'nyi
equation becomes a second order autonomous non-linear differential equation.
The equation can be translated into the Abel's differential equation of the
second kind and is an algebraic differential equation.
