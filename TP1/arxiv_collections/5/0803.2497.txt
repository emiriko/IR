The paper introduces an alternative rishon model for a composite structure of
quarks and leptons. The model builds matter from six basic blocks (and their
antiparticles). For this reason it introduces new properties of rishons, called
"scents", that can take two values, called masculine and feminine scents, which
can appear in three colours both. The Quantum Scent Dynamics (QSD) model
calculates new electric charges for the rishons. Then it discusses the
construction of the known families of particles from scents, as well as the
constraints and advantages of the proposed hypothetic model.
