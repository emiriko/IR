To perform a queuing analysis or design in a communications context, we need
to estimate the values of the input parameters, specifically the mean of the
arrival rate and service time. In this paper, we propose an approach for
estimating the arrival rate of Poisson processes and the average service time
for servers under the assumption that the service time is exponential. In
particular, we derive sample size (i.e., the number of i.i.d. observations)
required to obtain an estimate satisfying a pre-specified relative accuracy
with a given confidence level. A remarkable feature of this approach is that no
a priori information about the parameter is needed. In contrast to conventional
methods such as, standard error estimation and confidence interval
construction, which only provides post-experimental evaluations of the
estimate, this approach allows experimenters to rigorously control the error of
estimation.
