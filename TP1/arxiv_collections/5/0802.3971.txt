We study the effect of nano(n)-SiC addition on the crystal structure,
critical temperature (Tc), critical current density (Jc) and flux pinning in
MgB2 superconductor. X-ray diffraction patterns show that all the samples have
MgB2 as the main phase with very small amount of MgO, further with n-SiC
addition the presence of Mg2Si is also noted and confirmed by SEM & EDS. The Tc
value for the pure MgB2 is 18.9K under 8 Tesla applied field, while is 20.8K
for the 10-wt % n-SiC doped sample under the same field. This points towards
the increment in upper-critical field value with n-SiC addition. The
irreversibility field (Hirr) for the 5% n-SiC added sample reached 11.3, 10 and
5.8 Tesla, compared to 7.5, 6.5, and 4.2 Tesla for the pure MgB2 at 5, 10 and
20K respectively. The critical current density (Jc) for the 5-wt % n-SiC added
sample is increased by a factor of 35 at 10K and 6.5 Tesla field and by a
factor 20 at 20K and 4.2 Tesla field. These results are understood on the basis
of superconducting condensate (sigma band) disorder and ensuing intrinsic
pining due to B site C substitution clubbed with further external pinning due
to available n-SiC/Mg2Si pins in the composite system.
