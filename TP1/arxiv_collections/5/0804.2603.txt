The collisions in four different reaction systems using $^{40,48}$Ca and
$^{58,64}$Ni isotope beams and a Be target have been simulated using the Heavy
Ion Phase Space Exploration and the Antisymmetrized Molecular Dynamics models.
The present study mainly focuses on the model predictions for the excitation
energies of the hot fragments and the cross sections of the final fragments
produced in these reactions. The effects of various factors influencing the
final fragment cross sections, such as the choice of the statistical decay code
and its parameters have been explored. The predicted fragment cross sections
are compared to the projectile fragmentation cross sections measured with the
A1900 mass separator. At $E/A=140$ MeV, reaction dynamics can significantly
modify the detection efficiencies for the fragments and make them different
from the efficiencies applied to the measured data reported in the previous
work. The effects of efficiency corrections on the validation of event
generator codes are discussed in the context of the two models.
