We study the zero temperature properties of a trapped polarized Fermi gas at
unitarity by assuming phase separation between an unpolarized superfluid and a
polarized normal phase. The effects of the interaction are accounted using the
formalism of quasi-particles to build up the equation of state of the normal
phase with the Monte Carlo results for the relevant parameters. Our predictions
for the Chandrasekhar-Clogston limit of critical polarization and for the
density profiles, including the density jump at the interface, are confirmed
with excellent accuracy by the recent experimental results at MIT. The role of
interaction on the radial width of the minority component, on the gap of the RF
transition and on the spin oscillations in the normal phase is also discussed.
Our analysis points out the Fermi liquid nature of these strongly interacting
spin polarized configurations.
