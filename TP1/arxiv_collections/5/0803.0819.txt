Electronic ferroelectricity from charge ordering (CO) is currently a
significant issue that has been extensively investigated in the charge/spin
frustrated LuFe2O4 system. Chemical substitution and structural layer
intercalation have been considered as potentially effective approaches in our
recent study, and we herein report on the structural and multi-ferromagnetic
properties in the layered series of LuFe2O4(LuFeO3)n (n=0, 1, and 2).
Experimental investigations reveal that the (RFeO3)-layer intercalation results
in notable changes in ferroelectricity, magnetic properties and CO features.
These results demonstrate that further exploration of this series of layered
members might prove fruitful.
