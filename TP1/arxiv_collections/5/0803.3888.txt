In this paper, we present results of our calculations on the effects of next
to nearest neighbor boson hopping ($t^{\prime}$) energy on Bose-Einstein
condensation in cubic lattices. We consider both non-interacting and
repulsively interacting bosons moving in the lowest Bloch band. The interacting
bosons are studied making use of the Bogoliubov method. We find that the bose
condensation temperature is enhanced with increasing $t^{\prime}$ for bosons in
a simple cubic (sc) lattice and decreases for bosons in body-centered cubic
(bcc) and face-centered cubic (fcc) lattices. We also find that interaction
induced depletion of the condensate is reduced for bosons in a sc lattice while
is enhanced for bosons in bcc and fcc lattices.
