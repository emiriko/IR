Chaotic mixing in a closed vessel is studied experimentally and numerically
in different 2-D flow configurations. For a purely hyperbolic phase space, it
is well-known that concentration fluctuations converge to an eigenmode of the
advection-diffusion operator and decay exponentially with time. We illustrate
how the unstable manifold of hyperbolic periodic points dominates the resulting
persistent pattern. We show for different physical viscous flows that, in the
case of a fully chaotic Poincare section, parabolic periodic points at the
walls lead to slower (algebraic) decay. A persistent pattern, the backbone of
which is the unstable manifold of parabolic points, can be observed. However,
slow stretching at the wall forbids the rapid propagation of stretched
filaments throughout the whole domain, and hence delays the formation of an
eigenmode until it is no longer experimentally observable. Inspired by the
baker's map, we introduce a 1-D model with a parabolic point that gives a good
account of the slow decay observed in experiments. We derive a universal decay
law for such systems parametrized by the rate at which a particle approaches
the no-slip wall.
