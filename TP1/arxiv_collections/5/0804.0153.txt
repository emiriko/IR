In a recent article we have introduced Friedmann thermodynamics, where
certain geometric parameters in Friedmann models are treated like their
thermodynamic counterparts (temperature, entropy, Gibbs potential etc.). This
model has the advantage of allowing us to determine the geometry of the
universe by thermodynamic stability arguments. In this article we review
connections between thermodynamics, geometry and cosmology.
