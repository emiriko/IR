We propose and demonstrate the functioning of a special Rapid Single Flux
Quantum (RSFQ) circuit with frequency-dependent damping. This damping is
achieved by shunting individual Josephson junctions by pieces of open-ended RC
transmission lines. Our circuit includes a toggle flip-flop cell, Josephson
transmission lines transferring single flux quantum pulses to and from this
cell, as well as DC/SFQ and SFQ/DC converters. Due to the desired
frequency-dispersion in the RC line shunts which ensures sufficiently low noise
at low frequencies, such circuits are well-suited for integrating with the
flux/phase Josephson qubit and enable its efficient control.
