The Euler equation (EE) is one of the basic equations in many physical fields
such as fluids, plasmas, condensed matter, astrophysics, oceanic and
atmospheric dynamics. A symmetry group theorem of the (2+1)-dimensional EE is
obtained via a simple direct method which is thus utilized to find \em exact
analytical \rm vortex and circumfluence solutions. A weak Darboux
transformation theorem of the (2+1)-dimensional EE can be obtained for \em
arbitrary spectral parameter \rm from the general symmetry group theorem. \rm
Possible applications of the vortex and circumfluence solutions to tropical
cyclones, especially Hurricane Katrina 2005, are demonstrated.
