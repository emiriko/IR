We describe a Picard-Vessiot theory for differential fields with non
algebraically closed fields of constants. As a technique for constructing and
classifying Picard-Vessiot extensions, we develop a Galois descent theory. We
utilize this theory to prove that every linear algebraic group $G$ over
$\mathbb{R}$ occurs as a differential Galois group over $\mathbb{R}(z)$. The
main ingredient of the proof is the Riemann-Hilbert correspondence for regular
singular differential equations over $\mathbb{C}(z)$.
