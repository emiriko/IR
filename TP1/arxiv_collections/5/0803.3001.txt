We show that there is a constant c>0 so that for any fixed r which is at
least 3 a.a.s. an r-regular graph on n vertices contains a complete graph on c
n^{1/2} vertices as a minor. This confirms a conjecture of Markstrom. Since any
minor of an r-regular graph on n vertices has at most rn/2 edges, our bound is
clearly best possible up to the value of the constant c. As a corollary, we
also obtain the likely order of magnitude of the largest complete minor in a
random graph G(n,p) during the phase transition (i.e. when pn is close to 1).
