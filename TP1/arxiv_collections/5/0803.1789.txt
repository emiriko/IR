NO molecules adsorbed on a Pt(111) surface from dipping in an acidic nitrite
solution are studied by near edge X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy
(NEXAFS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), low energy electron
diffraction (LEED) and scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) techniques. LEED
patterns and STM images show that no long range ordered structures are formed
after NO adsorption on a Pt(111) surface. Although the total NO coverage is
very low, spectroscopic features in N K-edge and O K-edge absorption spectra
have been singled out and related to the different species induced by this
preparation method. From these measurements it is concluded that the NO
molecule is adsorbed trough the N atom in an upright conformation. The maximum
saturation coverage is about 0.3 monolayers, and although nitric oxide is the
major component, nitrite and nitrogen species are slightly co-adsorbed on the
surface. The results obtained from this study are compared with those
previously reported in the literature for NO adsorbed on Pt(111) under UHV
conditions.
