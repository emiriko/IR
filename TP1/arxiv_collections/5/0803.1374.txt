We perform an analysis of fractal properties of the positive and the negative
changes of the German DAX30 index separately using Multifractal Detrended
Fluctuation Analysis (MFDFA). By calculating the singularity spectra
$f(\alpha)$ we show that returns of both signs reveal multiscaling. Curiously,
these spectra display a significant difference in the scaling properties of
returns with opposite sign. The negative price changes are ruled by stronger
temporal correlations than the positive ones, what is manifested by larger
values of the corresponding H\"{o}lder exponents. As regards the properties of
dominant trends, a bear market is more persistent than the bull market
irrespective of the sign of fluctuations.
