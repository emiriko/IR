We prove that the smooth solutions to the Cauchy problem for the
Navier-Stokes equations with conserved mass, total energy and finite momentum
of inertia loses the initial smoothness within a finite time in the case of
space of dimension 3 or greater even if the initial data are not compactly
supported.
