The suspended electrothermal polysilicon micro beams generate displacements
and forces by thermal buckling effects. In the previous electro-thermal and
thermo-elastic models of suspended polysilicon micro beams, the
thermo-mechanical properties of polysilicon have been considered constant over
a wide rang of temperature (20- 900 degrees C). In reality, the
thermo-mechanical properties of polysilicon depend on temperature and change
significantly at high temperatures. This paper describes the development and
validation of theoretical and Finite Element Model (FEM) including the
temperature dependencies of polysilicon properties such as thermal expansion
coefficient and Young's modulus. In the theoretical models, two parts of
elastic deflection model and thermal elastic model of micro beams buckling have
been established and simulated. Also, temperature dependent buckling of
polysilicon micro beam under high temperature has been modeled by Finite
Element Analysis (FEA). Analytical results and numerical results using FEA are
compared with experimental data available in literature. Their reasonable
agreement validates analytical model and FEM. This validation indicates the
importance of including temperature dependencies of polysilicon
thermo-mechanical properties such as Coefficient of Thermal Expansion (CTE) in
the previous models.
