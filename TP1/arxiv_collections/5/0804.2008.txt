The famous twin paradox of the Special Theory of Relativity by Einstein
(1905) is revisited and revised. This paradox is not a paradox in the true
sense of a paradox but a reflection of a misunderstanding of the problem and
the Principle of Relativity. The currently accepted solution to this takes into
account the accelerations and deceleration of the traveling twin thus
introducing an asymmetry that solves the paradox. We argue here that, with the
acceleration and deceleration neglected, the problem is asymmetric hence
leading to the same conclusion that the traveling twin will age less than the
stay at home. We introduce a symmetric twin paradox whose solution can not be
found within the currently accepted provinces of the STR if one adopts the
currently accepted philosophy of the STR namely that it is impossible for an
inertial observer to determine their state of motion. To resolve this, we
present (in our modest view) a simple and convincing argument that leads us to
conclude that it must be possible for an inertial observer to determine their
own state of motion. With this, we are able to solve the symmetric twin
paradox. The fact that it is possible for an inertial observer to determine
their state of motion -- brings us back to the long rejected idea of an all
pervading and permeating medium -- the Aether, namely the Lorentz luminiferous
Aether. An experiment capable of validating or invalidating this claim is
suggested.
