We prove an analogue the Khinchin theorem for the Diophantine approximation
by integer vectors lying on a quadratic variety. The proof is based on the
study of a dynamical system on a homogeneous space of the orthogonal group. We
show that in this system, generic trajectories visit a family of shrinking
subsets infinitely often.
