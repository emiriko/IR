An effective description for spherical nanoparticles in a fluid of point
particles is presented. The points inside the nanoparticles and the point
particles are assumed to interact via spherically symmetric additive pair
potentials, while the distribution of points inside the nanoparticles is taken
to be spherically symmetric and smooth. The resulting effective pair
interactions between a nanoparticle and a point particle, as well as between
two nanoparticles, are then given by spherically symmetric potentials. If
overlap between particles is allowed, the effective potential generally has
non-analytic points, but for each effective potential the expressions for
different overlapping cases can be written in terms of one analytic auxiliary
potential. Effective potentials for hollow nanoparticles (appropriate e.g. for
buckyballs) are also considered, and shown to be related to those for solid
nanoparticles. Finally, explicit expressions are given for the effective
potentials derived from basic pair potentials of power law and exponential
form, as well as from the commonly used London-Van der Waals, Morse,
Buckingham, and Lennard-Jones potential. The applicability of the latter is
demonstrated by comparison with an atomic description of nanoparticles with an
internal face centered cubic structure.
