The electronic structure of the new superconductor, SmO$_{1-x}$F$_x$FeAs
($x=0.15$), has been studied by angle-integrated photoemission spectroscopy.
Our data show a sharp feature very close to the Fermi energy, and a relative
flat distribution of the density of states between 0.5 eV and 3 eV binding
energy, which agrees best with band structure calculations considering an
antiferromagnetic ground state. No noticeable gap opening was observed at 12
Kelvin below the superconducting transition temperature, indicating the
existence of large ungapped regions in the Brillouin zone.
