Network intrusion detection sensors are usually built around low level models
of network traffic. This means that their output is of a similarly low level
and as a consequence, is difficult to analyze. Intrusion alert correlation is
the task of automating some of this analysis by grouping related alerts
together. Attack graphs provide an intuitive model for such analysis.
Unfortunately alert flooding attacks can still cause a loss of service on
sensors, and when performing attack graph correlation, there can be a large
number of extraneous alerts included in the output graph. This obscures the
fine structure of genuine attacks and makes them more difficult for human
operators to discern. This paper explores modified correlation algorithms which
attempt to minimize the impact of this attack.
