We propose a rationale for experimentally studying the intricate relationship
between the rate of information transmission and synchronization level in
active networks, applying theoretical results recently proposed. We consider
two non-identical coupled Chua's circuit with non-identical coupling strengths
in order to illustrate the proceeding for experimental scenarios of very few
data points coming from highly non-coherent coupled systems, such that phase
synchronization can only be detected by methods that do not rely explicitely on
the calculation of the phase. A relevant finding is to show that for the
coupled Chua's circuit, the larger the level of synchronization the larger the
rate of information exchanged between both circuits. We further validate our
findings with data from numerical simulations, and discuss an extension to
arbitrarily large active networks.
