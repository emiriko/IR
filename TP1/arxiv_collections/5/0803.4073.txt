The combination of phase, intensity, and contrast effects during electrooptic
modulation is theoretically and exper- imentally investigated. One consequence
of this combination is the modification of the amplitude of the
single-frequency signals which are commonly used as working points for
electrooptic mod- ulators and for the measurements of the electrooptic
coefficients. Another consequence of direct intensity modulation is to shift
the double-frequency points of the transfer function from the positions they
normally occupy at the intensity extrema. They can even make them disappear if
the direct intensity modulation is stronger than the phase modulation. Such
phenomena are expected with any ferroelectric material in which a significant
part of the incident light is deflected or scattered by domain walls or grain
boundaries. They can lead to considerable mistakes in the determination of the
electrooptic coefficients. Appropriate procedures to extract the different
contributions are explained. Experimental results in rubidium hydrogen selenate
are given, and consequences of the working of electrooptic modulators are
discussed.
