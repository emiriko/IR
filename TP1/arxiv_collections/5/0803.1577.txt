In this work we report the performances and the chemical and physical
properties of a (2 x 1.2) ton organic liquid scintillator target doped with Gd
up to ~0.1%, and the results of a 2 year long stability survey. In particular
we have monitored the amount of both Gd and primary fluor actually in solution,
the optical and fluorescent properties of the Gd-doped liquid scintillator
(GdLS) and its performances as a neutron detector, namely neutron capture
efficiency and average capture time. The experimental survey is ongoing, the
target being continuously monitored. After two years from the doping time the
performances of the Gd-doped liquid scintillator do not show any hint of
degradation and instability; this conclusion comes both from the laboratory
measurements and from the "in-tank" measurements. This is the largest stable
Gd-doped organic liquid scintillator target ever produced and continuously
operated for a long period.
