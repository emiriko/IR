The class of gravito-electric, algebraically general, rotating `silent' dust
space-times is studied. The main invariant properties are deduced. The number
$t_0$ of functionally independent zero-order Riemann invariants satisfies
$1\leq t_0\leq 2$ and special attention is given to the subclass $t_0=1$.
Whereas there are no $\Lambda$-term limits comprised in the class, the limit
for vanishing vorticity leads to two previously derived irrotational dust
families with $\Lambda>0$, and the shear-free limit is the G\"{o}del universe.
