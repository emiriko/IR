We summarize the theoretical approach to the solution of the NNLO DGLAP
equations using methods based on the logarithmic expansions in x-space and
their implementation into the C program Candia 1.0. We present the various
options implemented in the program and discuss the different solutions. The
user can choose the order of the evolution, the type of the solution, which can
be either exact or truncated, and the evolution either with a fixed or a
varying flavor number, implemented in the varying-flavour-number scheme (VFNS).
The renormalization and factorization scale dependences are treated separately.
In the non-singlet sector the program implements an exact NNLO solution.
