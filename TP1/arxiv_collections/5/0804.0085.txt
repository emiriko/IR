We consider a two-level atom stimulated by a coherent monochromatic laser and
we study how to enhance the squeezing of the fluorescence light and of the atom
itself in the presence of a Wiseman-Milburn feedback mechanism, based on the
homodyne detection of a fraction of the emitted light. Besides analyzing the
effect of the control parameters on the squeezing properties of the light and
of the atom, we also discuss the relations among these. The problem is tackled
inside the framework of quantum trajectory theory.
