We present the result for the two-loop and the one-loop squared virtual QCD
corrections to the W boson pair production in the quark-anti-quark-annihilation
channel in the limit where all kinematical invariants are large compared to the
mass of the W boson. The infrared pole structure is in agreement with the
prediction of Catani's general formalism for the singularities of two loop
amplitudes.
