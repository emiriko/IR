The moduli space of flat connections for maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills
theories, in a space-time of the form T^3xR, contains isolated points,
corresponding to normalizable zero energy states, for certain simple gauge
groups G. We consider the low energy effective field theories in the weak
coupling limit supported on such isolated points and find that when quantized
they consist of an infinite set of harmonic oscillators whose angular
frequencies are completely determined by the Lie algebra of G. We then proceed
to find the isolated flat connections for all simple G and subsequently specify
the corresponding effective field theories.
