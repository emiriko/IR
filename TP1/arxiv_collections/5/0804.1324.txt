We report the first Nernst effect measurement on the new iron-based
superconductor LaO$_{1-x}$F$_{x}$FeAs $(x=0.1)$. In the normal state, the
Nernst signal is negative and very small. Below $T_{c}$ a large positive peak
caused by vortex motion is observed. The flux flowing regime is quite large
compared to conventional type-II superconductors. However, a clear deviation of
the Nernst signal from normal state background and an anomalous depression of
off-diagonal thermoelectric current in the normal state between $T_{c}$ and 50
K are observed. We propose that this anomaly in the normal state Nernst effect
could correlate with the SDW fluctuations.
