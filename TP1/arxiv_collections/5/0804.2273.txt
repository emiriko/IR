The OAI Object Reuse and Exchange (OAI-ORE) framework recasts the
repository-centric notion of digital object to a bounded aggregation of Web
resources. In this manner, digital library content is more integrated with the
Web architecture, and thereby more accessible to Web applications and clients.
This generalized notion of an aggregation that is independent of repository
containment conforms more closely with notions in eScience and eScholarship,
where content is distributed across multiple services and databases. We provide
a motivation for the OAI-ORE project, review previous interoperability efforts,
describe draft ORE specifications and report on promising results from early
experimentation that illustrate improved interoperability and reuse of digital
objects.
