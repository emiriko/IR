We propose a simplification of the Optimized Effective Potential (OEP)
applied to the Self Interaction Correction (SIC) scheme of Density Functional
Theory (DFT). The new scheme fulfills several key formal properties and turns
out to be both simple and accurate. We show examples of applications on model
molecules in terms of observables known to be especially sensitive to details
of the SIC-OEP approach.
