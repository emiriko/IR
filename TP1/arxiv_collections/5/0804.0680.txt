The effects of correlation-induced coupling between spin and charge
fluctuations on spin-wave excitations in a band ferromagnet are investigated by
including self-energy and vertex corrections within a systematic
inverse-degeneracy expansion scheme which explicitly preserves the Goldstone
mode. Arising from the scattering of a magnon into intermediate spin-excitation
states (including both magnon and Stoner excitations) accompanied with charge
fluctuations in the majority spin band, this spin-charge coupling results not
only in a substantial reduction of magnon energies but also in anomalous
softening and significant magnon damping for zone-boundary modes lying within
the Stoner gap. Our results are in good qualitative agreement with recent
spin-wave excitation measurements in colossal magneto-resistive manganites and
ferromagnetic ultrathin films of transition metals.
