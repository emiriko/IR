We construct k-parameter families of rational surface automorphisms for any
k. These are automorphisms of surfaces X, which are constructed from iterated
blowups over the projective plane. In certain cases: we are able to determine
the exact automorphism group of X, as well as when two of the surfaces X are
inequivalent.
