With the goal of gaining a deeper understanding of quantum non-locality, we
decompose quantum correlations into more elementary non-local correlations. We
show that the correlations of all pure entangled states of two qubits can be
simulated without communication, hence using only non-signaling resources. Our
simulation model works in two steps. First, we decompose the quantum
correlations into a local and a non-local part. Second, we present a model for
simulating the nonlocal part using only non-signaling resources. In our model
partially entangled states require more nonlocal resources than maximally
entangled states, but the less the state is entangled, the less frequently must
the nonlocal resources be used.
