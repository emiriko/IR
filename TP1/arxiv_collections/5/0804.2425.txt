In most configurations aimed at generating entangled photons based on
spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC), the generated pairs of photons
are required to be entangled in only one degree of freedom. Any distinguishing
information coming from the other degrees of freedom that characterize the
photon should be suppressed to avoid correlations with the degree of freedom of
interest. However, this suppression is not always possible. Here, we show how
the frequency information available affects the purity of the two-photon state
in space, revealing a correlation between the frequency and the space degrees
of freedom. This correlation should be taken into account to calculate the
total amount of entanglement between the photons.
