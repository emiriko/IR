We analyze the scattering and bound state physics of a pair of atoms in a
one-dimensional optical lattice interacting via a narrow Feshbach resonance.
The lattice provides a structured continuum allowing for the existence of bound
dimer states both below and above the continuum bands, with pairs above the
continuum stabilized by either repulsive interactions or their center of mass
motion. Inside the band the Feshbach coupling to a closed channel bound state
leads to a Fano resonance profile for the transmission, which may be mapped out
by RF- or photodissociative spectroscopy. We generalize the scattering length
concept to the one-dimensional lattice, where a scattering length may be
defined at both the lower and the upper continuum thresholds. As a function of
the applied magnetic field the scattering length at either band edge exhibits
the usual Feshbach divergence when a bound state enters or exits the continuum.
Near the scattering length divergences the binding energy and wavefunction of
the weakly bound dimer state acquires a universal form reminiscent of those of
free-space Feshbach molecules. We give numerical examples of our analytic
results for a specific Feshbach resonance, which has been studied
experimentally.
