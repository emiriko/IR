We describe two protocols for efficient data transmission using a single
passive bus. Different types of interactions are obtained enabling
deterministic transfer and teleportation of composite quantum systems for
arbitrary subsystem dimension and for arbitrary numbers of subsystems. The
subsystems may become entangled in the transmission in which case the protocols
can serve generalized teleportation based information processing as well as
storage and transmission functions. We explore the cases of two qubits and two
qutrits in detail, obtaining a maximally entangling mapping of the composite
systems and discuss the use of a continuous variable bus.
