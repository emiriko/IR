We present a collection of signatures for physics beyond the standard model
that need to be explored at the LHC. The signatures are organized according to
the experimental objects that appear in the final state, and in particular the
number of high pT leptons. Our report, which includes brief experimental and
theoretical reviews as well as original results, summarizes the activities of
the "New Physics'' working group for the "Physics at TeV Colliders" workshop
(Les Houches, France, 11-29 June, 2007).
