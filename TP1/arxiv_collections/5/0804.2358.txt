In this paper a description of the Hubbard model on the square lattice with
nearest-neighbor transfer integral $t$, on-site repulsion $U$, and $N_a^2\gg 1$
sites consistent with its exact global $SO(3)\times SO(3)\times U(1)$ symmetry
is constructed. Our studies profit from the interplay of that recently found
global symmetry of the model on any bipartite lattice with the transformation
laws under a suitable electron - rotated-electron unitary transformation of a
well-defined set of operators and quantum objects. For $U/4t>0$ the occupancy
configurations of these objects generate the energy eigenstates that span the
one- and two-electron subspace. Such a subspace as defined in this paper
contains nearly the whole spectral weight of the excitations generated by
application onto the zero-spin-density ground state of one- and two-electron
operators. Our description involves three basic objects: charge $c$ fermions,
spin-1/2 spinons, and $\eta$-spin-1/2 $\eta$-spinons. Alike in chromodynamics
the quarks have color but all quark-composite physical particles are
color-neutral, the $\eta$-spinon (and spinons) that are not invariant under
that transformation have $\eta$ spin 1/2 (and spin 1/2) but are part of
$\eta$-spin-neutral (and spin-neutral) $2\nu$-$\eta$-spinon (and $2\nu$-spinon)
composite $\eta\nu$ fermions (and $s\nu$ fermions) where $\nu=1,2,...$ is the
number of $\eta$-spinon (and spinon) pairs.The description introduced here is
consistent with a Mott-Hubbard insulating ground state with antiferromagnetic
long-range order for half filling at $x=0$ hole concentration and a ground
state with short-range spin order for a well-defined range of finite hole
concentrations $x>0$.
