At the 2003 EuSpRIG meeting, we presented a framework and software
infrastructure to generate and analyse an audit trail for a spreadsheet file.
This report describes the results of a pilot implementation of this software
(now called TellTable; see www.telltable.com), along with developments in the
server infrastructure and availability, extensions to other "Office Suite"
files, integration of the audit tool into the server interface, and related
developments, licensing and reports. We continue to seek collaborators and
partners in what is primarily an open-source project with some shared-source
components.
