Industrial knowledge is complex, difficult to formalize and very dynamic in
reason of the continuous development of techniques and technologies. The
verification of the validity of the knowledge base at the time of its
elaboration is not sufficient. To be exploitable, this knowledge must then be
able to be used under conditions (slightly) different from the conditions in
which it was formalized. So, it becomes vital for the company to permanently
evaluate the quality of the industrial knowledge implemented in the system.
This evaluation is founded on the concept of robustness of the knowledge
formalized by conceptual graphs. The evaluation method is supported by a
computerized tool.
