We studied the effect of strong electric current on spin waves interacting
relativistically with the current. The spin-wave spectrum is calculated at
arbitrary direction of the wave vector. It is shown that the alternating Hall
current generated by the alternating magnetic moment of the spin waves, reduces
the spin-wave damping. At strong enough unpolarized dc current the damping
changes sign, and the spin-wave amplitude starts to increase exponentially fast
with time. The critical current for the spin-wave instability is determined
mainly by the anomalous Hall effect, and can be much smaller than that for the
spin-torque mechanism of instability.
