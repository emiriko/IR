The SU(3)$_L\otimesU(1)_N$ electroweak model predicts new Higgs bosons beyond
the one of the standard model. In this work we investigate the signature and
production of doubly charged Higgs bosons in the $e^-e^+$ International Linear
Collider and in the CERN Linear Collider. We compute the branching ratios for
the doubly charged gauge bosons of the model.
