We propose a method for the theoretical investigation of polymer
translocation through composite pore structures possessing arbitrarily
specified geometries. Translocation through each constituent part of the
composite is treated as being analogous to the diffusion of the translocation
coordinate over the free energy landscape derived from the chain configurations
within the pore. The proposed method accounts for possible reverse motions of
the leading chain end at the interface between constituent parts of a composite
pore, a possibility that has been neglected in prior studies. As an
illustration of our method, we study the translocation of a Gaussian chain
between two spherical compartments connected by a cylindrical pore, and by a
composite pore consisting of two connected cylinders of different diameters,
which is structurally similar to the $\alpha$-hemolysin membrane channel. We
demonstrate that reverse chain motions between the pore constituents may
contribute significantly to the total translocation time. Our results further
establish that translocation through a two-cylinder composite pore is faster
when the chain is introduced into the pore on the cis (wide) side of the
channel rather than the trans (narrow) side.
