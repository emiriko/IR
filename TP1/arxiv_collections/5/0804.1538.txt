A new modified version of the Oxford purification protocol is proposed. This
version is based on the controlled-controlled NOT gate instead of controlled
NOT in the original one. Comparisons between the results of the new version and
the original and an earlier modification are given. It is found that the new
version converges faster and consumes fewer initial qubit pairs of low fidelity
per final qubit pair of high fidelity.
