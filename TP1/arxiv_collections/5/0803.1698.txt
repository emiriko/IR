Effects of the paramagnetic depairing on structural transitions between
vortex lattices of a quasi two dimensional d-wave superconductor are examined.
It is found that, in systems with Maki parameter $\alpha_{\rm M}$ of order
unity, a square lattice induced by a d-wave pairing is destabilized with {\it
increasing} fields, and that a reentrant rhombic lattice occurs in higher
fields. Further, a weak Fermi surface anisotropy competitive with the pairing
symmetry induces another structural transition near $H_{c2}$. These results are
consistent with the structure changes of the vortex lattice in CeCoIn$_5$ in
${\bf H} \parallel c$ determined from recent neutron scattering data.
