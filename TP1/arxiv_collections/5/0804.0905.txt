We consider the linear Primitive Equations of the ocean in the three
dimensional space, with horizontal periodic and vertical Dirichlet boundary
conditions. Thanks to Fourier transforms we are able to calculate explicitly
the pressure term. We then state existence, unicity and regularity results for
the linear time-depending Primitive Equations, with low-regularity right-hand
side.
