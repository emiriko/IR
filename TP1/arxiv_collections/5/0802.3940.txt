Our term "structure discovery" denotes the recovery of structure, such as the
grouping of cells, that was intended by a spreadsheet's author but is not
explicit in the spreadsheet. We are implementing structure discovery tools in
the logic-programming language Prolog for our spreadsheet analysis program
Model Master, by writing grammars for spreadsheet structures. The objective is
an "intelligent structure monitor" to run beside Excel, allowing users to
reconfigure spreadsheets to the representational needs of the task at hand.
This could revolutionise spreadsheet "best practice". We also describe a
formulation of spreadsheet reverse-engineering based on "arrows".
