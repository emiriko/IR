We propose that the Hawking radiation energy and entropy flow rates from a
black hole can be viewed as a one-dimensional (1D), non-equilibrium Landauer
transport process. Support for this viewpoint comes from previous calculations
invoking conformal symmetry in the near-horizon region, which give radiation
rates that are identical to those of a single 1D quantum channel connected to a
thermal reservoir at the Hawking temperature. The Landauer approach shows in a
direct way the particle statistics independence of the energy and entropy
fluxes of a black hole radiating into vacuum, as well as one near thermal
equilibrium with its environment. As an application of the Landauer approach,
we show that Hawking radiation gives a net entropy production that is 50%
larger than that obtained assuming standard three-dimensional emission into
vacuum.
