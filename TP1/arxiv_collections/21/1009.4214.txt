Algorithms to generate various combinatorial structures find tremendous
importance in computer science. In this paper, we begin by reviewing an
algorithm proposed by Rohl that generates all unique permutations of a list of
elements which possibly contains repetitions, taking some or all of the
elements at a time, in any imposed order. The algorithm uses an auxiliary array
that maintains the number of occurrences of each unique element in the input
list. We provide a proof of correctness of the algorithm. We then show how one
can efficiently generate other combinatorial structures like combinations,
subsets, n-Parenthesizations, derangements and integer partitions &
compositions with minor changes to the same algorithm.
