We explore the X-ray properties of the 126 sub-mm galaxies (SMGs) of the
LABOCA survey in the CDFS and the eCDFS regions. SMGs are believed to
experience massive episodes of star-formation. Our goal is to examine whether
star-formation coexists with AGN activity, determine the fraction of highly
obscured AGN and finally to obtain an idea of the dominant power-mechanism in
these sources. Using Spitzer and radio arc-second positions for the SMGs, we
find 14 sources with significant X-ray detections. For most of these there are
only photometric redshifts available, with their median redshift being ~2.3.
Taking into account only the CDFS area which has the deepest X-ray
observations, we estimate an X-ray AGN fraction of <26+/-9 % among SMGs. The
X-ray spectral properties of the majority of the X-ray AGN which are associated
with SMGs are consistent with high obscuration, 10^23 cm-2, but there is no
unambiguous evidence for the presence of Compton-thick sources. Detailed
Spectral Energy Distribution fittings show that the bulk of total IR luminosity
originates in star-forming processes, although a torus component is usually
present. Finally, stacking analysis of the X-ray undetected SMGs reveals a
signal in the soft (0.5-2 keV) and marginally in the hard (2-5 keV) X-ray band.
The hardness ratio of the stacked signal is relatively soft (-0.40+/-0.10)
corresponding to a photon index of ~1.6. This argues against a high fraction of
Compton-thick sources among the X-ray undetected SMGs.
