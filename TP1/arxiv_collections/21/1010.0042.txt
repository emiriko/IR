We investigate the Josephson transport through a ferromagnetic oxide film,
e.g., La$_2$BaCuO$_5$, theoretically. Using the recursive Green's function
technique, we found the formation of a pi-junction in such systems. Moreover
the 0-pi phase transition is induced by increasing the temperature. Such
ferromagnetic-oxide based Josephson junctions may become an element in the
architecture of future quantum computers.
