Taking into account the constraints on the free parameters of the littlest
Higgs model with T-parity (called $LHT$ model) from some rare decay processes,
such as $\mu\rightarrow e\gamma$ and $\mu\rightarrow 3e$, we consider the
contributions of the $LHT$ model to the lepton flavor violating ($LFV$)
processes $e^{+}e^{-}\rightarrow l_{i}\bar{l}_{j}$ and $\gamma\gamma\rightarrow
l_{i}\bar{l}_{j}$ ($i\neq j$). We find that the $LHT$ model can indeed produce
significant contributions to these $LFV$ processes and its $LFV$ signal might
has a chance of being observed in the future $ILC$ experiments.
