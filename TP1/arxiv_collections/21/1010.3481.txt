We consider 2-state quantum walks (QWs) on the line, which are defined by two
matrices. One of the matrices operates the walk in certain intervals. In the
usual QWs starting from the origin, localization does not occur at all.
However, our walk can be localized around the origin. In this paper, we present
some limit distributions for the walk.
