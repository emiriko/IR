The tree-level flavour-changing neutral currents in the two-Higgs-doublet
models can be suppressed by protecting the breaking of either flavour or
flavour-blind symmetries, but only the first choice, implemented by the
application of the Minimal Flavour Violation hypothesis, is stable under
quantum corrections. Moreover, a two-Higgs-doublet model with Minimal Flavour
Violation enriched with flavour-blind phases can explain the anomalies recently
found in the Delta F = 2 transitions, namely the large CP-violating phase in
B_s mixing and the tension between epsilon_K and S_\psi_K.
