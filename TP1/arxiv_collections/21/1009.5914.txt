We present new imaging data and archival multiwavelength observations of the
little studied emission nebula K 1-6 and its central star. Narrow-band images
in H-alpha (+ [NII]) and [OIII] taken with the Faulkes Telescope North reveal a
stratified, asymmetric, elliptical nebula surrounding a central star which has
the colours of a late G- or early K-type subgiant or giant. GALEX ultraviolet
images reveal a very hot subdwarf or white dwarf coincident in position with
this star. The cooler, optically dominant star is strongly variable with a
period of 21.312 +/- 0.008 days, and is possibly a high amplitude member of the
RS CVn class, although an FK Com classification is also possible. Archival
ROSAT data provide good evidence that the cool star has an active corona. We
conclude that K 1-6 is most likely an old bona fide planetary nebula at a
distance of ~1.0 kpc, interacting with the interstellar medium, and containing
a binary or ternary central star. The observations and data analyses reported
in this paper were conducted in conjunction with Year 11 high school students
as part of an Australian Research Council Linkage Grant science education
project, denoted Space To Grow, conducted jointly by professional astronomers,
educational researchers, teachers, and high-school students.
