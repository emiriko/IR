Millimeter and sub-millimeter observations have made fundamental
contributions to our current understanding of the transition from AGB stars to
white dwarfs. The approaching era of ALMA brings significantly enhanced
observing capabilities at these wavelengths and promises to push back the
frontiers in a number of ways. We examine the scientific prospects of this new
era for PNe, with an emphasis on how developments may contribute to the goals
of the asymmetric PNe community.
