The disorder-driven phase transition of the RFIM is observed using exact
ground-state computer simulations for hyper cubic lattices in d=5,6,7
dimensions. Finite-size scaling analyses are used to calculate the critical
point and the critical exponents of the specific heat, magnetization,
susceptibility and of the correlation length. For dimensions d=6,7 which are
larger or equal to the assumed upper critical dimension, d_u=6, mean-field
behaviour is found, i.e. alpha=0, beta=1/2, gamma=1, nu=1/2. For the analysis
of the numerical data, it appears to be necessary to include recently proposed
corrections to scaling at and beyond the upper critical dimension.
