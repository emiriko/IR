We construct a compactification $M^{\mu ss}$ of the Uhlenbeck-Donaldson type
for the moduli space of slope stable framed bundles. This is a kind of a moduli
space of slope semistable framed sheaves. We show that there exists a
projective morphism $\gamma \colon M^{ss} \to M^{\mu ss}$, where $M^{ss}$ is
the moduli space of S-equivalence classes of Gieseker-semistable framed
sheaves. The space $M^{\mu ss}$ has a natural set-theoretic stratification
which allows one, via a Hitchin-Kobayashi correspondence, to compare it with
the moduli spaces of framed ideal instantons.
