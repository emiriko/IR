A theory of light propagation through one-dimensional photonic crystals and
deterministic aperiodic structures, including quasicrystals, based on doped
quantum-well structures has been developed. The resonant Bragg condition,
leading to the superradiant regime and formation of the widest optical
reflection spectrum, has been formulated. The expressions for band gap edges
for light waves in the Bragg structures have been obtained. The reflection and
absorption spectra of such systems are calculated. The optical properties of
the doped multiple-quantum-well structure are compared with the properties of
undoped ones.
