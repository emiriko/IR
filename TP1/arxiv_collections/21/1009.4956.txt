We present evidence supporting the weakly paired Moore-Read phase in the
half-filled second Landau level, focusing on some of the qualitative features
of its excitations. Based on numerical studies, we show that systems with odd
particle number at the flux $N_\phi=2N-3$ can be interpreted as a neutral
fermion mode of one unpaired fermion, which is gapped. The mode is found to
have two distinct minima, providing a signature that could be observed by
photoluminescence. In the presence of two quasiparticles the same neutral
fermion excitation is shown to be gapless, confirming expectations for
non-Abelian statistics of the Ising model with degenerate fusion channels 1 and
$\psi$.
