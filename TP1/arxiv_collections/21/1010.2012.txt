We present a method to derive Bell monogamy relations by connecting the
complementarity principle with quantum non-locality. The resulting monogamy
relations are stronger than those obtained from the no-signaling principle
alone. In many cases, they yield tight quantum bounds on violation of single
and multiple qubit correlation Bell inequalities. In contrast with the
two-qubit case, a rich structure of possible violation patterns is shown to
exist in the multipartite scenario.
