We show that the soft breaking of the BRST symmetry arising in the
Gribov-Zwanziger theory can be converted into a linear breaking upon
introduction of a set of BRST quartets of auxiliary fields. Due to its
compatibility with the Quantum Action Principle, the linearly broken BRST
symmetry can be directly converted into a suitable set of useful Slavnov-Taylor
identities. As a consequence, it turns out that the renormalization aspects of
the Gribov-Zwanziger theory can be addressed by means of the cohomology of a
nilpotent local operator
