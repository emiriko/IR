Ageing phenomena far from equilibrium naturally present dynamical scaling and
in many situations this may generalised to local scale-invariance. Generically,
the absence of time-translation-invariance implies that each scaling operator
is characterised by two independent scaling dimensions. Building on analogies
with logarithmic conformal invariance and logarithmic Schr\"odinger-invariance,
this work proposes a logarithmic extension of local scale-invariance, without
time-translation-invariance. Carrying this out requires in general to replace
both scaling dimensions of each scaling operator by Jordan cells. Co-variant
two-point functions are derived for the most simple case of a two-dimensional
logarithmic extension. Their form is compared to simulational data for
autoresponse functions in several universality classes of non-equilibrium
ageing phenomena.
