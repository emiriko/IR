Using an isospin-dependent quantum molecular dynamics (IQMD) model, nuclear
stopping is analyzed in asymmetric colliding channels by keeping the total mass
fixed. The calculations have been carried by varying the asymmetry of the
colliding pairs with different neutron-proton ratios in center of mass energy
250 MeV/nucleon and by switching off the effect of Coulomb interactions. We
find sizable effect of asymmetry of colliding pairs on the stopping and
therefore on the equilibrium reached in a reaction.
