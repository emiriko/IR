This note summarises the workshop LCTW09 held between the 3.11.2009 and
5.11.2009 at LAL Orsay. The workshop was dedicated to discuss the beam tests in
the years 2010 up to 2013 for detectors to be operated at a future linear
electron positron collider. The document underlines the rich R&D program on
these detectors in the coming years. Large synergies were identified in the DAQ
and software systems. Considerable consolidation of resources are expected from
the establishment of semi-permanent beam lines for linear collider detector R&D
at major centres like CERN and FNAL. Reproducing a beam structure as foreseen
for the International Linear Collider (ILC) would clearly enhance the value of
the obtained beam test results. Although not ultimately needed for every
research program, all groups would exploit such a feature if it is available.
