The order parameter in superconductivity of cuprates is investigated in the
framework of the Bogoliubov theory. By using a simplifying assumption about the
electronic states, it is predicted an effective critical temperature Tc* > Tc
associated to the coherent gap D0. A connection between D0 and the antinodal
pseudogap DPG is proposed allowing for a comprehensive picture of the main
experimental features of cuprate superconductors.
