2009 has been an extraordinary year for gamma-ray pulsar astronomy and 2010
promises to be equally good. Not only have we registered an extraordinary
increase in the number of pulsars detected in gamma rays, but we have also
witnessed the birth of new sub-families: first of all, the radio-quiet gamma
pulsars and later an ever growing number of millisecond pulsars, a real
surprise. We started with a sample of 7 gamma-ray emitting neutron stars (6
radio pulsars and Geminga) and now the Fermi-LAT harvest encompasses 24
"Geminga-like" new gamma-ray pulsars, a dozen millisecond pulsars and about
thirty radio pulsars. Moreover, radio searches targeted to LAT unidentified
sources yielded 18 new radio millisecond pulsars, several of which have been
already detected also in gamma rays. Thus, currently the family of gamma-ray
emitting neutron stars seems to be evenly divided between classical radio
pulsars, millisecond pulsars and radio quiet neutron stars.
