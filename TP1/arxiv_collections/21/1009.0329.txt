We demonstrate adiabatic wavelength shifting by electro-optic modulation
using a p-i-n integrated high-Q photonic crystal nanocavity. The wavelength of
the trapped light is adiabatically shifted by modulating the resonance of the
cavity faster than the photon lifetime. The cavity resonance is changed by
injecting electrons through a p-i-n junction to reduce the refractive index. In
addition we employ adiabatic wavelength shifting in a demonstration of dynamic
Q tuning by electro-optic modulation.
