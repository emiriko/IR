The Planetary Nebulae Luminosity Function (PNLF) describes the collective
luminosity evolution for a given population of Planetary Nebulae (PN). A major
paradox in current PNLF studies is in the universality of the absolute
magnitude of the brightest PNe with galaxy type and age. The progenitor
central-star mass required to produce such bright PNe should have evolved
beyond the PNe phase in old, red elliptical galaxies whose stellar populations
are ~10~Gyr. Only by dissecting this resolved population in detail can we
attempt to address this conundrum. The Bulge of our Galaxy is predominantly old
\citep{Z03} and can therefore be used as a proxy for an elliptical galaxy, but
with the significant advantage that the population is resolvable from ground
based telescopes. We have used the MOSAIC-II camera on the Blanco 4-m at CTIO
to carefully target ~80 square degrees of the Galactic Bulge and establish
accurate [Oiii] fluxes for 80% of Bulge PNe currently known from the Acker and
MASH catalogues. Construction of the [Oiii] Bulge PNLF has allowed us to
investigate placement of PNe population sub-sets according to morphology and
spectroscopic properties the PNLF and most importantly, whether any population
subset might constitute the bright end of the LF. Our excellent, deep data also
offers exciting prospects for significant new PNe discoveries and [Oiii]
morphological studies.
