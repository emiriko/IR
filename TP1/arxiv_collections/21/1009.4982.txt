This paper presents an optimal Bangla Keyboard Layout, which distributes the
load equally on both hands so that maximizing the ease and minimizing the
effort. Bangla alphabet has a large number of letters, for this it is difficult
to type faster using Bangla keyboard. Our proposed keyboard will maximize the
speed of operator as they can type with both hands parallel. Here we use the
association rule of data mining to distribute the Bangla characters in the
keyboard. First, we analyze the frequencies of data consisting of monograph,
digraph and trigraph, which are derived from data wire-house, and then used
association rule of data mining to distribute the Bangla characters in the
layout. Experimental results on several data show the effectiveness of the
proposed approach with better performance.
