According to a recent ray-based asymptotic theory, the high-frequency p-mode
spectrum of rapidly rotating stars is a superposition of frequency subsets
associated with dynamically independent regions of the ray-dynamics phase
space. At high rotation rates corresponding to typical $\delta$ Scuti stars,
two frequency subsets are expected to be visible : a regular frequency subset
described by a Tassoul like formula and an irregular frequency subset with
specific statistical properties. In this paper, we investigate whether the
regular patterns can be detected in the resulting spectrum. We compute the
autocorrelation function of synthetic spectra where the frequencies follow the
asymptotic theory, the relative amplitudes are simply given by the modes'
disk-averaging factors, and the frequency resolution is that of a CoRoT long
run. Our first results are that (i) the detection of regular patterns strongly
depends on the ratio of regular over irregular modes, (ii) low inclination
angle configurations are more favorable than near equator-on configurations,
(iii) in the absence of differential rotation, the $2 \Omega$ rotational
splitting between $m=1$ and $m=-1$ modes is an easy feature to detect.
