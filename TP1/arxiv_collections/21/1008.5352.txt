PIONIER is a 4-telescope visitor instrument for the VLTI, planned to see its
first fringes in 2010. It combines four ATs or four UTs using a pairwise ABCD
integrated optics combiner that can also be used in scanning mode. It provides
low spectral resolution in H and K band. PIONIER is designed for imaging with a
specific emphasis on fast fringe recording to allow closure-phases and
visibilities to be precisely measured. In this work we provide the detailed
description of the instrument and present its updated status.
