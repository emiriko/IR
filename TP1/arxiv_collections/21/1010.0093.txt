We describe an interferometer based on fluorescent emission of radiation of
two qubits in quasi-one-dimensional modes. Such a system can be readily
realized with dipole emitters near conducting surface-plasmonic nanowires or
with superconducting qubits coupled to coplanar waveguide transmission lines.
