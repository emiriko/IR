This paper analyzes the sensitivity of antineutrino count rate measurements
to changes in the fissile content of civil power reactors. Such measurements
may be useful in IAEA reactor safeguards applications. We introduce a
hypothesis testing procedure to identify statistically significant differences
between the antineutrino count rate evolution of a standard 'baseline' fuel
cycle and that of an anomalous cycle, in which plutonium is removed and
replaced with an equivalent fissile worth of uranium. The test would allow an
inspector to detect anomalous reactor activity, or to positively confirm that
the reactor is operating in a manner consistent with its declared fuel
inventory and power level. We show that with a reasonable choice of detector
parameters, the test can detect replacement of 73 kg of plutonium in 90 days
with 95% probability, while controlling the false positive rate at 5%. We show
that some improvement on this level of sensitivity may be expected by various
means, including use of the method in conjunction with existing reactor
safeguards methods. We also identify a necessary and sufficient daily
antineutrino count rate to achieve the quoted sensitivity, and list examples of
detectors in which such rates have been attained.
