Recent experiments on ferroelectric gating have introduced a novel
functionality, i.e. nonvolatility, in graphene field effect transistors. A
comprehensive understanding in the non-linear, hysteretic ferroelectric gating
and an effective way to control it are still absent. In this letter, we
quantitatively characterize the hysteretic ferroelectric gating using the
reference of an independent background doping (nBG) provided by normal
dielectric gating. More importantly, we prove that nBG can be used to control
the ferroelectric gating by unidirectionally shifting the hysteretic
ferroelectric doping in graphene. Utilizing this electrostatic effect, we
demonstrate symmetrical bit writing in graphene-ferroelectric FETs with
resistance change over 500% and reproducible no-volatile switching over 10^5
cycles.
