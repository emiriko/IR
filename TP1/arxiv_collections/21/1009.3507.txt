Hierarchical modeling of abundance in space or time using closed-population
mark-recapture under heterogeneity (model M$_{h}$) presents two challenges: (i)
finding a flexible likelihood in which abundance appears as an explicit
parameter and (ii) fitting the hierarchical model for abundance. The first
challenge arises because abundance not only indexes the population size, it
also determines the dimension of the capture probabilities in heterogeneity
models. A common approach is to use data augmentation to include these capture
probabilities directly into the likelihood and fit the model using Bayesian
inference via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Two such examples of this
approach are (i) explicit trans-dimensional MCMC, and (ii) superpopulation data
augmentation. The superpopulation approach has the advantage of simple
specification that is easily implemented in BUGS and related software. However,
it reparameterizes the model so that abundance is no longer included, except as
a derived quantity. This is a drawback when hierarchical models for abundance,
or related parameters, are desired. Here, we analytically compare the two
approaches and show that they are more closely related than might appear
superficially. We exploit this relationship to specify the model in a way that
allows us to include abundance as a parameter and that facilitates hierarchical
modeling using readily available software such as BUGS. We use this approach to
model trends in grizzly bear abundance in Yellowstone National Park from
1986-1998.
