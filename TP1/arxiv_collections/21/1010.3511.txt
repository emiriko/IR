V889 Herculis is one of the brightest single early-G type stars, a young Sun,
that is rotating fast enough (P_rot =1.337 days) for mapping its surface by
Doppler Imaging. The 10 FOCES spectra collected between 13-16 Aug 2006 at Calar
Alto Observatory allowed us to reconstruct one single Doppler image for two
mapping lines. The FeI-6411 and CaI-6439 maps, in a good agreement, revealed an
asymmetric polar cap and several weaker features at lower latitudes. Applying
the sheared-image method with our Doppler reconstruction we perform an
investigation to detect surface differential rotation (DR). The resulting DR
parameter, deltaOmega/Omega~0.009 of solar type, is compared to previous
studies which reported either much stronger shear or comparably weak DR, or
just preferred rigid rotation. Theoretical aspects are also considered and
discussed.
