Local unitary invariants allow one to test whether multipartite states are
equivalent up to local basis changes. Equivalently, they specify the geometry
of the "orbit space" obtained by factoring out local unitary action from the
state space. This space is of interest because of its intimate relationship to
entanglement. Unfortunately, the dimension of the orbit space grows
exponentially with the number of subsystems, and the number of invariants
needed to characterise orbits grows at least as fast. This makes the study of
entanglement via local unitary invariants seem very daunting. I point out here
that there is a simplifying principle: Invariants fall into families related by
the tracing-out of subsystems, and these families grow exponentially with the
number of subsystems. In particular, in the case of pure qubit systems, there
is a family whose size is about half the dimension of orbit space. These
invariants are closely related to cumulants and to multipartite separability.
Members of the family have been repeatedly discovered in the literature, but
the fact that they are related to cumulants and constitute a family has
apparently not been observed.
