The next generation mass probes will investigate DE nature by measuring
non-linear power spectra at various z, and comparing them with high precision
simulations. Producing a complete set of them, taking into account baryon
physics and for any DE state equation w(z), would really be numerically
expensive. Regularities reducing such duty are essential. This paper presents
further n-body tests of a relation we found, linking models with DE state
parameter w(z) to const.-w models, and also tests the relation in hydro
simulations.
