We present a map of the diffuse ultraviolet cosmic background in two
wavelength bands (FUV: 1530 {\AA}; NUV: 2310 {\AA}) over almost 75% of the sky
using archival data from the GALEX mission. Most of the diffuse flux is due to
dust-scattered starlight and follows a cosecant law with slopes of 545 photons
cm-2 s-1 sr-1 {\AA}-1 and 433 photons cm-2 s-1 sr-1 {\AA}-1 in the FUV and NUV
bands, respectively. There is a strong correlation with the 100 {\mu}m IRAS
flux with an average UV/IR ratio of 300 photons cm-2 s-1 sr-1 {\AA}-1 (MJy
sr-1)-1 in the FUV band and 220 photons cm-2 s-1 sr-1 {\AA}-1 (MJy sr-1)-1 in
the NUV but with significant variations over the sky. In addition to the large
scale distribution of the diffuse light, we note a number of individual
features including bright spots around the hot stars Spica and Achernar.
