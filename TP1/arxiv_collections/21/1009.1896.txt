We investigate X-ray emission properties of the peculiar X-ray source Theta2
Ori A in the Orion trapezium region using more than 500 ksec of HETGS spectral
data in the quiescent state. The amount of exposure provides tight constraints
on several important diagnostics involving O, Ne, Mg, and Si line flux ratios
from He-like ion triplets, resonance line ratios of the H- and He-like lines
and line widths. Accounting for the influence of the strong UV radiation field
of the O9.7V star we can now place the He-like line origin well within two
stellar radii of the O-star's surface. The lines are resolved with average line
widths of 341+-38 km/s confirming a line origin relatively close to the stellar
surface. In the framework of standard wind models this implies a rather weak,
low opacity wind restricting wind shocks to temperatures not much larger than
2x10^6 K. The emission measure distribution of the X-ray spectrum, as reported
previously, includes very high temperature components which are not easily
explained in this framework. The X-ray properties are also not consistent with
coronal emissions from an unseen low-mass companion nor with typical signatures
from colliding wind interactions. The properties are more consistent with X-ray
signatures observed in the massive Trapezium star Theta1 Ori C which has
recently been successfully modeled with a magnetically confined wind model.
