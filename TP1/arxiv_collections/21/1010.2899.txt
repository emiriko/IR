We analyze the nonlinear active microrheology of dense colloidal suspensions
using a schematic model of mode-coupling theory. The model describes the
strongly nonlinear behavior of the microscopic friction coefficient as a
function of applied external force in terms of a delocalization transition. To
probe this regime, we have performed Brownian dynamics simulations of a system
of quasi-hard spheres. We also analyze experimental data on hard-sphere-like
colloidal suspensions [Habdas et al., Europhys. Lett., 2004, 67, 477]. The
behavior at very large forces is addressed specifically.
