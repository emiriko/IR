Thermoelectric generation is an essential function of future energy-saving
technologies. However, this generation has been an exclusive feature of
electric conductors, a situation which inflicts a heavy toll on its
application; a conduction electron often becomes a nuisance in thermal design
of devices. Here we report electric-voltage generation from heat flowing in an
insulator. We reveal that, despite the absence of conduction electrons, a
magnetic insulator LaY2Fe5O12 converts a heat flow into spin voltage. Attached
Pt films transform this spin voltage into electric voltage by the inverse spin
Hall effect. The experimental results require us to introduce thermally
activated interface spin exchange between LaY2Fe5O12 and Pt. Our findings
extend the range of potential materials for thermoelectric applications and
provide a crucial piece of information for understanding the physics of the
spin Seebeck effect.
