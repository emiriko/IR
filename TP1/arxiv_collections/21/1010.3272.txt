In this paper we present a general procedure that allows for the reduction or
expansion of any network (considered as a weighted graph). This procedure
maintains the spectrum of the network's adjacency matrix up to a set of
eigenvalues known beforehand from its graph structure. This procedure can be
used to establish new equivalence relations on the class of all weighted graphs
(networks) where two graphs are equivalent if they can be reduced to the same
graph. Additionally, dynamical networks (or any finite dimensional, discrete
time dynamical system) can be analyzed using isospectral transformations. By so
doing we obtain stronger results regarding the global stability (strong
synchronization) of dynamical networks when compared to other standard methods.
