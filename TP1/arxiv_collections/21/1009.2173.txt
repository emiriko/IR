LS I +61 303 is an exceptionally rare example of a high mass X-ray binary
(HMXB) that also exhibits MeV-TeV emission, making it one of only a handful of
"gamma-ray binaries". Here we present H-alpha spectra that show strong
variability during the 26.5 day orbital period and over decadal time scales. We
detect evidence of a spiral density wave in the Be circumstellar disk over part
of the orbit. The H-alpha line profile also exhibits a dramatic emission burst
shortly before apastron, observed as a redshifted shoulder in the line profile,
as the compact source moves almost directly away from the observer. We
investigate several possible origins for this red shoulder, including an
accretion disk, mass transfer stream, and a compact pulsar wind nebula that
forms via a shock between the Be star's wind and the relativistic pulsar wind.
