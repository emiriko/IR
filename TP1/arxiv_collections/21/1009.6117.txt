The complete analytical solutions of the geodesic equations in Kerr-de Sitter
and Kerr-anti-de Sitter space-times are presented. They are expressed in terms
of Weierstrass elliptic p, zeta, and sigma functions as well as hyperelliptic
Kleinian sigma functions restricted to the one-dimensional theta-divisor. We
analyze the dependency of timelike geodesics on the parameters of the
space-time metric and the test-particle and compare the results with the
situation in Kerr space-time with vanishing cosmological constant. Furthermore,
we systematically can find all last stable spherical and circular orbits and
derive the expressions of the deflection angle of flyby orbits, the orbital
frequencies of bound orbits, the periastron shift, and the Lense-Thirring
effect.
