The hadron inclusive spectra in pp collisions at high energies are analyzed
within a soft QCD model, namely the quark-gluon string model. In addition to
the sea quark distribution in the incoming proton we consider also the
unintegrated gluon distribution that has an increasing behaviour when the gluon
transverse momentum grows. It leads to an increase of the inclusive spectra of
hadrons and their multiplicity in the central rapidity region of pp collision
at LHC energies.
