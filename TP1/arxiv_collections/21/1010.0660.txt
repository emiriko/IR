We characterize the energy loss of the non-equilibrium electron system in
individual metallic single-walled carbon nanotubes at low temperature. Using
Johnson noise thermometry, we demonstrate that, for a nanotube with ohmic
contacts, the dc resistance at finite bias current directly reflects the
average electron temperature. This enables a straightforward determination of
the thermal conductance associated with cooling of the nanotube electron
system. In analyzing the temperature- and length-dependence of the thermal
conductance, we consider contributions from acoustic phonon emission, optical
phonon emission, and hot electron outdiffusion.
