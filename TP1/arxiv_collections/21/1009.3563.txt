The Magnetism in Massive Stars (MiMeS) Project is a consensus collaboration
among many of the foremost international researchers of the physics of hot,
massive stars, with the basic aim of understanding the origin, evolution and
impact of magnetic fields in these objects. At the time of writing, MiMeS Large
Programs have acquired over 950 high-resolution polarised spectra of about 150
individual stars with spectral types from B5-O4, discovering new magnetic
fields in a dozen hot, massive stars. The quality of this spectral and magnetic
mat\'eriel is very high, and the Collaboration is keen to connect with
colleagues capable of exploiting the data in new or unforeseen ways. In this
paper we review the structure of the MiMeS observing programs and report the
status of observations, data modeling and development of related theory.
