We present results on strange and multi-strange particle production in Au+Au
collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=62.4$ GeV as measured with the STAR detector at
RHIC. Mid-rapidity transverse momentum spectra and integrated yields of
$K^{0}_{S}$, $\Lambda$, $\Xi$, $\Omega$ and their anti-particles are presented
for different centrality classes. The particle yields and ratios follow a
smooth energy dependence. Chemical freeze-out parameters, temperature, baryon
chemical potential and strangeness saturation factor obtained from the particle
yields are presented. Intermediate transverse momentum ($p_T$) phenomena are
discussed based on the ratio of the measured baryon-to-meson spectra and
nuclear modification factor. The centrality dependence of various measurements
presented show a similar behavior as seen in Au+Au collisions at
$\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV.
