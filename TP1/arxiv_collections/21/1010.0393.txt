We study exotic fermions with spectrum E^2 ~ p^{2N}. Such spectrum emerges in
the vicinity of the Fermi point with multiple topological charge N, if special
symmetry is obeyed. When this symmetry is violated, the multiple Fermi point
typically splits into N elementary Fermi points -- Dirac points with N=1 and
spectrum E^2 ~ p^2 .
