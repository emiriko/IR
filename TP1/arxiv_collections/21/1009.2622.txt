Optimization techniques for decreasing the time and area of adder circuits
have been extensively studied for years mostly in binary logic system. In this
paper, we provide the necessary equations required to design a full adder in
quaternary logic system. We develop the equations for single-stage parallel
adder which works as a carry look-ahead adder. We also provide the design of a
logarithmic stage parallel adder which can compute the carries within log2(n)
time delay for n qudits. At last, we compare the designs and finally propose a
hybrid adder which combines the advantages of serial and parallel adder.
