Recent work on information survival in sensor and human P2P networks, try to
study the datum preservation or the virus spreading in a network under the
dynamical system approach. Some interesting solutions propose to use non-linear
dynamical systems and fixed point stability theorems, providing closed form
formulas that depend on the largest eigenvalue of the dynamic system matrix.
Given that in a the Web there can be messages from one place to another, and
that this messages can be, with some probability, new unclassified virus
warning messages as well as worms or other kind of virus, the sites can be
infected very fast. The question to answer is how and when a network infection
can become global and how it can be controlled or at least how to stabilize his
spreading in such a way that it becomes confined below a fixed portion of the
network. In this paper, we try to make a step ahead in this direction and apply
classic results of the dynamical systems theory to model the behaviour of a
network where warning messages and virus spread.
