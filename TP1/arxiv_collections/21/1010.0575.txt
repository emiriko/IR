Researchers especially beginning with (Rogers & Graham, 1982) have noticed
important psychophysical and experimental similarities between the
neurologically different motion parallax and stereopsis cues. Their
quantitative analysis relied primarily on the "disparity equivalence"
approximation. In this article we show that retinal motion from lateral
translation satisfies a strong ("asymptotic") approximation to binocular
disparity. This precise mathematical similarity is also practical in the sense
that it applies at normal viewing distances. The approximation is an extension
to peripheral vision of (Cormac & Fox's 1985) well-known non-trig central
vision approximation for binocular disparity. We hope our simple algebraic
formula will be useful in analyzing experiments outside central vision where
less precise approximations have led to a number of quantitative errors in the
vision literature.
