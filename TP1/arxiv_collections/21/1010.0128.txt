Computational complexity theory contains a corpus of theorems and conjectures
regarding the time a Turing machine will need to solve certain types of
problems as a function of the input size. Nature {\em need not} be a Turing
machine and, thus, these theorems do not apply directly to it. But {\em
classical simulations} of physical processes are programs running on Turing
machines and, as such, are subject to them. In this work, computational
complexity theory is applied to classical simulations of systems performing an
adiabatic quantum computation (AQC), based on an annealed extension of the
density matrix renormalization group (DMRG). We conjecture that the
computational time required for those classical simulations is controlled
solely by the {\em maximal entanglement} found during the process. Thus, lower
bounds on the growth of entanglement with the system size can be provided. In
some cases, quantum phase transitions can be predicted to take place in certain
inhomogeneous systems. Concretely, physical conclusions are drawn from the
assumption that the complexity classes {\bf P} and {\bf NP} differ. As a
by-product, an alternative measure of entanglement is proposed which, via
Chebyshev's inequality, allows to establish strict bounds on the required
computational time.
