An analytical approach, which develops the gauge model of the glass
transition phenomenon, is suggested. It is based on the quantum field theory
and critical dynamics methods. The suggested mechanism of glass transition is
based on the interaction of the local magnetization field with the massive
gauge field, which describes frustration-induced plastic deformation. The
example of the three-dimensional Heisenberg model with trapped disorder is
considered. It is shown that the glass transition appears when the fluctuations
scale reaches the frustrations scale, and the mass of the gauge field becomes
equal to zero. The Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann relation for the glass transition
kinetics and critical exponent for non-linear susceptibility, $1.7\lesssim
\gamma < 3$, are derived in the framework of the suggested approach.
