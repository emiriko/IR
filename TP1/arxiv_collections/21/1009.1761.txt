The question is discussed of what is the speed of gravity (at the fundamental
non-perturbative level). The question is important, if nowhere else, in
discussing the problem of information "lost" in black holes. It turns out that
the duly defined "gravitational signal" generally may be causal, superluminal
and "semi-superluminal". In the class of globally hyperbolic spacetimes the two
last varieties coincide. And if some (often imposed, but not always satisfied)
conditions hold, the signals may be \emph{only} causal. In this sense the speed
of gravity does not exceed the speed of light.
