We study leptogenesis in the supersymmetric standard model plus the seesaw.
We identify important qualitative differences that characterize supersymmetric
leptogenesis with respect to the non-supersymmetric case. The lepton number
asymmetries in fermions and scalars do not equilibrate, and are related via a
non-vanishing gaugino chemical potential. Due to the presence of new anomalous
symmetries, electroweak sphalerons couple to winos and higgsinos, and QCD
sphalerons couple to gluinos, thus modifying the corresponding chemical
equilibrium conditions. A new constraint on particles chemical potentials
corresponding to an exactly conserved $R$-charge, that also involves the number
density asymmetry of the heavy sneutrinos, appears. These new ingredients
determine the $3\times 4$ matrices that mix up the density asymmetries of the
lepton flavours and of the heavy sneutrinos. We explain why in all temperature
ranges the particle thermodynamic system is characterized by the same number of
independent quantities. Numerical differences with respect to usual treatment
remain at the ${\cal O}(1)$ level.
