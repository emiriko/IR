MiBoard (Multiplayer Interactive Board Game) is an online, turn-based board
game, which is a supplement of the iSTART (Interactive Strategy Training for
Active Reading and Thinking) application. MiBoard is developed to test the
hypothesis that integrating game characteristics (point rewards, game-like
interaction, and peer feedback) into the iSTART trainer will significantly
improve its effectiveness on students' learning. It was shown by M. Rowe that a
physical board game did in fact enhance students' performance. MiBoard is a
computer-based version of Rowe's board game that eliminates constraints on
locality while retaining the crucial practice components that were the game's
objective. MiBoard gives incentives for participation and provides a more
enjoyable and social practice environment compared to the online individual
practice component of the original trainer
