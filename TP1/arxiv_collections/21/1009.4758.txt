We study the effect of isospin degree of freedom on the balance energy as
well as its mass dependence throughout the mass range 48-270 for two sets of
isobaric systems with N/Z = 1 and 1.4 using isospin-dependent quantum molecular
dynamics (IQMD) model. Our fndings reveal the dominance of Coulomb repulsion in
isospin effects on balance energy as well as its mass dependence throughout the
range of the colliding geometry.
