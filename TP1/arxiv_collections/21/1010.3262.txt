We review the fundamental results of a new cosmological model, based on
conformal gravity, and apply them to the analysis of the early data of the
Pioneer anomaly. We show that our conformal cosmology can naturally explain the
anomalous acceleration of the Pioneer 10 and 11 spacecraft, in terms of a local
blueshift region extending around the solar system and therefore affecting the
frequencies of the navigational radio signals exchanged between Earth and the
spacecraft. On the contrary, conformal gravity corrections alone would not be
able to account for dynamical effects of such magnitude to be capable of
producing the observed Pioneer acceleration. By using our model, we explain the
numerical coincidence between the value of the anomalous acceleration and the
Hubble constant at the present epoch and also confirm our previous
determination of the cosmological parameters gamma ~ 10^(-28) cm^(-1) and delta
~ 10^(-4) - 10^(-5). New Pioneer data are expected to be publicly available in
the near future, which might enable more precise evaluations of these
parameters.
