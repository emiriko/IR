Aims: We study the diffuse X-ray emission observed in the field of view of
the pulsar B 0540-69 in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) by XMM-Newton. We want
to understand the nature of this soft diffuse emission, which coincides with
the superbubble in the HII region N 158, and improve our understanding of the
evolution of superbubbles. Methods: We analyse the XMM-Newton spectra of the
diffuse emission. Using the parameters obtained from the spectral fit, we
perform calculations of the evolution of the superbubble. The mass loss and
energy input rates are based on the initial mass function (IMF) of the observed
OB association inside the superbubble. Results: The analysis of the spectra
shows that the soft X-ray emission arises from hot shocked gas surrounded by a
thin shell of cooler, ionised gas. We show that the stellar winds alone cannot
account for the energy inside the superbubble, but the energy release of 2 - 3
supernova explosions in the past ~1 Myr provides a possible explanation.
Conclusions: The combination of high sensitivity X-ray data, allowing spectral
analysis, and analytical models for superbubbles bears the potential to reveal
the evolutionary state of interstellar bubbles, if the stellar content is
known.
