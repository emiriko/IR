Thermally activated flux flow (TAFF) and flux flow Hall effect (FFHE) of
Fe(Te,S) single crystal in the mixed state are studied in magnetic fields up to
35 T. Thermally activated energy (TAE) is analyzed using conventional Arrhenius
relation and modified TAFF theory which is closer to experimental results. The
results indicate that there is a crossover from single-vortex pinning region to
collective creep pinning region with increasing magnetic field. The temperature
dependence of TAE is different for H//ab and H//c. On the other hand, the
analysis of FFHE in the mixed state indicates that there is no Hall sign
reversal. We also observe scaling behavior |Rhoxy(H)| = A*Rhoxx(H)^beta.
