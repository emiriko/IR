We report on the attainment of Bose-Einstein condensation of 86Sr. This
isotope has a scattering length of about +800 a0 and thus suffers from fast
three-body losses. To avoid detrimental atom loss, evaporative cooling is
performed at low densities around 3x10^12 cm^-3 in a large volume optical
dipole trap. We obtain almost pure condensates of 5x10^3 atoms.
