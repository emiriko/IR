We measure tunneling through a single quantum level in a carbon nanotube
quantum dot connected to resistive metal leads. For the electrons tunneling
to/from the nanotube, the leads serve as a dissipative environment, which
suppresses the tunneling rate. In the regime of sequential tunneling, the
height of the single-electron conductance peaks increases as the temperature is
lowered, although it scales more weekly than the conventional 1/T. In the
resonant tunneling regime (temperature smaller than the level width), the peak
width approaches saturation, while the peak height starts to decrease. Overall,
the peak height shows a non-monotonic temperature dependence. We associate this
unusual behavior with the transition from the sequential to the resonant
tunneling through a single quantum level in a dissipative environment.
