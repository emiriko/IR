Background: The recent explosion of experimental techniques in single
molecule biophysics has generated a variety of novel time series data requiring
equally novel computational tools for analysis and inference. This article
describes in general terms how graphical modeling may be used to learn from
biophysical time series data using the variational Bayesian expectation
maximization algorithm (VBEM). The discussion is illustrated by the example of
single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) versus time
data, where the smFRET time series is modeled as a hidden Markov model (HMM)
with Gaussian observables. A detailed description of smFRET is provided as
well. Results: The VBEM algorithm returns the model's evidence and an
approximating posterior parameter distribution given the data. The former
provides a metric for model selection via maximum evidence (ME), and the latter
a description of the model's parameters learned from the data. ME/VBEM provide
several advantages over the more commonly used approach of maximum likelihood
(ML) optimized by the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm, the most
important being a natural form of model selection and a well-posed
(non-divergent) optimization problem. Conclusions: The results demonstrate the
utility of graphical modeling for inference of dynamic processes in single
molecule biophysics.
