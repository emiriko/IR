We found that under pressure SnO with alpha-PbO structure, the same structure
as in many Fe-based superconductors, e.g. beta-FeSe, undergoes a transition to
a superconducting state for p > 6 GPa with a maximum Tc of 1.4 K at p = 9.3
GPa. The pressure dependence of Tc reveals a dome-like shape and
superconductivity disappears for p > 16 GPa. It is further shown from band
structure calculations that SnO under pressure exhibits a Fermi surface
topology similar to that reported for some Fe-based superconductors and that
the nesting between the hole and electron pockets correlates with the change of
Tc as a function of pressure.
