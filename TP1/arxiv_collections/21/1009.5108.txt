Many theorems about Kolmogorov complexity rely on existence of combinatorial
objects with specific properties. Usually the probabilistic method gives such
objects with better parameters than explicit constructions do. But the
probabilistic method does not give "effective" variants of such theorems, i.e.
variants for resource-bounded Kolmogorov complexity. We show that a "naive
derandomization" approach of replacing these objects by the output of
Nisan-Wigderson pseudo-random generator may give polynomial-space variants of
such theorems.
  Specifically, we improve the preceding polynomial-space analogue of Muchnik's
conditional complexity theorem. I.e., for all $a$ and $b$ there exists a
program $p$ of least possible length that transforms $a$ to $b$ and is simple
conditional on $b$. Here all programs work in polynomial space and all
complexities are measured with logarithmic accuracy instead of polylogarithmic
one in the previous work.
