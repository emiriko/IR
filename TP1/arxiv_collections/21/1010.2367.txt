We investigate the entanglement produced by a multi-path interferometer that
is composed of two symmetric multiports, with phase shifts applied to the
output of the first multiport. Particular attention is paid to the case when we
have a single photon entering the interferometer. For this situation we derive
a simple condition that characterize the types of entanglement that one can
generate. We then show how one can use the results from the single photon case
to determine what kinds of multi-photon entangled states one can prepare using
the interferometer.
