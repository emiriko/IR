Within the framework of projective geometry, we investigate kinematics and
symmetry in $(\alpha,\beta)$ spacetime-one special types of Finsler spacetime.
The projectively flat $(\alpha,\beta)$ spacetime with constant flag curvature
is divided into four types. The symmetry in type A-Riemann spacetime with
constant sectional curvature is just the one in de Sitter special relativity.
The symmetry in type B-locally Minkowski spacetime is just the one in very
special relativity. It is found that type C-Funk spacetime and type D-scaled
Berwald's metric spacetime both possess the Lorentz group as its isometric
group. The geodesic equation, algebra and dispersion relation in the
$(\alpha,\beta)$ spacetime are given. The corresponding invariant special
relativity in the four types of $(\alpha,\beta)$ spacetime contain two
parameters-the speed of light and a geometrical parameter which may relate to
the new physical scale. They all reduce to Einstein's special relativity while
the geometrical parameter vanishes.
