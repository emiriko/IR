We argue that complex systems must possess long range correlations and
illustrate this idea on the example of the mean field spin glass model. Defined
on the complete graph, this model has no genuine concept of distance, but the
long range character of correlations is translated into a broad distribution of
the spin-spin correlation coefficients for almost all realizations of the
random couplings. When we sample the whole phase space we find that this
distribution is so broad indeed that at low temperatures it essentially becomes
uniform, with all possible correlation values appearing with the same
probability. The distribution of correlations inside a single phase space
valley is also studied and found to be much narrower.
