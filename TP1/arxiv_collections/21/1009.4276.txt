The confinement of coloured entities in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is
traced to colour singletness of the observed entities. This is believed to
arise from colour singlet state of quark-antiquark for mesons and a fully
colour antisymmetric state for baryons. This demands a spherically symmetric
baryon in the ground state. However it is pointed out that a deformed baryon in
the ground state has been found to be extremely successful phenomenology. There
are convincing experimental supports for a deformed nucleon as well. This means
that something has been missed in the fundamental theory. In this paper this
problem is traced to a new colour singlet state for baryons which has been
missed hitherto and incorporation of which provides a consistent justification
of a deformed baryon in the ground state. Interestingly this new colour singlet
state is global in nature.
