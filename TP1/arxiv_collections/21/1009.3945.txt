We present preliminary results of an analysis of the iron depletion factor
into dust grains for a sample of 20 planetary nebulae (PNe) from the Galactic
bulge. We compare these results with the ones we obtained in a prior analysis
of 28 Galactic disk PNe and 8 Galactic H II regions. We derive high depletion
factors in all the objects, suggesting that more than 80% of their iron atoms
are condensed into dust grains. The range of iron depletions in the sample PNe
covers about two orders of magnitude, and we explore here if the differences
are related to the PN morphology. However, we do not find any significant
correlation.
