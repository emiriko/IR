We discuss the relevance of the scalar modes appearing in chiral theories
with spontaneous symmetry breaking such as the NJL model for nuclear matter
studies. We show that it depends on the relative role of chiral symmetry
breaking and confinement in the nucleon mass origin. It is only in the case of
a mixed origin that nuclear matter can be stable and reach saturation. We
describe models of nucleon structure where this balance is achieved. We show
how chiral constarints and confinement modify the QCD sum rules for the mass
evolution in nuclear matter.
