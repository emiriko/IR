We find a dramatic enhancement of electron propagation along a narrow range
of real-space angles from an isotropic source in a two-dimensional quantum well
made from a zincblende semiconductor. This ``electron beam'' formation is
caused by the interplay between spin-orbit interaction originating from a
perpendicular electric field to the quantum well and the intrinsic spin-orbit
field of the zincblende crystal lattice in a quantum well, in situations where
the two fields are different in strength but of the same order of magnitude.
Beam formation is associated with caustics and can be described
semi-classically using a stationary phase analysis.
