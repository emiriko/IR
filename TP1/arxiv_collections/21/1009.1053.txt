We derive a nonlocal effective Lagrangian for the chiral magnetic effect. An
electric field is generated by winding number fluctuations of the nonabelian
gauge field in the presence of a strong magnetic field. We estimate the
magnitude of charge asymmetry fluctuations with respect to the reaction plane
induced by the chiral magnetic effect in relativistic heavy ion collisions to
be less than $10^{-6}$, several orders of magnitude smaller than the signal
observed in the STAR experiment.
