In a recent work [H. Flayac, I.A. Shelykh, D.D. Solnyshkov and G. Malpuech,
Phys. Rev. B 81, 045318 (2010)], we have analyzed the effect of the TE-TM
splitting on the stability of the exciton-polariton vortex states. We
considered classical vortex solutions having cylindrical symmetry and we found
that the so-called half-vortex states [Yu. G. Rubo, Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 106401
(2007)] are not solutions of the stationary Gross-Pitaevskii equation. In their
Comment [M. Toledo Solano, Yu.G. Rubo, Phys. Rev. B 82, 127301 (2010)], M.
Toledo Solano and Yuri G. Rubo claim that this conclusion is misleading and
pretend to demonstrate the existence of static half-vortices in an
exciton-polariton condensate in the presence of TE-TM splitting. In this reply
we explain why this assertion is not demonstrated satisfactorily.
