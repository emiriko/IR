The PDPTW is an optimization vehicles routing problem which must meet
requests for transport between suppliers and customers satisfying precedence,
capacity and time constraints. We present, in this paper, a genetic algorithm
for optimization of a multi pickup and delivery problem with time windows
(m-PDPTW). We purposes a brief literature review of the PDPTW, present an
approach based on genetic algorithms to give a satisfying solution to the
m-PDPTW minimizing the total travel cost.
