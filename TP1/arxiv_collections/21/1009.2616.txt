The temperature evolution of the crystal and magnetic structures of
ferroelectric sulfide AgCrS2 have been investigated by means of neutron
scattering. AgCrS2 undergoes at TN = 41.6 K a first-order phase transition,
from a paramagnetic rhombohedral R3m to an antiferromagnetic monoclinic
structure with a polar Cm space group. In addition to being ferroelectric below
TN, the low temperature phase of AgCrS2 exhibits an unconventional collinear
magnetic structure that can be described as double ferromagnetic stripes
coupled antiferromagnetically, with the magnetic moment of Cr+3 oriented along
b within the anisotropic triangular plane. The magnetic couplings stabilizing
this structure are discussed using inelastic neutron scattering results.
Ferroelectricity below TN in AgCrS2 can possibly be explained in terms of
atomic displacements at the magneto-elastic induced structural distortion.
These results contrast with the behavior of the parent frustrated
antiferromagnet and spin-driven ferroelectric AgCrO2.
