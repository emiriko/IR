The nature of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) is still unclear. Employing
Eggleton's stellar evolution code with the optically thick wind assumption, we
systematically studied the He star donor channel of SNe Ia, in which a
carbon-oxygen white dwarf accretes material from a He main-sequence star or a
He subgiant to increase its mass to the Chandrasekhar mass. We mapped out the
initial parameters for producing SNe Ia in the orbital period--secondary mass
plane for various WD masses from this channel. According to a detailed binary
population synthesis approach, we find that this channel can produce SNe Ia
with short delay times (~100Myr) implied by recent observations. We obtained
many properties of the surviving companions of this channel after SN explosion,
which can be verified by future observations. We also find that the surviving
companions from the SN explosion scenario have a high spatial velocity
(>400km/s), which could be an alternative origin for hypervelocity stars
(HVSs), especially for HVSs such as US 708.
