In this paper we discuss the threat of malware targeted at extracting
information about the relationships in a real-world social network as well as
characteristic information about the individuals in the network, which we dub
Stealing Reality. We present Stealing Reality, explain why it differs from
traditional types of network attacks, and discuss why its impact is
significantly more dangerous than that of other attacks. We also present our
initial analysis and results regarding the form that an SR attack might take,
with the goal of promoting the discussion of defending against such an attack,
or even just detecting the fact that one has already occurred.
