We investigate the phase diagram of a three-component system of particles on
a one-dimensional filled lattice, or equivalently of a one-dimensional
three-state Potts model, with reflection asymmetric mean field interactions.
The three types of particles are designated as $A$, $B$, and $C$. The system is
described by a grand canonical ensemble with temperature $T$ and chemical
potentials $T\lambda_A$, $T\lambda_B$, and $T\lambda_C$. We find that for
$\lambda_A=\lambda_B=\lambda_C$ the system undergoes a phase transition from a
uniform density to a continuum of phases at a critical temperature $\hat
T_c=(2\pi/\sqrt3)^{-1}$. For other values of the chemical potentials the system
has a unique equilibrium state. As is the case for the canonical ensemble for
this $ABC$ model, the grand canonical ensemble is the stationary measure
satisfying detailed balance for a natural dynamics. We note that $\hat
T_c=3T_c$, where $T_c$ is the critical temperature for a similar transition in
the canonical ensemble at fixed equal densities $r_A=r_B=r_C=1/3$.
