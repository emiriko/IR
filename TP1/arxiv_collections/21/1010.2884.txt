Crystal plasticity is the result of the motion and interaction of
dislocations. There is, however, still a major gap between microscopic and
mesoscopic simulations and continuum crystal plasticity models. Only recently a
higher dimensional dislocation density tensor was defined which overcomes some
drawbacks of earlier dislocation density measures. The evolution equation for
this tensor can be considered as a continuum version of dislocation dynamics.
We use this evolution equation to develop evolution equations for the total
dislocation density and an average curvature which together govern a faithful
representation of the dislocation kinematics without having to use extra
dimensions.
