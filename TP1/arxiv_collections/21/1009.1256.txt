This paper aims at giving an update on the most versatile adaptive optics fed
instrument to date, the well known and successful NACO . Although NACO is only
scheduled for about two more years at the Very Large Telescope (VLT), it keeps
on evolving with additional operation modes bringing original astronomical
results. The high contrast imaging community uses it creatively as a test-bench
for SPHERE and other second generation planet imagers. A new visible wavefront
sensor (WFS) optimized for Laser Guide Star (LGS) operations has been installed
and tested, the cube mode is more and more requested for frame selection on
bright sources, a seeing enhancer mode (no tip/tilt correction) is now offered
to provide full sky coverage and welcome all kind of extragalactic
applications, etc. The Instrument Operations Team (IOT) and Paranal engineers
are currently working hard at maintaining the instrument overall performances
but also at improving them and offering new capabilities, providing the
community with a well tuned and original instrument for the remaining time it
is being used. The present contribution delivers a non-exhaustive overview of
the new modes and experiments that have been carried out in the past months.
