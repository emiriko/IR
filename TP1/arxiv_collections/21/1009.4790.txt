Solar oscillations are expected to be excited by turbulent flows in the
intergranular lanes near the solar surface. Time series recorded by the IMaX
instrument aboard the {\sc Sunrise} observatory reveal solar oscillations at
high resolution, which allow studying the properties of oscillations with short
wavelengths. We analyze two times series with synchronous recordings of Doppler
velocity and continuum intensity images with durations of 32\thinspace min and
23\thinspace min, resp., recorded close to the disk center of the Sun to study
the propagation and excitation of solar acoustic oscillations. In the Doppler
velocity data, both the standing acoustic waves and the short-lived,
high-degree running waves are visible. The standing waves are visible as
temporary enhancements of the amplitudes of the large-scale velocity field due
to the stochastic superposition of the acoustic waves. We focus on the
high-degree small-scale waves by suitable filtering in the Fourier domain.
Investigating the propagation and excitation of $f$- and $p_1$-modes with wave
numbers $k > 1.4$\thinspace 1/Mm we find that also exploding granules
contribute to the excitation of solar $p$-modes in addition to the contribution
of intergranular lanes.
