The time-dependent non-crossing approximation is utilized to determine the
effects of the crystal planes of gold contacts on time dependent current
through a quantum dot suddenly shifted into the Kondo regime via a gate
voltage. For an asymmetrically coupled system, instantaneous conductance
exhibits complex fluctuations. We identify the frequencies participating in
these fluctuations and they turn out to be proportional to the separation
between the sharp features in the density of states and the Fermi level in
agreement with previous studies. Based on this observation, we predict that
using different crystal planes as electrodes would give rise to drastically
different transient currents which can be accessed with ultrafast pump-probe
techniques.
