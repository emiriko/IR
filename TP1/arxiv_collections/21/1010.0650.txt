A deep Chandra observation of the X-ray bright group, NGC 5044, shows that
the central region of this group has been strongly perturbed by repeated AGN
outbursts. These recent AGN outbursts have produced many small X-ray cavities,
cool filaments and cold fronts. We find a correlation between the coolest X-ray
emitting gas and the morphology of the Ha filaments. The Ha filaments are
oriented in the direction of the X-ray cavities, suggesting that the warm gas
responsible for the Halpha emission originated near the center of NGC 5044 and
was dredged up behind the buoyant, AGN-inflated X-ray cavities. A detailed
spectroscopic analysis shows that the central region of NGC 5044 contains
spatially varying amounts of multiphase gas. The regions with the most
inhomogeneous gas temperature distribution tend to correlate with the extended
235 MHz and 610 MHz radio emission detected by the GMRT. This may result from
gas entrainment within the radio emitting plasma or mixing of different
temperature gas in the regions surrounding the radio emitting plasma by AGN
induced turbulence. Accounting for the effects of multiphase gas, we find that
the abundance of heavy elements is fairly uniform within the central 100 kpc,
with abundances of 60-80% solar for all elements except oxygen, which has a
significantly sub-solar abundance. In the absence of continued AGN outbursts,
the gas in the center of NGC 5044 should attain a more homogeneous distribution
of gas temperature through the dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy and heat
conduction in approximately 10e8 yr. The presence of multiphase gas in NGC 5044
indicates that the time between recent AGN outbursts has been less than
approximately 10e8 yr.
