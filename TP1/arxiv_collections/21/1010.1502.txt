We study string solutions in the beta-deformed Sasaki-Einstein gauge/gravity
dualities. We find that the BPS point-like strings move in the submanifolds
where the two U(1) circles shrink to zero size. In the corresponding T^3
fibration description, the strings live on the edges of the polyhedron, where
the T^3 fibration degenerates to T^1. Moreover, we find that for each deformed
Sasaki-Einstein manifold the BPS string solutions exist only for particular
values of the deformation parameter. Our results imply that in the dual field
theory the corresponding BPS operators exist only for these particular values
of the deformation parameter we find. We also examine the non-BPS strings,
derive their dispersion relations and compare them with the undeformed ones.
Finally, we comment on the range of the validity of our solutions and their
dependence on the deformation parameter.
