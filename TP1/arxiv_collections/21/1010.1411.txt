We investigate colloidal suspensions under shear flow through numerical
experiments. By measuring the time-correlation function of a bond-orientational
order parameter, we find a divergent time scale near a transition point from a
disordered fluid phase to an ordered fluid phase, where the order is
characterized by a nonzero value of the bond-orientational order parameter. We
also present a phase diagram in the $(\rho, \dot{\gamma}^{\mathrm{ex}})$ plane,
where $\rho$ is the density of the colloidal particles and
$\dot{\gamma}^{\mathrm{ex}}$ is the shear rate of the solvent. The transition
line in the phase diagram terminates at the equilibrium transition point, while
a critical region near the transition line vanishes continuously as
$\dot{\gamma}^{\mathrm{ex}} \rightarrow 0$.
