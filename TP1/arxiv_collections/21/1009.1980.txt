Gamma-ray binaries are systems containing a massive star and a compact object
that have been detected up to TeV energies. The high energy emission could
result from particle acceleration in the region where the stellar wind from the
massive star interacts with the relativistic wind from a young pulsar. LS 5039
has the most compact orbit amongst gamma-ray binaries and its X-ray lightcurve
shows a stable modulation synchronized with the orbital period. Photoelectric
absorption of X-rays in the O star wind and occultation of the X-ray emitting
region by the massive star can alter the X-ray lightcurve and spectrum along
the orbit. Yet, the X-ray spectrum and lightcurve of LS 5039 do not show
intrinsic absorption or X-ray eclipses. We study these effects in the framework
of the pulsar wind scenario as a function of the binary inclination angle, the
stellar wind mass-loss rate and the size of the X-ray emitter. An extended
X-ray emission region >~ 3R_star appears necessary to reconcile the pulsar wind
scenario with observations.
