We develop a Born-Oppenheimer type formalism for the description of quantum
thermal transport along hybrid nanoscale objects. Our formalism is suitable for
treating heat transfer in the off-resonant regime, where e.g., the relevant
vibrational modes of the interlocated molecule are high relative to typical
bath frequencies, and at low temperatures when tunneling effects dominate. A
general expression for the thermal energy current is accomplished, in the form
of a generalized Landauer formula. In the harmonic limit this expression
reduces to the standard Landauer result for heat transfer, while in the
presence of nonlinearities multiphonon tunneling effects are realized.
