We derive an analytical expression which allows efficient computation of the
effect of all the Fermi surface trajectories induced by a combination of Bragg
scattering and magnetic breakdown on the in-plane components of the resistivity
tensor. The particular network of coupled orbits which we consider was first
formulated by Falicov and Sievert, who studied the problem numerically. Our
approach, based upon a method used previously to derive an analytical solution
for interlayer transport, allows us to show that the conductivity tensor can be
written as a sum of a matrix representing the effect of total magnetic
breakdown and one representing a combination of complex electronic
trajectories, and we find a compact expression for the in-plane components of
the resistivity tensor that can be evaluated straightforwardly.
