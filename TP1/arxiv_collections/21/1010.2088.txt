Lyapunov control (open-loop) is often confronted with uncertainties and
errors in practical applications. In this paper, we analyze the robustness of
Lyapunov control against the uncertainties and errors in quantum control
systems. The analysis is carried out through examinations of uncertainties and
errors, calculations of the control fidelity under influences of the
certainties and errors, as well as discussions on the caused effects. Two
examples, a closed control system and an open control system, are presented to
illustrate the general formulism.
