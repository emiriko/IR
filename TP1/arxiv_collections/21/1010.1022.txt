In this article, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a triple-mode
single-transistor graphene amplifier utilizing a three-terminal back-gated
single-layer graphene transistor. The ambipolar nature of electronic transport
in graphene transistors leads to increased amplifier functionality as compared
to amplifiers built with unipolar semiconductor devices. The ambipolar graphene
transistors can be configured as n-type, p-type, or hybrid-type by changing the
gate bias. As a result, the single-transistor graphene amplifier can operate in
the common-source, common-drain, or frequency multiplication mode,
respectively. This in-field controllability of the single-transistor graphene
amplifier can be used to realize the modulation necessary for phase shift
keying and frequency shift keying, which are widely used in wireless
applications. It also offers new opportunities for designing analog circuits
with simpler structure and higher integration densities for communications
applications.
