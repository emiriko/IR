The application package "IONORT" for the calculation of ray-tracing can be
used by customers using the Windows operating system. It is a program whose
interface with the user is created in MATLAB. In fact, the program launches an
executable that integrates the system of differential equations written in
Fortran and importing the output in the MATLAB program, which generates
graphics and other information on the ray. This work is inspired mainly by the
program of Jones and Stephenson, widespread in the scientific community that is
interested in radio propagation via the ionosphere. The program is written in
FORTRAN 77, a mainframe CDC-3800. The code itself, as well as being very
elegant, is highly efficient and provides the basis for many programs now in
use mainly in the Coordinate Registration (CR) of Over The Horizon (OTH)
radars. The input and output of this program require devices no longer in use
for several decades and there are no compilers that accept instructions written
for that type of mainframe. For this reason, the core of the program to perform
numerical integration, after the necessary amendments, was passed to a modern
compiler under the Windows operating system and the executable has been
imported into a MATLAB program. Thus, all input and output operations are
handled by modern MATLAB program that implements the Fortran program and
importing the output. This provides great versatility to the entire application
package with presentations in two dimensions (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) on
real geo-referenced maps.
