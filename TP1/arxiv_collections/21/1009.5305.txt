We have simulated a Galactic population of young pulsars and compared with
the Fermi LAT sample, constraining the birth properties, beaming and evolution
of these spin-powered objects. Using quantitative tests of agreement with the
distributions of observed spin and pulse properties, we find that short birth
periods P_0 ~ 50ms and gamma-ray beams arising in the outer magnetosphere,
dominated by a single pole, are strongly preferred. The modeled relative
numbers of radio-detected and radio-quiet objects agree well with the data.
Although the sample is local, extrapolation to the full Galaxy implies a
gamma-ray pulsar birthrate 1/(59 yr). This is shown to be in good agreement
with the estimated Galactic core collapse rate and with the local density of OB
star progenitors. We give predictions for the numbers of expected young pulsar
detections if Fermi LAT observations continue 10 years. In contrast to the
potentially significant contribution of unresolved millisecond pulsars, we find
that young pulsars should contribute little to the Galactic gamma-ray
background.
