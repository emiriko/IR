The results of a theoretical investigation on the low-velocity stopping power
of the ions moving in a magnetized collisional plasma are presented. The
stopping power for an ion is calculated employing linear response theory using
the dielectric function approach. The collisions, which leads to a damping of
the excitations in the plasma, is taken into account through a
number-conserving relaxation time approximation in the linear response
function. In order to highlight the effects of collisions and magnetic field we
present a comparison of our analytical and numerical results obtained for a
nonzero damping or magnetic field with those for a vanishing damping or
magnetic field. It is shown that the collisions remove the anomalous friction
obtained previously [Nersisyan et al., Phys. Rev. E 61, 7022 (2000)] for the
collisionless magnetized plasmas at low ion velocities. One of major objectives
of this study is to compare and contrast our theoretical results with those
obtained through a novel diffusion formulation based on Dufty-Berkovsky
relation evaluated in magnetized one-component plasma models framed on target
ions and electrons.
