Low energy electron diffraction (LEED) experiments, LEED simulations and
finite slab density functional calculations are combined to study the cleavage
surface of Co doped BaFe_{2-x}Co_{x}As_{2} (x = 0.1, 0.17). We demonstrate that
the energy dependence of the LEED data can only be understood from a
terminating 1/2 Ba layer accompanied by distortions of the underlying
As-Fe_2-As block. As a result, surface related Fe 3d states are present in the
electronic structure, which we identify in angle resolved photoemission
experiments. The close proximity of the surface-related states to the bulk
bands inevitably leads to broadening of the ARPES signals, which excludes the
use of the BaFe_{2-x}Co_{x}As_{2} system for accurate determination of
self-energies using ARPES.
