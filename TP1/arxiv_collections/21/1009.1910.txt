We have used the greatly enhanced spectral capabilities of the Expanded Very
Large Array to observe both the 22.3 GHz continuum emission and the H66{\alpha}
recombination line toward the well-studied Galactic emission-line star MWC
349A. The continuum flux density is found to be 411 $\pm$ 41 mJy in good
agreement with previous determinations. The H66{\alpha} line peak intensity is
about 25 mJy, and the average line-to-continuum flux ratio is about 5%, as
expected for local thermodynamic equilibrium conditions. This shows that the
H66{\alpha} recombination line is not strongly masing as had previously been
suggested, although a moderate maser contribution could be present. The
He66{\alpha} recombination line is also detected in our observations; the
relative strengths of the two recombination lines yield an ionized helium to
ionized hydrogen abundance ratio y+ = 0.12 $\pm$ 0.02. The ionized helium
appears to share the kinematics of the thermally excited ionized hydrogen gas,
so the two species are likely to be well mixed. The electron temperature of the
ionized gas in MWC 349A deduced from our observations is 6,300 $\pm$ 600 K.
