This volume contains the proceedings of WCSI 2010, the International Workshop
on Component and Service Interoperability. WCSI 2010 was held in Malaga (Spain)
on June 29th, 2010 as a satellite event of the TOOLS 2010 Federated
Conferences. The papers published in this volume tackle different issues that
are currently central to our community, namely definition of expressive
interface languages, formal models and approaches to software composition and
adaptation, interface-based compatibility and substitutability, and
verification techniques for distributed software.
