We propose how to explore the Franck-Condon (FC) physics via a single ion
confined in a spin-dependent potential, formed by the combination of a Paul
trap and a magnetic field gradient. The correlation between electronic and
vibrational degrees of freedom, called as electron-vibron coupling, is induced
by a nonzero gradient. For a sufficiently strong electron-vibron coupling, the
FC blockade of low-lying vibronic transitions takes place. We analyze the
feasibility of observing the FC physics in a single trapped ion, and
demonstrate various potential applications of the ionic FC physics in quantum
state engineering and quantum information processing.
