We report first-principles calculations of inelastic Seebeck coefficients in
an aluminum monatomic junction. We compare the elastic and inelastic Seebeck
coefficients with and without local heating. In the low temperature regime, the
signature of normal modes in the profiles of the inelastic Seebeck effects is
salient. The inelastic Seebeck effects are enhanced by the normal modes, and
further magnified by local heating. In the high temperature regime, the
inelastic Seebeck effects are weakly suppressed due to the quasi-ballistic
transport.
