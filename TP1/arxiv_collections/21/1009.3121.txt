Given n-copies of unknown bipartite (possiblly mixed) state, our task is to
test whether the state is a pure state of not. Allowed to use the global
operations, optimal one-sided error test is the projection onto the symmetric
subspace, obviously. Is it possible to approximate the globally optimal
measurement by LOCC when n is large?
