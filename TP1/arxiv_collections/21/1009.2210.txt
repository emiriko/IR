In this note, we survey some elementary theorems and proofs concerning
dynamical matrices theory. Some mathematical concepts and results involved in
quantum information theory are reviewed. A little new result on the matrix
representation of quantum operation are obtained. And best separable
approximation for quantum operations is presented.
