Let each of n particles starting at the origin in Z^2 perform simple random
walk until reaching a site with no other particles. Lawler, Bramson, and
Griffeath proved that the resulting random set A(n) of n occupied sites is
(with high probability) close to a disk B_r of radius r=\sqrt{n/\pi}. We show
that the discrepancy between A(n) and the disk is at most logarithmic in the
radius: i.e., there is an absolute constant C such that the following holds
with probability one: B_{r - C \log r} \subset A(\pi r^2) \subset B_{r+ C \log
r} for all sufficiently large r.
