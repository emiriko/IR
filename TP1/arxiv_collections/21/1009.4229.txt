We describe two different important measurements to be performed at the LHC.
The Mueller Navelet jet and jet gap jet cross section represent a test of BFKL
dynamics and we perform a NLL calculation of these processes and compare it
with recent Tevatron measurements. The study of the $WW\gamma \gamma$ couplings
at the LHC using the forward detectors proposed in the ATLAS Forward Physics
project as an example allows to probe higgsless and extradimension models via
anomalous quartic couplings since the reach is improved by four orders of
magnitude with respect to the LEP results.
