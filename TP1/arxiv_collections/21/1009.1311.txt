We make an complementary investigation of the primordial trispectrum from
exchanging intermediate scalar modes in multi-field inflation models with
generalized kinetic terms. Together with the calculation of irreducible
contributions to the primordial trispectrum in Ref.[103], we give the full
leading-order primordial trispectrum in generalized multi-field models.
