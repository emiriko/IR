In this paper, we propose three approaches for the estimation of the Tucker
decomposition of multi-way arrays (tensors) from partial observations. All
approaches are formulated as convex minimization problems. Therefore, the
minimum is guaranteed to be unique. The proposed approaches can automatically
estimate the number of factors (rank) through the optimization. Thus, there is
no need to specify the rank beforehand. The key technique we employ is the
trace norm regularization, which is a popular approach for the estimation of
low-rank matrices. In addition, we propose a simple heuristic to improve the
interpretability of the obtained factorization. The advantages and
disadvantages of three proposed approaches are demonstrated through numerical
experiments on both synthetic and real world datasets. We show that the
proposed convex optimization based approaches are more accurate in predictive
performance, faster, and more reliable in recovering a known multilinear
structure than conventional approaches.
