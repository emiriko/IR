We present a new detailed abundance study of field red horizontal branch
(RHB) and blue horizontal branch (BHB) non-variable stars. High resolution and
high S/N echelle spectra of 11 RHB and 12 BHB were obtained with the McDonald
2.7 m telescope, and the RHB sample was augmented by reanalysis of spectra of
25 stars from a recent survey. We derived stellar atmospheric parameters based
on spectroscopic constraints, and computed relative abundance ratios for 24
species of 19 elements. The species include Si II and Ca II, which have not
been previously studied in RHB and BHB (Teff < 9000 K) stars. The abundance
ratios are generally consistent with those of similar-metallicity field stars
in different evolutionary stages. We estimated the masses of the RHB and BHB
stars by comparing their Teff--log g positions with HB model evolutionary
tracks. The mass distribution suggests that our program stars possess masses of
~0.5 Msun. Finally, we compared the temperature distributions of field RHB and
BHB stars with field RR Lyraes in the metallicity range -0.8 >~ [Fe/H] >~ -2.5.
This yielded effective temperatures estimates of 5900K and 7400 K for the red
and blue edges of the RR Lyrae instability strip.
