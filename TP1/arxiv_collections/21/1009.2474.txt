We present a combinatorial method to determine the dimension of
$\C{H}$-strata in the algebra of $m\times n$ quantum matrices $\Oq$ as follows.
To a given $\C{H}$-stratum we associate a certain permutation via the notion of
pipe-dreams. We show that the dimension of the $\C{H}$-stratum is precisely the
number of odd cycles in this permutation. Using this result, we are able to
give closed formulas for the trivariate generating function that counts the
$d$-dimensional $\C{H}$-strata in $\Oq$. Finally, we extract the coefficients
of this generating function in order to settle conjectures proposed by the
first and third named authors \cite{bldim,bll} regarding the asymptotic
proportion of $d$-dimensional $\C{H}$-strata in $\Oq$.
