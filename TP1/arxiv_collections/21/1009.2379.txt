In spallation neutron sources, liquid mercury is the subject of big thermal
and pressure shocks, upon adsorbing the proton beam. These changes can cause
unstable bubbles in the liquid, which can damage the structural material. While
there are methods to deal with the pressure shock, the local temperature shock
cannot be avoided. In our paper we calculated the work of the critical cluster
formation (i.e. for mercury micro-bubbles) together with the rate of their
formation (nucleation rate). It is shown that the homogeneous nucleation rates
are very low even after adsorbing several proton pulses, therefore the
probability of temperature induced homogeneous bubble nucleation is negligible.
