We present an extensive study on generalized parton distributions of pions.
In particular, we present the results for the pion-photon transition
distribution amplitudes in the Nambu - Jona-Lasinio model. We discuss the
phenomenology of such objects and give explicit estimates for cross sections.
The spin structure of the proton is also studied: we discuss the results for
the T-odd transverse momentum distributions in quark models.
