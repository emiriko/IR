We obtained laboratory spectra of absorption by water vapor at the
wavelengths 6500-10500 {\AA} with the multipass cell. The water vapor content
along the line of view varied from 0.1 to 3.0 cm of precipitated water, the
pressure from 0.1 to 1.0 atm. The spectra were taken with the width of the exit
slit of the spectrophotometer 25, 50, 100, and 150 {\AA}. To match these
spectra, we selected empirical functions, which approximate the observed
absorption within the indicated interval of water vapor content and pressure
with the accuracy about 1%. For the water vapor band at the wavelengths regions
7200, 8200, and 9300 {\AA}, with the step 25 {\AA}, we determined the
parameters necessary for the calculation of empirical transmission functions.
The presented data make it possible to select the parameters for taking into
account the radiation attenuation in the spectral region of telluric water
vapor under the conditions of real astronomical observations for a specific
place and spectrophotometer. The suggested set of empirical parameters may
provide correction of observed stellar spectra for the extinction in the
atmosphere with the accuracy 0.m01-0.m02.
