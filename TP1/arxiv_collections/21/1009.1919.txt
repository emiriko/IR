SuWt2 is a planetary nebula (PN) consisting of a bright ionized thin ring
seen nearly edge-on. It has a bright (V=12) central star, too cool to ionize
the PN, which we discovered to be an eclipsing binary. A spectrum from IUE did
not reveal a UV source. We present extensive ground-based photometry and
spectroscopy of the central binary collected over the ensuing two decades,
resulting in the determination that the orbital period of the eclipsing pair is
4.9 d, and consists of two nearly identical A1 V stars, each of mass ~2.7
M_sun. The physical parameters of the A stars, combined with evolutionary
tracks, show that both are in the short-lived "blue-hook" evolutionary phase
that occurs between the main sequence and the Hertzsprung gap, and that the age
of the system is about 520 Myr. One puzzle is that the stars' rotational
velocities are different from each other, and considerably slower than
synchronous with the orbital period. It is possible that the center-of-mass
velocity of the eclipsing pair is varying with time, suggesting that there is
an unseen third orbiting body in the system. We propose a scenario in which the
system began as a hierarchical triple, consisting of a ~2.9 M_sun star orbiting
the close pair of A stars. Upon reaching the AGB stage, the primary engulfed
the pair into a common envelope, leading to a rapid contraction of the orbit
and catastrophic ejection of the envelope into the orbital plane. In this
picture, the exposed core of the initial primary is now a white dwarf of ~0.7
M_sun, orbiting the eclipsing pair, which has already cooled below the
detectability possible by IUE at our derived distance of 2.3 kpc and a
reddening of E(B-V)=0.40. The SuWt2 system may be destined to perish as a Type
Ia supernova. (Abridged)
