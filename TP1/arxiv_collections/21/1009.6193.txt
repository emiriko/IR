In this paper we present a possible origin of dark matter and dark energy
from a solution of the Einstein's equation to a primordial universe, which was
presented in a previous paper. We also analyze the Dirac's equation in this
primordial universe and present the possible origin of the
particle-antiparticle asymmetry. We also present ghost primordial particles as
candidates to some quantum vacuum contituents.
