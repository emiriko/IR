The binding energy of an Efimov trimer state was precisely determined via
radio-frequency association. It is found that the measurement results
significantly shift with temperature, but that the shift can be made negligible
at the lowest temperature in our experiment. The obtained trimer binding energy
reveals a significant deviation from the nonuniversal theory prediction based
on a three-body parameter with a monotonic energy dependence.
