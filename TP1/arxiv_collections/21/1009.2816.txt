We present a detailed study and results of new Australia Telescope Compact
Array (ATCA) observations of supernova remnant, SNR J0527-6549. This Large
Magellanic Cloud (LMC) ob ject follows a typical supernova remnant (SNR)
horseshoe morphology with a diameter of D=(66x58)+-1 pc which is among the
largest SNRs in the LMC. Its relatively large size indicates older age while a
steeper than expected radio spectral index of aplha=-0.92+-0.11 is more typical
for younger and energetic SNRs. Also, we report detections of regions with a
high order of polarization at a peak value of ~54+-17% at 6 cm.
