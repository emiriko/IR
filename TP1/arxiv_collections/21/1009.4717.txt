Solar-neutrino oscillations are considered using a massive model with
perturbative Lorentz violation. The adiabatic approximation is used to
calculate the effects of Lorentz violation to leading order. The results are
more compact than previous work involving vacuum oscillations, and are accurate
for small Lorentz-violating coefficients.
