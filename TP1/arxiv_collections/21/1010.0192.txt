Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are large-scale ejections of plasma and
magnetic field from the solar corona, which propagate through interplanetary
space at velocities of $\sim$100--2500~km~s$^{-1}$. Although plane-of-sky
coronagraph measurements have provided some insight into their kinematics near
the Sun ($<$32~R$_\odot$), it is still unclear what forces govern their
evolution during both their early acceleration and later propagation. Here, we
use the dual perspectives of the Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory
(STEREO) spacecrafts to derive the three-dimensional kinematics of CMEs over a
range of heliocentric distances ($\sim$2--250\,R$_{\odot}$). We find evidence
for solar wind (SW) drag-forces acting in interplanetary space, with a fast CME
decelerated and a slow CME accelerated towards typical SW velocities. We also
find that the fast CME showed linear ($\delta=1$) dependence on the velocity
difference between the CME and the SW, while the slow CME showed a quadratic
($\delta=2$) dependence. The differing forms of drag for the two CMEs indicate
the forces and thus mechanism responsible for there acceleration may be
different.
