The strong Coulomb correlations effects in the electronic structure of
magnetic Co adatom on the Pt(111) surface have been investigated. Using a
realistic five d-orbital impurity Anderson model at low temperatures with
parameters determined from first-principles calculations we found a striking
change of the electronic structure in comparison with the LDA results. The
spectral function calculated with full rotationally invariant Coulomb
interaction is in good agreement with the quasiparticle region of the STM
conductance spectrum. Using the calculated spin-spin correlation functions we
have analyzed the formation of the magnetic moments of the Co impurity
orbitals.
