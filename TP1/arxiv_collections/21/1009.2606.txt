Spatial entropy redistribution plays a key role in adiabatic cooling of
ultra-cold lattice gases. We show that high-spin fermions with a spatially
variable quadratic Zeeman coupling may allow for the creation of an inner
spin-1/2 core surrounded by high-spin wings. The latter are always more
entropic than the core at high temperatures and, remarkably, at all
temperatures in the presence of frustration. Combining thermodynamic Bethe
Ansatz with local density approximation, we study the spatial entropy
distribution for the particular case of one-dimensional spin-3/2 lattice
fermions in the Mott phase. Interestingly, this spatially dependent entropy
opens a possible path for an adiabatic cooling technique that, in contrast to
previous proposals, would specifically target the spin degree of freedom. We
discuss a possible realization of this adiabatic cooling, which may allow for a
highly efficient entropy decrease in the spin-1/2 core and help access
antiferromagnetic order in experiments on ultracold spinor fermions.
