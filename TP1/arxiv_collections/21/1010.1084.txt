We have theoretically investigated the spin and charge fluctuations in the
quasi-one dimensional organic superconductor (TMTSF)2ClO4. Using the extended
multi-site Hubbard model, which contains four sites in a unit cell and the
transfer energies obtained by the extended H\"uckel method, we calculate the
linearized gap equation with the random phase approximation, to find novel
order parameters of superconductivity due to several kinds of charge
fluctuations induced by the anisotropic intersite repulsive interactions. For
the singlet state, the order parameter with line nodes appears in the case of
the strong charge fluctuation, while the order parameter with anisotropic gap
suggested by Shimahara is reproduced in the spin fluctuation. The triplet state
is also obtained for the wide parameter range of repulsive interactions due to
a cooperation between charge and spin fluctuations.
