Much of atmospheric and oceanic transport is associated with coherent
structures. Lagrangian methods are emerging as optimal tools for their
identification and analysis. An important Lagrangian technique which is
starting to be widely used in oceanography is that of Finite-Size Lyapunov
Exponents (FSLEs). Despite this growing relevance there are still many open
questions concerning the reliability of the FSLEs in order to analyse the ocean
dynamics. In particular, it is still unclear how robust they are when
confronted with real data. In this paper we analyze the effect on this
Lagrangian technique of the two most important effects when facing real data,
namely noise and dynamics of unsolved scales. Our results, using as a
benchmarch data from a primitive numerical model of the Mediterranean Sea, show
that even when some dynamics is missed the FSLEs results still give an accurate
picture of the oceanic transport properties.
