In this article, we investigate Bertrand curves corresponding to the
spherical images of the tangent, binormal, principal normal and Darboux
indicatrices of a space curve in Euclidean 3-space. As a result, in case of a
space curve is a general helix, we show that the curves corresponding to the
spherical images of its the tangent indicatrix and binormal indicatrix are both
Bertrand curves and circular helices. Similarly, in case of a space curve is a
slant helix, we demonstrate that the curve corresponding to the spherical image
of its the principal normal indicatrix is both a Bertrand curve and a circular
helix.
