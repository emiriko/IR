Hot-Jupiter planets must form at large separations from their host stars
where the temperatures are cool enough for their cores to condense. They then
migrate inwards to their current observed orbital separations. Different
theories of how this migration occurs lead to varying distributions of orbital
eccentricity and the alignment between the rotation axis of the star and the
orbital axis of the planet. The spin-orbit alignment of a transiting system is
revealed via the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect, which is the anomaly present in
the radial velocity measurements of the rotating star during transit due to the
planet blocking some of the starlight. In this paper we aim to measure the
spin-orbit alignment of the WASP-3 system via a new way of analysing the
Rossiter-McLaughlin observations. We apply a new tomographic method for
analysing the time variable asymmetry of stellar line profiles caused by the
Rossiter-McLaughlin effect. This new method eliminates the systematic error
inherent in previous methods used to analyse the effect. We find a value for
the projected stellar spin rate of v sin i = 13.9 \pm 0.03 km/s which is in
agreement with previous measurements but has a much higher precision. The
system is found to be well aligned which favours an evolutionary history for
WASP-3b involving migration through tidal interactions with a protoplanetary
disc. Using gyrochronology we estimate the age of the star to be ~300 Myr with
an upper limit of 2 Gyr from comparison with isochrones.
