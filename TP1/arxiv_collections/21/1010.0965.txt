To describe the physical reality, there are two ways of constructing the
dynamical equation of field, differential formalism and integral formalism. The
importance of this fact is firstly emphasized by Yang in case of gauge field
[Phys. Rev. Lett. 33 (1974) 445], where the fact has given rise to a deeper
understanding for Aharonov-Bohm phase and magnetic monopole [Phys. Rev. D. 12
(1975) 3845]. In this paper we shall point out that such a fact also holds in
general wave function of matter, it may give rise to a deeper understanding for
Berry phase. Most importantly, we shall prove a point that, for general wave
function of matter, in the adiabatic limit, there is an intrinsic difference
between its integral formalism and differential formalism. It is neglect of
this difference that leads to an inconsistency of quantum adiabatic theorem
pointed out by Marzlin and Sanders [Phys. Rev. Lett. 93 (2004) 160408]. It has
been widely accepted that there is no physical difference of using differential
operator or integral operator to construct the dynamical equation of field.
Nevertheless, our study shows that the Schrodinger differential equation (i.e.,
differential formalism for wave function) shall lead to vanishing Berry phase
and that the Schrodinger integral equation (i.e., integral formalism for wave
function), in the adiabatic limit, can satisfactorily give the Berry phase.
Therefore, we reach a conclusion: There are two ways of describing physical
reality, differential formalism and integral formalism; but the integral
formalism is a unique way of complete description.
