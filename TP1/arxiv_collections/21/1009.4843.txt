Beginning with several basic hypotheses of quantum mechanics, we give a new
quantum model in econophysics. In this model, we define wave functions and
operators of the stock market to establish the Schr\"odinger equation for the
stock price. Based on this theoretical framework, an example of a driven
infinite quantum well is considered, in which we use a cosine distribution to
simulate the state of stock price in equilibrium. After adding an external
field into the Hamiltonian to analytically calculate the wave function, the
distribution and the average value of the rate of return are shown.
