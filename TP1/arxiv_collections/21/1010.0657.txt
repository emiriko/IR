Measurements of the magnetic susceptibility of Fe/W(110) films with thickness
in the range of 1.6 to 2.4 ML Fe, show that in addition to the large response
along the easy axis associated with the Curie transition, there is a much
smaller, paramagnetic hard axis response that is not consistent with the 2D
anisotropic Heisenberg model used to describe homogeneous in-plane ferromagnets
with uniaxial anisotropy. The shape, amplitude, and peak temperature of the
hard axis susceptibility, as well as its dependence upon layer completion close
to 2.0 ML, indicate that inhomogeneities in the films create a system of mixed
anisotropy. A likely candidate for inhomogeneities that are magnetically
relevant in the critical region are the closed lines of step edges associated
with the incomplete layers. According to the Harris criterion, the existence of
magnetically relevant inhomogeneities may alter the critical properties of the
films from those of a 2D Ising model. Experiments in the recent literature are
discussed in this context.
