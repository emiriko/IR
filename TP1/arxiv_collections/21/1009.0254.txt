We introduce thermal fluctuations in the lattice Boltzmann method for
non-ideal fluids. A fluctuation-dissipation theorem is derived within the
Langevin framework and applied to a specific lattice Boltzmann model that
approximates the linearized fluctuating Navier-Stokes equations for fluids
based on square-gradient free energy functionals. The obtained thermal noise is
shown to ensure equilibration of all degrees of freedom in a simulation to high
accuracy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that satisfactory results for most
practical applications of fluctuating hydrodynamics can already be achieved
using thermal noise derived in the long wavelength-limit.
