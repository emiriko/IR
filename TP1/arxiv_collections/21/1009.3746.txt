Pressure-induced superconductivity and its relation to corresponding Hall
coefficient (RH) have been reported for Bi2Te3, one of known topological
insulators. A full phase diagram is presented which shows a complex dependence
of the superconducting transition temperature as a function of pressure over an
extensive range. High-pressure RH measurements reveal a close relation of these
complex behaviors, particularly, a dramatic change of dRH/dP before structural
phase transition and a pressure-induced crossover on RH in the high pressure
phase were observed.
