Keck/LRIS multi-object spectroscopy has been carried out on 140 of some of
the lowest and highest surface brightness faint (19 < R < 22) dwarf galaxy
candidates in the core region of the Coma Cluster. These spectra are used to
measure redshifts and establish membership for these faint dwarf populations.
The primary goal of the low surface brightness sample is to test our ability to
use morphological and surface brightness criteria to distinguish between Coma
Cluster members and background galaxies using high resolution HST/ACS images.
Candidates were rated as expected members, uncertain, or expected background.
From 93 spectra, 51 dwarf galaxy members and 20 background galaxies are
identified. Our morphological membership estimation success rate is ~100% for
objects expected to be members and better than ~90% for galaxies expected to be
in the background. We confirm that low surface brightness is a very good
indicator of cluster membership. High surface brightness galaxies are almost
always background with confusion arising only from the cases of the rare
compact elliptical galaxies. The more problematic cases occur at intermediate
surface brightness. Many of these galaxies are given uncertain membership
ratings, and these were found to be members about half of the time. Including
color information will improve membership determination but will fail for some
of the same objects that are already mis-identified when using only surface
brightness and morphology criteria. Compact elliptical galaxies with B-V colors
~0.2 magnitudes redward of the red sequence in particular require spectroscopic
follow-up. In a sample of 47 high surface brightness, UCD candidates, 19
objects have redshifts which place them in the Coma Cluster. Redshift
measurements are presented and the use of indirect means for establishing
cluster membership is discussed.
