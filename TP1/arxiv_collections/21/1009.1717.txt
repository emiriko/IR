In their comment[1] on our Letter [arXiv:0907.0767], Leggett and Garg claim
that they have introduced in their original paper (LG1) a dependence on
measurement times. They also claim that Eqs.(HMDR1) and (LG2a) can therefore
not be linked in such a way that the arguments of [arXiv:0907.0767] can be
transcribed. However, (LG1) distinguishes only three time differences, and all
experimental results corresponding to the same time differences are identically
labeled and therefore treated as mathematically identical. We therefore cannot
agree with the argumentation of Leggett and Garg: except for a change of
nomenclature Eqs.(HMDR1) and (LG2a) are the same. A more extensive discussion
of this point can be found in [arXiv:0901.2546].
