Discovered over 30 years ago, the B[e] phenomenon has not yet revealed all
its puzzles. New objects that exhibit it are being discovered in the Milky Way,
and properties of known objects are being constrained. We review recent
findings about objects of this class and their subgroups as well as discuss new
results from studies of the objects with yet unknown nature. In the Magellanic
Clouds, the population of such objects has been restricted to supergiants. We
present new candidates with apparently lower luminosities found in the LMC.
