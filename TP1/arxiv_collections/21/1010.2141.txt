Building on existing stochastic actor-oriented models for panel data, we
employ a conditional logistic framework to explore growth mechanisms for tie
creation in continuously-observed networks. This framework models the
likelihood of tie formation distinguishing it from hazard models that consider
time to tie formation. It enables multiple growth mechanisms for network
evolution (homophily, focus constraints, reinforcement, reciprocity, triadic
closure, and popularity) to be modeled simultaneously. We apply this framework
to communication within a Facebook-like community. The findings exemplify the
inadequacy of descriptive measures that test single mechanisms independently.
They also indicate how system design shapes behavior and network evolution.
