Consider an m by N matrix Phi with the Restricted Isometry Property of order
k and level delta, that is, the norm of any k-sparse vector in R^N is preserved
to within a multiplicative factor of 1 +- delta under application of Phi. We
show that by randomizing the column signs of such a matrix Phi, the resulting
map with high probability embeds any fixed set of p = O(e^k) points in R^N into
R^m without distorting the norm of any point in the set by more than a factor
of 1 +- delta. Consequently, matrices with the Restricted Isometry Property and
with randomized column signs provide optimal Johnson-Lindenstrauss embeddings
up to logarithmic factors in N. In particular, our results improve the best
known bounds on the necessary embedding dimension m for a wide class of
structured random matrices; for partial Fourier and partial Hadamard matrices,
we improve the recent bound m = O(delta^(-4) log(p) log^4(N)) appearing in
Ailon and Liberty to m = O(delta^(-2) log(p) log^4(N)), which is optimal up to
the logarithmic factors in N. Our results also have a direct application in the
area of compressed sensing for redundant dictionaries.
