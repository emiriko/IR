We present the setup and test of a transportable clock laser at 698 nm for a
strontium lattice clock. A master-slave diode laser system is stabilized to a
rigidly mounted optical reference cavity. The setup was transported by truck
over 400 km from Braunschweig to D\"usseldorf, where the cavity-stabilized
laser was compared to a stationary clock laser for the interrogation of
ytterbium (578 nm). Only minor realignments were necessary after the transport.
The lasers were compared by a Ti:Sapphire frequency comb used as a transfer
oscillator. The thus generated virtual beat showed a combined linewidth below 1
Hz (at 1156 nm). The transport back to Braunschweig did not degrade the laser
performance, as was shown by interrogating the strontium clock transition.
