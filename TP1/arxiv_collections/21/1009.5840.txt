We consider flux penetration to a 2D superconducting cylinder. We show that
in the low field limit the kinetics is deterministic. In the strong field limit
the dynamics becomes stochastic. Surprisingly the inhomogeneity in the cylinder
reduces the level of stochasticity because of the predominance of
Kelvin-Helmholtz vortices.
