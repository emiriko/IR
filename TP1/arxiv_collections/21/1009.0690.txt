The authors measure the persistence and contour lengths of DNA-psoralen
complexes, as a function of psoralen concentration, for intercalated and
crosslinked complexes. In both cases, the persistence length monotonically
increases until a certain critical concentration is reached, above which it
abruptly decreases and remains approximately constant. The contour length of
the complexes exhibits no such discontinuous behavior. By fitting the relative
increase of the contour length to the neighbor exclusion model, we obtain the
exclusion number and the intrinsic intercalating constant of the psoralen-DNA
interaction. Ab initio calculations are employed in order to provide an
atomistic picture of these experimental findings.
