We study how joint shear and magnification measurements improve the
statistical precision of weak lensing mass calibration experiments, relative to
standard shear-only analysis. For our magnification measurements, we consider
not only the impact of lensing on the source density of galaxies, but also the
apparent increase in source sizes. The combination of all three lensing probes
- density, size, and shear - can improve the statistical precision of mass
estimates by as much as 40% - 50%. This number is insensitive to survey
assumptions, though it depends on the degree of knowledge of the parameters
controlling the magnification measurements, and on the value of the parameter q
that characterizes the response of the source population to magnification.
Furthermore, the combination of magnification and shear allows for powerful
cross-checks on residual systematics (such as point spread function
corrections) at the few percent level.
