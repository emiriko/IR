We propose a novel finite size scaling analysis for percolation transition
observed in complex networks. While it is known that cooperative systems in
growing networks often undergo an infinite order transition with inverted
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless singularity, it is very hard for numerical
simulations to determine the transition point precisely. Since the neighbor of
the ordered phase is not a simple disordered phase but a critical phase,
conventional finite size scaling technique does not work. In our finite size
scaling, the forms of the scaling functions for the order parameter and the
fractal exponent determine the transition point and critical exponents
numerically for an infinite order transition as well as a standard second order
transition. We confirm the validity of our scaling hypothesis through
Monte-Carlo simulations for bond percolations in some network models: the
decorated (2,2)-flower and the random attachment growing network, where an
infinite order transition occurs, and the configuration model, where a second
order transition occurs.
