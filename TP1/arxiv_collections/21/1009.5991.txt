The discovery of 9 new brown-dwarf candidates orbiting stars in the CORALIE
and HARPS radial-velocity surveys is reported. New CORALIE radial velocities
yielding accurate orbits of 6 previously-known hosts of potential brown-dwarf
companions are presented. Including targets selected from the literature, 33
hosts of potential brown-dwarf companions are examined. Employing innovative
methods, we use the new reduction of the Hipparcos data to fully characterise
the astrometric orbits of 6 objects, revealing M-dwarf companions with masses
between 90 M_Jup and 0.52 M_Sun. Additionally, the masses of two companions can
be restricted to the stellar domain. The companion to HD 137510 is found to be
a brown dwarf. At 95 % confidence, the companion of HD 190228 is also a brown
dwarf. The remaining 23 companions persist as brown-dwarf candidates. Based on
the CORALIE planet-search sample, we obtain an upper limit of 0.6 % for the
frequency of brown-dwarf companions around Sun-like stars. We find that the
companion-mass distribution function is rising at the lower end of the
brown-dwarf mass range, suggesting that in fact we are detecting the high-mass
tail of the planetary distribution.
