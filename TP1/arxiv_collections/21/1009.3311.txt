Motivated by recent experiments of a novel 5$d$ Mott insulator in
Sr$_2$IrO$_4$, we have studied the two-dimensional three-orbital Hubbard model
with a spin-orbit coupling $\lambda$. The variational Monte Carlo method is
used to obtain the ground state phase diagram with varying a on-site Coulomb
interaction $U$ as well as $\lambda$. It is found that the transition from a
paramagnetic metal to an antiferromagnetic (AF) insulator occurs at a finite
$U=U_{\mathrm{MI}}$, which is greatly reduced by a large $\lambda$,
characteristic of 5$d$ electrons, and leads to the "spin-orbit-induced" Mott
insulator. It is also found that the Hund's coupling induces the anisotropic
spin exchange and stabilizes the in-plane AF order. We have further studied the
one-particle excitations using the variational cluster approximation, and
revealed the internal electronic structure of this novel Mott insulator. These
findings are in agreement with experimental observations on Sr$_2$IrO$_4$, and
qualitatively different from those of extensively studied 3$d$ Mott insulators.
