We investigate the spin-dependent dynamical response of a semiconductor
quantum ring with a spin orbit interaction (SOI) upon the application of a
single and two linearly polarized, picosecond, asymmetric electromagnetic
pulses in the presence of a static magnetic flux. We find that the
pulse-generated electric dipole moment is spin dependent. It is also shown that
the SOI induces an extra SU(2) effective flux in addition to the static
external magnetic flux which is reflected in an additional periodicity of the
spin-dependent dipole moment. Furthermore, the pulses may induce a net
dynamical charge currents (CC) and dynamical spin currents (SC) when the
clockwise and anti-clockwise symmetry of the carrier is broken upon the pulse
application.
