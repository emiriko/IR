A description of time-dependent Mechanics in terms of Lagrangian submanifolds
of Dirac manifolds (in particular, presymplectic and Poisson manifolds) is
presented. Two new Tulczyjew triples are discussed. The first one is adapted to
the restricted Hamiltonian formalism and the second one is adapted to the
extended Hamiltonian formalism.
