The modification of the properties of nucleon in nuclear medium have been
investigated in the context of flux tube model. A nucleon has been described as
diquark-quark system connected by flux tube and quasi particle diquark model
has been used to describe the diquak constituting the nucleon. The modification
of incompressiblity, the roper resonance etc in the nuclear medium have been
investigated. The results are compared with recent experimental and theoretical
predictions.
