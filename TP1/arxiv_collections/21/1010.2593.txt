Switching of magnetic vortex cores involves a topological transition
characterized by the presence of a magnetization singularity, a point where the
magnetization vanishes (Bloch point). We analytically derive the shape of the
Bloch point that is an extremum of the free energy with exchange, dipole and
the Landau terms for the determination of the local value of the magnetization
modulus.
