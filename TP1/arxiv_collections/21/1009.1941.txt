The screening of impurities in plasma with Bose-Einstein condensate of
electrically charged bosons is considered. It is shown that the screened
potential is drastically different from the usual Debye one. The polarization
operator of photons in plasma acquires infrared singular terms at small photon
momentum and the screened potential drops down as a power of distance and even
has an oscillating behavior, similar to the Friedel oscillations in plasma with
degenerate fermions. The magnetic properties of the cosmological plasma with
condensed W-bosons are also discussed. It is shown that W-bosons condense in
the ferromagnetic state. It could lead to spontaneous magnetization of the
primeval plasma. The created magnetic fields may seed galactic and
intergalactic magnetic fields observed in the present-day universe.
