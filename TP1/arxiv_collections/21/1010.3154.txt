Context. Asteroseismology is an effcient tool not only for testing stellar
structure and evolutionary theory but also constraining the parameters of stars
for which solar-like oscillations are detected, presently. As an important
southern asteroseismic target, Tau Ceti, is a metal-poor star. The main
features of the oscillations and some frequencies of ? Ceti have been
identified. Many scientists propose to comprehensively observe this star as
part of the Stellar Observations Network Group. Aims. Our goal is to obtain the
optimal model and reliable fundamental parameters for the metal-poor star Tau
Ceti by combining all non-asteroseismic observations with these seismological
data. Methods. Using the Yale stellar evolution code (YREC), a grid of stellar
model candidates that fall within all the error boxes in the HR diagram have
been constructed, and both the model frequencies and large- and small-
frequency separations are calculated using the Guenther's stellar pulsation
code. The \chi2c minimization is performed to identify the optimal modelling
parameters that reproduce the observations within their errors. The frequency
corrections of near-surface effects to the calculated frequencies using the
empirical law, as proposed by Kjeldsen and coworkers, are applied to the
models. Results. We derive optimal models, corresponding to masses of about
0.775 - 0.785 M? and ages of about 8 - 10 Gyr. Furthermore, we find that the
quantities derived from the non-asteroseismic observations (effective
temperature and luminosity) acquired spectroscopically are more accurate than
those inferred from interferometry for ? Ceti, because our optimal models are
in the error boxes B and C, which are derived from spectroscopy results.
