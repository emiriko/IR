With increasing complexity of modern-day mobile devices, security of these
devices in presence of myriad attacks by an intelligent adversary is becoming a
major issue. The vast majority of cell phones still remain unsecured from many
existing and emerging security threats. To address the security threats in
mobile devices we are exploring a technology, which we refer as "Collaborative
Trust". It is a technology that uses a system of devices cooperating with each
other (working in a fixed or ad-hoc network) to achieve the individual security
of each device. The idea is that each device is insecure by itself, since in
many cases it is incapable of checking its safety by itself (e.g. when it is
compromised it may lose its ability to monitor its own trustworthiness), but
together, they can ensure each other's security in a collaborative manner.
