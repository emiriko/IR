In this correspondence, we point out two typographical errors in Chai and
Tjhung's paper and we offer the correct formula of the unified Laguerre
polynomial-series-based cumulative distribution function (cdf) for small-scale
fading distributions. A Laguerre polynomial-series-based cdf formula for
non-central chi-square distribution is also provided as a special case of our
unified cdf result.
