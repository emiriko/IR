Future galactic supernovae will provide an extremely long baseline for
studying the properties and interactions of neutrinos. In this paper, we
discuss the possibility of using such an event to constrain (or discover) the
effects of exotic physics in scenarios that are not currently constrained and
are not accessible with reactor or solar neutrino experiments. In particular,
we focus on the cases of neutrino decay and quantum decoherence. We calculate
the expected signal from a core-collapse supernova in both current and future
water Cerenkov, scintillating, and liquid argon detectors, and find that such
observations will be capable of distinguishing between many of these scenarios.
Additionally, future detectors will be capable of making strong,
model-independent conclusions by examining events associated with a galactic
supernova's neutronization burst.
