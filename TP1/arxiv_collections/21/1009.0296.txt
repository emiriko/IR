We argue that our analysis of the J-Q model, presented in Phys. Rev. B 80,
174403 (2009), and based on a field-theory description of coupled dimers,
captures properly the strong quantum fluctuations tendencies, and the
objections outlined by L. Isaev, G. Ortiz, and J. Dukelsky, arXiv:1003.5205,
are misplaced.
