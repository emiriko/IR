We consider a stochastic volatility model with L\'evy jumps for a log-return
process $Z=(Z_{t})_{t\geq 0}$ of the form $Z=U+X$, where $U=(U_{t})_{t\geq 0}$
is a classical stochastic volatility process and $X=(X_{t})_{t\geq 0}$ is an
independent L\'evy process with absolutely continuous L\'evy measure $\nu$.
Small-time expansions, of arbitrary polynomial order, in time-$t$, are obtained
for the tails $\bbp(Z_{t}\geq z)$, $z>0$, and for the call-option prices
$\bbe(e^{z+Z_{t}}-1)_{+}$, $z\neq 0$, assuming smoothness conditions on the
{\PaleGrey density of $\nu$} away from the origin and a small-time large
deviation principle on $U$. Our approach allows for a unified treatment of
general payoff functions of the form $\phi(x){\bf 1}_{x\geq{}z}$ for smooth
functions $\phi$ and $z>0$. As a consequence of our tail expansions, the
polynomial expansions in $t$ of the transition densities $f_{t}$ are also
{\Green obtained} under mild conditions.
