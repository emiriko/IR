We have calculated a discrete spectrum and found an exact analytical solution
in the form of Meixner polynomials for the wave function of a thin gravitating
shell in the Reissner-Nordstrom geometry. We show that there is no extreme
state in the quantum spectrum of the gravitating shell, as in the case of
extreme black hole.
