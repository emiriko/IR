The AKARI Deep Field South (ADF-S) is a ~12 sq. deg. region near the South
Ecliptic Pole that has been observed with deep scans in the far-infrared by the
AKARI satellite. As such it is becoming one of the key extragalactic survey
fields. We here present complementary observations of the ADF-S conducted by
the Spitzer Space Telescope at wavelengths of 24 and 70 micron. We extract
source catalogs at each of these wavelengths reaching depths of ~ 0.2mJy at 24
micron and ~ 20mJy at 70 micron. We also apply an K-to-24 micron colour
criterion to select objects with galaxy-like colours in the 24 micron survey.
Completeness corrections as a function of flux density are derived for both
catalogs by injecting artificial sources of known flux density into the maps,
and we find that our surbveys are 50% complete at 0.26mJy and 24mJy at 24 and
70 micron respectively. We can thus produce number counts as a function of flux
density for the ADF-S at 24 and 70 micron. These are combined with existing
literature counts and compared to four different number count models derived
from galaxy evolution models. One complicating factor for the ADF-S counts is
the presence of a foreground galaxy cluster at z=0.04 in the field. We examine
the ranges of flux densities to which this cluster might make a contribution to
the counts and find hints that the 24 micron luminosity function of the cluster
galaxies might be enhanced above that of field galaxies. Full catalogs for
these ADF-S Spitzer surveys at 24 and 70 micron are made available as part of
this paper.
