A new implementation of the POWHEG method into the Monte-Carlo event
generator Sherpa is presented, focusing on processes with a simple colour
structure. Results for a variety of processes, namely e+e- to hadrons,
deep-inelastic lepton-nucleon scattering, hadroproduction of single vector
bosons and of vector boson pairs as well as the production of Higgs bosons in
gluon fusion serve as test cases for the successful realisation. The algorithm
is fully automated such that for further processes only virtual matrix elements
need to be included.
