We present numerical results for the solution of the 1D critical nonlinear
Schrodinger with periodic boundary conditions and initial data that give rise
to a finite time singularity. We construct, through the Mori-Zwanzig formalism,
a reduced model which allows us to follow the solution after the formation of
the singularity. The computed post-singularity solution exhibits the same
characteristics as the post-singularity solutions constructed recently by
Terence Tao.
