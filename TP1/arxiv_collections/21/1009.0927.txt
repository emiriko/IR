We undertook investigations in polycrystalline R(x)R'(1-x)Al(2) alloys, in
particular, explored the stoichiometries, Nd(0.8)Gd(0.2)Al(2) and
Nd(0.8)Tb(0.2)Al(2), to study the magnetic compensation behavior in them in the
context of contemporary interest. In these admixed rare-earth (RE)
intermetallics, the compensation phenomenon is characterized by a crossover of
the M = 0 axis in the low field thermomagnetic response, and a turnaround
behavior due to the field-induced reversal in the orientations of the RE
moments at high fields. While the characteristic attributes are present in
Nd(0.8)Gd(0.2)Al(2), a repeated/multiple magnetic compensation behavior stands
observed in Nd(0.8)Tb(0.2)Al(2). The ac susceptibility, the heat capacity and
the transport measurements in the latter compound reveal the onset of two
quasi-antiferromagnetic transitions one after the other on cooling down from
the high temperature end. The two magnetic transitions involving competition
between the contributions from nearly balanced weighted averages of moments of
Nd{3+} and Tb{3+} ions generate the curious multiple crossings of the M = 0
axis. The results are compared and contrasted with repeated compensation
behavior reported earlier in admixed Nd(0.8)Gd(0.2)Rh(3)B(2) alloy.
