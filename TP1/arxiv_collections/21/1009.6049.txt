Searching for the Higgs boson is of first priority in LHC experiments. Once a
Higgs candidate is found, we then need to know whether it is the standard model
(SM) Higgs boson or a Higgs boson in new physics beyond the SM. So far we do
not know what model of new physics will actually reflect the property of the
nature. A model-independent way of measuring the anomalous couplings of the
Higgs boson will provide a no-lose study, i.e., if we find nonvanishing
anomalous couplings (deviation from the SM couplings), we can conclude that it
is a new physics effect. In a previous paper \cite{QKLZ09}, we gave a hadron
level study of a model-independent test of the anomalous gauge couplings of the
Higgs boson at the 14 TeV LHC via the semileptonic mode of weak-boson
scatterings $pp\to W^+W^\pm j^f_1 j^f_2\to l^+\nu^{}_lj^{}_1j^{}_2j^f_1j^f_2$,
and the conclusion is that, with certain kinematical cuts imposed, the
measurement can start for an integrated luminosity of 50 fb$^{-1}$. For higher
integrated luminosity, say 100 fb$^{-1}$, the two main anomalous coupling
constants $f^{}_{WW}/\Lambda^2$ and $f^{}_W/\Lambda^2$ can be determined
separately which may provide a clue for figuring out the underlying theory of
new physics.
