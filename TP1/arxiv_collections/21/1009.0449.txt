Serendipitously we have discovered a rare, bright submillimeter galaxy (SMG)
with a flux density of 30 +/- 2 mJy at lambda=1.2mm, using MAMBO2 at the IRAM
30-meter millimeter telescope. Although no optical counterpart is known for
MM18423+5938, we were able to measure the redshift z=3.92960 +/- 0.00013 from
the detection of CO lines using the IRAM Eight MIxer Receiver (EMIR). In
addition, by collecting all available photometric data in the far-infrared and
radio to constrain its spectral energy distribution, we derive the FIR
luminosity 4.8 10^14/m Lsol and mass 6.0 10^9/m Msol for its dust, allowing for
a magnification factor m caused by a probable gravitational lens. The
corresponding star-formation rate is 8.3 10^4/m Msol/yr. The detection of three
lines of the CO rotational ladder, and a significant upper limit for a fourth
CO line, allow us to estimate an H2 mass of between 1.9 10^11/m Msol and 1.1
10^12/m Msol. The two lines CI(3p1-3p0) and CI(3p2-3p1) were clearly detected
and yield a [CI]/[H2] number abundance between 1.4 10^-5 and 8.0 10^-5. Upper
limits are presented for emission lines of HCN, HCO^+, HNC, H_2O and other
molecules observed. The moderate excitation of the CO lines is indicative of an
extended starburst, and excludes the dominance of an AGN in heating this
high-redshift SMG.
