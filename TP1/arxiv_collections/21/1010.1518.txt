We study the dynamical instability of a spherically symmetric anisotropic
fluid which collapses adiabatically under the condition of vanishing expansion
scalar. The Newtonian and post Newtonian regimes are considered in detail. It
is shown that within those two approximations the adiabatic index $\Gamma_1$,
measuring the fluid stiffness, does not play any role. Instead, the range of
instability is determined by the anisotropy of the fluid pressures and the
radial profile of the energy density, independently of its stiffness, in a way
which is fully consistent with results previously obtained from the study on
the Tolman mass.
