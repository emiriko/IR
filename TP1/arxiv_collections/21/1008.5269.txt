We report the synthesis of arbitrary optical waveforms by manipulating the
spectral phases of Raman sidebands with a wide frequency spacing line-by-line.
Trains of rectangular and triangular pulses are stably produced at an ultrahigh
repetition rate of 10.6229 THz, reminiscent of an ultrafast function generator.
