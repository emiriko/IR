We consider a mixture of hard core bosonic polar molecules, interacting via
repulsive dipole-dipole interaction, and one atomic bosonic species. The
mixture is confined on a two-dimensional square lattice and, at low enough
temperatures, can be described by the two-component Bose-Hubbard model. The
latter displays a extremely rich phase diagram including solid, superfluid,
supersolid phases. Here we mainly focus on the checkerboard molecular solid,
stabilized by the long range dipolar interaction, and study how the presence of
atoms affects its robustness both at zero and finite temperature. We find that,
due to atom-molecule interaction, solid phases can be stabilized at both,
(much) lower strengths of dipolar interaction and higher temperatures, than
when no atoms are present. As a byproduct, atoms also order in a solid phase
with same melting temperatures as for molecules. Finally, we find that for
large enough interaction between atoms and molecules a paired supersolid phase
can be stabilized.
