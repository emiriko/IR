In a previous paper we considered the most general field equations for a
system of two fermions of which one single-handed, showing that the
spin-torsion interactions among these spinors had the same structure of the
electroweak forces among leptons; in this paper we consider the most general
field equations for a system of two fermions, showing that the spin-torsion
interactions among these spinors have a structure similar to that of the
electroweak forces among hadrons: possible differences are discussed, and
consequently further extensions are speculated.
