The spectra emitted from clouds near the Galactic Centre are investigated
calculating the UV-optical-IR lines using the physical parameters and the
element abundances constrained by the fit of mid-IR observations. The
characteristic line ratios are compared with those observed in active galaxies.
We have found that the physical conditions in the nebulae near the GC are
different from those of starburst galaxies and AGN, namely, gas velocities and
densities as well as the photoionization fluxes are relatively low. The
geometrical thickness of the emitting nebulae is particularly small suggesting
that matter is strongly fragmented by instabilities leading to an underlying
shock-generated turbulence.
