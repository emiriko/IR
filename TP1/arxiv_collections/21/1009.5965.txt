We study the influence of various magnetic diffusivity profiles on the
evolution of the poloidal and toroidal magnetic fields in a kinematic flux
transport dynamo model for the Sun. The diffusivity is a poorly understood
ingredient in solar dynamo models. We mathematically construct various
theoretical profiles of the depth-dependent diffusivity, based on constraints
from mixing length theory and turbulence, and on comparisons of poloidal field
evolution on the Sun with that from the flux-transport dynamo model.
  We then study the effect of each diffusivity profile in the cyclic evolution
of the magnetic fields in the Sun, by solving the mean-field dynamo equations.
We investigate effects on the solar cycle periods, the maximum tachocline field
strengths, and the evolution of the toroidal and poloidal field structures
inside the convection zone, due to different diffusivity profiles.
  We conduct three experiments: (I) comparing very different magnetic
diffusivity profiles; (II) comparing different locations of diffusivity
gradient near the tachocline for the optimal profile; and (III) comparing
different slopes of diffusivity gradient for an optimal profile.
  Based on these simulations, we discuss which aspects of depth-dependent
diffusivity profiles may be most relevant for magnetic flux evolution in the
Sun, and how certain observations could help improve knowledge of this dynamo
ingredient.
