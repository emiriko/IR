The positions of nucleosomes in eukaryotic genomes determine which parts of
the DNA sequence are readily accessible for regulatory proteins and which are
not. Genome-wide maps of nucleosome positions have revealed a salient pattern
around transcription start sites, involving a nucleosome-free region (NFR)
flanked by a pronounced periodic pattern in the average nucleosome density.
While the periodic pattern clearly reflects well-positioned nucleosomes, the
positioning mechanism is less clear. A recent experimental study by Mavrich et
al. argued that the pattern observed in S. cerevisiae is qualitatively
consistent with a `barrier nucleosome model', in which the oscillatory pattern
is created by the statistical positioning mechanism of Kornberg and Stryer. On
the other hand, there is clear evidence for intrinsic sequence preferences of
nucleosomes, and it is unclear to what extent these sequence preferences affect
the observed pattern. To test the barrier nucleosome model, we quantitatively
analyze yeast nucleosome positioning data both up- and downstream from NFRs.
Our analysis is based on the Tonks model of statistical physics which
quantifies the interplay between the excluded-volume interaction of nucleosomes
and their positional entropy. We find that although the typical patterns on the
two sides of the NFR are different, they are both quantitatively described by
the same physical model, with the same parameters, but different boundary
conditions. The inferred boundary conditions suggest that the first nucleosome
downstream from the NFR (the +1 nucleosome) is typically directly positioned
while the first nucleosome upstream is statistically positioned via a
nucleosome-repelling DNA region. These boundary conditions, which can be
locally encoded into the genome sequence, significantly shape the statistical
distribution of nucleosomes over a range of up to ~1000 bp to each side.
