Niels Bohr famously insisted on the indispensability of what he termed
"classical concepts." In the context of the decoherence program, on the other
hand, it has become fashionable to talk about the "dynamical emergence of
classicality" from the quantum formalism alone. Does this mean that decoherence
challenges Bohr's dictum -- for example, that classical concepts do not need to
be assumed but can be derived? In this paper, we'll try to shed some light down
the murky waters where formalism and philosophy mingle. To begin, we'll clarify
the notion of classicality in the decoherence description. We'll then discuss
Bohr's and Heisenberg's takes on the quantum-classical problem and reflect on
the different meanings of the terms "classicality" and "classical concepts" in
the writings of Bohr and his followers. This analysis will allow us to put
forward some tentative suggestions for how we may better understand the
relation between decoherence-induced classicality and Bohr's classical
concepts.
