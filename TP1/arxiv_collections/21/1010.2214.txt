The WIde-field Nearby Galaxy clusters Survey (WINGS) is a project whose
primary goal is to study the galaxy populations in clusters in the local
universe (z<0.07) and of the influence of environment on their stellar
populations. This survey has provided the astronomical community with a high
quality set of photometric and spectroscopic data for 77 and 48 nearby galaxy
clusters, respectively. In this paper we present the catalog containing the
properties of galaxies observed by the WINGS SPEctroscopic (WINGS-SPE) survey,
which were derived using stellar populations synthesis modelling approach. We
also check the consistency of our results with other data in the literature.
Using a spectrophotometric model that reproduces the main features of observed
spectra by summing the theoretical spectra of simple stellar populations of
different ages, we derive the stellar masses, star formation histories, average
age and dust attenuation of galaxies in our sample. ~5300 spectra were analyzed
with spectrophotometric techniques, and this allowed us to derive the star
formation history, stellar masses and ages, and extinction for the WINGS
spectroscopic sample that we present in this paper. The comparison with the
total mass values of the same galaxies derived by other authors based on SDSS
data, confirms the reliability of the adopted methods and data.
