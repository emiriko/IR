It is known that spherically symmetric static spacetimes admit a foliation by
{\deg}at hypersurfaces. Such foliations have explicitly been constructed for
some spacetimes, using different approaches, but none of them have proved or
even discussed the uniqueness of these foliations. The issue of uniqueness
becomes more important due to suitability of {\deg}at foliations for studying
black hole physics. Here {\deg}at spherically symmetric spacelike hy-
persurfaces are obtained by a direct method. It is found that spherically
symmetric static spacetimes admit {\deg}at spherically symmetric hypersurfaces,
and that these hypersurfaces are unique up to translation under the time- like
Killing vector. This result guarantees the uniqueness of {\deg}at spherically
symmetric foliations for such spacetimes.
