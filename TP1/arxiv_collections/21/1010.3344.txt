We present multi-instruments and multi-wavelengths observations of the famous
LBV star Pistol Star. These observations are part of a larger program about
early O stars at different metallicities. The Pistol star has been claimed as
the most massive star known, with 250 solar masses. We present the preliminary
results based on X-Shooter spectra, as well as the observations performed with
the VLTI-AMBER and the VLT-NACO adaptive optics. The X-shooter spectrograph
allows to obtain simultaneously a spectrum from the UV to the K-band with a
resolving power of $\sim$15000. The preliminary results obtained indicate that
Pistol Star has similar properties of Eta Car, including shells of matter, but
also the binarity. Other objects of the program, here briefly presented, were
selected for their particular nature: early O stars with mass discrepancies
between stellar evolution models and observations, discrepancies with the wind
momentum luminosity relation.
