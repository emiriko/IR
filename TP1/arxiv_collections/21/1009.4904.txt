We report on a non-interacting technique for thermal characterization of
fluids based on surface plasmon resonance interrogation. Using liquid volumes
less than 20 micro liters we have determined the materials' thermo-optic
coefficients with an accuracy of better than 10^{-5} 1/{\deg}C and demonstrated
temperature sensing with an accuracy of 0.03 {\deg}C. The apparatus employs a
low-power probe laser, requiring only a single wavelength, polarization and
interrogation angle for accurate characterization. The device is particularly
suited for precise diagnostics of liquids and gases within microfluidic
systems, and may also be readily integrated into a variety of lab-on-chip
platforms, providing rapid and accurate temperature diagnostics.
