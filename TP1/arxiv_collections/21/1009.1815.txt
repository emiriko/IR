We investigate the details of pattern formation and transitions between
different modulated phases in ultra-thin Fe films on Cu(001). At high
temperature, the transitions between the uniform saturated state, the bubble
state and the striped state are completely reversible, while at low temperature
the bubble phase is avoided. The observed non-equilibrium behavior can be
qualitatively explained by considering the intrinsic energy barriers appearing
in the system due to the competition between the short-ranged exchange and the
long-ranged dipolar interactions. Our experiments suggest that the height of
these energy barriers is related to the domain size and is therefore strongly
temperature dependent.
