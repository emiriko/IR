We show that the dimension of the geometric shape formed by the
phenomenologically valid points inside a multi-dimensional parameter space can
be used to characterise different new physics models and to define a
quantitative measure for the distribution of the points. We explain a simple
algorithm to determine the box-counting dimension from a given set of parameter
points, and illustrate our method with examples from different models that have
recently been studied with respect to precision flavour observables.
