Optical lattices have emerged as ideal simulators for Hubbard models of
strongly correlated materials, such as the high-temperature superconducting
cuprates. In optical lattice experiments, microscopic parameters such as the
interaction strength between particles are well known and easily tunable.
Unfortunately, this benefit of using optical lattices to study Hubbard models
come with one clear disadvantage: the energy scales in atomic systems are
typically nanoKelvin compared with Kelvin in solids, with a correspondingly
miniscule temperature scale required to observe exotic phases such as d-wave
superconductivity. The ultra-low temperatures necessary to reach the regime in
which optical lattice simulation can have an impact-the domain in which our
theoretical understanding fails-have been a barrier to progress in this field.
To move forward, a concerted effort to develop new techniques for cooling and,
by extension, techniques to measure even lower temperatures. This article will
be devoted to discussing the concepts of cooling and thermometry, fundamental
sources of heat in optical lattice experiments, and a review of proposed and
implemented thermometry and cooling techniques.
