We present a complete evaluation for $\jpsi(\psip)$ prompt production at the
Tevatron and LHC at next-to-leading order in nonrelativistic QCD, including
color-singlet, color-octet, and higher charmonia feeddown contributions. The
short-distance coefficients of $\pj$ at next-to-leading order are found to be
larger than leading order by more than an order of magnitude but with a minus
sign at high transverse momentum $p_T$. Two new linear combinations of
color-octet matrix elements are obtained from the CDF data, and used to predict
$\jpsi$ production at the LHC, which agrees with the CMS data. The possibility
of $\sa$ dominance and the $\jpsi$ polarization puzzle are also discussed.
