We employ a novel thermodynamical argument to show that, at the macroscopic
level,there is no intrinsic law of temperature transformation under Lorentz
boosts. This result extends the corresponding microstatistical one of earlier
works to the purely macroscopic regime and signifies that the concept of
temperature as an objective entity is restricted to the description of bodies
in their rest frames. The argument on which this result is based is centred on
the thermal transactions between a body that moves with uniform velocity
relative to a certain inertial frame and a thermometer, designed to measure its
temperature, that is held at rest in that frame.
