Directional point-contact Andreev-reflection (PCAR) measurements in
Ba(Fe1-xCox)2As2 single crystals (Tc=24.5 K) indicate the presence of two
superconducting gaps with no line nodes on the Fermi surface. The PCAR spectra
also feature additional structures related to the electron-boson interaction,
from which the characteristic boson energy Omega_b(T) is obtained, very similar
to the spin-resonance energy observed in neutron scattering experiments. Both
the gaps and the additional structures can be reproduced within a three-band
s+- Eliashberg model by using an electron-boson spectral function peaked at
Omega_0 = 12 meV ~ Omega_b(0).
