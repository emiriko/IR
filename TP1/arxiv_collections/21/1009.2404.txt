It has been suggested that consciousness plays an important role in quantum
mechanics as it is necessary for the collapse of wave function during the
measurement. Furthermore, this idea has spawned a symmetrical proposal: a
possibility that quantum mechanics explains the emergence of consciousness in
the brain. Here we formulated several predictions that follow from this
hypothetical relationship and that can be empirically tested. Some of the
experimental results that are already available suggest falsification of the
first hypothesis. Thus, the suggested link between human consciousness and
collapse of wave function does not seem viable. We discuss the constraints
implied by the existing evidence on the role that the human observer may play
for quantum mechanics and the role that quantum mechanics may play in the
observer's consciousness.
