To clarify the conflict between the theoretical predictions and experimental
measurements of the inclusive J/psi production in Upsilon decay, We consider
the alpha_s^6 order color-singlet contributions of processes Upsilon -->
J/psi+gg and Upsilon --> J/psi+gggg. Both the branching ratio and J/psi
momentum spectrum are calculated, and the branching ratio 4.7 x 10^{-4} is
larger than the leading-order contribution (alpha_s^5, Upsilon -->
J/psi+c\bar{c}g). Together with the QCD and QED leading-order contributions
considered in our previous work, the color-singlet prediction of the branching
ratio for the direct J/psi production is Br(Upsilon-->
J/psi_{direct}+X)=0.90^{+0.49}_{-0.31} x 10^{-4}, which is still about 3.8
times less than the CLEO measurement. We also obtain a preliminary
color-singlet prediction of R_{cc}=sigma(Upsilon --> J/psi+c\bar{c}+X)/
sigma(Upsilon --> J/psi+X) and find the value 0.39^{+0.21}_{-0.20} is much
larger than the color-octet predictions, and suggest to measure this quality in
future experimental analysis.
