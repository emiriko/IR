Owing to their small mass, hydrogen atoms exhibit strong quantum behavior
even at room temperature. Including these effects in first principles
calculations is challenging, because of the huge computational effort required
by conventional techniques. Here we present the first ab-initio application of
a recently-developed stochastic scheme, which allows to approximate nuclear
quantum effects inexpensively. The proton momentum distribution of lithium
imide, a material of interest for hydrogen storage, was experimentally measured
by inelastic neutron scattering experiments and compared with the outcome of
quantum thermostatted ab initio dynamics. We obtain favorable agreement between
theory and experiments for this purely quantum mechanical property, thereby
demonstrating that it is possible to improve the modelling of complex
hydrogen-containing materials without additional computational effort.
