Magnetoresistivity and Hall effect measured in magnetic fields up to B=9T
(B||c, J||ab) in electron-doped $Nd_{2-x}$Ce_{x}Cu$O_{4+{\delta}} single
crystal films with x = 0.14; 0.15; 0.18 and different oxygen content ({\delta})
were studied in a temperature range of 0.4-4.2 K. The resistivity and Hall
coefficient behaviors in the mixed state are discussed in the framework of
flux-flow model with the inclusion of the back-flow of vortices owing to the
pinning forces.
