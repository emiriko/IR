We use a combination of VJHK and Spitzer} [3.6], [5.8] and [8.0] photometry,
to determine IR excesses in a sample of LMC and SMC O stars. This sample is
ideal for determining excesses because: 1) the distances to the stars, and
hence their luminosities, are well-determined, and; 2) the very small line of
sight reddenings minimize the uncertainties introduced by extinction
corrections. We find IR excesses much larger than expected from Vink et al.
(2001) mass loss rates. This is in contrast to previous wind line analyses for
many of the LMC stars which suggest mass loss rates much less than the Vink et
al. predictions. ogether, these results indicate that the winds of the LMC and
SMC O stars are strongly structured (clumped).
