A promising method to detect earth-sized exoplanets is the timing analysis of
a known transit. The technique allows a search for variations in transit
duration or center induced by the perturbation of a third body, e.g. a second
planet or an exomoon. To this aim, TASTE (The Asiago Survey for Timing transit
variations of Exoplanets) project will collect high-precision, short-cadence
light curves for a selected sample of transits by using imaging differential
photometry at the Asiago 1.82m telescope. The first light curves show that our
project can already provide a competitive timing accuracy, as well as a
significant improvement over the orbital parameters. We derived refined
ephemerides for HAT-P-3b and HAT-P-14b with only one transit each, thanks to a
timing accuracy of 11 and 25 s, respectively.
