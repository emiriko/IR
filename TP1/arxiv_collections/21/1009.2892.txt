We devise a fairly general sufficient condition ensuring that the
endomorphism monoid of a countably infinite ultrahomogeneous structure (i.e. a
Fra\"{\i}ss\'{e} limit) embeds all countable semigroups. This approach provides
us not only with a framework unifying the previous scattered results in this
vein, but actually yields new applications for endomorphism monoids of the
(rational) Urysohn space and the countable universal ultrahomogeneous
semilattice.
