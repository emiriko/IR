Given a pure state vector |x> and a density matrix rho, the function
p(x|rho)=<x|rho|x> defines a probability density on the space of pure states
parameterised by density matrices. The associated Fisher-Rao information
measure is used to define a unitary invariant Riemannian metric on the space of
density matrices. An alternative derivation of the metric, based on square-root
density matrices and trace norms, is provided. This is applied to the problem
of quantum-state estimation. In the simplest case of unitary parameter
estimation, new higher-order corrections to the uncertainty relations,
applicable to general mixed states, are derived.
