We present an analysis of semileptonic decays of orbitally, $P$-wave excited
$B_{s}$ meson states $B^{**}_{s}$, including the newly found narrow
$B_{s1}(5830)$ and $B^{*}_{s2}(5840)$ states, into low lying $D_{s}$ mesons
($D_{s}(1968)$, $D^{*}_{s}(2112)$, $D_{sJ}(2317)$, $D_{sJ}(2460)$) within the
framework of heavy quark effective theory. The relevant universal form factors
are estimated using QCD sum rules at the leading-order of the heavy quark
expansion. The decay widths are predicted and the branching ratios are
estimated.
