Ultracold three-component atomic Fermi gases in one dimension are expected to
exhibit rich physics due to the presence of trions and different pairing
states. Quantum phase transitions from the trion state into a paired phase and
a normal Fermi liquid occur at zero temperature. We derive the analytical
thermodynamics of strongly attractive three-component one-dimensional fermions
with SU(3) symmetry via the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz method in unequal Zeeman
splitting fields $H_1$ and $H_2$. We find explicitly that for low temperature
the system acts like either a two-component or a three-component
Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid dependent on the system parameters. The phase
diagrams for the chemical potential and specific heat are presented for
illustrative values of the Zeeman splitting. We also demonstrate that crossover
between different Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid phases evolve singular behaviour in
specific heat and entropy as the temperature tends to zero. Beyond
Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid physics, we obtain the equation of state which
provides a precise description of universal thermodynamics and quantum
criticality in three-component strongly attractive Fermi gases.
