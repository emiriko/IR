The fluorescent X-ray emission from neutral iron in the molecular clouds (Sgr
B) indicates that the clouds are being irradiated by an external X-ray source.
The source is probably associated with the Galactic central black hole (Sgr
A*), which triggered a bright outburst one hundred years ago. We suggest that
such an outburst could be due to a partial capture of a star by Sgr A*, during
which a jet was generated. By constraining the observed flux and the time
variability ($\sim$ 10 years) of the Sgr B's fluorescent emission, we find that
the shock produced by the interaction of the jet with the dense interstellar
medium represents a plausible candidate for the X-ray source emission.
