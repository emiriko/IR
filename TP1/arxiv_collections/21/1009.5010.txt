Chaos control in Random Boolean networks is implemented by freezing part of
the network to drive it from chaotic to ordered phase. However, controlled
nodes are only viewed as passive blocks to prevent perturbation spread. This
paper proposes a new control method in which controlled nodes can exert an
active impact on the network. Controlled nodes and frozen values are
deliberately selected according to the information of connection and Boolean
functions. Simulation results show that the number of nodes needed to achieve
control is largely reduced compared to previous method. Theoretical analysis is
also given to estimate the least fraction of nodes needed to achieve control.
