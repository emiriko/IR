We reconsider the flavor problem in the models with two Higgs doublets. By
studying two generation toy models, we look for flavor basis independent
constraints on Yukawa couplings that will give us the mass hierarchy while
keeping all Yukawa couplings of the same order. We then generalize our findings
to the full three generation Standard Model. We find that we need two
constraints on the Yukawa couplings to generate the observed mass hierarchy,
and a slight tuning of Yukawa couplings of order 10%, much less than the
Standard Model. We briefly study how these constraints can be realized, and
show how flavor changing currents are under control for $K-\bar{K}$ mixing in
the near-decoupling limit.
