We report a technique that uses clouds of ultracold atoms as sensitive,
tunable, and non-invasive probes for microwave field imaging with micrometer
spatial resolution. The microwave magnetic field components drive Rabi
oscillations on atomic hyperfine transitions whose frequency can be tuned with
a static magnetic field. Readout is accomplished using state-selective
absorption imaging. Quantitative data extraction is simple and it is possible
to reconstruct the distribution of microwave magnetic field amplitudes and
phases. While we demonstrate 2d imaging, an extension to 3d imaging is
straightforward. We use the method to determine the microwave near-field
distribution around a coplanar waveguide integrated on an atom chip.
