We investigate the transient response of the generated light from Four-Wave
Mixing (FWM) in the diamond configuration using a step-down field excitation.
The transients show fast decay times and oscillations that depend on the
detunings and intensities of the fields. A simplified model taking into account
the thermal motion of the atoms, propagation, absorption and dispersion effects
shows qualitative agreement with the experimental observations with the energy
levels in rubidium (5S1/2, 5P1/2, 5P3/2 and 6S1/2). The atomic polarization
comes from all the contributions of different velocity classes of atoms in the
ensemble modifying dramatically the total transient behavior of the light from
FWM.
