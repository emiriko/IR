Traditional Aboriginal Australian cultures include a significant astronomical
component, perpetuated through oral tradition and ceremony. This knowledge has
practical navigational and calendrical functions, and sometimes extends to a
deep understanding of the motion of objects in the sky. Here we explore whether
this astronomical tradition is reflected in the rock art of Aboriginal
Australians. We find several plausible examples of depictions of astronomical
figures and symbols, and also evidence that astronomical observations were used
to set out stone arrangements. However, we recognise that the case is not yet
strong enough to make an unequivocal statement, and describe our plans for
further research.
