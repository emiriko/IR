This paper proposes an organized generalization of Newman and Girvan's
modularity measure for graph clustering. Optimized via a deterministic
annealing scheme, this measure produces topologically ordered graph clusterings
that lead to faithful and readable graph representations based on clustering
induced graphs. Topographic graph clustering provides an alternative to more
classical solutions in which a standard graph clustering method is applied to
build a simpler graph that is then represented with a graph layout algorithm. A
comparative study on four real world graphs ranging from 34 to 1 133 vertices
shows the interest of the proposed approach with respect to classical solutions
and to self-organizing maps for graphs.
