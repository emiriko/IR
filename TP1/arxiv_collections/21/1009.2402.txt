It is shown, that retardation in the $\alpha$-quenching in the Parker's
dynamo model leads to parametric resonance. This result is observed in the
numerical simulations and can be reproduced in the simple analytic model. The
other interesting effect in the model with retardation is a appearance of the
long-term processes with the period much larger than the typical time of
retardation.
