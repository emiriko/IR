The study of fingerprint individuality aims to determine to what extent a
fingerprint uniquely identifies an individual. Recent court cases have
highlighted the need for measures of fingerprint individuality when a person is
identified based on fingerprint evidence. The main challenge in studies of
fingerprint individuality is to adequately capture the variability of
fingerprint features in a population. In this paper hierarchical mixture models
are introduced to infer the extent of individualization. Hierarchical mixtures
utilize complementary aspects of mixtures at different levels of the hierarchy.
At the first (top) level, a mixture is used to represent homogeneous groups of
fingerprints in the population, whereas at the second level, nested mixtures
are used as flexible representations of distributions of features from each
fingerprint. Inference for hierarchical mixtures is more challenging since the
number of unknown mixture components arise in both the first and second levels
of the hierarchy. A Bayesian approach based on reversible jump Markov chain
Monte Carlo methodology is developed for the inference of all unknown
parameters of hierarchical mixtures. The methodology is illustrated on
fingerprint images from the NIST database and is used to make inference on
fingerprint individuality estimates from this population.
