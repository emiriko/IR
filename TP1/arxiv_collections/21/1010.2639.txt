We reconstruct different f(R)-gravity models corresponding to the polytropic,
standard Chaplygin, generalized Chaplygin, modified Chaplygin and modified
variable Chaplygin gas dark energy models. We also obtain the equation of state
parameters of the corresponding f(R)-gravity models which describe the
accelerated expansion of the universe. We conclude that although the equation
of state parameters of the obtained f(R)-gravities can behave like phantom or
quintessence dark energy models, they cannot justify the transition from the
quintessence state to the phantom regime. Furthermore, the polytropic and
Chaplygin f(R)-gravity models in de Sitter space can satisfy the inflation
condition.
