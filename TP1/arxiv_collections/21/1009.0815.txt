La0.67Sr0.33MnO3 (LSMO) thin films under compressive strain have an
orthorhombic symmetry with (1-10)o and (001)o in-plane orientations. (The
subscript o denotes the orthorhombic symmetry.) Here, we grew LSMO on cubic
(LaAlO3)0.3-(Sr2AlTaO6)0.7 (LSAT) substrates and observed a uniaxial
contribution to the magnetic anisotropy which is related to the orthorhombic
crystal structure. Since the lattice mismatch is equal in the two directions,
the general understanding of anisotropy in LSMO, which relates the uniaxial
anisotropy to differences in strain, cannot explain the results. These findings
suggest that the oxygen octahedra rotations associated with the orthorhombic
structure, possibly resulting in different Mn-O-Mn bond angles and therefore a
change in magnetic coupling between the [1-10]o and [001]o directions,
determine the anisotropy. We expect these findings to lead to a better
understanding of the microscopic origin of the magnetocrystalline anisotropy in
LSMO.
