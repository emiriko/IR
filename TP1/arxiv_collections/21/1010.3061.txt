We experimentally demonstrate low-power-consumption vortex-core switching in
magnetic nanodisks using tailored rotating magnetic fields that are produced
with orthogonal and unipolar Gaussian-pulse currents. Optimal width of the
orthogonal pulses and their time delay are found to be determined only by the
angular eigenfrequency {\omega}_D for a given vortex-state disk of its
polarization p, such that {\sigma} = 1/{\omega}_D and {\Delta}t =
{\pi}p/2{\omega}_D, as studied from analytical and micromagnetic numerical
calculations. The estimated optimal pulse parameters are in good agreements
with the experimentally found results. This work provides a foundation for
energy-efficient information recording in vortex-core cross-point architecture.
