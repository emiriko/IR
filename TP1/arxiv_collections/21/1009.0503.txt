The relation between high-harmonic spectra and the geometry of the molecular
orbitals in position and momentum space is investigated. In particular we
choose two isoelectronic pairs of homonuclear and heteronuclear molecules, such
that the highest occupied molecular orbital of the former exhibit at least one
nodal plane. The imprint of such planes is a strong suppression in the harmonic
spectra, for particular alignment angles. We are able to identify two distinct
types of nodal planes. If the nodal planes are determined by the atomic
wavefunctions only, the angle for which the yield is suppressed will remain the
same for both types of molecules. In contrast, if they are determined by the
linear combination of atomic orbitals at different centers in the molecule,
there will be a shift in the angle at which the suppression occurs for the
heteronuclear molecules, with regard to their homonuclear counterpart. This
shows that, in principle, molecular imaging, which uses the homonuclear
molecule as a reference and enables one to observe the wavefunction distortions
in its heteronuclear counterpart, is possible.
