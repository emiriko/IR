Tardos codes are currently the state-of-the-art in the design of practical
collusion-resistant fingerprinting codes. Tardos codes rely on a secret vector
drawn from a publicly known probability distribution in order to generate each
Buyer's fingerprint. For security purposes, this secret vector must not be
revealed to the Buyers. To prevent an untrustworthy Provider forging a copy of
a Work with an innocent Buyer's fingerprint, previous asymmetric fingerprinting
algorithms enforce the idea of the Buyers generating their own fingerprint.
Applying this concept to Tardos codes is challenging since the fingerprint must
be based on this vector secret.
  This paper provides the first solution for an asymmetric fingerprinting
protocol dedicated to Tardos codes. The motivations come from a new attack, in
which an untrustworthy Provider by modifying his secret vector frames an
innocent Buyer.
