It is first pointed out that there is a common mathematical model for the
universe and the quantum computer. The former is called the histories approach
to quantum mechanics and the latter is called measurement based quantum
computation. Although a rigorous concrete model for the universe has not been
completed, a quantum measure and integration theory has been developed which
may be useful for future progress. In this work we show that the quantum
integral is the unique functional satisfying certain basic physical and
mathematical principles. Since the set of paths (or trajectories) for a quantum
computer is finite, this theory is easier to treat and more developed. We
observe that the sum of the quantum measures of the paths is unity and the
total interference vanishes. Thus, constructive interference is always balanced
by an equal amount of destructive interference. As an example we consider a
simplified two-slit experiment
