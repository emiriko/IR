The spectacular variability of microquasars has led to a long string of
efforts in order to classify their observed behaviors in a few states. The
progress made in the understanding of the Quasi-Periodic Oscillations observed
in these objects now makes it possible to develop a new way to find order in
their behavior, based on the theorized physical processes associated with these
oscillations. This will also have the interest of reuniting microquasars in a
single classification based on the physical processes at work and therefore
independent of their specificities (mass, variation timescale, outburst
history, etc.). This classification is aimed to be a tool to further our
understanding of microquasars behavior and not to replace phenomenological
states. We start by considering three instabilities that can cause accretion in
the disk. We compare the conditions for their development, and the
Quasi-Periodic Oscillations they can be expected to produce, with the spectral
states in which these Quasi-Periodic Oscillations are observed and sometimes
coexist. From the three instabilities that we proposed to explain the three
states of GRS 1915+105 we actually found the theoretical existence of four
states. We compared those four states with observations and also how those four
states can be seen in a model-independent fashion. Those four state can be used
to find an order in microquasar observations, based on the properties of the
Quasi-Periodic Oscillations and the physics of the associated instabilities.
