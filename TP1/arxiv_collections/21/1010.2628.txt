A recently developed Shastry's formalism for energy transport is used to
analyze the temporal and spatial behaviors of the energy and heat transport in
metals under delta function excitation at the surface. Comparison with
Cattaneo's model is performed. Both models show the transition between
nonthermal (ballistic) and thermal (ballistic-diffusive) regimes. Furthermore,
because the new model considers the discrete character of the lattice, it
highlights some new phenomena such as damped oscillations in the energy
transport both in time and space. The energy relaxation of the conduction band
electrons in metals is considered to be governed by the electron-phonon
scattering, and the scattering time is taken to be averaged over the Fermi
surface. Using the new formalism, one can quantify the transfer from nonthermal
modes to thermal ones as energy propagates in the material and it is
transformed into heat. While the thermal contribution shows a wave-front and an
almost exponentially decaying behavior with time, the nonthermal part shows a
wave-front and a damped oscillating behavior. Two superimposed oscillations are
identified; a fast oscillation that is attributed to the nonthermal nature of
energy transport at very short time scales and a slow oscillation that
describes the nature of the transition from the nonthermal regime to the
thermal regime of energy transport.
