D. Krieger and J. Shallit have proved that every real number greater than 1
is a critical exponent of some sequence. We show how this result can be derived
from some general statements about sequences whose subsequences have (almost)
maximal Kolmogorov complexity. In this way one can also construct a sequence
that has no "approximate" fractional powers with exponent that exceeds a given
value.
