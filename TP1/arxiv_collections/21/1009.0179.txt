The majority of basaltic asteroids are found in the inner main belt, although
a few have also been observed in the outer main belt and near-Earth space.
These asteroids -referred to as V-types- have surface compositions that
resemble that of the 530km sized asteroid Vesta. Besides the compositional
similarity, dynamical evidence also links many V-type asteroids to Vesta.
Moreover, Vesta is one of the few asteroids to have been identified as source
of specific classes of meteorites, the howardite, eucrite, diogenite
achondrites (HEDs). Despite the general consensus on the outlined scenario,
several questions remain unresolved. In particular, it is not clear if the
observed spectral diversity among Vesta, V-types and HEDs is due to space
weathering, as is thought to be the case for S-type asteroids. In this paper,
SDSS photometry is used to address the question of whether the spectral
diversity among candidate V-types and HEDs can be explained by space
weathering. We show that visible spectral slopes of V-types are systematically
redder with respect to HEDs, in a similar way to what is found for ordinary
chondrite meteorites and S-types. On the assumption that space weathering is
responsible for the slope mismatch, we estimated an upper limit for the
reddening timescale of about 0.5Ga. Nevertheless, the observed slope mismatch
between HEDs and V-types poses several puzzles to understanding its origin. The
implication of our findings is also discussed in the light of Dawn mission to
Vesta.
