The upper main sequence magnetic chemically peculiar (Ap) stars exhibit a
non-uniform distribution of chemical elements across their surfaces and with
height in their atmospheres. These inhomogeneities, responsible for the
conspicuous photometric and spectroscopic variation of Ap stars, are believed
to be produced by atomic diffusion operating in the stellar atmospheres
stabilized by multi-kG magnetic fields. Here I present an overview of the
current state-of-the-art in understanding Ap-star spots and their relation to
magnetic fields. In particular, I highlight recent 3-D chemical spot structure
studies and summarize magnetic field mapping results based on the inversion of
the full Stokes vector spectropolarimetric observations. I also discuss a
puzzling new type of spotted stars, HgMn stars, in which the formation and
evolution of heavy element spots is driven by a poorly understood mechanism,
apparently unrelated to magnetic fields.
