we use the nuclear proximity potential obtained recently for the Skyrme
nucleus-nucleus interaction in the semiclassical extended Thomas Fermi (ETF)
approach using Skyrme energy density formalism (SEDF) under frozen-density
(sudden-without-exchange) approximation, and $\Phi$=0$^0$. This method allows
the barrier modifications by using different Skyrme forces, since a different
Skyrme force would mean different barrier characteristics, and possibly a
different force for different reaction cross-section.
