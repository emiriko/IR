The complete point symmetry group of the barotropic vorticity equation on the
$\beta$-plane is computed using the direct method supplemented with two
different techniques. The first technique is based on the preservation of any
megaideal of the maximal Lie invariance algebra of a differential equation by
the push-forwards of point symmetries of the same equation. The second
technique involves a priori knowledge on normalization properties of a class of
differential equations containing the equation under consideration. Both of
these techniques are briefly outlined.
