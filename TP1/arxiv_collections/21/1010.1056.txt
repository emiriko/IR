We compare three attempts that have been made to decompose the angular
momentum of the electromagnetic field into components of an "orbital" and
"spin" nature. All three expressions are different and it appears, on the basis
of classical electrodynamics, that there is no preferred way of decomposing the
angular momentum of the electromagnetic field into orbital and spin components,
even in an inertial frame.
