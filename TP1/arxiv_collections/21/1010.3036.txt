We wish to explore a link between the Lax integrability of the $q$-Painlev\'e
equations and the symmetries of the $q$-Painlev\'e equations. We shall
demonstrate that the connection preserving deformations that give rise to the
$q$-Painlev\'e equations may be thought of as elements of the groups of
Schlesinger transformations of their associated linear problems. These groups
admit a very natural lattice structure. Each Schlesinger transformation induces
a B\"acklund transformation of the $q$-Painlev\'e equation. Each translational
B\"acklund transformation may be lifted to the level of the associated linear
problem, effectively showing that each translational B\"acklund transformation
admits a Lax pair. We will demonstrate this framework for the $q$-Painlev\'e
equations up to and including $q$-$\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{VI}}$.
