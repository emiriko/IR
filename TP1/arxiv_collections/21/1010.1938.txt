Nearly 70% of information security threats originate from inside an
organization. Opportunities for insider threats have been increasing at an
alarming rate with the latest trends of mobility (portable devices like Laptop,
smart phones etc.), ubiquitous connectivity (wireless or through 3G
connectivity) and this trend increases as more and more web-based applications
are made available over the Internet. Insider threats are generally caused by
current or ex-employees, contractors or partners, who have authorized access to
the organization's network and servers. Theft of confidential information is
often for either material gain or for willful damage. Easy availability of
hacking tools on the Internet, USB devices and wireless connectivity provide
for easy break-ins. The net result is losses worth millions of dollars in terms
of IP theft, leakage of customer / individual information, etc. This paper
presents an understanding of Insider threats, attackers and their motives and
suggests mitigation techniques at the organization level
