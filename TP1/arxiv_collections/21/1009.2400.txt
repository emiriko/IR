We use the entropy production variational method to associate a one particle
distribution function to the assumed known energy-momentum and entropy currents
describing a relativistic conformal fluid. Assuming a simple form for the
collision operator we find this one particle distribution function explicitly,
and show that this method of linking the hydro and kinetic description is a non
trivial generalization of Grad's ansatz. The resulting constitutive relations
are the same as in the conformal dissipative type theories discussed in J.

results may prove useful in the description of freeze-out in ultrarelativistic
heavy-ion collisions.
