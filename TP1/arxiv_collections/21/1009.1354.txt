We present near-infrared H and K-band spectro-interferometric observations of
the gaseous disk around the primary Be star in the delta Sco binary system,
obtained in 2007 (between periastron passages in 2000 and 2011). Observations
using the CHARA/MIRC instrument at H-band resolve an elongated disk with a
Gaussian FWHM 1.18 x 0.91 mas. Using the Keck Interferometer, the source of the
K-band continuum emission is only marginally spatially resolved, and
consequently we estimate a relatively uncertain K-band continuum disk FWHM of
0.7 +/- 0.3 mas. Line emission on the other hand, He1 (2.0583 micron) and Br
gamma (2.1657 micron), is clearly detected, with about 10% lower visibilities
than those of the continuum. When taking into account the continuum/line flux
ratio this translates into much larger sizes for the line emission regions: 2.2
+/- 0.4 mas and 1.9 +/- 0.3 mas for He1 and Br gamma respectively. Our KI data
also reveal a relatively flat spectral differential phase response, ruling out
significant off-center emission. We expect these new measurements will help
constrain dynamical models being actively developed in order to explain the
disk formation process in the delta Sco system and Be stars in general.
