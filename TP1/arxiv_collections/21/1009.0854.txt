Color space transformations are frequently used in image processing,
graphics, and visualization applications. In many cases, these transformations
are complex nonlinear functions, which prohibits their use in time-critical
applications. In this paper, we present a new approach called Minimax
Approximations for Color-space Transformations (MACT).We demonstrate MACT on
three commonly used color space transformations. Extensive experiments on a
large and diverse image set and comparisons with well-known multidimensional
lookup table interpolation methods show that MACT achieves an excellent balance
among four criteria: ease of implementation, memory usage, accuracy, and
computational speed.
