We present precision calculations of the invariant-mass and
transverse-momentum distributions of gaugino pairs produced at hadron
colliders. We implement the threshold and transverse-momentum resummation
formalisms at next-to-leading order accuracy and match the obtained result to
the perturbative prediction at O(alpha_s). We compare the various resummed
cross sections with the perturbative results and Monte Carlo predictions. The
theoretical uncertainties coming from renormalisation and factorisation scale
variations are also discussed.
