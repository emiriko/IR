Obscured AGN are fundamental to understand the history of Super Massive Black
Hole growth and their influence on galaxy formation. However, the Compton-thick
AGN (NH>1e24 cm^-2) population is basically unconstrained, with less than few
dozen confirmed Compton-thick AGN found and studied so far. A way to select
heavily obscured AGN is to compare the X-ray emission below 10 keV (which is
strongly depressed) with the emission from other bands less affected by the
absorption, i.e. the IR band. To this end, we have cross-correlated the 2XMM
catalogue with the IRAS Point Source catalogue and, by using the X-ray to
infrared flux ratio and X-ray colors, we selected a well defined sample of
Compton-thick AGN candidates at z<0.1. The aim of this work is to confirm the
nature and to study one of these local Compton-thick AGN candidates, the nearby
(z=0.029) Seyfert 2 galaxy IRAS 04507+0358, by constraining the amount of
intrinsic absorption (NH) and thus the intrinsic luminosity. To this end we
obtained deep (100 ks) Suzaku observations (AO4 call) and performed a joint fit
with SWIFT-BAT data. We analyzed XMM-Newton, Suzaku and SWIFT-BAT data and we
present here the results of this broad-band (0.4-100 keV) spectral analysis. We
found that the broad-band X-ray emission of IRAS 04507+0358 requires a large
amount of absorption (larger than 1e24 cm^-2) to be well reproduced, thus
confirming the Compton-thick nature of this source. In particular, the most
probable scenario is that of a mildly (NH (1.3-1.5)x1e24 cm^-2, L(2-10 keV)
(5-7)x1e43 erg s^-1) Compton-thick AGN.
