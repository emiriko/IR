We consider the implications of the condensation of a general local BRST
invariant dimension two operator built out of the localizing ghost fields of
the Gribov-Zwanziger Lagrangian which is a localized Lagrangian incorporating
the Gribov problem in the Landau gauge. For different colour tensor projections
of the general operator, the properties of a frozen gluon propagator and
unenhanced Faddeev-Popov ghost propagator, which are observed in lattice
computations, can be reproduced. The alternative possibilities are
distinguished by the infrared structure of the propagators of the spin-1
fields, other than those of the gluon and Faddeev-Popov ghost, for which there
is no numerical simulation data to compare with yet.
