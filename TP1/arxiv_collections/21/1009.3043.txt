Newtonian gravitation is non-radiative but is extremely pervasive and
penetrates equally into every media because it cannot be shielded. The extra
terrestrial fgravity is responsible for earth's trajectory. However its
correlation or geodesic deviation is manifested as semi-diurnal and diurnal
tides. Tidal signals, A(t) are temporal modulations in the field differential
which can be observed in a wide variety of natural and laboratory situations.
A(t) is a quasi-static, low frequency signal which arises from the relative
changes in positions of the detector and source and is not part of the
electromagnetic spectrum. Isaac Newton was the first to recognize the
importance of tides in astrometry and attempetd to estimate lunar mass from
ocean tides. By a case study we show, how the systematics of the gravitational
correlation can be used for calibration and de-trending which can significantly
increase the confidence level of high precision experiments. A(t) can also be
used to determine the distribution of celestial masses independently of the
"1-2-3" law. Guided by modern advances in gravity wave detectors we argue that
it is important to develop high precision accelerometry. With a resolution of
about a nano-m it will be possible to determine solar system masses and detect
the SMBH at the center of our galaxy. Observations of the gravitational
correlation can potentially open up yet to be explored vistas of the cosmos.
