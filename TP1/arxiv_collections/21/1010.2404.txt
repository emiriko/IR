The properties of a local spin S=1/2 coupled to K independent wires is
studied in the presence of bias voltages which drive the system out of thermal
equilibrium. For K >> 1, a perturbative renormalization group approach is
employed to construct the voltage dependent scaling function for the
conductance and the T-matrix. In contrast to the single-channel case, the Kondo
resonance is split even by bias voltages small compared to the Kondo
temperature T_K, V << T_K. Besides the applied voltage V, the current induced
decoherence rate \Gamma << V controls the physical properties of the system.
While the presence of V changes the structure of the renormalization group
considerably, decoherence turns out to be be very effective in prohibiting the
flow towards new nonequilibrium fixed points even in variants of the Kondo
model where currents are partially suppressed.
