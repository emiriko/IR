A covariant spectator quark model is applied to estimate the valence quark
contributions to the$ F1*(Q2) and F2*(Q2) transition form factors for the gamma
N -> P11(1440) reaction. The Roper resonance, P11(1440), is assumed to be the
first radial excitation of the nucleon. The model requires no extra parameters
except for those already fixed by the previous studies for the nucleon. The
results are consistent with the experimental data in the high Q2 region, and
those from the lattice QCD. Finally the model is also applied to estimate the
meson cloud contributions from the CLAS and MAID analysis.
