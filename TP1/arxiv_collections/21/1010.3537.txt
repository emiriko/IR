In this note we consider the perfect integrator driven by Poisson process
input. We derive its equilibrium and response properties and contrast them to
the approximations obtained by applying the diffusion approximation. In
particular, the probability density in the vicinity of the threshold differs,
which leads to altered response properties of the system in equilibrium.
