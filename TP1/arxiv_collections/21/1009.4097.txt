We present evidence, from published BABAR data, for the existence of further
excitations in the b-bbar spectrum, namely the long-awaited Upsilon(1D) and
Upsilon(2D) with central masses of 10098 pm 5 MeV and 10492 pm 5 MeV,
respectively. The significance of the Upsilon(1 3D1) and Upsilon(2 3D1) signals
is found to be 3.0 and 10.7 standard deviations, respectively.
