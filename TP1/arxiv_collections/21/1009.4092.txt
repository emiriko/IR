Steady states of the thin film equation $u_t+[u^3 (u_xxx + \alpha^2 u_x
-\sin(x) )]_x=0$ are considered on the periodic domain $\Omega = (-\pi,\pi)$.
The equation defines a generalized gradient flow for an energy functional that
controls the $H^1$-norm. The main result establishes that there exists for each
given mass a unique nonnegative function of minimal energy. This minimizer is
symmetric decreasing about $x=0$. For $\alpha<1$ there is a critical value for
the mass at which the minimizer has a touchdown zero. If the mass exceeds this
value, the minimizer is strictly positive. Otherwise, it is supported on a
proper subinterval of the domain and meets the dry region at zero contact
angle. A second result explores the relation between strict positivity and
exponential convergence for steady states. It is shown that positive minimizers
are locally exponentially attractive, while the distance from a steady state
with a dry region cannot decay faster than a power law.
