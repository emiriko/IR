Pair production of massive coloured particles in hadron collisions is
accompanied by potentially large radiative corrections related to the
suppression of soft gluon emission and enhanced Coulomb exchange near the
production threshold. We recently developed a framework to sum both series of
corrections for the partonic cross section using soft-collinear and
non-relativistic effective theory. If it can be argued that the resummed cross
section approximates the complete result over a significant kinematic range, an
improvement of the hadronic cross section results, even when the production is
not kinematically constrained to the threshold. This is discussed here for the
case of top quark production.
