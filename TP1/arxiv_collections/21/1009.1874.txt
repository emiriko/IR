"Propellers" in planetary rings are disturbances in ring material excited by
moonlets that open only partial gaps. We describe a new type of co-orbital
resonance that can explain the observed non-Keplerian motions of propellers.
The resonance is between the moonlet underlying the propeller, and co-orbiting
ring particles downstream of the moonlet where the gap closes. The moonlet
librates within the gap about an equilibrium point established by co-orbiting
material and stabilized by the Coriolis force. In the limit of small libration
amplitude, the libration period scales linearly with the gap azimuthal width
and inversely as the square root of the co-orbital mass. The new resonance
recalls but is distinct from conventional horseshoe and tadpole orbits; we call
it the "frog" resonance, after the relevant term in equine hoof anatomy. For a
ring surface density and gap geometry appropriate for the propeller Bl\'eriot
in Saturn's A ring, our theory predicts a libration period of ~4 years, similar
to the ~3.7 year period over which Bl\'eriot's orbital longitude is observed to
vary. These librations should be subtracted from the longitude data before any
inferences about moonlet migration are made.
