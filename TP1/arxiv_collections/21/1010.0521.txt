I review the ideas and main results in the derivation of security bounds in
quantum key distribution for keys of finite length. In particular, all the
detailed studies on specific protocols and implementations indicate that no
secret key can be extracted if the number of processed signals per run is
smaller than 10^5-10^6. I show how these numbers can be recovered from very
basic estimates.
