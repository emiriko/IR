Studies are presented of the selection of events consistent with top quark
pair production in data recorded by the CMS detector at the LHC, corresponding
to an integrated luminosity of 0.84+/-0.09 1/pb and at center-of-mass energy
sqrt{s}=7 TeV. Results are presented for the lepton+jets as well as dilepton
channels. Event yields in data are compared to those in simulation, and several
background processes are estimated using data-driven techniques. The observed
yields of top-antitop candidate events are roughly consistent with the Standard
Model.
