Effect of two-particle correlations between impurities on the temperature of
transition of a Fermi liquid in the superfluid or superconducting state is
analyzed. It is shown, that correlations with a radius exceeding correlation
length of the superconductor can have pronounced effect on the transition
temperature. The equation for the transition temperature is corrected for
correlations of the impurities. Possible applications of the new equation are
discussed.
