There exist Kruskal like coordinates for the Reissner-Nordstrom (RN) black
hole spacetime which are regular at coordinate singularities. Non existence of
such coordinates for the extreme RN black hole spacetime has already been
shown. Also the Carter coordinates available for the extreme case are not
manifestly regular at the coordinate singularity, therefore, a numerical
procedure was developed to obtain free fall geodesics and flat foliation for
the extreme RN black hole spacetime. The Kottler-Schwarzschild-de Sitter
(KSSdS) spacetime geometry is similar to the RN geometry in the sense that,
like the RN case, there exist non-singular coordinates when there are two
distinct coordinate singularities. There are no manifestly regular coordinates
for the extreme KSSdS case. In this paper foliation of all the cases of the
KSSdS spacetime by flat spacelike hypersurfaces is obtained by introducing a
non-singular time coordinate.
