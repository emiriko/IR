In the current paper, we give a quiver theoretical interpretation of
Mirkovi\'c-Vilonen polytopes in type $A_n$. As a by-product, we give a new
proof of the Anderson-Mirkovi\'c conjecture which describes the explicit forms
of the actions of lowering Kashiwara operators on the set of Mirkovi\'c-Vilonen
polytopes.
