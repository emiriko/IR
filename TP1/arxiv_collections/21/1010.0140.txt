X-ray Free Electron Lasers (XFEL) are revolutionary photons sources, whose
ultrashort, brilliant pulses are expected to allow single molecule diffraction
experiments providing structural information on the atomic length scale. This
ultimate goal, however, is currently hampered by several challenging questions
basically concerning sample damage, Coulomb explosion and the role of
nonlinearity. By employing an original \emph{ab-initio} approach, as well as
exceptional resources of parallel computing, we address these issues showing
that accurate XFEL-based single molecule imaging will be only possible with
ultrashort pulses of half of femtosecond, due to significant radiation damage
and the formation of preferred multi-soliton clusters which reshape the overall
electronic density of the molecular system at the femtosecond scale.
