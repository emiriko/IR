Recently, the D0 Collaboration measured the CP-violating like-sign dimuon
charge asymmetry in neutral B decays, finding a 3.2sigma difference from the
standard-model (SM) prediction. A non-SM charge asymmetry a_sl^s suggests a
new-physics (NP) contribution to Bs-Bsbar mixing. In this case, in order to
explain the measured value of a_sl^s within its 1sigma range, NP must be
present in Gamma_12^s, the absorptive part of the mixing. In this paper, we
examine whether such an explanation is possible in models with flavor-changing
Z (ZFCNC) or Z' (Z'FCNC) gauge bosons. The models must also reproduce the
measured values of the indirect CP asymmetry S_psi-phi in Bs -> J/psi phi, and
Delta Gamma_s, the Bs-Bsbar width difference. We find that the ZFCNC model
cannot reproduce the present measured values of S_psi-phi and a_sl^s within
their 1sigma ranges. On the other hand, in the Z'FCNC model, the values of all
three observables can be simultaneously reproduced.
