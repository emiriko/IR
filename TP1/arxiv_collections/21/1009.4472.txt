There are good reasons to believe that we are classical algorithms run on
(effectively) classical machines. However, the fact that a physical state of a
system in a universe described by a classical deterministic model doesn't
contain any information about the model's evolution laws, gives rise to deep
philosophical paradoxes with this picture of what we are. We explain these
paradoxes in detail and show that they can be resolved once we take into
account that in the real world, classical behavior arises as a result of
decoherence. We then show that this solution naturally leads to a variant of
the idea of a mathematical multiverse, originally proposed by Tegmark.
