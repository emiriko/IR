Libpsht (or "library for Performant Spherical Harmonic Transforms") is a
collection of algorithms for efficient conversion between spatial-domain and
spectral-domain representations of data defined on the sphere. The package
supports transforms of scalars as well as spin-1 and spin-2 quantities, and can
be used for a wide range of pixelisations (including HEALPix, GLESP and ECP).
It will take advantage of hardware features like multiple processor cores and
floating-point vector operations, if available. Even without this additional
acceleration, the employed algorithms are among the most efficient (in terms of
CPU time as well as memory consumption) currently being used in the
astronomical community.
  The library is written in strictly standard-conforming C90, ensuring
portability to many different hard- and software platforms, and allowing
straightforward integration with codes written in various programming languages
like C, C++, Fortran, Python etc.
