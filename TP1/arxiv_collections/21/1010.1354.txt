We report the detection of X-ray pulsations with a period of ~315.87 ms from
the 2009 XMM-Newton observation for the radio-quiet gamma-ray pulsar, LAT PSR
J0007+7303, centered in the supernova remnant CTA 1. The detected pulsed period
is consistent with the gamma-ray periodicity at the same epoch found with the
Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. The broader sinusoidal structure in the folded
light curve of the X-ray emission is dissimilar to that of the gamma-ray
emission, and the phase of the peak is about 0.5 shifting from the peak in the
gamma-ray bands, indicating that the main component of the X-rays originates
from different sites of the pulsar. We conclude that the main component of the
X-ray pulsation is contributed by the thermal emission from the neutron star.
Although with a significantly different characteristic age, PSR~J0007+7303 is
similar to Geminga in emission properties of X-rays and gamma-rays; this makes
PSR J0007+7303 the second radio-quiet gamma-ray pulsar with detected X-ray
pulsations after Geminga.
