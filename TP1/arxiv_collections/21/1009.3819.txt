Reversible logic design has become one of the promising research directions
in low power dissipating circuit design in the past few years and has found its
application in low power CMOS design, digital signal processing and
nanotechnology. This paper presents the efficient design approaches of fault
tolerant carry skip adders (FTCSAs) and compares those designs with the
existing ones. Variable block carry skip logic (VBCSL) using the fault tolerant
full adders (FTFAs) has also been developed. The designs are minimized in terms
of hardware complexity, gate count, constant inputs and garbage outputs.
Besides of it, technology independent evaluation of the proposed designs
clearly demonstrates its superiority with the existing counterparts.
