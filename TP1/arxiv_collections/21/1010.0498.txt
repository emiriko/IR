We present an economical setup for faithful entanglement sharing against
collective noise. It is composed of polarizing beam splitters, half wave
plates, polarization independent wavelength division multiplexers, and
frequency shifters. An arbitrary qubit error on the polarization state of each
photon in a multi-photon system caused by the noisy channel can be rejected,
without resorting to additional qubits, fast polarization modulators, and
nondestructive quantum nondemolition detectors. Its success probability is in
principle 100%, which is independent of the noise parameters, and it can be
applied directly in any one-way quantum communication protocol based on
entanglement.
