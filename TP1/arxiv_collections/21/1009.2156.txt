Charge transport in GaN quantum well (QW) devices grown in non-polar
direction has been theoretically investigated . Emergence of anisotropic line
charge scattering mechanism originating as a result of anisotropic rough
surface morphology in conjunction with in-plane built-in polarization has been
proposed. It has shown that in-plane growth anisotropy leads to large
anisotropic carrier transport at low temperatures. At high temperatures, this
anisotropy in charge transport is partially washed out by strong isotropic
optical phonon scattering in GaN QW.
