Measurement of the three dimensional trajectory and specific ionization of
recoil protons using a hydrogen gas time projection chamber provides
directional information about incident fast neutrons. Here we demonstrate
directional fast neutron detection using such a device. The wide field of view
and excellent gamma rejection that are obtained suggest that this device is
well suited to searches for special nuclear materials, among other
applications.
