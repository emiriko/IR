The distribution engendered by successive splitting of one point vortex are
considered. The process of splitting a vortex in three using a reverse
three-point vortex collapse course is analysed in great details and shown to be
dissipative. A simple process of successive splitting is then defined and the
resulting vorticity distribution and vortex populations are analysed.
