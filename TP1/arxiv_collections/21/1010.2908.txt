This article is based on the 5th Takagi Lectures delivered at the University
of Tokyo in 2008. We discuss a hypothetical correspondence between holonomic
D-modules on an algebraic variety X defined over a field of zero
characteristic, and certain families of Lagrangian subvarieties in the
cotangent bundle to X. The correspondence is based on the reduction to positive
characteristic.
