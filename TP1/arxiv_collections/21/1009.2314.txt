Most of the services viewed in context to grid and cloud computing are mostly
confined to services that are available for intellectual purposes. The grid or
cloud computing are large scale distributed systems. The essence of large scale
distribution can only be realized if the services are rendered to common man.
The only organization which has exposure to almost every single resident is the
respective governments in every country. As the size of population increases so
the need for a larger purview arises. The problem of having a large purview can
be solved by means of large scale grid for online services. The government
services can be rendered through fully customized Service-oriented Clouds. In
this paper we are presenting tight similarities between generic government
functioning and the service oriented grid/cloud approach. Also, we will discuss
the major issues in establishing services oriented grids for governmental
organization.
