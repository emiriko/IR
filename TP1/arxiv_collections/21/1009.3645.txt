A recurrent formula is presented, for the enumeration of the compositions of
positive integers as sums over multisets of positive integers, that closely
resembles Euler's recurrence based on the pentagonal numbers, but where the
coefficients result from a discrete integration of Euler's coefficients. Both a
bijective proof and one based on generating functions show the equivalence of
the subject recurrences.
