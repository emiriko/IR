We consider enhancing the sensitivity of future gravitational-wave detectors
by using double optical spring. When the power, detuning and bandwidth of the
two carriers are chosen appropriately, the effect of the double optical spring
can be described as a "negative inertia", which cancels the positive inertia of
the test masses and thus increases their response to gravitational waves. This
allows us to surpass the free-mass Standard Quantum Limit (SQL) over a broad
frequency band, through signal amplification, rather than noise cancelation,
which has been the case for all broadband SQL-beating schemes so far considered
for gravitational-wave detectors. The merit of such signal amplification
schemes lies in the fact that they are less susceptible to optical losses than
noise cancelation schemes. We show that it is feasible to demonstrate such an
effect with the {\it Gingin High Optical Power Test Facility}, and it can
eventually be implemented in future advanced GW detectors.
