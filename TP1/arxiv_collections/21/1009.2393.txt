Single atoms can be considered as basic objects for electron microscopy to
test the microscope performance and basic concepts for modeling of image
contrast. In this work high-resolution transmission electron microscopy was
applied to image single platinum atoms in an aberration-corrected transmission
electron microscope. The atoms are deposited on a self-assembled monolayer
substrate which induces only negligible contrast. Single-atom contrast
simulations were performed on the basis of Weickenmeier-Kohl and Doyle-Turner
scattering factors. Experimental and simulated intensities are in full
agreement on an absolute scale.
