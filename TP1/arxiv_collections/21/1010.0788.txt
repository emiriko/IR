Context: Molecular data of extreme environments, such as Arp 220, but also
NGC 253, show evidence for extremely high cosmic ray (CR) rates (10^3-10^4 *
Milky Way) and mechanical heating from supernova driven turbulence.
  Aims: The consequences of high CR rates and mechanical heating on the
chemistry in clouds are explored.
  Methods: PDR model predictions are made for low, n=10^3, and high, n=10^5.5
cm^-3, density clouds using well-tested chemistry and radiation transfer codes.
Column densities of relevant species are discussed, and special attention is
given to water related species. Fluxes are shown for fine-structure lines of O,
C+, C, and N+, and molecular lines of CO, HCN, HNC, and HCO+. A comparison is
made to an X-ray dominated region model.
  Results: Fine-structure lines of [CII], [CI], and [OI] are remarkably similar
for different mechanical heating and CR rates, when already exposed to large
amounts of UV. HCN and H2O abundances are boosted for very high mechanical
heating rates, while ionized species are relatively unaffected. OH+ and H2O+
are enhanced for very high CR rates zeta > 5 * 10^-14 s^-1. A combination of
OH+, OH, H2O+, H2O, and H3O+ trace the CR rates, and are able to distinguish
between enhanced cosmic rays and X-rays.
