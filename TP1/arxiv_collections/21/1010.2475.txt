In this paper we introduce simplified, combinatorially exact formulas that
arise in the vortex interaction model found in (Nagem, et al., SIAM J. Appl.
Dyn. Syst. 2009). These combinatorial formulas allow for the efficient
implementation and development of a new multi-moment vortex method (MMVM) using
a Hermite expansion to simulate 2D vorticity. The method naturally allows the
particles to deform and become highly anisotropic as they evolve without the
added cost of computing the non-local Biot-Savart integral. We present three
examples using MMVM. We first focus our attention on the implementation of a
single particle, large number of Hermite moments case, in the context of
quadrupole perturbations of the Lamb-Oseen vortex. At smaller perturbation
values, we show the method captures the shear diffusion mechanism and the rapid
relaxation (on $Re^{1/3}$ time scale) to an axisymmetric state. We then present
two more examples of the full multi-moment vortex method and discuss the
results in the context of classic vortex methods. We perform spatial
convergence studies of the single-particle method and show that the method
exhibits exponential convergence. Lastly, we numerically investigate the
spatial accuracy improvement from the inclusion of higher Hermite moments in
the full MMVM.
