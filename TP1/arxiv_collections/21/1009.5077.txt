Lattice parameter, electronic structure, mechanical and thermodynamic
properties of ThN are systematically studied using the projector-augmented-wave
method and the generalized gradient approximation based on the density
functional theory. The calculated electronic structure indicates the important
contributions of Th 6\emph{d}and 5\emph{f} states to the Fermi-level electron
occupation. Through Bader analysis it is found that the effective valencies in
ThN can be represented as Th$^{+1.82}$ N$^{-1.82}$. Elastic constant
calculations shows that ThN is mechanically stable and elastically anisotropic.
Furthermore, the melting curve of ThN is presented up to 120 GPa. Based on the
phonon dispersion data, our calculated specific heat capacities including both
lattice and conduction-electron contributions agree well with experimental
results in a wide range of temperature.
