We study how the bosonic atoms on the excited p-band of an optical lattice
are coupled to the lowest s-band and the 2nd excited d-band. We find that in
some parameter regimes the atom-atom interactions can cause a dynamical
instability of the p-band atoms towards decay to the s- and d-bands.
Furthermore, even when dynamical instability is not expected s- and d-bands can
become substantially populated.
