In Distributed Interactive Applications (DIA) such as multiplayer games,
where many participants are involved in a same game session and communicate
through a network, they may have an inconsistent view of the virtual world
because of the communication delays across the network. This issue becomes even
more challenging when communicating through a cellular network while executing
the DIA client on a mobile terminal. Consistency maintenance algorithms may be
used to obtain a uniform view of the virtual world. These algorithms are very
complex and hard to program and therefore, the implementation and the future
evolution of the application logic code become difficult. To solve this
problem, we propose an approach where the consistency concerns are handled
separately by a distributed component called a Synchronization Medium, which is
responsible for the communication management as well as the consistency
maintenance. We present the detailed architecture of the Synchronization Medium
and the generic interfaces it offers to DIAs. We evaluate our approach both
qualitatively and quantitatively. We first demonstrate that the Synchronization
Medium is a reusable component through the development of two game
applications, a car racing game and a space war game. A performance evaluation
then shows that the overhead introduced by the Synchronization Medium remains
acceptable.
