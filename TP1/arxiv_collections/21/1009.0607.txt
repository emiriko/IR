Optical detection of single defect centers in the solid state is a key
element of novel quantum technologies. This includes the generation of single
photons and quantum information processing. Unfortunately the brightness of
such atomic emitters is limited. Therefore we experimentally demonstrate a
novel and simple approach that uses off-the-shelf optical elements. The key
component is a solid immersion lens made of diamond, the host material for
single color centers. We improve the excitation and detection of single
emitters by one order of magnitude, as predicted by theory.
