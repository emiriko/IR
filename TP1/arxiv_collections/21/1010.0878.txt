Quasi-local variables, i.e. quantities whose values can be derived from
physics accessible within an arbitrarily small neighborhood of a spacetime
point, are used to construct the equation of state (EoS) for the anisotropic
fluid in the spherical symmetry. One parameter families of equilibrium
solutions are obtained making it possible to assess stability properties by
means of the standard M(R) method. Normal modes of radial pulsation are
computed as well and are found to confirm the onset of instability as predicted
by the M(R) method. As an example, a stable configuration with outwardly
increasing energy density in the core is obtained with a simple quasi-local
extension of the polytropic EoS. It is also found that the loss of stability
occurs at higher surface compactness when the anisotropy of pressures is
present.
