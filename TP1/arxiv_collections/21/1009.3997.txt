We present a tropical geometric description of a piecewise linear map whose
invariant curve is a concave polygon. In contrast to convex polygons, a concave
one is not directly related to tropical geometry; nevertheless the description
is given in terms of the addition formula of a tropical elliptic curve. We show
that the map is arising from a pair of tropical elliptic pencils each member of
which is the invariant curve of the ultradiscrete QRT map.
