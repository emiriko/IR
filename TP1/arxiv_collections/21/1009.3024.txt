We show that the baryon asymmetry of the Universe can be generated by a
strongly coupled right handed neutrino condensate which also drives inflation.
The resulting model has only a small number of parameters, which completely
determine not only the baryon asymmetry of the Universe and the mass of the
right handed neutrino but also the inflationary phase. This feature allows us
to make predictions that will be tested by current and planned experiments. As
compared to the usual approach our dynamical framework is both economical and
predictive.
