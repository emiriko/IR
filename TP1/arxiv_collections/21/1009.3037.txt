We study the geoeffectiveness of a sample of complex events; each includes a
coronal type II burst, accompanied by a GOES SXR flare and LASCO CME. The radio
bursts were recorded by the ARTEMIS-IV radio spectrograph, in the 100-650 MHz
range; the GOES SXR flares and SOHO/LASCO CMEs, were obtained from the Solar
Geophysical Data (SGD) and the LASCO catalogue respectively. These are compared
with changes of solar wind parameters and geomagnetic indices in order to
establish a relationship between solar energetic events and their effects on
geomagnetic activity.
