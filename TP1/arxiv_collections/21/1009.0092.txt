This paper presents a technique that collapses existing experimental data of
heat transfer in pipe flow of Newtonian and power law fluids into a single
master curve. It also discusses the theoretical basis of heat, mass and
momentum analogies and the implications of the present analysis to
visualisations of turbulence.
