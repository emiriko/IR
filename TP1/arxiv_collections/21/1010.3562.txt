We discuss the nature of structure-preserving maps of varies function
algebras. In particular, we identify isomorphisms between special Colombeau
algebras on manifolds with invertible manifold-valued generalized functions in
the case of smooth parametrization. As a consequence, and to underline the
consistency and validity of this approach, we see that this generalized version
on algebra isomorphisms in turn implies the classical result on algebras of
smooth functions.
