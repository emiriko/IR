We experimentally observe the tuning of metamaterials through the relative
rotation of the elements about their common axis. In contrast to previous
results we observe a crossing of resonances, where the symmetric and
anti-symmetric modes become degenerate. We associate this effect with an
interplay between the magnetic and electric near-field interactions and verify
this by calculations based on the interaction energy between resonators.
