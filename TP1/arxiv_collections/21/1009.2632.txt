The Nucleon-Nucleon One Meson Exchange Potential, its wave functions and
related Meson Exchange Currents are analyzed for point-like nucleons. The
leading Nc contributions generate a local and energy independent potential
which presents 1/r^3 singularities, requiring renormalization. We show how
invoking suitable boundary conditions, neutron-proton phase shifts and deuteron
properties become largely insensitive to the nucleon substructure and to the
vector mesons. Actually, reasonable agreement with low energy data for
realistic values of the coupling constants (e.g. SU(3) values) is found. The
analysis along similar lines for the Meson Exchange Currents suggests that this
renormalization scheme implies tremendous simplifications while complying with
exact gauge invariance at any stage of the calculation.
