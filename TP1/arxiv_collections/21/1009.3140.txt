A scheme is proposed for engineering two-mode squeezed states of two
separated cold atomic clouds positioned near the surface of a superconducting
stripline resonator. Based on the coherent magnetic coupling between the atomic
spins and a stripline resonator mode, the desired two-mode squeezed state can
be produced via precisely control on the dynamics of the system. This scheme
may be used to realize scalable on-chip quantum networks with cold atoms
coupling to stripline resonators.
