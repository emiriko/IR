The Belle II detector operating at the future upgrade to the KEKB accelerator
will perform high-statistics precision investigations into the flavor sector of
the Standard Model. As charged hadron identification is a vital element of the
experiment's success, the time-of-propagation (TOP) counter has been chosen as
the primary particle identification device in the barrel region of Belle II.
The TOP counter is a compact variant of the detection of internally reflected
Cherenkov light (DIRC) technique and relies heavily on exquisite single photon
timing resolution with micro-channel plate photomultiplier tubes. We discuss
the general principles of TOP operation and optimization of the Belle II TOP
configuration, which is expected to provide 4 sigma or better separation of
kaons and pions up to momenta of approximately 4 GeV/c.
