Ontologies such as taxonomies, product catalogs or web directories are
heavily used and hence evolve frequently to meet new requirements or to better
reflect the current instance data of a domain. To effectively manage the
evolution of ontologies it is essential to identify the difference (Diff)
between two ontology versions. We propose a novel approach to determine an
expressive and invertible diff evolution mapping between given versions of an
ontology. Our approach utilizes the result of a match operation to determine an
evolution mapping consisting of a set of basic change operations
(insert/update/delete). To semantically enrich the evolution mapping we adopt a
rule-based approach to transform the basic change operations into a smaller set
of more complex change operations, such as merge, split, or changes of entire
subgraphs. The proposed algorithm is customizable in different ways to meet the
requirements of diverse ontologies and application scenarios. We evaluate the
proposed approach by determining and analyzing evolution mappings for
real-world life science ontologies and web directories.
