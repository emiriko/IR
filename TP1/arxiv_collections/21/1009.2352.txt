A numerical method for calculation electronic structure of a nanosystem
composed of a pseudoisocyanine (PIC) molecule assembled on a silver
nanoparticle is developed. The electronic structure of the silver nanoparticle
containing 125 atoms is calculated within the local density version of the
density functional method. A model of an Ag atom embedded in the center of a
spherical jellium cluster is used. The host electron Green function is
calculated by means of the spherically symmetric expansion. The principal
theoretical tool is the scattering theory using the Green function method. The
molecule -- silver nanoparticle interaction is studied using the approach
similar to that of the Anderson model for transition metal impurities in
solids. Localized levels are shown to split off from the top of the band of the
nanosystem. The electronic structure calculations yield information on the
character of chemical bonding in the PIC molecule --- silver particle
nanosystem.
