Jet cross sections have been measured with the ATLAS detector for the first
time in proton-proton collisions at center-of-mass energy of t TeV. The
measurement uses an integrated luminosity of 17 nb-1 recorded at the Large
Hadron Collider. The anti-kt algorithm is used to identify jets, with jet
resolution parameters R=0.6. The dominant uncertainty comes from the jet energy
scale, which is determined to within 7% for central jets above 60 GeV
transverse momentum. Inclusive single-jet differential cross sections are
presented as functions of jet transverse momentum and rapidity. Dijet cross
sections are presented as functions of dijet mass and angle chi. The
experimental results are compared to the expectations based on next-to-leading
order QCD.
