The production of charged pion pairs via multiphoton absorption from an
intense X-ray laser wave colliding with an ultrarelativistic proton beam is
studied. Our calculations include the contributions from both the
electromagnetic and hadronic interactions where the latter are described
approximately by a phenomenological Yukawa potential. Order-of-magnitude
estimates for $\pi^+\pi^-$ production on the proton by two- and three-photon
absorption from the high-frequency laser field are obtained and compared with
the corresponding rates for $\mu^+\mu^-$ pair creation.
