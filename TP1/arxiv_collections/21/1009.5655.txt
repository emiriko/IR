A selection of statistically stable (robust) algorithms for data variance
calculating has been made. Their properties have been analyzed via computer
simulation. These algorithms would be useful if adopted in radio astronomy
observations in the presence of strong sporadic radio frequency interference
(RFI). Several observational results have been presented here to demonstrate
the effectiveness of these algorithms in RFI mitigation.
