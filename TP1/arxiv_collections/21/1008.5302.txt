Based on simple phenomenological Lagrangians, fulfilling reasonable
consistency conditions, we consider under which circumstances the production of
a single particle might be an early signal of new physics at the LHC. Effective
final states are $\gamma \gamma $ and $\gamma +jet$ already with tens of
inverse picobarns of integrated luminosity at 7 TeV.
