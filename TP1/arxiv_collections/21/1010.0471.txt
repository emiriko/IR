This paper investigates the effect of process variations on unity gain
frequency (ft) in 30 nm gate length FinFET by performing extensive TCAD
simulations. Six different geometrical parameters, channel doping, source/drain
doping and gate electrode work function are studied for their sensitivity on
ft. It is found that ft is more sensitive to gate length, underlap, gate-oxide
thickness, channel and Source/Drain doping and less sensitive to source/drain
width and length, and work function variations. Statistical modelling has been
performed for ft through design of experiment with respect to sensitive
parameters. The model has been validated through a comparison between random
set of experimental data simulations and predicted values obtained from the
model.
