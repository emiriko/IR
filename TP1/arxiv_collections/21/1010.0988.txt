We report results from the GammeV Chameleon Afterglow Search---a search for
chameleon particles created via photon/chameleon oscillations within a magnetic
field. This experiment is sensitive to a wide class of chameleon power-law
models and dark energy models not previously explored. These results exclude
five orders of magnitude in the coupling of chameleons to photons covering a
range of four orders of magnitude in chameleon effective mass and, for
individual chameleon models, exclude between 4 and 12 orders of magnitude in
chameleon couplings to matter.
