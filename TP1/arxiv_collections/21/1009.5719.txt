Half-quantum vortices (HQVs) can exist in a superconductor or superfluid with
an exact or approximate U(1) \times U(1) symmetry, for instance in spinor
condensates, 3He-A, Sr2RuO4, and possibly cuprate superconductors with stripe
order. In this paper, we show that a lattice of HQVs can be stabilized at
finite temperature even when it does not have lower energy than the lattice of
full vortices at T = 0 since there is a gain in configurational entropy when a
full vortex fractionalizes into a pair of HQVs. Specifically, the lattice of
HQVs has an optical branch of phonon modes absent in the lattice of full
vortices. Moreover, the HQV lattice at T > 0 can have a different structure
than the HQV lattice at T = 0.
