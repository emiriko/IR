In higher dimensions than four, conventional uniqueness theorem in
asymptotically flat space-times does not hold, i.e., black objects can not be
classified only by the mass, angular momentum and charge. In this paper, we
define multipole moments for black objects and show that Myers-Perry black hole
and black ring can be distinguished by quadrupole moments. This consideration
gives us a new insight for the uniqueness theorem for black objects in higher
dimensions.
