The thermodynamic properties of hot nuclei are described within the canonical
and microcanonical ensemble approaches. These approaches are derived based on
the solutions of the BCS and self-consistent quasiparticle random-phase
approximation at zero temperature embedded into the canonical and
microcanonical ensembles. The obtained results agree well with the recent data
extracted from experimental level densities by Oslo group for $^{94}$Mo,
$^{98}$Mo, $^{162}$Dy and $^{172}$Yb nuclei.
