We study the Higgs boson pair production through $e^+e^-$ collision in the
noncommutative(NC) extension of the standard model using the Seiberg-Witten
maps of this to the first order of the noncommutative parameter $\Theta_{\mu
\nu}$. This process is forbidden in the standard model with background
space-time being commutative. We find that the cross section of the pair
production of Higgs boson (of intermediate and heavy mass) at the future Linear
Collider(LC) can be quite significant for the NC scale $\Lambda$ lying in the
range $0.5 - 1.0$ TeV. Finally, using the direct experimental(LEP II, Tevatron
and global electro-weak fit) bound on Higgs mass, we obtain bounds on the NC
scale as 665 GeV $\le \Lambda \le 998$ GeV.
