The formation of ultra-compact dwarf galaxies (UCDs) is believed to be
interaction driven, and UCDs are abundant in the cores of galaxy clusters,
environments that mark the end-point of galaxy evolution. Nothing is known
about the properties of UCDs in compact groups of galaxies, environments where
most of galaxy evolution and interaction is believed to occur and where UCDs in
intermediate state of evolution may be expected. The main goal of this study is
to detect and characterize, for the first time, the UCD population of compact
groups. For that, 2 groups in different evolutionary stages, HCG 22 and HCG 90,
were targeted with VLT/FORS2/MXU. We detect 16 and 5 objects belonging to HCG
22 and HCG 90, respectively, covering the magnitude range -10.0 > M_R > -11.5
mag. Their colours are consistent with old ages covering a broad range in
metallicities. Photometric mass estimates put 4 objects in HCG 90 and 9 in HCG
22 in the mass range of UCDs (>2x10^6 M_Sun) for an assumed age of 12 Gyr.
These UCDs are on average 2-3 times larger than typical Galactic GCs, covering
a range of 2 >~ r_h >~ 21 pc. The UCDs in HCG 22 are more concentrated around
the central galaxy than in HCG 90, at the 99% confidence level. They cover a
broad range in [alpha/Fe] abundances from sub- to super-solar. The spectra of 3
UCDs show tentative evidence for intermediate age stellar populations. We
calculate the specific frequency (S_N) of UCDs for both groups, finding that
HCG 22 has about three times higher S_N than HCG 90. The ensemble properties of
the detected UCDs supports 2 co-existing formation channels: a star cluster
origin and an origin as tidally stripped dwarf nuclei. Our results imply that
the UCDs detected in both groups do not, in their majority, originate from
relatively recent galaxy interactions. Most of the detected UCDs have likely
been brought into the group with their host galaxies.[abridged]
