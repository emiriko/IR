We present a new method for the evaluation of the age and age-spread among
pre-main-sequence (PMS) stars in star-forming regions in the Magellanic Clouds,
accounting simultaneously for photometric errors, unresolved binarity,
differential extinction, stellar variability, accretion and crowding. The
application of the method is performed with the statistical construction of
synthetic color-magnitude diagrams using PMS evolutionary models. We convert
each isochrone into 2D probability distributions of artificial PMS stars in the
CMD by applying the aforementioned biases that dislocate these stars from their
original CMD positions. A maximum-likelihood technique is then applied to
derive the probability for each observed star to have a certain age, as well as
the best age for the entire cluster. We apply our method to the photometric
catalog of ~2000 PMS stars in the young association LH 95 in the LMC, based on
the deepest HST/ACS imaging ever performed toward this galaxy, with a detection
limit of V~28, corresponding to M~0.2 Msun. Our treatment shows that the age
determination is very sensitive to the considered grid of evolutionary models
and the assumed binary fraction. The age of LH 95 is found to vary from 2.8 Myr
to 4.4 Myr, depending on these factors. Our analysis allows us to disentangle a
real age-spread from the apparent CMD-broadening caused by the physical and
observational biases. We find that LH 95 hosts an age-spread well represented
by a gaussian distribution with a FWHM of the order of 2.8 Myr to 4.2 Myr
depending on the model and binary fraction. We detect a dependence of the
average age of the system with stellar mass. This dependence does not appear to
have any physical meaning, being rather due to imperfections of the PMS
evolutionary models, which tend to predict lower ages for the intermediate
masses, and higher ages for low-mass stars.
