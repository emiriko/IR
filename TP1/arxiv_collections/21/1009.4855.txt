The recently discovered topological insulators exhibit topologically
protected metallic surface states which are interesting from the fundamental
point of view and could be useful for various applications if an appropriate
electronic gating can be realized. Our photoemission study of Cu intercalated
Bi2Se3 shows that the surface states occupancy in this material can be tuned by
changing the photon energy and understood as a photoemission induced gating
effect. Our finding provides an effective tool to investigate the new physics
coming from the topological surface states and suggests the intercalation as a
recipe for synthesis of the material suitable for electronic applications.
