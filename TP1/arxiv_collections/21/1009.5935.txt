I review recent progress in lattice QCD at non-zero temperature whith
emphasis on the calculations of equation of state and the properties of heavy
quar anti-quark pairs at high temperatures. I also briefly discuss the
deconfinement and chiral symmetry restoring aspects of the QCD transition at
finite temperature
