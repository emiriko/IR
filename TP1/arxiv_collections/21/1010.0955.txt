The Aligned Two-Higgs-Doublet Model (A2HDM) describes a particular way of
enlarging the scalar sector of the Standard Model, with a second Higgs doublet
which is aligned to first the one in flavour space. This implies the absence of
flavour-changing neutral currents at tree level and the presence of three
complex parameters. Within this general approach, we analyze the charged Higgs
phenomenology, including CP asymmetries in the K and B systems.
