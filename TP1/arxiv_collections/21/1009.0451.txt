In this paper, we address the problem of creating believable agents (virtual
characters) in video games. We consider only one meaning of believability,
``giving the feeling of being controlled by a player'', and outline the problem
of its evaluation. We present several models for agents in games which can
produce believable behaviours, both from industry and research. For high level
of believability, learning and especially imitation learning seems to be the
way to go. We make a quick overview of different approaches to make video
games' agents learn from players. To conclude we propose a two-step method to
develop new models for believable agents. First we must find the criteria for
believability for our application and define an evaluation method. Then the
model and the learning algorithm can be designed.
