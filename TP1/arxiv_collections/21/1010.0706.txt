Recent gamma-ray observations of middle-aged supernova remnants revealed a
mysterious broken power-law spectrum. Using three-dimensional
magnetohydrodynamics simulations, we show that the interaction between a
supernova blast wave and interstellar clouds formed by thermal instability
generates multiple reflected shocks. The typical Mach numbers of the reflected
shocks are shown to be M ~ 2 depending on the density contrast between the
diffuse intercloud gas and clouds. These secondary shocks can further energize
cosmic-ray particles originally accelerated at the blast-wave shock. This
"two-step" acceleration scenario reproduces the observed gamma-ray spectrum and
predicts the high-energy spectral index ranging approximately from 3 to 4.
