The role of spin-orbit interaction, arises from the Dzyaloshinski-Moriya
anisotropic antisymmetric interaction, on the entanglement transfer via an
antiferromagnetic XXZ Heisenberg chain is investigated. From symmetrical point
of view, the XXZ Hamiltonian with Dzyaloshinski-Moriya interaction can be
replaced by a modified XXZ Hamiltonian which is defined by a new exchange
coupling constant and rotated Pauli operators. The modified coupling constant
and the angle of rotations are depend on the strength of Dzyaloshinski-Moriya
interaction. In this paper we study the dynamical behavior of the entanglement
propagation through a system which is consist of a pair of maximally entangled
spins coupled to one end of the chain. The calculations are performed for the
ground state and the thermal state of the chain, separately. In both cases the
presence of this anisotropic interaction make our channel more efficient, such
that the speed of transmission and the amount of the entanglement are improved
as this interaction is switched on. We show that for large values of the
strength of this interaction a large family of XXZ chains becomes efficient
quantum channels, for whole values of an isotropy parameter in the region $-2
\leq \Delta \leq 2$.
