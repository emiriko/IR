We analyze the dynamics of single photon transport in a single-mode waveguide
coupled to a micro-optical resonator using a fully quantum mechanical model. We
examine the propagation of a single-photon Gaussian packet through the system
under various coupling conditions. We review the theory of single photon
transport phenomena as applied to the system and we develop a discussion on the
numerical technique we used to solve for dynamical behavior of the quantized
field. To demonstrate our method and to establish robust single photon results,
we study the process of adiabatically lowering or raising the energy of a
single photon trapped in an optical resonator under active tuning of the
resonator. We show that our fully quantum mechanical approach reproduces the
semi-classical result in the appropriate limit and that the adiabatic invariant
has the same form in each case. Finally, we explore the trapping of a single
photon in a system of dynamically tuned, coupled optical cavities.
