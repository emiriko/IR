In the recent experiment by Cren \textit{et al.} [Phys. Rev. Lett.
\textbf{102}, 127005 (2009)], no hysteresis for vortex penetration and
expulsion from the nano-island of Pb was observed. In the present paper, we
argue that this effect can be associated with the thermoactivated surmounting
of the surface barrier by a vortex. The typical entrance (exit) time is found
analytically from the Fokker-Planck equation, written in the form suitable for
the extreme vortex confinement. We show that this time is several orders of
magnitude smaller than 1 second under the conditions of the experiment
considered. Our results thus demonstrate a possibility for the thermal
suppression of the surface barrier in nanosized low-$T_{c}$ superconductors. We
also briefly discuss other recent experiments on vortices in related
structures.
