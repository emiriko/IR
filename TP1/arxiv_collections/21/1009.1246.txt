Quantum anomalies, determined by the Atiyah-Singer index theorem, place
strong constraints on the space of quantum gravity theories in six dimensions
with minimal supersymmetry. The conjecture of "string universality" states that
all such theories which do not have anomalies or other quantum inconsistencies
are realized in string theory. This paper describes this conjecture and recent
work by Kumar, Morrison, and the author towards developing a global picture of
the space of consistent 6D supergravities and their realization in string
theory via F-theory constructions. We focus on the discrete data for each model
associated with the gauge symmetry group and the representation of this group
on matter fields. The 6D anomaly structure determines an integral lattice for
each gravity theory, which is related to the geometry of an elliptically
fibered Calabi-Yau three-fold in an F-theory construction. Possible exceptions
to the string universality conjecture suggest novel constraints on low-energy
gravity theories which may be identified from the structure of F-theory
geometry.
