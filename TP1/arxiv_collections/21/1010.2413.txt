We report the experimental observation of St\"{u}ckelberg oscillations of
matter waves in optical lattices. Extending previous work on Landau-Zener
tunneling of Bose-Einstein condensates in optical lattices, we study the
effects of the accumulated phase between two successive crossings of the
Brillouin zone edge. Our results agree well with a simple model for multiple
Landau-Zener tunneling events taking into account the band structure of the
optical lattice.
