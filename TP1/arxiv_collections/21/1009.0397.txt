To analyze complex phenomena which involve moving objects, Trajectory Data
Warehouse (TDW) seems to be an answer for many recent decision problems related
to various professions (physicians, commercial representatives, transporters,
ecologists ...) concerned with mobility. This work aims to make trajectories as
a first class concept in the trajectory data conceptual model and to design a
TDW, in which data resulting from mobile information collectors' trajectory are
gathered. These data will be analyzed, according to trajectory characteristics,
for decision making purposes, such as new products commercialization, new
commerce implementation, etc.
