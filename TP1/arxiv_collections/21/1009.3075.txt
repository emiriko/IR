We investigate the quantum dynamics of three different configurations of
nonlinear cavity systems. To begin, we carry out a quantum analysis of a dc
superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) mechanical displacement
detector comprised of a SQUID with a mechanically compliant loop segment. The
SQUID is approximated by a nonlinear current-dependent inductor, inducing a
flux tunable nonlinear Duffing term in the cavity equation of motion.
Expressions are derived for the detector signal and noise response where it is
found that a soft-spring Duffing self-interaction enables a closer approach to
the displacement detection standard quantum limit, as well as cooling closer to
the ground state. Next, we make use of a superconducting transmission line
formed from an array of dc-SQUIDs for investigating analogue Hawking radiation.
Biasing the array with a space-time varying flux modifies the propagation
velocity of the transmission line, leading to an effective metric with a
horizon. This setup allows for quantum effects such as backreaction and
analogue space-time fluctuations on the Hawking process. Finally, we look at a
quantum parametric amplifier with dynamical pump mode, viewed as a
zero-dimensional model of Hawking radiation from an evaporating black hole. The
conditions are derived under which the spectrum of particles generated from
vacuum fluctuations deviates from the thermal spectrum predicted for the
conventional parametric amplifier. We find that significant deviation occurs
once the pump mode (black hole) has released nearly half of its initial energy
in the signal (Hawking radiation) and idler (in-falling particle) modes. As a
model of black hole dynamics, this finding lends support to the view that
late-time Hawking radiation contains information about the quantum state of the
black hole and is entangled with the black hole's quantum gravitational degrees
of freedom.
