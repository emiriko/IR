Parton distributions in impact parameter space, which are obtained by Fourier
transforming GPDs, exhibit a significant deviation from axial symmetry when the
target and/or quark are transversely polarized. Connections between this
deformation and single-spin asymmetries as well as with quark-gluon
correlations are discussed. The information content of the DVCS amplitude at
fixed $Q^2$ can be condensed into GPDs along the `diagonal' $x=\xi$ plus D-form
factor.
