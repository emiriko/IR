We comprehensively study non-equilibrium relaxation and aging processes in
the two-dimensional random-site Ising model through numerical simulations. We
discuss the dynamical correlation length as well as scaling functions of
various two-times quantities as a function of temperature and of the degree of
dilution. For already modest values of the dynamical correlation length $L$
deviations from a simple algebraic growth, $L(t) \sim t^{1/z}$, are observed.
When taking this non-algebraic growth properly into account, a simple aging
behavior of the autocorrelation function is found. This is in stark contrast to
earlier studies where, based on the assumption of algebraic growth, a
superaging scenario was postulated for the autocorrelation function in
disordered ferromagnets. We also study the scaling behavior of the space-time
correlation as well as of the time integrated linear response and find again
agreement with simple aging. Finally, we briefly discuss the possibility of
superuniversality in the scaling properties of space- and time-dependent
quantities.
