Determination of whether the Harrison--Zel'dovich spectrum for primordial
scalar perturbations is consistent with observations is sensitive to
assumptions about the reionization scenario. In light of this result, we
revisit constraints on inflationary models using more general reionization
scenarios. While the bounds on the tensor-to-scalar ratio are largely
unmodified, when different reionization schemes are addressed, hybrid models
are back into the inflationary game. In the general reionization picture, we
reconstruct both the shape and amplitude of the inflaton potential. We find a
broader spectrum of potential shapes when relaxing the simple reionization
restriction. An upper limit of $10^{16}$ GeV to the amplitude of the potential
is found, regardless of the assumptions on the reionization history.
