The school choice problem concerns the design and implementation of matching
mechanisms that produce school assignments for students within a given public
school district. In this note we define a simple student-optimal criterion that
is not met by any previously employed mechanism in the school choice
literature. We then use this criterion to adapt a well-known combinatorial
optimization technique (Hungarian algorithm) to the school choice problem.
