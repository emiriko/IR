In this paper we consider Chameleonic Generalized Brans--Dicke Cosmology in
the framework of FRW universes. The bouncing solution and phantom crossing is
investigated for the model. Two independent cosmological tests: Cosmological
Redshift Drift (CRD) and distance modulus are applied to test the model with
the observation.
