The theory of radiatively driven winds successfully explains the key points
of the stellar winds of hot massive stars. However, there is an apparent
break-down of this paradigm at L/Lsun<5.2: the stellar wind momentum is smaller
than predicted for low luminosity early-type stars from metal poor
environments, and there are also some Galactic examples. In this work we
explore whether magnetic fields are playing a role.
