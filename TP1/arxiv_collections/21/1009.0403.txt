We present the orbital analysis of four response models, that succeed in
reproducing morphological features of NGC 1300. Two of them assume a planar
(2D) geometry with $\Omega_p$=22 and 16 \ksk respectively. The two others
assume a cylindrical (thick) disc and rotate with the same pattern speeds as
the 2D models. These response models reproduce most successfully main
morphological features of NGC 1300 among a large number of models, as became
evident in a previous study. Our main result is the discovery of three new
dynamical mechanisms that can support structures in a barred-spiral grand
design system. These mechanisms are presented in characteristic cases, where
these dynamical phenomena take place. They refer firstly to the support of a
strong bar, of ansae type, almost solely by chaotic orbits, then to the support
of spirals by chaotic orbits that for a certain number of pat tern revolutions
follow an n:1 (n=7,8) morphology, and finally to the support of spiral arms by
a combination of orbits trapped around L$_{4,5}$ and sticky chaotic orbits with
the same Jacobi constant. We have encountered these dynamical phenomena in a
large fraction of the cases we studied as we varied the parameters of our
general models, without forcing in some way their appearance. This suggests
that they could be responsible for the observed morphologies of many
barred-spiral galaxies. Comparing our response models among themselves we find
that the NGC 130 0 morphology is best described by a thick disc model for the
bar region and a 2D disc model for the spirals, with both components rotating
with the same pattern speed $\Omega_p$=16 \ksk !. In such a case, the whole
structure is included inside the corotation of the system. The bar is supported
mainly by regular orbits, while the spirals are supported by chaotic orbits.
