All-order spurion-corrected superpropagators and superfield Feynman rules are
employed to systematically compute a two-loop corrected effective potential for
the O'Raifeartaigh model, that realizes spontaneous supersymmetry breaking.
Though the shifted superpropagators are rather nontrivial, superspace
techniques may be suitably extended and confirm their efficacy in computing
radiative corrections even when supersymmetry breakdown occurs.
