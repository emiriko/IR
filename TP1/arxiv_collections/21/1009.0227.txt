We study the radiative emission of various types of solar features, such as
quiet Sun, enhanced network, plage, and bright plage regions, identified on
filtergrams taken in the Ca II K line. We analysed fulldisk images obtained
with the PSPT, by using three interference filters that sample the Ca II K line
with different bandpasses. We studied the dependence of the radiative emission
of disk features on the filter bandpass. We also performed a NLTE spectral
synthesis of the Ca II K line integrated over the bandpass of PSPT filters. The
synthesis was carried out by utilizing both the PRD and CRD with the most
recent set of semi empirical atmosphere models in the literature and some
earlier atmosphere models. We measured the CLV of intensity values for various
solar features identified on PSPT images and compared the results obtained with
those derived from the synthesis. We find that CRD calculations derived using
the most recent quiet Sun model, on average, reproduce the measured values of
the quiet Sun regions slightly more accurately than PRD computations with the
same model. This may reflect that the utilized atmospheric model was computed
assuming CRD. Calculations with PRD on earlier quiet Sun model atmospheres
reproduce measured quantities with a similar accuracy as to that achieved here
by applying CRD to the recent model. We also find that the median contrast
values measured for most of the identified bright features, disk positions, and
filter widths are, on average, a factor 1.9 lower than those derived from PRD
simulations performed using the recent bright feature models. The discrepancy
between measured and modeled values decreases by 12% after taking into account
straylight effects on PSPT images. PRD computations on either the most recent
or the earlier atmosphere models of bright features reproduce measurements from
plage and bright plage regions with a similar accuracy.
