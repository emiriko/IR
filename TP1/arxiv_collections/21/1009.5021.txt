Assume that a stochastic processes can be approximated, when some scale
parameter gets large, by a fluid limit (also called "mean field limit", or
"hydrodynamic limit"). A common practice, often called the "fixed point
approximation" consists in approximating the stationary behaviour of the
stochastic process by the stationary points of the fluid limit. It is known
that this may be incorrect in general, as the stationary behaviour of the fluid
limit may not be described by its stationary points. We show however that, if
the stochastic process is reversible, the fixed point approximation is indeed
valid. More precisely, we assume that the stochastic process converges to the
fluid limit in distribution (hence in probability) at every fixed point in
time. This assumption is very weak and holds for a large family of processes,
among which many mean field and other interaction models. We show that the
reversibility of the stochastic process implies that any limit point of its
stationary distribution is concentrated on stationary points of the fluid
limit. If the fluid limit has a unique stationary point, it is an approximation
of the stationary distribution of the stochastic process.
