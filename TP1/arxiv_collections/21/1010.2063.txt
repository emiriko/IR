We consider the radiation from an electron in flight over a surface wave of
an arbitrary profile excited in a plane interface. For an electron bunch the
conditions are specified under which the overall radiation essentially exceeds
the incoherent part. It is shown that the radiation from the bunch with
asymmetric density distribution of electrons in the longitudinal direction is
partially coherent for waves with wavelengths much shorter than the
characteristic longitudinal size of the bunch.
