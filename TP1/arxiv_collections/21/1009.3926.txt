In a thermally bistable medium, cold, dense gas is separated from warm,
rareified gas by thin phase transition layers, or fronts, in which heating,
radiative cooling, thermal conduction, and convection of material are balanced.
We calculate the steady-state structure of such fronts in the presence of
magnetic fields, including the processes of ion-neutral drift and ion-neutral
frictional heating. We find that ambipolar diffusion efficiently transports the
magnetic field across the fronts, leading to a flat magnetic field strength
profile. The thermal profiles of such fronts are not significantly different
from those of unmagnetized fronts. The near uniformity of the magnetic field
strength across a front is consistent with the flat field strength-gas density
relation that is observed in diffuse interstellar gas.
