We study the physics of a three-component Fermi gas in an optical lattice, in
the presence of a strong three-body constraint arising due to three-body loss.
Using analytical and numerical techniques, we show that an atomic color
superfluid phase is formed in this system and undergoes phase separation
between unpaired fermions and superfluid pairs. This phase separation survives
well above the critical temperature, giving a clear experimental signature of
the three-body constraint.
