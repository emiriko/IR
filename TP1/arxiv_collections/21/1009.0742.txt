In this article, we introduce the notion of cluster automorphism of a given
cluster algebra as a $\ZZ$-automorphism of the cluster algebra that sends a
cluster to another and commutes with mutations. We study the group of cluster
automorphisms in detail for acyclic cluster algebras and cluster algebras from
surfaces, and we compute this group explicitly for the Dynkin types and the
Euclidean types.
