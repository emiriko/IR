Twisting DNA under a constant applied force reveals a thermally activated
transition into a state with a supercoiled structure known as a plectoneme.
Using transition state theory, we predict the rate of this plectoneme
nucleation to be of order 10^4 Hz. We reconcile this with experiments that have
measured hopping rates of order 10 Hz by noting that the viscosity of the bead
used to manipulate the DNA limits the measured rate. We find that the intrinsic
bending caused by disorder in the base-pair sequence is important for
understanding the free energy barrier that governs the transition. Both
analytic and numerical methods are used in the calculations. We provide
extensive details on the numerical methods for simulating the elastic rod model
with and without disorder.
