We present evidence that the concurrent existence of two populations of
particles with different effective diameters is not a prerequisite for the
occurrence of anomalous phase behaviors in systems of particles interacting
through spherically-symmetric unbounded potentials. Our results show that an
extremely weak softening of the interparticle repulsion, yielding a single
nearest-neighbor separation, is able to originate a wide spectrum of
unconventional features including reentrant melting, solid polymorphism, as
well as thermodynamic, dynamic, and structural anomalies. These findings extend
the possibility of anomalous phase behavior to a class of systems much broader
than currently assumed.
