Copious production of very energetic jets is expected at the LHC due to the
large increase in collision energy. Jet reconstruction at these high center of
mass energies will provide crucial leverage to map out the QCD evolution of
parton energy loss and a unique insight into the nature of the hot QCD matter.
This article presents jet reconstruction techniques and the preliminary jet
results in p+p collisions at $\sqrt{s}=7$ TeV collected by the CMS experiment
at the LHC. Jet reconstruction prospects for the heavy ion collisions are also
discussed.
