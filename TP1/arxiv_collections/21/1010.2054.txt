We calculate the birefringent in the vacuum for light at the leading and
sub-leading orders for the CPT-even part of the SME. We report that all the LIV
coefficients absent in the leading order, but the isotropic one, contributes to
the sub-leading order birefringent. We consider models free of the first order
birefringent. We then show that infrared, optical, and ultraviolet
spectropolarimetry of cosmological sources bound the LIV coefficients to less
than $ 10^{-16}$. This improves the best current bound on the parity-odd
coefficients by two orders of magnitude and establishes the isotropy of the
one-way light speed with the precision of $41 \frac{nm}{s}$.
