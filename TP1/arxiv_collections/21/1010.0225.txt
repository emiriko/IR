We review the notion of perfect recall in the literature on interpreted
systems, game theory, and epistemic logic. In the context of Epistemic Temporal
Logic (ETL), we give a (to our knowledge) novel frame condition for perfect
recall, which is local and can straightforwardly be translated to a defining
formula in a language that only has next-step temporal operators. This frame
condition also gives rise to a complete axiomatization for S5 ETL frames with
perfect recall. We then consider how to extend and consolidate the notion of
perfect recall in sub-S5 settings, where the various notions discussed are no
longer equivalent.
