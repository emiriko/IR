The theory of diffusion in many-dimensional Hamiltonian system is applied to
asteroidal dynamics. The general formulations developed by Chirikov is applied
to the Nesvorn\'{y}-Morbidelli analytic model of three-body (three-orbit)
mean-motion resonances (Jupiter-Saturn-asteroid system). In particular, we
investigate the diffusion \emph{along} and \emph{across} the separatrices of
the (5,-2,-2) resonance of the (490) Veritas asteroidal family and their
relationship to diffusion in semi-major axis and eccentricity. The estimations
of diffusion were obtained using the Melnikov integral, a Hadjidemetriou-type
sympletic map and numerical integrations for times up to $10^{8}$ years.
