Cryptanalysis is an important branch in the study of cryptography, including
both the classical cryptography and the quantum one. In this paper we analyze
the security of two three-party quantum key distribution protocols (QKDPs)
proposed recently, and point out that they are susceptible to a simple and
effective attack, i.e. the dense-coding attack. It is shown that the
eavesdropper Eve can totally obtain the session key by sending entangled qubits
as the fake signal to Alice and performing collective measurements after
Alice's encoding. The attack process is just like a dense-coding communication
between Eve and Alice, where a special measurement basis is employed.
Furthermore, this attack does not introduce any errors to the transmitted
information and consequently will not be discovered by Alice and Bob. The
attack strategy is described in detail and a proof for its correctness is
given. At last, the root of this insecurity and a possible way to improve these
protocols are discussed.
