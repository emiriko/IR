By means of lattice-based Monte Carlo simulations, we address properties of
two-component lipid membranes on the experimentally relevant spatial scales of
order of a micrometer and time intervals of order of a second, using DMPC/DSPC
lipid mixtures as a model system. Our large-scale simulations allowed us to
obtain important results previously not reported in simulation studies of lipid
membranes. We find that, within a certain range of lipid compositions, the
phase transition from the fluid phase to the fluid-gel phase coexistence
proceeds via near-critical fluctuations, while for other lipid compositions
this phase transition has a quasi-abrupt character. In the presence of
near-critical fluctuations, transient subdiffusion of lipid molecules is
observed. These features of the system are stable with respect to perturbations
in lipid interaction parameters used in our simulations. The line tension
characterizing lipid domains in the fluid-gel coexistence region is found to be
in the pN range. When approaching the critical point, the line tension, the
inverse correlation length of fluid-gel spatial fluctuations, and the
corresponding inverse order parameter susceptibility of the membrane vanish.
All these results are in agreement with recent experimental findings for model
lipid membranes. Our analysis of the domain coarsening dynamics after an abrupt
quench of the membrane to the fluid-gel coexistence region reveals that lateral
diffusion of lipids plays an important role in the fluid-gel phase separation
process.
