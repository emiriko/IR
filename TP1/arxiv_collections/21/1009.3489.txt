We extend the study of Kapitza-Dirac diffraction to the case of two-particle
systems. Due to the exchange effects the shape and visibility of the
two-particle detection patterns show important differences for identical and
distinguishable particles. We also identify a novel quantum statistics effect
present in momentum space for some values of the initial particle momenta,
which is associated with different numbers of photon absorptions compatible
with the final momenta.
