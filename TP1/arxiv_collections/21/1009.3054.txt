We present results for a multichannel tunneling model that describes
point-contact spectra between a metallic tip and a superconducting
heavy-fermion system. We calculate tunneling spectra both in the normal and
superconducting state. In point-contact and scanning tunneling spectroscopy
many heavy-fermion materials, like CeCoIn5, exhibit an asymmetric differential
conductance, dI/dV, combined with a strongly suppressed Andreev reflection
signal in the superconducting state. For Andreev reflection to occur a junction
has to be in the highly transparent limit. Here we focus on the opposite limit,
namely that of low transparency leading to BCS-like dI/dV curves. We discuss
the consequences of a multichannel tunneling model for CeCoIn5 assuming
itinerant electron bands and localized f electrons.
