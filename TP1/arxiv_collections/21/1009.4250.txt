Entanglement is the essential quantum resource for a potential speed-up of
information processing, as well as for sophisticated quantum communication.
Quantum information networks will be required to convey information from one
place to another, by using entangled light beams. Many physical systems are
under consideration as building blocks, with different merits and faults, so
that hybrid systems are likely to be developed. Here we present an important
tool for connecting systems that share no common resonance frequencies: we
demonstrate the first direct generation of entanglement among more than two
bright beams of light, all of different wavelengths (532.251 nm, 1062.102 nm,
and 1066.915 nm). We also observe, for the first time, disentanglement for
finite channel losses, the continuous variable counterpart to entanglement
sudden death.
