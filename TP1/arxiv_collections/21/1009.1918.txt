We examine the zero-range limit of the finite square well in arbitrary
dimensions through a systematic analysis of the reduced, s-wave two-body
time-independent Schr\"odinger equation. A natural consequence of our
investigation is the requirement of a delta-function multiplied by a
regularization operator to model the zero-range limit of the finite-square well
when the dimensionality is greater than one. The case of two dimensions turns
out to be surprisingly subtle, and needs to be treated separately from all
other dimensions.
