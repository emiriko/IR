High resolution magnetization measurements performed in a high quality
Ba_(1-x)K_xFe2As2 single crystal allowed to determine the diamagnetism induced
above the superconducting transition by thermally activated Cooper pairs. These
data, obtained with magnetic fields applied along and transverse to the crystal
ab layers, demonstrate experimentally that the superconducting transition of
iron pnictides may be explained at a phenomenological level in terms of the
Gaussian Ginzburg-Landau approach for three-dimensional anisotropic
superconductors.
