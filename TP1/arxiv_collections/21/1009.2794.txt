LF has been designed and successfully used as a meta-logical framework to
represent and reason about object logics. Here we design a representation of
the Isabelle logical framework in LF using the recently introduced module
system for LF. The major novelty of our approach is that we can naturally
represent the advanced Isabelle features of type classes and locales.
  Our representation of type classes relies on a feature so far lacking in the
LF module system: morphism variables and abstraction over them. While
conservative over the present system in terms of expressivity, this feature is
needed for a representation of type classes that preserves the modular
structure. Therefore, we also design the necessary extension of the LF module
system.
