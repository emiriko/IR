We present a systematic study of the existence and stability of discrete
breathers that are spatially localized in the bulk of a one-dimensional chain
of compressed elastic beads that interact via Hertzian contact. The chain is
diatomic, consisting of a periodic arrangement of heavy and light spherical
particles. We examine two families of discrete gap breathers: (1) an unstable
discrete gap breather that is centered on a heavy particle and characterized by
a symmetric spatial energy profile and (2) a potentially stable discrete gap
breather that is centered on a light particle and is characterized by an
asymmetric spatial energy profile. We investigate their existence, structure,
and stability throughout the band gap of the linear spectrum and classify them
into four regimes: a regime near the lower optical band edge of the linear
spectrum, a moderately discrete regime, a strongly discrete regime that lies
deep within the band gap of the linearized version of the system, and a regime
near the upper acoustic band edge. We contrast discrete breathers in anharmonic
FPU-type diatomic chains with those in diatomic granular crystals, which have a
tensionless interaction potential between adjacent particles, and highlight in
that the asymmetric nature of the latter interaction potential may lead to a
form of hybrid bulk-surface localized solutions.
