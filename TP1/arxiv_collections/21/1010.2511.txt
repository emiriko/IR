We present a machine learning approach to static code analysis and
fingerprinting for weaknesses related to security, software engineering, and
others using the open-source MARF framework and the MARFCAT application based
on it for the NIST's SATE2010 static analysis tool exposition workshop found at
http://samate.nist.gov/SATE2010Workshop.html
