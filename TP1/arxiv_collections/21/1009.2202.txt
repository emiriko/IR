We discuss, from a theoretical point of view, the four wave mixing
spectroscopy on an ensemble of p-doped quantum dots in a magnetic field
slightly tilted from the in-plane configuration. We describe the system
evolution in the density matrix formalism. In the limit of coherent ultrafast
optical driving, we obtain analytical formulas for the single system dynamics
and for the response of an inhomogeneously broadened ensemble. The results are
compared to the previously studied time-resolved Kerr rotation spectroscopy on
the same system. We show that the Kerr rotation and four wave mixing spectra
yield complementary information on the spin dynamics (precession and damping).
