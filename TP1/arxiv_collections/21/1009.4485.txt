In this report we present the Type II and IV radio bursts observed and
analyzed by the radio spectrograph ARTEMIS IV1, in the 650-20MHz frequency
range, during the active period October-November 2003. These bursts exhibit
very rich fine structures such fibers, pulsations and zebra patterns which is
associated with certain characteristics of the associated solar flares and
CMEs.
