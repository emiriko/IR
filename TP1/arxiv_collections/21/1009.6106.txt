A Scintillator Deposited CCD (SDCCD) is a wide-band X-ray detector consisting
of a CCD and a scintillator directly attached to each other. We assembled the
newly developed SDCCD that the scintillator CsI(Tl) is below the fully depleted
CCD. The incident X-rays enter the CCD depletion layer first. Then, X-rays
passing through the depletion layer are absorbed in the CsI(Tl). The contact
surface of the CCD is a back-illuminated side so that we can have good light
collection efficiency. In our experimental setup, we confirmed good performance
of our SDCCD detecting many emission lines up to 88\,keV that comes from
$^{109}$Cd.
