This work is devoted to the study of the problem of user-level capture and
restoration of running computations in heterogeneous environments. Support for
those operations has traditionally been offered through ready-made solutions
for specific applications, which are difficult to tailor or adapt to different
needs. We believe that a more promising approach would be to build specific
solutions as needed, over a more general framework for capture and restoration.
In this work, in order to explore the basic mechanisms a language should
provide to support the implementation of different policies, we extend the Lua
programming language with an API that allows the programmer to reify the
internal structures of execution into fine-grained language values.
