Whereas classical multi-agent systems have the agent in center, there have
recently been a development towards focusing more on the organization of the
system. This allows the designer to focus on what the system goals are, without
considering how the goals should be fulfilled. This paper investigates whether
taking this approach has any clear advantages to the classical way of
implementing multi-agent systems. The investigation is done by implementing
each type of system in the same environment in order to realize what advantages
and disadvantages each approach has.
