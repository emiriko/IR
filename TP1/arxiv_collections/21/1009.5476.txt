Experimental studies established that calcium undergoes several
counterintuitive transitions under pressure: fcc \rightarrow bcc \rightarrow
simple cubic \rightarrow Ca-IV \rightarrow Ca-V, and becomes a good
superconductor in the simple cubic and higher-pressure phases. Here, using ab
initio evolutionary simulations, we explore the behavior of Ca under pressure
and find a number of new phases. Our structural sequence differs from the
traditional picture for Ca, but is similar to that for Sr. The {\beta}-tin
(I41/amd) structure, rather than simple cubic, is predicted to be the
theoretical ground state at 0 K and 33-71 GPa. This structure can be
represented as a large distortion of the simple cubic structure, just as the
higher-pressure phases stable between 71 and 134 GPa. The structure of Ca-V,
stable above 134 GPa, is a complex host-guest structure. According to our
calculations, the predicted phases are superconductors with Tc increasing under
pressure and reaching ~20 K at 120 GPa, in good agreement with experiment.
