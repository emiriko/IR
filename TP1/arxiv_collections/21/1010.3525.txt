Scientometrics is the field of quantitative studies of scholarly activity. It
has been used for systematic studies of the fundamentals of scholarly practice
as well as for evaluation purposes. Although advocated from the very beginning
the use of scientometrics as an additional method for science history is still
under explored. In this paper we show how a scientometric analysis can be used
to shed light on the reception history of certain outstanding scholars. As a
case, we look into citation patterns of a specific paper by the American
sociologist Robert K. Merton.
