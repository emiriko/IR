Distributed embedded systems (DESs) are no longer the exception; they are the
rule in many application areas such as avionics, the automotive industry,
traffic systems, sensor networks, and medical devices. Formal DES specification
and verification is challenging due to state space explosion and the need to
support real-time features. This paper reports on an extensive industry-based
case study involving a DES product family for a pedestrian and car 4-way
traffic intersection in which autonomous devices communicate by asynchronous
message passing without a centralized controller. All the safety requirements
and a liveness requirement informally specified in the requirements document
have been formally verified using Real-Time Maude and its model checking
features.
