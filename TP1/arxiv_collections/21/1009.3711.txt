Web applications suffer from cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks that
resulting from incomplete or incorrect input sanitization. Learning the
structure of attack vectors could enrich the variety of manifestations in
generated XSS attacks. In this study, we focus on generating more threatening
XSS attacks for the state-of-the-art detection approaches that can find
potential XSS vulnerabilities in Web applications, and propose a mechanism for
structural learning of attack vectors with the aim of generating mutated XSS
attacks in a fully automatic way. Mutated XSS attack generation depends on the
analysis of attack vectors and the structural learning mechanism. For the
kernel of the learning mechanism, we use a Hidden Markov model (HMM) as the
structure of the attack vector model to capture the implicit manner of the
attack vector, and this manner is benefited from the syntax meanings that are
labeled by the proposed tokenizing mechanism. Bayes theorem is used to
determine the number of hidden states in the model for generalizing the
structure model. The paper has the contributions as following: (1)
automatically learn the structure of attack vectors from practical data
analysis to modeling a structure model of attack vectors, (2) mimic the manners
and the elements of attack vectors to extend the ability of testing tool for
identifying XSS vulnerabilities, (3) be helpful to verify the flaws of
blacklist sanitization procedures of Web applications. We evaluated the
proposed mechanism by Burp Intruder with a dataset collected from public XSS
archives. The results show that mutated XSS attack generation can identify
potential vulnerabilities.
