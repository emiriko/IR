In the present work, the use of a commercial ionic liquid as a convenient
solvent medium for graphite exfoliation in mild and easy conditions without any
chemical modification is presented. To confirm the presence of few layer
graphene, its dispersion was charachterized by Raman spectroscopy, atomic force
miscroscopy and field emission electron microscopy. From the UV-Vis
characterization, a graphene concentration as high as 2.543 mg/ml was obtained,
which is the highest value reported so far in any solvent.
