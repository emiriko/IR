The electron and nuclear spins of the shallow donor 31P are promising qubit
candidates invoked in many proposed Si-based quantum computing schemes. We have
recently shown that the near-elimination of inhomogeneous broadening in highly
isotopically enriched 28Si enables an optical readout of both the donor
electron and nuclear spins by resolving the donor hyperfine splitting in the
near-gap donor bound exciton transitions. We have also shown that pumping these
same transitions can very quickly produce large electron and nuclear
hyperpolarizations at low magnetic fields, where the equilibrium electron and
nuclear polarizations are very small. Here we show preliminary results of the
measurement of 31P neutral donor NMR parameters using this optical nuclear
hyperpolarization mechanism for preparation of the 31P nuclear spin system,
followed by optical readout of the resulting nuclear spin population after
manipulation with NMR pulse sequences. This allows for the observation of
single-shot NMR signals with very high signal to noise ratio under conditions
where conventional NMR is not possible, due to the low concentration of 31P and
the small equilibrium polarization.
