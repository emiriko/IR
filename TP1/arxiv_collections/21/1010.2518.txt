Elements heavier than hydrogen or helium that are present in the atmospheres
of white dwarfs with effective temperatures lower than 25,000 K, are believed
to be the result of accretion. By measuring the abundances of these elements
and by assuming a steady-state accretion, we can derive the composition of the
accreted matter and infer its source. The presence of radiative levitation,
however, may affect the determination of the accretion rate. We present
time-dependent diffusion calculations that take into account radiative
levitation and accretion. The calculations are performed on C, N, O, Ne, Na,
Mg, Al, Si, S, Ar, and Ca in hydrogen-rich white dwarf models with effective
temperatures lower than 25,000 K and a gravity of log g = 8.0. We show that in
the presence of accretion, the abundance of an element supported by the
radiative levitation is given by the equilibrium between the radiative and
gravitational accelerations, unless the abundance predicted by the steady-state
accretion is much greater than the abundance supported by the radiative
acceleration.
