We investigate the persistence properties of critical d-dimensional systems
relaxing from an initial state with non-vanishing order parameter (e.g., the
magnetization in the Ising model), focusing on the dynamics of the global order
parameter of a d'-dimensional manifold. The persistence probability P(t) shows
three distinct long-time decays depending on the value of the parameter \zeta =
(D-2+\eta)/z which also controls the relaxation of the persistence probability
in the case of a disordered initial state (vanishing order parameter) as a
function of the codimension D = d-d' and of the critical exponents z and \eta.
We find that the asymptotic behavior of P(t) is exponential for \zeta > 1,
stretched exponential for 0 <= \zeta <= 1, and algebraic for \zeta < 0. Whereas
the exponential and stretched exponential relaxations are not affected by the
initial value of the order parameter, we predict and observe a crossover
between two different power-law decays when the algebraic relaxation occurs, as
in the case d'=d of the global order parameter. We confirm via Monte Carlo
simulations our analytical predictions by studying the magnetization of a line
and of a plane of the two- and three-dimensional Ising model, respectively,
with Glauber dynamics. The measured exponents of the ultimate algebraic decays
are in a rather good agreement with our analytical predictions for the Ising
universality class. In spite of this agreement, the expected scaling behavior
of the persistence probability as a function of time and of the initial value
of the order parameter remains problematic. In this context, the
non-equilibrium dynamics of the O(n) model in the limit n->\infty and its
subtle connection with the spherical model is also discussed in detail.
