Computer hardware costs are the limiting factor in producing highly accurate
radiation dose calculations on convenient time scales. Because of this,
large-scale, full Monte Carlo simulations and other resource intensive
algorithms are often considered infeasible for clinical settings. The emerging
cloud computing paradigm promises to fundamentally alter the economics of such
calculations by providing relatively cheap, on-demand, pay-as-you-go computing
resources over the Internet. We believe that cloud computing will usher in a
new era, in which very large scale calculations will be routinely performed by
clinics and researchers using cloud-based resources. In this research, several
proof-of-concept radiation therapy calculations were successfully performed on
a cloud-based virtual Monte Carlo cluster. Performance evaluations were made of
a distributed processing framework developed specifically for this project. The
expected 1/n performance was observed with some caveats. The economics of
cloud-based virtual computing clusters versus traditional in-house hardware is
also discussed. For most situations, cloud computing can provide a substantial
cost savings for distributed calculations.
