The structural, electronic and optical properties of Si nanocrystals of
different size and shape, passivated with hydrogens, OH groups, or embedded in
a SiO2 matrix are studied. The comparison between the embedded and free,
suspended nanocrystals shows that the silica matrix produces a strain on the
embedded NCs, that contributes to determine the band gap value. By including
the strain on the hydroxided nanocrystals we are able to reproduce the
electronic and optical properties of the full Si/SiO2 systems. Moreover we
found that, while the quantum confinement dominates in the hydrogenated
nanocrystals of all sizes, the behaviour of hydroxided and embedded
nanocrystals strongly depends on the interface oxidation degree, in particular
for diameters below 2 nm. Here, the proportion of NC atoms at the Si/SiO2
interface becomes relevant, producing surface-related states that may affect
the quantum confinement appearing as inner band gap states and then drastically
changing the optical response of the system.
