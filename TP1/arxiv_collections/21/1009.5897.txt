We operate an on-demand source of single electrons in high perpendicular
magnetic fields up to 30T, corresponding to a filling factor below 1/3. The
device extracts and emits single charges at a tunable energy from and to a
two-dimensional electron gas, brought into well defined integer and fractional
quantum Hall (QH) states. It can therefore be used for sensitive electrical
transport studies, e.g. of excitations and relaxation processes in QH edge
states.
