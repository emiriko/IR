We have carried out an H-alpha flux measurement for 52 nearby galaxies as
part of a general H-alpha imaging survey for the Local Volume sample of
galaxies within 10 Mpc. Most of the objects are probable members of the groups
around Maffei 2/IC 342, NGC 672/IC 1727, NGC 784, and the Orion galaxy. The
measured H-alpha fluxes corrected for extinction are used to derive the galaxy
star formation rate (SFR). We briefly discuss some basic scaling relations
between SFR, hydrogen mass and absolute magnitude of the Local Volume galaxies.
The total SFR density in the local (z = 0) universe is estimated to be
(0.019+/-0.003) M_sun yr/Mpc^3.
