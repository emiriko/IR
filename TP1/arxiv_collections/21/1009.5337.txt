Generalized linear statistics are an unifying class that contains
U-statistics, U-quantiles, L-statistics as well as trimmed and winsorized
U-statistics. For example, many commonly used estimators of scale fall into
this class. GL-statistics only have been studied under independence; in this
paper, we develop an asymptotic theory for GL-statistics of sequences which are
strongly mixing or L^1 near epoch dependent on an absolutely regular process.
For this purpose, we prove an almost sure approximation of the empirical
U-process by a Gaussian process. With the help of a generalized Bahadur
representation, it follows that such a strong invariance principle also holds
for the empirical U-quantile process and consequently for GL-statistics. We
obtain central limit theorems and laws of the iterated logarithm for
U-processes, U-quantile processes and GL-statistics as straightforward
corollaries.
