Given $E \subset \mathbb{R}^d$, $d \ge 2$, define ${\mathcal D}(E) \equiv
{(x-y)/|x-y|: x,y \in E} \subset S^{d-1},$ the set of directions determined by
$E$. We prove that if the Hausdorff dimension of $E$ is greater than $d-1$,
then $\sigma({\mathcal D}(E))>0$, where $\sigma$ denotes the surface measure on
$S^{d-1}$. This result is sharp since the conclusion fails to hold if $E$ is a
$(d-1)$-dimensional hyper-plane. This result can be viewed as a continuous
analog of a recent result of Pach, Pinchasi, and Sharir (\cite{PPS04},
\cite{PPS07}) on angles determined by finite subsets of $\mathbb{R}^d$. Also
define ${\mathcal A}(E)=\{\theta(x,y,z): x,y,z \in E\},$ where $\theta(x,y,z)$
is the angle between $x-y$ and $y-z$. We use the techniques developed to handle
the problem of directions and results on distance sets previously obtained by
Wolff and Erdogan to prove that if the Hasudorff dimension of $E$ is greater
than $(d-1)/2+1/3$, then the Lebesgue measure of ${\mathcal A}(E)$ is positive.
This result can be viewed as a continuous analog of a recent result of
Apfelbaum and Sharir (\cite{AS05}).
  At the end of this paper we show that our continuous results can be used to
recover and in some case improve the exponents for the corresponding results in
the discrete setting for large classes of finite point sets. In particular, we
prove that a finite point set $P \subset {\Bbb R}^d$, $d \ge 3$, satisfying a
certain discrete energy condition (Definition \ref{adaptablemama}), determines
$\gtrapprox # P$ distinct directions and $\gtrapprox {(# P)}^{6/(3d-1)}$
distinct angles. In two dimensions, the lower bound on the number of angles is
$\gtrapprox # P$.
