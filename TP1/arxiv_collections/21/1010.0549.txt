The evolution of electromagnetic and Dirac perturbations in the spacetime
geometry of Kehagias-Sfetsos(KS) black hole in the deformed Horava-Lifshitz(HL)
gravity is investigated and the associated quasinormal modes are evaluated
using time domain integration and WKB methods. We find a considerable deviation
in the nature of field evolution in HL theory from that in the Schwarzschild
spacetime and QNMs region extends over a longer time in HL theory before the
power-law tail decay begins. The dependence of the field evolution on the HL
parameter $\alpha$ are studied. In the time domain picture we find that the
length of QNM region increases with $\alpha$. But the late time decay of field
follows the same power-law tail behavior as in the case of Schwarzschild black
hole.
