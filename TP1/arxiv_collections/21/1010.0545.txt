We derive system of equations describing fluidity of the medium consisting of
non-relativistic particles with finite mass-widths. For that we use expressions
for the kinetic Noether 4-current and the Noether energy-momentum tensor being
conserved provided one uses self-consistent approximations to the gradient
expanded Kadanoff-Baym equations. Kinetic coefficients entering equations of
non-ideal hydrodynamics of resonances are obtained in terms of the real and
imaginary parts of the self-energies within a relaxation time approximation.
