Thorough analysis of the multicolour CCD observations of the RRab-type
variable, CZ Lacertae is presented. The observations were carried out in two
consecutive observing seasons in 2004 and 2005 within the framework of the
Konkoly Blazhko Survey of bright, northern, short-period RRab variables. The
O-C variation of CZ Lac indicated that a significant period decrease took place
just around the time of the CCD observations. Our data gave a unique
opportunity to study the related changes in the pulsation and modulation
properties of a Blazhko star in detail. Two different period components
($\approx$14.6 d and $\approx$18.6 d) of the Blazhko modulation were
identified. Both modulation components had similar strength. The periods and
amplitudes of the modulations changed significantly from the first season to
the next, meanwhile, the mean pulsation amplitude slightly decreased. The
modulation frequencies were in a 5:4 resonance ratio in the first observing
season then the frequencies shifted in opposite directions, and their ratio was
close to the 4:3 resonance in the next season. The interaction of the two
modulations caused beating with a period of 74~d in the first season, which
resembled the 4-yr-long cycle of the $\approx$40-d modulation of RR Lyr. The
mean values of the global physical parameters and their changes with Blazhko
phase of both modulation components were determined by the Inverse Photometric
Method.
