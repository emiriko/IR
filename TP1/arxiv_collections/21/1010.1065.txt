We report on twenty-three clusters detected blindly as Sunyaev-Zel'dovich
(SZ) decrements in a 148 GHz, 455 square-degree map of the southern sky made
with data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope 2008 observing season. All SZ
detections announced in this work have confirmed optical counterparts. Ten of
the clusters are new discoveries. One newly discovered cluster, ACT-CL
J0102-4915, with a redshift of 0.75 (photometric), has an SZ decrement
comparable to the most massive systems at lower redshifts. Simulations of the
cluster recovery method reproduce the sample purity measured by optical
follow-up. In particular, for clusters detected with a signal-to-noise ratio
greater than six, simulations are consistent with optical follow-up that
demonstrated this subsample is 100% pure. The simulations further imply that
the total sample is 80% complete for clusters with mass in excess of 6x10^14
solar masses referenced to the cluster volume characterized by five hundred
times the critical density. The Compton y -- X-ray luminosity mass comparison
for the eleven best detected clusters visually agrees with both self-similar
and non-adiabatic, simulation-derived scaling laws.
