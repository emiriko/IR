Establishing an universal method to measure the organization of an universal
system, will allow us to understand the mechanisms of functioning and
organizing in general and enable us to design systems which will posses highest
level of perfection. Attempts to measure organization have been done using
information and entropy. The least action principle which is the basis of all
branches of physics has been applied to a biotechnical system, ecosystem,
chemical system and reliability theory to explain their functioning. Here we
show that the amount of organization is inversely proportional to the physical
amount of action in a system. We show the derivation of the expression for
organization and apply it in a simple case. The significance of this result is
that it will empower all of the natural and social sciences to quantify the
organization in the systems that they are studying when it is applied to them.
