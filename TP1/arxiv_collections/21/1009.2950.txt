The first direct measurement of the proton separation energy, Sp, for the
proton-unbound nucleus 69Br is reported. Of interest is the exponential
dependence of the 2p-capture rate on Sp which can bypass the 68Se waiting-point
in the astrophysical rp process. An analysis of the observed proton decay
spectrum is given in terms of the 69Se mirror nucleus and the influence of Sp
is explored within the context of a single-zone X-ray burst model.
