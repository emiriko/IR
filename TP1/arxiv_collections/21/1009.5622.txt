We report an approach to quantum open system dynamics that leads to novel
nonlinear constant relations governing information flow among the participants.
Our treatment is for mixed state systems entangled in a pure state fashion with
an unspecified party that was involved in preparing the system for an
experimental test, but no longer interacts after $t=0$. Evolution due to
subsequent interaction with another party is treated as an amplitude flow
channel and uses Schmidt-type bipartite decomposition of the evolving state. We
illustrate this with three examples, including both reversible and irreversible
information flows, and give formulas for the new nonlinear constraints in each
case.
