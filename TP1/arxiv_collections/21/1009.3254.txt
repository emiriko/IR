Kowalski & Saumon (2006) identified the missing absorption mechanism in the
observed spectra of cool white dwarf stars as the Ly-alpha red wing formed by
the collisions between atomic and molecular hydrogen and successfully explained
entire spectra of many cool DA-type white dwarfs. Owing to the important
astrophysical implications of this issue, we present here an independent
assessment of the process. For this purpose, we compute free-free
quasi-molecular absorption in Lyman-alpha due to collisions with H and H2
within the one-perturber, quasi-static approximation. Line cross-sections are
obtained using theoretical molecular potentials to describe the interaction
between the radiating atom and the perturber. The variation of the
electric-dipole transition moment with the interparticle distance is also
considered. Six and two allowed electric dipole transitions due to H-H and H-H2
collisions, respectively, are taken into account. The new theoretical
Lyman-alpha line profiles are then incorporated in our stellar atmosphere
program for the computation of synthetic spectra and colours of DA-type white
dwarfs. Illustrative model atmospheres and spectral energy distributions are
computed, which show that Ly-alpha broadening by atoms and molecules has a
significant effect on the white dwarf atmosphere models. The inclusion of this
collision-induced opacity significantly reddens spectral energy distributions
and affects the broadband colour indices for model atmospheres with Teff<5000
K. These results confirm those previously obtained by Kowalski & Saumon (2006).
Our study points out the need for reliable evaluations of H3 potential energy
surfaces covering a large region of nuclear configurations, in order to obtain
a better description of H-H2 collisions and a more accurate evaluation of their
influence on the spectrum of cool white dwarfs.
