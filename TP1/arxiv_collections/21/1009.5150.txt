The results of a coordinated space-based photometric and ground-based
spectroscopic observing campaign on the enigmatic gamma-ray binary LS 5039 are
reported. Sixteen days of observations from the MOST satellite have been
combined with high-resolution optical echelle spectroscopy from the 2.3m ANU
Telescope in Siding Spring, Australia. These observations were used to measure
the orbital parameters of the binary and to study the properties of stellar
wind from the O primary. We found that any broad-band optical photometric
variability at the orbital period is below the 2 mmag level, supporting the
scenario that the orbital eccentricity of the system is near the 0.24 +/- 0.08
value implied by our spectroscopy, which is lower than values previously
obtained by other workers. The low amplitude optical variability also implies
the component masses are at the higher end of estimates based on the primary's
O6.5V((f)) spectral type with a primary mass of ~26 solar masses and a mass for
the compact star of at least 1.8 solar masses. The mass loss rate from the O
primary was determined to be 3.7E-7 to 4.8E-7 solar masses per year.
