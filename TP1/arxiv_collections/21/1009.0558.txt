This paper proposes a robust control method based on sliding mode design for
two-level quantum systems with bounded uncertainties. An eigenstate of the
two-level quantum system is identified as a sliding mode. The objective is to
design a control law to steer the system's state into the sliding mode domain
and then maintain it in that domain when bounded uncertainties exist in the
system Hamiltonian. We propose a controller design method using the Lyapunov
methodology and periodic projective measurements. In particular, we give
conditions for designing such a control law, which can guarantee the desired
robustness in the presence of the uncertainties. The sliding mode control
method has potential applications to quantum information processing with
uncertainties.
