The Skyrme force parameters can be uniquely determined by coarse graining the
NN interactions at a characteristic momentum scale. We show how exact Vlowk
potentials to second order in momenta are accurately and universally saturated
with physical NN scattering threshold parameters at CM momentum scales of about
Lambda=250 MeV for the S-waves and Lambda=100 MeV for the P-waves. The pattern
of Wigner and Serber symmetries unveiled previously is also saturated at these
scales.
