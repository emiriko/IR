We address the feasibility of imaging geometric and orbital structure of a
polyatomic molecule on an attosecond time-scale using the laser induced
electron diffraction (LIED) technique. We present numerical results for the
highest molecular orbitals of the CO2 molecule excited by a near infrared
few-cycle laser pulse. The molecular geometry (bond-lengths) is determined
within 3% of accuracy from a diffraction pattern which also reflects the nodal
properties of the initial molecular orbital. Robustness of the structure
determination is discussed with respect to vibrational and rotational motions
with a complete interpretation of the laser-induced mechanisms.
