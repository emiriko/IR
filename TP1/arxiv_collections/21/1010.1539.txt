It is a well established empirical fact that the surface density of the star
formation rate, Sigma_SFR, strongly correlates with the surface density of
molecular hydrogen, Sigma_H2, at least when averaged over large (~kpc) scales.
Much less is known, however, if (and how) the Sigma_SFR-Sigma_H2 relation
depends on environmental parameters, such as the metallicity or the UV
radiation field in the interstellar medium (ISM). Furthermore, observations
indicate that the scatter in the Sigma_SFR-Sigma_H2 relation increases rapidly
with decreasing averaging scale. How the scale-dependent scatter is generated
and how one recovers a tight ~ kpc scale Sigma_SFR-Sigma_H2 relation in the
first place is still largely debated. Here, these questions are explored with
hydrodynamical simulations that follow the formation and destruction of H2,
include radiative transfer of UV radiation, and resolve the ISM on ~60 pc
scales. We find that within the considered range of H2 surface densities
(10-100 Msun/pc^2) the Sigma_SFR-Sigma_H2 relation is steeper in environments
of low metallicity and/or high radiation fields (compared to the Galaxy), that
the star formation rate at a given H2 surface density is larger, and the
scatter is increased. Deviations from a "universal" Sigma_SFR-Sigma_H2 relation
should be particularly relevant for high redshift galaxies or for
low-metallicity dwarfs at z~0. We also find that the use of time-averaged SFRs
produces a large, scale dependent scatter in the Sigma_SFR-Sigma_H2 relation.
Given the plethora of observational data expected from upcoming surveys such as
ALMA the scale-scatter relation may indeed become a valuable tool for
determining the physical mechanisms connecting star formation and H2 formation.
