In this article we describe a general optomechanical system for converting
photons to phonons in an efficient, and reversible manner. We analyze
classically and quantum mechanically the conversion process and proceed to a
more concrete description of a phonon-photon translator formed from coupled
photonic and phononic crystal planar circuits. Applications of the
phonon-photon translator to RF-microwave photonics and circuit QED, including
proposals utilizing this system for optical wavelength conversion, long-lived
quantum memory and state transfer from optical to superconducting qubits are
considered.
