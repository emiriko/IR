We calculate thermodynamical properties of the Hofstadter model using a
recently developed quantum transfer matrix method. We find intrinsic
oscillation features in specific heat that manifest the fractal structure of
the Hofstadter butterfly. We also propose experimental approaches which use
specific heat as an access to detect the Hofstadter butterfly.
