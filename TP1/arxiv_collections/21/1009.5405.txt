Existence of the fourth family follows from the basics of the Standard Model
and the actual mass spectrum of the third family fermions. We discuss possible
manifestations of the fourth SM family at existing and future colliders. The
LHC and Tevatron potentials to discover the fourth SM family have been
compared. The scenario with dominance of the anomalous decay modes of the
fourth family quarks has been considered in details.
