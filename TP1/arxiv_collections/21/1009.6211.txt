A non-equilibrium Green's function formalism is used to study in detail the
ballistic conductance of asymmetrically biased side-gated quantum point
contacts (QPCs) in the presence of lateral spin-orbit coupling and
electron-electron interaction for a wide range of QPC dimensions and gate bias
voltage. Various conductance anomalies are predicted below the first quantized
conductance plateau (G0=2e2/h) which occur due to spontaneous spin polarization
in the narrowest portion of the QPC. The number of observed conductance
anomalies increases with increasing aspect ratio (length/width) of the QPC
constriction. These anomalies are fingerprints of spin textures in the narrow
portion of the QPC.
