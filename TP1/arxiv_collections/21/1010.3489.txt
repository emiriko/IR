Non-linear nature of Einstein equation introduces genuine relativistic higher
order corrections to the usual Newtonian fluid equations describing the
evolution of cosmological perturbations. We study the effect of such novel
non-linearities on the next-to-leading order matter and velocity power spectra
for the case of pressureless, irrotational fluid in a flat Friedmann
background. We find that pure general relativistic corrections are negligibly
small over all scales. Our result guarantees that, in the current paradigm of
standard cosmology, one can safely use Newtonian cosmology even in non-linear
regimes.
