We provide a method for the all order computation of small x contributions at
the leading logarithmic level to cross-sections which are differential in
rapidity. The method is based on a generalization to rapidity distributions of
the high energy (or k_T) factorization theorem hitherto proven for inclusive
cross-sections. We apply the method to Higgs production in gluon-gluon fusion,
both with finite top mass and in the infinite mass limit: in both cases, we
determine all-order resummed expressions, as well as explicit expressions for
the leading small x terms up to NNLO. We use our result to construct an
explicit approximate analytic expression of the finite-mass NLO rapidity
distribution and an estimate of finite-mass corrections at NNLO.
