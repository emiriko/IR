The impact of oxygen vacancies on local tunneling properties across
rf-sputtered MgO thin films was investigated by optical absorption spectroscopy
and conducting atomic force microscopy. Adding O$_2$ to the Ar plasma during
MgO growth alters the oxygen defect populations, leading to improved local
tunneling characteristics such as a lower density of current hotspots and a
lower tunnel current amplitude. We discuss a defect-based potential landscape
across ultrathin MgO barriers.
