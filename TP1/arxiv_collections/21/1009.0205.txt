We present the results of a computer simulation study of the liquid density
distribution normal to the interface between liquid Hg and the reconstructed
(0001) face of sapphire. The simulations are based on an extension of the
self-consistent quantum Monte Carlo scheme previously used to study the
structure of the liquid metal-vapor interface. The calculated density
distribution is in very good agreement with that inferred from the recent
experimental data of Tamam et al (J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 1, 1041-1045 (2010)). We
conclude that, to account for the difference in structure between the liquid
Hg-vapor and liquid-Hg-reconstructed (0001) Al2O3 interfaces, it is not
necessary assume there is charge transfer from the Hg to the Al2O3. Rather, the
available experimental data are adequately reproduced when the van der Waals
interactions of the Al and O atoms with Hg atoms and the exclusion of electron
density from Al2O3 via repulsion of the electrons from the closed shells of the
ions in the solid are accounted for.
