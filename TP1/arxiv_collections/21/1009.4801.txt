In this and the associated article 'BioBlender: A Software for Intuitive
Representation of Surface Properties of Biomolecules', (Andrei et al) we
present BioBlender as a complete instrument for the elaboration of motion
(here) and the visualization (Andrei et al) of proteins and other
macromolecules, using instruments of computer graphics. A vast number of
protein (if not most) exert their function through some extent of motion.
Despite recent advances in higly performant methods, it is very difficult to
obtain direct information on conformational changes of molecules. However,
several systems exist that can shed some light on the variability of
conformations of a single peptide chain; among them, NMR methods provide
collections of a number of static 'shots' of a moving protein. Starting from
this data, and assuming that if a protein exists in more than 1 conformation it
must be able to transit between the different states, we have elaborated a
system that makes ample use of the computational power of 3D computer graphics
technology. Considering information of all (heavy) atoms, we use animation and
game engine of Blender to obtain transition states. The model we chose to
elaborate our system is Calmodulin, a protein favorite among structural and
dynamic studies due to its (relative) simplicity of structure and small
dimension. Using Calmodulin we show a procedure that enables the building of a
'navigation map' of NMR models, that can help in the identification of
movements. In the process, a number of intermediate conformations is generated,
all of which respond to strict bio-physical and bio-chemical criteria. The
BioBlender system is available for download from the website
