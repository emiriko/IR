Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect can be estimated by cross-correlating
Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) sky with tracers of the local matter
distribution. At late cosmic time, the dark energy induced decay of gravitation
potential generates a cross-correlation signal on large angular scales. The
dominant noise are the intrinsic CMB anisotropies from the inflationary epoch.
In this Letter we use CMB polarization to reduce this intrinsic noise. We
cross-correlate the microwave sky observed by Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy
Probe (WMAP) with the radio source catalog compiled by NRAO VLA Sky Survey
(NVSS) to study the efficiency of the noise suppression . We find that the
error bars are reduced about 5-12 %, improving the statistical power.
