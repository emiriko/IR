This note contains sufficient conditions for the probability density function
of an arbitrary continuous univariate distribution, supported on $(0,\infty),$
such that the corresponding Mills ratio to be reciprocally convex (concave). To
illustrate the applications of the main results, the reciprocal convexity
(concavity) of Mills ratio of the gamma distribution is discussed in details.
