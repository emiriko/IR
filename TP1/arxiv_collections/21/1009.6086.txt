Alpha clustering in nuclei, at present is a well studied and reasonably well
accepted property of the nucleus. Less well appreciated and more ambiguous is
the role of A=3 clustering, i.e. helion and triton, in nuclei. Here we try to
place A=3 clustering in nuclei into its proper perspective, first by pointing
out strong experimental evidences which indicate its clear presence in nuclei
and secondly showing as to how to include these A=3 clusters in a proper and
consistent theoretical understanding of the nuclear phenomenon.
