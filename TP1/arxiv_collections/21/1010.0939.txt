A solution to the PAMELA positron excess with Higgsino dark matter within
extended supergravity grand unified (SUGRA) models is proposed. The models are
compliant with the photon constraints recently set by Fermi-LAT and produce
positron as well as antiproton fluxes consistent with the PAMELA experiment.
The SUGRA models considered have an extended hidden sector with extra degrees
of freedom which allow for a satisfaction of relic density consistent with
WMAP. The Higgsino models are also consistent with the CDMS-II and XENON100
data and are discoverable at LHC-7 with 1 fb^(-1) of luminosity. The models are
testable on several fronts.
