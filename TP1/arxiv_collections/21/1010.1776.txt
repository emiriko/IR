We present a theoretical study of the quantum corrections to the revival time
due to finite tunneling in the collapse and revival of matter wave interference
after a quantum quench. We study hard-core bosons in a superlattice potential
and the Bose-Hubbard model by means of exact numerical approaches and
mean-field theory. We consider systems without and with a trapping potential
present. We show that the quantum corrections to the revival time can be used
to accurately determine the value of the hopping parameter in experiments with
ultracold bosons in optical lattices.
