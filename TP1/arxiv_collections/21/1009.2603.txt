Quantum non-locality based on the well-known Bell inequality is of kinematic
nature. A different type of quantum non-locality, the non-locality of the
quantum equation of motion, is recently put forward with connection to the
Aharonov-Bohm effect [Nature Phys. 6, 151 (2010)]. Evolution of the
displacement operator provides an example to manifest such dynamic quantum
non-locality. We propose an experiment using single-atom interferometry to test
such dynamic quantum non-locality. We show how to measure evolution of the
displacement operator with clod atoms in a spin-dependent optical lattice
potential and discuss signature to identify dynamic quantum non-locality under
a realistic experimental setting.
