We present results of a complementary analysis of the frustrated planar
J_1-J_2-J_3 spin-1/2 quantum-antiferromagnet. Using dynamical functional
renormalization group, high-order coupled cluster calculations, and series
expansion based on the flow equation method, we have calculated generalized
momentum resolved susceptibilities, the ground state energy, the magnetic order
parameter, and the elementary excitation gap. From these we determine a quantum
phase diagram which shows a large window of a quantum paramagnetic phase
situated between the Neel, spiral and collinear states, which are present
already in the classical J_1-J_2-J_3 antiferromagnet. Our findings are
consistent with substantial plaquette correlations in the quantum paramagnetic
phase. The extent of the quantum paramagnetic region is found to be in
satisfying agreement between the three different approaches we have employed.
