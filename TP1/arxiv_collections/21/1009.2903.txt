The measurement of the mass of the W boson is one of the prime goals of the
Tevatron experiments. In this contribution, a review is given of the most
recent determinations of the W boson mass (mW) at the Tevatron. The combined
Tevatron result, mW = 80.420 +/- 0.031 GeV, is now more precise than the
combined LEP result, leading to a world average value of mW = 80.399 +/- 0.023
GeV.
