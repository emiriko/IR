In perturbative quantum gravity, the sum of the classical Lagrangian density,
a gauge fixing term and a ghost term is invariant under two sets of
supersymmetric transformations called the BRST and the anti-BRST
transformations. In this paper we will analyse the BRST and the anti-BRST
symmetries of perturbative quantum gravity in curved spacetime, in linear as
well as non-linear gauges. We will show that even though the sum of ghost term
and the gauge fixing term can always be expressed as a total BRST or a total
anti-BRST variation, we can express it as a combination of both of them only in
certain special gauges. We will also analyse the violation of nilpotency of the
BRST and the anti-BRST transformations by introduction of a bare mass term, in
the massive Curci-Ferrari gauge.
