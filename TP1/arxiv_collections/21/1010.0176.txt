We study Type I migration of a planet in a radiatively efficient disk using
global two dimensional hydrodynamic simulations. The large positive corotation
torque is exerted on a planet by an adiabatic disk at early times when the disk
has the steep negative entropy gradient. The gas on the horseshoe orbit of the
planet is compressed adiabatically during the change of the orbit from the slow
orbit to the fast orbit, increasing its density and exerting the positive
torque on the planet. The planet would migrate outward in the adiabatic disk
before saturation sets in. We further study the effect of energy dissipation by
radiation on Type I migration of the planet. The corotation torque decreases
when the energy dissipates effectively because the density of the gas on the
horseshoe orbit does not increase by the compression compared with the gas of
the adiabatic disk. The total torque is mainly determined by the negative
Lindblad torque and becomes negative. The planet migrates inward toward the
central star in the radiatively efficient disk. The migration velocity is
dependent on the radiative efficiency and greatly reduced if the radiative
cooling works inefficiently.
