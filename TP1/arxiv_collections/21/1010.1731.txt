We give an algebraic approach to the study of Hitchin pairs and prove the
tensor product theorem for Higgs semistable Hitchin pairs over smooth
projective curves defined over algebraically closed fields $k$ of
characteristic $0$ and characteristic $p$, with $p$ satisfying some natural
bounds. We also prove the corresponding theorem for polystable bundles.
