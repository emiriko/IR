It has been recently brought into spotlight that through the exploitation of
network coding concepts at physical-layer, the interference property of the
wireless media can be proven to be a blessing in disguise. Nonetheless, most of
the previous studies on this subject have either held unrealistic assumptions
about the network properties, thus making them basically theoretical, or have
otherwise been limited to fairly simple network topologies. We, on the other
hand, believe to have devised a novel scheme, called Real Amplitude Scaling
(RAS), that relaxes the aforementioned restrictions, and works with a wider
range of network topologies and in circumstances that are closer to practice,
for instance in lack of symbol-level synchronization and in the presence of
noise, channel distortion and severe interference from other sources. The
simulation results confirmed the superior performance of the proposed method in
low SNRs, as well as the high SNR limits, where the effect of quantization
error in the digital techniques becomes comparable to the channel.
