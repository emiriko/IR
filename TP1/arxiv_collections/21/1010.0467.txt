The scattering and recombination processes between two triplet excitons in
conjugated polymers are investigated by using a nonadiabatic evolution method,
based on an extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model including interchain
interactions. Due to the interchain coupling, the electron and/or hole in the
two triplet excitons can exchange. The results show that the recombination
induces the formation of singlet excitons, excited polarons and biexcitons.
Moreover, we also find the yields of these products, which can contribute to
the emission, increase with the interchain coupling strength, in good agreement
with results from experiments.
