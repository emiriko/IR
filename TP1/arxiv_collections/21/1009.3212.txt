We study heat conduction in a harmonic crystal whose bulk dynamics is
supplemented by random reversals (flips) of the velocity of each particle at a
rate $\lambda$. The system is maintained in a nonequilibrium stationary
state(NESS) by contacts with Langevin reservoirs at different temperatures. We
show that the one-body and pair correlations in this system are the same (after
an appropriate mapping of parameters) as those obtained for a model with
self-consistent reservoirs. This is true both for the case of equal and
random(quenched) masses. While the heat conductivity in the NESS of the ordered
system is known explicitly, much less is known about the random mass case. Here
we investigate the random system, with velocity flips. We improve the bounds on
the Green-Kubo conductivity obtained by C.Bernardin. The conductivity of the 1D
system is then studied both numerically and analytically. This sheds some light
on the effect of noise on the transport properties of systems with localized
states caused by quenched disorder.
