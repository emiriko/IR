If the stellar halos of disk galaxies are built up from the disruption of
dwarf galaxies, models predict highly structured variations in the stellar
populations within these halos. We test this prediction by studying the ratio
of blue horizontal branch stars (BHB stars; more abundant in old, metal-poor
populations) to main-sequence turn-off stars (MSTO stars; a feature of all
populations) in the stellar halo of the Milky Way using data from the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey. We develop and apply an improved technique to select BHB
stars using ugr color information alone, yielding a sample of ~9000 g<18
candidates where ~70% of them are BHB stars. We map the BHB/MSTO ratio across
~1/4 of the sky at the distance resolution permitted by the absolute magnitude
distribution of MSTO stars. We find large variations of BHB/MSTO star ratio in
the stellar halo. Previously identified, stream-like halo structures have
distinctive BHB/MSTO ratios, indicating different ages/metallicities. Some halo
features, e.g., the low-latitude structure, appear to be almost completely
devoid of BHB stars, whereas other structures appear to be rich in BHB stars.
The Sagittarius tidal stream shows an apparent variation in BHB/MSTO ratio
along its extent, which we interpret in terms of population gradients within
the progenitor dwarf galaxy. Our detection of coherent stellar population
variations between different stellar halo substructures provides yet more
support to cosmologically motivated models for stellar halo growth.
