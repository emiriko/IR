The recent findings about two distinct quasiparticle inelastic scattering
rates in angle-dependent magnetoresistance (ADMR) experiments in overdoped
high-$T_c$ cuprates superconductors have motivated many discussions related to
the link between superconductivity, pseudogap, and transport properties in
these materials. After computing dynamical self-energy corrections in the
framework of the $t-J$ model the inelastic scattering rate was introduced as
usual. Two distinct scattering rates were obtained showing the main features
observed in ADMR experiments. Predictions for underdoped cuprates are
discussed. The implicances of these two scattering rates on the resistivity
were also studied as a function of doping and temperature and confronted with
experimental measurements.
