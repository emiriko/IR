GPS-derived ZTD (Zenith Tropospheric Delay) plays a key role in near
real-time weather forecasting, especially in improving the precision of
Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models. The ZTD is usually estimated using
the first-order Gauss-Markov process with a fairly large correlation, and under
the assumption that all the GPS measurements, carrier phases or pseudo-ranges,
have the same accuracy. However, these assumptions are unrealistic. This paper
aims to investigate the impact of several stochastic modeling methods on
GPS-derived ZTD estimations using Australian IGS data. The results show that
the accuracy of GPS-derived ZTD can be improved using a suitable stochastic
model for the GPS measurements. The stochastic model using satellite elevation
angle-based cosine function is better than other investigated stochastic
models. It is noted that, when different stochastic modeling strategies are
used, the variations in estimated ZTD can reach as much as 1cm. This
improvement of ZTD estimation is certainly critical for reliable NWP and other
tropospheric delay corrections.
