The present work is dedicated to searching parameters, alternative to
entropy, applicable for description of highly organized systems. The general
concept has been offered, in which the system complexity and order are
functions of the order establishment rules. The concept of order poles has been
introduced. The concept is being applied to definition of the order parameter
(OP) for non-random sequences with equal number of zeros and ones. Properties
of the OP are being studied. Definition of the OP is being compared to
classical definition of amount of information.
