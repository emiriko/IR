The LOPES experiment at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology has been taking
radio data in the frequency range from 40 to 80 MHz in coincidence with the
KASCADE-Grande air shower detector since 2003. Various experimental
configurations have been employed to study aspects such as the energy scaling,
geomagnetic dependence, lateral distribution, and polarization of the radio
emission from cosmic rays. The high quality per-event air shower information
provided by KASCADE-Grande has been the key to many of these studies and has
even allowed us to perform detailed per-event comparisons with simulations of
the radio emission. In this article, we give an overview of results obtained by
LOPES, and present the status and perspectives of the ever-evolving experiment.
