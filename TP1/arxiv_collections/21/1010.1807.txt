We examine phase separation in aqueous mixtures due to preferential solvation
with a low-density solute (hydrophilic ions or hydrophobic particles). For
hydrophilic ions, preferential solvation can stabilize water domains enriched
with ions. This precipitation occurs in wide ranges of the temperature and the
average composition above a critical solute density $n_p$, where the mixture
solvent would be in a one-phase state without solute. The volume fraction of
precipitated domains tends to zero as the average solute density $\bar n$ is
decreased to $n_p$ or as the interaction parameter $\chi$ is decreased to a
critical value $\chi_p$. If we start with one-phase states with ${\bar n}>n_p$
or $\chi>\chi_p$, precipitation proceeds via homogeneous nucleation or via
heterogeneous nucleation, for example, around suspended colloids. In the latter
case, colliod particles are wrapped by thick wetting layers. We also predict a
first-order prewetting transition for $\bar n$ or $\chi$ slightly below $n_p$
or $\chi_p$.
