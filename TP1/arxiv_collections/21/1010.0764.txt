We study the discrete-time quantum walk-based search for a marked vertex on a
graph. By considering various structures in which not all vertices are
equivalent, we investigate the relationship between the successful search
probability and the position of the marked vertex, in particular its
centrality. We find that the maximum value of the search probability does not
necessarily increase as the marked vertex becomes more central and we
investigate an interesting relationship between the frequency of the successful
search probability and the centrality of the marked vertex.
