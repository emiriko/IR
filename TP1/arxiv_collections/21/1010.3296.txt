Fluid dynamics video of an evaporating sessile drop of capillary size is
presented. The corresponding simulation represents the description taking into
account jointly time dependent hydrodynamics, vapor diffusion and thermal
conduction in an evaporating sessile drop. The fluid convection in the drop is
driven by Marangoni forces associated with the temperature dependence of the
surface tension. For the first time the evolution of the vortex structure in
the drop during an evaporation process is obtained.
