We present the first analytical superposition of a charged black hole with an
annular disk of extremal dust. In order to obtain the solutions, we first solve
the Einstein-Maxwell field equations for sources that represent disk-like
configurations of matter in confomastatic spacetimes by assuming a functional
dependence among the metric function, the electric potential and an auxiliary
function,which is taken as a solution of the Laplace equation. We then employ
the Lord Kelvin Inversion Method applied to models of finite extension in order
to obtain annular disks. The structures obtained extend to infinity, but their
total masses are finite and all the energy conditions are satisfied. Finally,
we observe that the extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole can be embedded
into the center of the disks by adding a boundary term in the inversion.
