A method is described for the reconstruction of the amplitude and phase of
the object exit wave function by phase-plate transmission electron microscopy.
The proposed method can be considered as in-line holography and requires three
images, taken with different phase shifts between undiffracted and diffracted
electrons induced by a suitable phase-shifting device. The proposed method is
applicable for arbitrary object exit wave functions and non-linear image
formation. Verification of the method is performed for examples of a simulated
crystalline object wave function and a wave function acquired with off-axis
holography. The impact of noise on the reconstruction of the wave function is
investigated.
