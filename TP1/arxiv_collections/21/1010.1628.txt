We show that it is possible to create an RS soft-wall model, a model with a
compact extra dimension, without using fundamental branes. All that is required
are bulk scalar fields minimally coupled to gravity. Of crucial importance is
the stability of the size of the extra dimension. Without branes, one cannot
easily implement the Goldberger-Wise mechanism, and instead it must be shown
that the scalar configuration is stable in its own right. We use the
superpotential approach for generating solutions, the so called 'fake
supergravity' scenario, and show that configurations generated in such a way
are always free of tachyonic modes. Furthermore, we show that the model is also
free of zero modes (in the spin-0 sector) if all the scalars have odd parity.
We discuss the hierarchy problem in soft-wall models, and applications of our
analysis to the AdS/QCD correspondence.
