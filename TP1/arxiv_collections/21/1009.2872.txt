We present energy-resolved measurements of electron emission from sharp metal
tips driven with low energy pulses from a few-cycle laser oscillator. We
observe above-threshold photoemission with a photon order of up to 9. At a
laser intensity of 2*10^11 W/cm^2 suppression of the lowest order peak occurs,
indicating the onset of strong-field effects. We also observe peak shifting
linearly with intensity with a slope of around -1.8eV / (10^12 W/cm^2). We
attribute the magnitude of the laser field effects to field enhancement taking
place at the tip's surface.
