We present a discrete model theory similar in structure to ordinary quantum
mechanics, but based on a finite field instead of complex amplitudes. The
interpretation of this theory involves only the "modal" concepts of possibility
and necessity rather than quantitative probability measures. Despite its
simplicity, our model theory includes entangled states and has versions of both
Bell's theorem and the no cloning theorem.
