Toroidal carbon nanotubes can serve as hosts for encapsulated loops of atomic
metal wires. Such composite structures have been analyzed using density
functional theory for a semiconducting C$_{120}$ torus encapsulating chains of
Fe, Au and Cu atoms. The sheathed metal necklaces form a zigzag structure and
drops the HOMO/LUMO bandgap to less than 0.1 eV. The iron composite is
ferromagnetic with a magnetic moment essentially the same as that of bcc iron.
The azimuthal symmetry of these toroidal composites suggests that they may
offer novel elecromagnetic properties not associated with straight,
metal-encapsulated carbon nanotubes.
