Radio frequency interference (RFI) already limits the sensitivity of existing
radio telescopes in several frequency bands and may prove to be an even greater
obstacle for future generation instruments to overcome. I aim to create a
structure of radio astronomy correlators which will be statistically stable
(robust) in the presence of interference. A statistical analysis of the mixture
of system noise + signal noise + RFI is proposed here which could be
incorporated into the block diagram of a correlator. Order and rank statistics
are especially useful when calculated in both temporal and frequency domains.
Several new algorithms of robust correlators are proposed and investigated
here. Computer simulations and processing of real data demonstrate the efficacy
of the proposed algorithms.
