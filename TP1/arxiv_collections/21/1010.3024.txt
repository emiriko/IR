We study the pseudogap Bose-Fermi Anderson model with a continuous-time
quantum Monte Carlo (CT-QMC) method. We discuss some delicate aspects of the
transformation from this model to the Bose-Fermi Kondo model. We show that the
CT-QMC method can be used at sufficiently low temperatures to access the
quantum critical properties of these models.
