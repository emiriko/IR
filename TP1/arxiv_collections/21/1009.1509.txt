Gravitational field equations in Randers-Finsler space of approximate Berwald
type are investigated. A modified Friedmann equation and a new luminosity
distance-redshift relation is proposed. A best-fit to the Type Ia supernovae
(SNe) observations yields that the $\Omega_{\Lambda}$ in the $\Lambda$-CDM
model is suppressed to almost zero. This fact indicates that the astronomical
observations on the Type Ia SNe can be described well without invoking any form
of dark energy. The best-fit age of the universe is given. It is in agreement
with the age of our galaxy.
