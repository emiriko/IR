In this paper we present a successful experimental test of filling a volume
of 6 m$^3$ with argon gas, starting from normal ambient air and reducing the
impurities content down to few parts per million (ppm) oxygen equivalent. This
level of contamination was directly monitored measuring the slow component of
the scintillation light of the Ar gas, which is sensitive to {\it all} sources
of impurities affecting directly the argon scintillation.
