Financial market dynamics is rigorously studied via the exact generalized
Langevin equation. Assuming market Brownian self-similarity, the market return
rate memory and autocorrelation functions are derived, which exhibit an
oscillatory-decaying behavior with a long-time tail, similar to empirical
observations. Individual stocks are also described via the generalized Langevin
equation. They are classified by their relation to the market memory as heavy,
neutral and light stocks, possessing different kinds of autocorrelation
functions.
