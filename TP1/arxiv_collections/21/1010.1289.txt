A novel model of intermittency is presented in which the dynamics of the
rates of energy transfer between successive steps in the energy cascade is
described by a hierarchy of stochastic differential equations. The probability
distribution of velocity increments is calculated explicitly and expressed in
terms of generalized hypergeometric functions of the type ${_n}F_0$, which
exhibit power-law tails. The model predictions are found to be in good
agreement with experiments on a low temperature gaseous helium jet. It is
argued that distributions based on the functions ${_n}F_0$ might be relevant
also for other physical systems with multiscale dynamics.
