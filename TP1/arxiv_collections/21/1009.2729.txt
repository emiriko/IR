We investigate the phase diagram of a discrete version of the Maier-Saupe
model with the inclusion of additional degrees of freedom to mimic a
distribution of rodlike and disklike molecules. Solutions of this problem on a
Bethe lattice come from the analysis of the fixed points of a set of nonlinear
recursion relations. Besides the fixed points associated with isotropic and
uniaxial nematic structures, there is also a fixed point associated with a
biaxial nematic structure. Due to the existence of large overlaps of the
stability regions, we resorted to a scheme to calculate the free energy of
these structures deep in the interior of a large Cayley tree. Both
thermodynamic and dynamic-stability analyses rule out the presence of a biaxial
phase, in qualitative agreement with previous mean-field results.
