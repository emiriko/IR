We report on "graphene-like" mechanical exfoliation of single-crystal Bi2Te3
films and thermoelectric characterization of the stacks of such films. Thermal
conductivity of the resulting "pseudo-superlattices" was measured by the "hot
disk" and "laser flash" techniques. The room-temperature in-plane (cross-plane)
thermal conductivity of the stacks decreases by a factor of ~2.4 (3.5) as
compared to bulk. The thermal conductivity reduction with preserved electrical
properties leads to strong increase in the thermoelectric figure of merit. It
is suggested that the film thinning to few-quintuples and tuning of the Fermi
level can help in achieving the topological-insulator surface transport regime
with an extraordinary thermoelectric efficiency.
