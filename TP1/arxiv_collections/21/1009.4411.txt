We study the magnetocaloric effect for the integrable antiferromagnetic
high-spin chain. We present an exact computation of the Gr\"uneisen parameter,
which is closely related to the magnetocaloric effect, for the quantum spin-s
chain on the thermodynamical limit by means of Bethe ansatz techniques and the
quantum transfer matrix approach. We have also calculated the entropy S and the
isentropes in the (H,T) plane. We have been able to identify the quantum
critical points H_c^{(s)}=2/(s+1/2) looking at the isentropes and/or the
characteristic behaviour of the Gr\"uneisen parameter.
