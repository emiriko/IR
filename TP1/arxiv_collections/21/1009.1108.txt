A generic quantum channel can be represented in terms of a unitary
interaction between the information-carrying system and a noisy environment.
Here, the minimal number of quantum Gaussian environmental modes required to
provide a unitary dilation of a multi-mode bosonic Gaussian channel is analyzed
both for mixed and pure environment corresponding to the Stinespring
representation. In particular, for the case of pure environment we compute this
quantity and present an explicit unitary dilation for arbitrary bosonic
Gaussian channel. These results considerably simplify the characterization of
these continuous-variable maps and can be applied to address some open issues
concerning the transmission of information encoded in bosonic systems.
