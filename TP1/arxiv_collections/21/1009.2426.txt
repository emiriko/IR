The emerging strategy to overcome the limitations of bulk quantum optics
consists of taking advantage of the robustness and compactness achievable by
the integrated waveguide technology. Here we report the realization of a
directional coupler, fabricated by femtosecond laser waveguide writing, acting
as an integrated beam splitter able to support polarization encoded qubits.
This maskless and single step technique allows to realize circular transverse
waveguide profiles able to support the propagation of Gaussian modes with any
polarization state. Using this device, we demonstrate the quantum interference
with polarization entangled states and singlet state projection.
