This decade should make a significant progress towards the Theory of Flavour
and the main goal of this talk is to transfer this believe to my colleagues in
the particle physics community. Indeed a significant part of this decade could
  turn out to be the Flavour Era with participation of the LHC, Belle II,
Super-Flavour-Facility and dedicated Kaon and lepton flavour violation
experiments. Selected superstars of flavour physics listed below will play a
prominent role in these events. In this writeup the leading role is played by
the prima donna of 2010: CP violation in B_s system.
