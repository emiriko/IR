We revisit the scattering of surface plasmons by shallow surface defects for
both protrusions and indentations of various lengths, which are deemed infinite
in one-dimension parallel to the surface. Subwavelength protrusions and
indentations of equal shape present different scattering coefficients when
their height and width are comparable. In this case, a protrusion scatters
plasmons like a vertical point-dipole on a plane, while an indentation scatters
like a horizontal point-dipole on a plane. We corroborate that long and shallow
asymmetrically-shaped surface defects have very similar scattering, as already
found with approximate methods. In the transition from short shallow scatterers
to long shallow scatterers the radiation can be understood in terms of
interference between a vertical and a horizontal dipole. The results attained
numerically are exact and accounted for with analytical models.
