We demonstrate that whispering gallery mode resonators can be utilized to
generate optical frequency combs based on four wave mixing process at virtually
any frequency that lies in the transparency window of the resonator host
material. We show theoretically how the morphology of the resonator can be
engineered to produce a family of spectrally equidistant modes with anomalous
group velocity dispersion appropriate for the comb generation. We present
experimental results for a frequency comb centered at 794 nm to support our
theoretical findings.
