In a recent series of papers, Gebremariam, Bogner, and Duguet derived a
microscopically based nuclear energy density functional by applying the Density
Matrix Expansion (DME) to the Hartree-Fock energy obtained from chiral
effective field theory (EFT) two- and three-nucleon interactions. Due to the
structure of the chiral interactions, each coupling in the DME functional is
given as the sum of a coupling constant arising from zero-range contact
interactions and a coupling function of the density arising from the
finite-range pion exchanges. Since the contact contributions have essentially
the same structure as those entering empirical Skyrme functionals, a
microscopically guided Skyrme phenomenology has been suggested in which the
contact terms in the DME functional are released for optimization to
finite-density observables to capture short-range correlation energy
contributions from beyond Hartree-Fock. The present paper is the first attempt
to assess the ability of the newly suggested DME functional, which has a much
richer set of density dependencies than traditional Skyrme functionals, to
generate sensible and stable results for nuclear applications. The results of
the first proof-of-principle calculations are given, and numerous practical
issues related to the implementation of the new functional in existing Skyrme
codes are discussed. Using a restricted singular value decomposition (SVD)
optimization procedure, it is found that the new DME functional gives
numerically stable results and exhibits a small but systematic reduction of our
test $\chi^2$ function compared to standard Skyrme functionals, thus justifying
its suitability for future global optimizations and large-scale calculations.
