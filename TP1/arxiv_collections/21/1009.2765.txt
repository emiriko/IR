Although experts diverge on how best to improve spreadsheet quality, it is
generally agreed that more time needs to be spent testing spreadsheets.
Ideally, experienced and trained spreadsheet engineers would carry this out,
but quite often this is neither practical nor possible. Many spreadsheets are a
legacy, developed by staff that have since moved on, or indeed modified by many
staff no longer employed by the organisation. When such spreadsheets fall into
the hands of inexperienced, non-experts, any features that reduce error
visibility may become a risk. Range names are one such feature, and this paper,
building on previous research, investigates in a more structured and controlled
manner the effect they have on the debugging performance of novice spreadsheet
users.
