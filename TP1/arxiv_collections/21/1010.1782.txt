We show that an ensemble of polar molecules trapped in an optical lattice can
be considered as a controllable open quantum system. The coupling between
collective rotational excitations and the motion of the molecules in the
lattice potential can be controlled by varying the strength and orientation of
an external DC electric field as well as the intensity of the trapping laser.
The system can be described by a generalized Holstein Hamiltonian with tunable
parameters and can be used as a quantum simulator of excitation energy transfer
and polaron phenomena. We show that the character of excitation energy transfer
can be modified by tuning experimental parameters.
