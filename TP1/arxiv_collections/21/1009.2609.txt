The effect of magnetic anisotropy-axis alignment of individual nanoparticles
on the collective aging behavior in the superspin glass state of a frozen
ferrofluid has been investigated. The ferrofluid studied here consists of
maghemite nanoparticles (\gamma-Fe2O3, mean diameter = 8.6 nm) dispersed in
glycerin at a volume fraction of ~15%. The low temperature aging behavior has
been explored through 'zero-field cooled magnetization' (ZFCM) relaxation
measurements using SQUID magnetometry. The ZFCM response functions were found
to scale with effective age of the system in both textured and non-textured
superspin glass states, but with markedly different scaling exponents, \mu. The
value of {\mu} was found to shift from ~0.9 in non-textured case to ~ 0.6 in
the textured case, despite the identical cooling protocol used in both
experiments.
