Globular clusters (GCs) with their ages of the order of several billion years
contain many final products of evolution of stars such as: neutron stars, white
dwarfs and probably also black holes. These compact objects can be at present
responsible for the acceleration of particles to relativistic energies.
Therefore, gamma-ray emission is expected from GCs as a result of radiation
processes occurring either in the inner magnetosperes of millisecond pulsars or
in the vicinity of accreting neutron stars and white dwarfs or as a result of
interaction of particles leaving the compact objects with the strong radiation
field within the GC. Recently, GeV gamma-ray emission has been detected from
several GCs by the new satellite observatory Fermi. Also Cherenkov telescopes
reported interesting upper limits at the TeV energies which start to constrain
the content of GCs. We review the results of these gamma-ray observations in
the context of recent scenarios for their origin.
