The CoRoT exoplanet science team announces the discovery of CoRoT-11b, a
fairly massive hot-Jupiter transiting a V=12.9 mag F6 dwarf star (M*=1.27 +/-
0.05 Msun, R*=1.37 +/- 0.03 Rsun, Teff=6440 +/- 120 K), with an orbital period
of P=2.994329 +/- 0.000011 days and semi-major axis a=0.0436 +/- 0.005 AU. The
detection of part of the radial velocity anomaly caused by the
Rossiter-McLaughlin effect shows that the transit-like events detected by CoRoT
are caused by a planet-sized transiting object in a prograde orbit. The
relatively high projected rotational velocity of the star (vsini=40+/-5 km/s)
places CoRoT-11 among the most rapidly rotating planet host stars discovered so
far. With a planetary mass of mp=2.33+/-0.34 Mjup and radius rp=1.43+/-0.03
Rjup, the resulting mean density of CoRoT-11b (rho=0.99+/-0.15 g/cm^3) can be
explained with a model for an inflated hydrogen-planet with a solar composition
and a high level of energy dissipation in its interior.
