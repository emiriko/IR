The Salpeter equation, a standard tool in hadron physics, constitutes a
well-defined three-dimensional approximation to the Bethe-Salpeter formalism
for the description of bound states within quantum field theories. However, if
confinement is implemented in a too careless manner, the Salpeter equation
might predict unstable states where only truly bound states are expected. A
systematic spectral analysis of the Salpeter equation might serve to single out
those Bethe-Salpeter interaction kernels which indeed yield stable bound
states, with associated energy eigenvalues belonging to a real discrete
spectrum bounded from below.
