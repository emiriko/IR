Science strives for a detailed understanding of reality even if this
differentiation threatens individual synthesis, or the wholeness of psyche.
Religion strives to maintain the wholeness of psyche, even if at the expense of
a detailed understanding of the world and Self. This paper analyzes the
cognitive forces driving us to achieve both. This analysis leads to
understanding emotions of the religiously sublime, which are the foundations of
all religions. These seemingly mysterious feelings, which everyone feels, even
if rarely, even if without noticing them consciously, even if without being
able to name them properly, today can be explained scientifically. And
possibly, we may soon be able to measure them in a psychological laboratory.
The article briefly reviews new developments in brain imaging that have made
new data available, and reviews development and mathematical modeling in
cognitive theory explaining these previously mysterious feelings. This new
scientific analysis has overcome another long-standing challenge: reductionism.
Although religious feelings can be scientifically discussed in terms of
concrete neural mechanisms and mathematically modeled, but cannot be reduced to
"just this or that" mechanical explanation.
