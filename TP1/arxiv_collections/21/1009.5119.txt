Quantum electrodynamics corrects miscalculations of classical
electrodynamics, but by introducing the pseudo-particle "photon" it is the
source of errors whose practical consequences are serious. Thus W. E. Lamb
disadvises the use of the word "photon" in an article whose this text takes the
title. The purpose of this paper is neither a compilation, nor a critique of
Lamb's paper: It adds arguments and applications to show that the use of this
concept is dangerous while the semi-classical theory is always right provided
that common errors are corrected: in particular, the classical field of
electromagnetic energy is often, wrongly, considered as linear, so that Bohr's
electron falls on the nucleus and photon counting is false. Using absolute
energies and radiances avoids doing these errors. Quantum electrodynamics
quantizes "normal modes" chosen arbitrarily among the infinity of sets of
orthogonal modes of the electromagnetic field. Changing the choice of normal
modes splits the photons which are pseudo-particles, not physical objects.
Considering the photons as small particles interacting without pilot waves with
single atoms, astrophysicists use Monte-Carlo computations for the propagation
of light in homogeneous media while it works only in opalescent media as
clouds. Thus, for instance, two theories abort while, they are validated using
coherence and Einstein theories, giving a good interpretation of the rings of
supernova remnant 1987A, and the spectrum found inside. The high frequency
shifts of this spectrum can only result from a parametric interaction of light
with excited atomic hydrogen which is found in many regions of the universe.
