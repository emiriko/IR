The exactly solvable model of a one dimensional isotropic XY spin chain is
employed to study the thermodynamics of open systems. For this purpose the
chain is subdivided into two parts, one part is considered as the system while
the rest as the environment or bath. The equilibrium properties of the system
display several anomalous aspects such as negative entropies, negative specific
heat, negative susceptibilities in dependence of temperature and coupling
strength between system and bath. The statistical mechanics of this system is
studied in terms of a reduced density matrix. At zero temperature and for a
certain parameter values we observe a change of the ground state, a situation
akin to a quantum phase transition.
