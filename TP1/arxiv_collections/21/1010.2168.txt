We have investigated the static, charge-trapping properties of a hybrid
superconductor---normal metal electron turnstile embedded into a high-ohmic
environment. The device includes a local Cr resistor on one side of the
turnstile, and a superconducting trapping island on the other side. The
electron hold times, t ~ 2-20s, in our two-junction circuit are comparable with
those of typical multi-junction, N >= 4, normal-metal single-electron tunneling
devices. A semi-phenomenological model of the environmental activation of
tunneling is applied for the analysis of the switching statistics. The
experimental results are promising for electrical metrology.
