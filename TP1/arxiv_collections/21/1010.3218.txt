This is intended to be a brief introduction and overview of Horava-Lifshitz
gravity. The motivation and all of the various version of the theory (to date)
are presented. The dynamics of the theory are discussed in some detail, with a
focus on low energy viability and consistency, as these have been the issues
that attracted most of the attention in the literature so far. Other properties
of the theory and developments within its framework are also covered, such as:
its relation to Einstein-aether theory, cosmology, and future perspectives.
