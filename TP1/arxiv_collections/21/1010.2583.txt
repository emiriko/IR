Stability of radial and nonradial oscillations of massive supergiants is
discussed. The kappa-mechanism and strange-mode instability exciteoscillations
having various periods in wide ranges of the upper part of the HR diagram. In
addition, in very luminous ($\log L/L_\odot \gtrsim 5.9$) models, monotonously
unstable modes exist, which probably indicates the occurrence of optically
thick winds. The instability boundary is not far from the Humphreys-Davidson
limit. Furthermore, it is found that there exist low-degree($\ell = 1, 2$)
oscillatory convection modes associated with the Fe-opacity peak convection
zone, and they can emerge to the stellar surface so that they are very likely
observable in a considerable range in the HR diagram. The convection modes have
periods similar to g-modes, and their growth-times are comparable to the
periods. Theoretical predictions are compared with some of the supergiant
variables.
