Classical Gaussian white noise in communications and signal processing is
viewed as the limit of zero mean second order Gaussian processes with a
compactly supported flat spectral density as the support goes to infinity. The
difficulty of developing a theory to deal with nonlinear transformations of
white noise has been to interpret the corresponding limits. In this paper we
show that a renormalization and centering of powers of band-limited Gaussian
processes is Gaussian white noise and as a consequence, homogeneous polynomials
under suitable renormalization remain white noises.
