The nature of electron correlations in bilayer graphene has been
investigated. An analytic expression for the radial distribution function is
derived for an ideal electron gas and the corresponding static structure factor
is evaluated. We also estimate the interaction energy of this system. In
particular, the functional form of the pair-correlation function was found to
be almost insensitive to the electron density in the experimentally accessible
range. The inter-layer bias potential also has a negligible effect on the
pair-correlation function. Our results offer valuable insights into the general
behavior of the correlated systems and serve as an essential starting-point for
investigation of the fully-interacting system.
