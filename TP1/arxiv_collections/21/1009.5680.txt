We find that, even in the presence of discreteness noise, a Gaussianizing
transform (producing a more-Gaussian one-point distribution) reduces
nonlinearities in the power spectra of cosmological matter and galaxy density
fields, in many cases drastically. Although Gaussianization does increase the
effective shot noise, it also increases the power spectrum's fidelity to the
linear power spectrum on scales where the shot noise is negligible.
Gaussianizing also increases the Fisher information in the power spectrum in
all cases and resolutions, although the gains are smaller in redshift space
than in real space. We also find that the gain in cumulative Fisher information
from Gaussianizing peaks at a particular grid resolution that depends on the
sampling level.
