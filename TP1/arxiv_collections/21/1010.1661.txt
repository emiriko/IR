The recent works by the present authors predicted that the real part of
heavy-ion optical potentials changes its character from attraction to repulsion
around the incident energy per nucleon E/A = 200 - 300 MeV on the basis of the
complex G-matrix interaction and the double-folding model (DFM) and revealed
that the three-body force plays an important role there. In the present paper,
we have precisely analyzed the energy dependence of the calculated DFM
potentials and its relation to the elastic-scattering angular distributions in
detail in the case of the $^{12}$C + $^{12}$C system in the energy range of E/A
= 100 - 400 MeV. The tensor force contributes substantially to the energy
dependence of the real part of the DFM potentials and plays an important role
to lower the attractive-to-repulsive transition energy. The nearside and
farside (N/F) decomposition of the elastic-scattering amplitudes clarifies the
close relation between the attractive-to-repulsive transition of the potentials
and the characteristic evolution of the calculated angular distributions with
the increase of the incident energy. Based on the present analysis, we propose
experimental measurements of the predicted strong diffraction phenomena of the
elastic-scattering angular distribution caused by the N/F interference around
the attractive-to-repulsive transition energy together with the reduced
diffractions below and above the transition energy.
