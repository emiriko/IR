We measure the Casimir force between a gold sphere and a silicon plate with
nanoscale, rectangular corrugations with depth comparable to the separation
between the surfaces. In the proximity force approximation (PFA), both the top
and bottom surfaces of the corrugations contribute to the force, leading to a
distance dependence that is distinct from a flat surface. The measured Casimir
force is found to deviate from the PFA by up to 15%, in good agreement with
calculations based on scattering theory that includes both geometry effects and
the optical properties of the material.
