Results of resistivity, Hall effect, magnetoresistance, susceptibility and
heat capacity measurements are presented for single crystals of indium-doped
tin telluride with compositions Sn$_{.988-x}$In$_x$Te where $0 \leq x \leq 8.4
%$, along with microstructural analysis based on transmission electron
microscopy. For small indium concentrations, $x \leq 0.9 %$ the material does
not superconduct above 0.3 K, and the transport properties are consistent with
simple metallic behavior. For $x \geq 2.7 %$ the material exhibits anomalous
low temperature scattering and for $x \geq 6.1 %$ bulk superconductivity is
observed with critical temperatures close to 2 K. Intermediate indium
concentrations $2.7% \leq x \leq 3.8%$ do not exhibit bulk superconductivity
above 0.7 K. Susceptibility data indicate the absence of magnetic impurities,
while magnetoresistance data are inconsistent with localization effects,
leading to the conclusion that indium-doped SnTe is a candidate charge Kondo
system, similar to thallium-doped PbTe.
