Monte Carlo simulations of the 4d O(4) model in the broken phase are
performed to determine the parameters of a resonance. The standard method for
extracting them on the lattice is through L\"uscher's formula; recently a new
method, based on the probability distribution concept, has been proposed. We
study the application of these methods and compare them with Monte Carlo data.
