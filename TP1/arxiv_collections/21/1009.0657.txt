We give an overview on recently accomplished successful generalizations of
`worm' or loop gas simulation methods to O(N) and CP(N-1) sigma models and to
simple fermion models. Beside the advantage of (practically) eliminated
critical slowing down we also explain additional opportunities to estimate some
observables with extremely improved signal to noise levels.
