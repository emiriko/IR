We discuss the CUDA approach to the simulation of pure gauge Lattice SU(2).
CUDA is a hardware and software architecture developed by NVIDIA for computing
on the GPU. We present an analysis and performance comparison between the GPU
and CPU with single precision. Analysis with single and multiple GPU's, using
CUDA and OPENMP, are also presented. In order to obtain a high performance, the
code must be optimized for the GPU architecture, i.e., an implementation that
exploits the memory hierarchy of the CUDA programming model. Using GPU texture
memory and minimizing the data transfers between CPU and GPU, we achieve a
speedup of $200\times$ using 2 NVIDIA 295 GTX cards relative to a serial CPU,
which demonstrates that GPU's can serve as an efficient platform for scientific
computing. With multi-GPU's we are able, in one day computation, to generate 1
000 000 gauge configurations in a $48^4$ lattice with $\beta=6.0$ and calculate
the mean average plaquette. We present results for the mean average plaquette
in several lattice sizes for different $\beta$. Finally we present results for
the mean average Polyakov loop at finite temperature.
