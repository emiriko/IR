We explore the use of the optimal statistical interpolation (OSI) data
assimilation method for the statistical tracking of emerging epidemics and to
study the spatial dynamics of a disease. The epidemic models that we used for
this study are spatial variants of the common susceptible-infectious-removed
(S-I-R) compartmental model of epidemiology. The spatial S-I-R epidemic model
is illustrated by application to simulated spatial dynamic epidemic data from
the historic "Black Death" plague of 14th century Europe. Bayesian statistical
tracking of emerging epidemic diseases using the OSI as it unfolds is
illustrated for a simulated epidemic wave originating in Santa Fe, New Mexico.
