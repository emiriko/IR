In a sampling problem, we are given an input x, and asked to sample
approximately from a probability distribution D_x. In a search problem, we are
given an input x, and asked to find a member of a nonempty set A_x with high
probability. (An example is finding a Nash equilibrium.) In this paper, we use
tools from Kolmogorov complexity and algorithmic information theory to show
that sampling and search problems are essentially equivalent. More precisely,
for any sampling problem S, there exists a search problem R_S such that, if C
is any "reasonable" complexity class, then R_S is in the search version of C if
and only if S is in the sampling version. As one application, we show that
SampP=SampBQP if and only if FBPP=FBQP: in other words, classical computers can
efficiently sample the output distribution of every quantum circuit, if and
only if they can efficiently solve every search problem that quantum computers
can solve. A second application is that, assuming a plausible conjecture, there
exists a search problem R that can be solved using a simple linear-optics
experiment, but that cannot be solved efficiently by a classical computer
unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses. That application will be described
in a forthcoming paper with Alex Arkhipov on the computational complexity of
linear optics.
