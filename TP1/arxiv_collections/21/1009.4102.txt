This article presents a new search algorithm for the NP-hard problem of
optimizing functions of binary variables that decompose according to a
graphical model. It can be applied to models of any order and structure. The
main novelty is a technique to constrain the search space based on the topology
of the model. When pursued to the full search depth, the algorithm is
guaranteed to converge to a global optimum, passing through a series of
monotonously improving local optima that are guaranteed to be optimal within a
given and increasing Hamming distance. For a search depth of 1, it specializes
to Iterated Conditional Modes. Between these extremes, a useful tradeoff
between approximation quality and runtime is established. Experiments on models
derived from both illustrative and real problems show that approximations found
with limited search depth match or improve those obtained by state-of-the-art
methods based on message passing and linear programming.
