The line graphs are clustered and assortative. They share these topological
features with some social networks. We argue that this similarity reveals the
cliquey character of the social networks. In the model proposed here, a social
network is the line graph of an initial network of families, communities,
interest groups, school classes and small companies. These groups play the role
of nodes, and individuals are represented by links between these nodes. The
picture is supported by the data on the LiveJournal network of about 8 x 10^6
people. In particular, sharp maxima of the observed data of the degree
dependence of the clustering coefficient C(k) are associated with cliques in
the social network.
