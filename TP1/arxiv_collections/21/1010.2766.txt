A complete solid solution series between the t2g^4 perovskite ferromagnet
SrRuO3 and the diamagnetic t2g^6 perovskite LaRhO3 has been prepared. The
evolution with composition x in (SrRuO3)(1-x)(LaRhO3)(x) of the crystal
structure and electrical and magnetic properties has been studied and is
reported here. As x increases, the octahedral tilt angle gradually increases,
along with the pseudocubic lattice parameter and unit cell volume. Electrical
resistivity measurements reveal a compositionally driven metal to insulator
transition between x = 0.1 and 0.2. Ferromagnetic ordering gives over to glassy
magnetism for x > 0.3 and no magnetic ordering is found above 2 K for x > 0.5.
M_sat and Theta_CW decrease with increasing x and remain constant after x =
0.5. The magnetism appears poised between localized and itinerant behavior, and
becomes more localized with increasing x as evidenced by the evolution of the
Rhodes-Wohlfarth ratio. mu_eff per Ru is equal to the quenched spin-only S
value across the entire solid solution. Comparisons with Sr(1-x)Ca(x)RuO3
reinforce the important role of structural distortions in determining magnetic
ground state. It is suggested that electrical transport and magnetic properties
are not strongly coupled in this system.
