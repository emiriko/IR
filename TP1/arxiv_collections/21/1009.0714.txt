We study the electronic transport properties of dual-gated bilayer graphene
devices. We focus on the regime of low temperatures and high electric
displacement fields, where we observe a clear exponential dependence of the
resistance as a function of displacement field and density, accompanied by a
strong non-linear behavior in the transport characteristics. The effective
transport gap is typically two orders of magnitude smaller than the optical
band gaps reported by infrared spectroscopy studies. Detailed temperature
dependence measurements shed light on the different transport mechanisms in
different temperature regimes.
