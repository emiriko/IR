A method of radio frequency interference (RFI) suppression in radio astronomy
spectral observations is described based on the analysis of the probability
distribution of an instantaneous spectrum. This method allows the separation of
the gaussian component due to the natural radio source and the non-gaussian RFI
signal. Examples are presented in the form of %computer simulations of this
method of RFI suppression and of WSRT observations with this method applied.
The application %of real time digital signal processing for RFI suppression is
found to be effective for radio astronomy telescopes %operating in a worsening
spectral environment.
