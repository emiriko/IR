The search strategy of a CP solver is determined by the variable and value
ordering heuristics it employs and by the branching scheme it follows. Although
the effects of variable and value ordering heuristics on search effort have
been widely studied, the effects of different branching schemes have received
less attention. In this paper we study this effect through an experimental
evaluation that includes standard branching schemes such as 2-way, d-way, and
dichotomic domain splitting, as well as variations of set branching where
branching is performed on sets of values. We also propose and evaluate a
generic approach to set branching where the partition of a domain into sets is
created using the scores assigned to values by a value ordering heuristic, and
a clustering algorithm from machine learning. Experimental results demonstrate
that although exponential differences between branching schemes, as predicted
in theory between 2-way and d-way branching, are not very common, still the
choice of branching scheme can make quite a difference on certain classes of
problems. Set branching methods are very competitive with 2-way branching and
outperform it on some problem classes. A statistical analysis of the results
reveals that our generic clustering-based set branching method is the best
among the methods compared.
