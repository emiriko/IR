The problem is addressed of defining the values of functions, whose variables
tend to infinity, from the knowledge of these functions at asymptotically small
variables close to zero. For this purpose, the extrapolation by means of
different types of self-similar approximants is employed. Two new variants of
such an extrapolation are suggested. The methods are illustrated by several
examples of systems typical of chemical physics, statistical physics, and
quantum physics. The developed methods make it possible to find good
approximations for the strong-coupling limits from the knowledge of the
weak-coupling expansions.
