Min et al. (2009) presented two complementary techniques that use the
diffusion approximation to allow efficient Monte-Carlo radiation transfer in
very optically thick regions: a modified random walk and a partial diffusion
approximation. In this note, I show that the calculations required for the
modified random walk method can be significantly simplified. In particular, the
diffusion coefficient and the mass absorption coefficients required for the
modified random walk are in fact the same as the standard diffusion coefficient
and the Planck mean mass absorption coefficient.
