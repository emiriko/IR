The dynamical generation of entanglement in closed bipartite systems is
investigated in the semiclassical regime. We consider a model of two particles,
initially prepared in a product of coherent states, evolving in time according
to a generic Hamiltonian, and derive a formula for the linear entropy of the
reduced density matrix using the semiclassical propagator in the coherent-state
representation. The formula is explicitly written in terms of quantities that
define the stability of classical trajectories of the underlying classical
system. The formalism is then applied to the problem of two nonlinearly coupled
harmonic oscillators and the result is shown to be in remarkable agreement with
the exact quantum measure of entanglement in the short-time regime. An
important byproduct of our approach is a unified semiclassical formula which
contemplates both the coherent-state propagator and its complex conjugate.
