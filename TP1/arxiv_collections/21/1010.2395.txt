Recently, two nearby prominent starburst galaxies, M82 and NGC253, have been
detected as point-like sources with gamma-ray telescopes at TeV energies [1]
[2]. It has been claimed that these detections show that the cosmic ray
intensity in the starburst galaxies is three orders of magnitude higher than in
the Milky Way galaxy, assuming that the observed gamma rays arise due to pion
production of cosmic rays interacting with the ambient gas. The observed
spectrum is flatter than the cosmic ray spectrum in the Milky Way galaxy, and
this could be due to the much higher gas density in the starburst galaxies [3].
The interpretation seems to be in line with the Ginzburg-model of the origin of
cosmic rays according to which the cosmic rays are accelerated in the shells of
supernova remnants. As an immediate corollary it follows that the cosmic ray
driven gamma ray luminosity should scale with the gas density and supernova
rate. At lower energies, gamma-ray measurements with the Fermi LAT instrument
could provide support for this scaling [4]. However, there are nagging doubts
about the interpretation of the observations at very high energies. At the
distance of the observed galaxies, point-like sources cannot be discriminated
from diffuse emission for an angular resolution of the order of 0.1 deg. Hence,
the question about the contribution of unresolved point-like sources to the
gamma-ray luminosity arises.
