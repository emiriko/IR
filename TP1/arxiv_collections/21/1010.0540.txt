We consider the Proca equation which is the Maxwell equation of
electromagnetism for a massive particle, in the ultra relativistic limit using
Snyder-Sidharth Hamiltonian. There is now an extra parity non-conserving term
and we investigate the consequence both for the Proca equation and the Maxwell
equation.
