Several laser techniques have been suggested and demonstrated recently for
preparing polarizable molecules in rapidly spinning states with a disc-like
angular distribution. We consider motion of these spinning discs in
inhomogeneous fields, and show that the molecular trajectories may be precisely
controlled by the tilt of the plane of the laser-induced rotation. The
feasibility of the scheme is illustrated by optical deflection of linear
molecules twirled by two delayed cross-polarized laser pulses. These results
open new ways for many applications involving molecular focusing, guiding and
trapping, and may be suitable for separating molecular mixtures by optical and
static fields.
