This fluid dynamics video describes droplet impingement experiments performed
on superhydrophobic surfaces. When droplets of pure water are impinged upon
superhydrophobic surfaces, a region of thin coherent jets are observed for
Weber numbers between 5 and 15. Also, peripheral splashing is observed for
Weber numbers above about 200. When the viscosity of the droplet is increased
by mixing glycerol with the water, the thin jets are not observed and
peripheral splashing is delayed somewhat. In the Weber number range where pure
water droplets are observed to splash peripherally, the water/glycerol droplets
are observed to have two-pronged jets.
