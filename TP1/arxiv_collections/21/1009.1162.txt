We present an attempt at a critical overview of the current status of
modeling for high-pT processes in nuclei. The paper covers several topics
including coherence phenomena, in particular gluon shadowing and CGC; nuclear
effects related to the restrictions imposed by energy conservation at large xL
and xT ; space-time development of hadronization of highly virtual light and
heavy partons and the related time scales; and the role of early production and
subsequent attenuation of pre-hadrons in a dense medium. We identify several
intriguing problems in the current paradigms for high-pT processes and propose
solutions for some of them.
