This thesis aims to study how amending certain astrophysical observable of
quark stars due to presence of magnetic field. To do this we need to obtain
Equation of State (EOS) and consider the stability of Strange Quark Matter
(made up of quarks u, d and s) cold dense and magnetized in stellar equilibrium
(beta equilibrium, conservation of the baryonic number and charge neutrality).
We will work using the phenomenological MIT Bag model. The stability of the
Magnetized Strange Quark Matter (MSQM) is studied taking into account the
variation of parameters from the model: s quark mass, baryonic density,
magnetic field and the Bag parameter. Results obtained were compared with those
of magnetized normal quark matter (only u and d quarks in beta equilibrium) as
well as the Strange Quark Matter (SQM). It is found that the energy per baryon
decreases with the increasing magnetic field which implies that the MSQM is
more stable than SQM. The Equations of State previously obtained are used to
obtain stable configurations of magnetized strange stars checking that the
magnetic field helps to reduce Mass-Radius (M-R) ratio of the star.
