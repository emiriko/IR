We study the effect of uniform uniaxial strain on the ground state electronic
configuration of a thin film manganite. Our model Hamiltonian includes the
double-exchange, the Jahn-Teller electron-lattice coupling, and the
antiferromagnetic superexchange. The strain arises due to the lattice mismatch
between an insulating substrate and a manganite which produces a tetragonal
distortion. This is included in the model via a modification of the hopping
amplitude and the introduction of an energy splitting between the Mn e_g
levels. We analyze the bulk properties of half-doped manganites and the
electronic reconstruction at the interface between a ferromagnetic and metallic
manganite and the insulating substrate. The strain drives an orbital selection
modifying the electronic properties and the magnetic ordering of manganites and
their interfaces.
