We report on optical orientation of Mn^2+ in bulk GaAs under application of
weak longitudinal magnetic field (B <= 100 mT). The manganese spin polarization
of 25% is directly evaluated using spin flip Raman scattering spectroscopy. The
dynamical polarization of Mn^2+ occurs due to s-d exchange interaction with
optically oriented conduction band electrons. Time-resolved photoluminescence
uncovers nontrivial electron spin dynamics where the oriented Mn^2+ ions tend
to stabilize the electron spin.
