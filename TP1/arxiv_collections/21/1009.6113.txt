In this chapter we summarize recent developments in the study of kinetically
constrained models (KCMs) as models for glass formers. After recalling the
definition of the KCMs which we cover we study the possible occurrence of
ergodicity breaking transitions and discuss in some detail how, before any such
transition occurs, relaxation timescales depend on the relevant control
parameter (density or temperature). Then we turn to the main issue: the
prediction of KCMs for dynamical heterogeneities. We focus in particular on
multipoint correlation functions and susceptibilities, and decoupling in the
transport coefficients. Finally we discuss the recent view of KCMs as being at
first order coexistence between an active and an inactive space-time phase.
