The ATLAS trigger has been used very successfully to collect collision data
during 2009 and 2010 LHC running at centre of mass energies of 900 GeV, 2.36
TeV, and 7 TeV. This paper presents the ongoing work to commission the ATLAS
trigger with proton collisions, including an overview of the performance of the
trigger based on extensive online running. We describe how the trigger has
evolved with increasing LHC luminosity and give a brief overview of plans for
forthcoming LHC running.
