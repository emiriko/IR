We discuss dynamical response of odd-frequency Cooper pairs to
electromagnetic field. By using the quasiclassical Green function method, we
calculate the surface impedance (Z=R-iX) of a normal metal thin film which
covers a superconductor. In contrast to the standard relation (i.e., R << X),
the surface impedance in spin-triplet proximity structures shows anomalous
behavior (i.e., R>X) at low temperatures. This unusual relation is a result of
the penetration of odd-frequency pairs into the normal metal and reflects the
negative Cooper pair density.
