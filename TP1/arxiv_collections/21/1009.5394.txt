A major part of the many thermally driven processes in our natural
environment as well as in engineering solutions of Carnot-type machinery is
based on the second law of thermodynamics (or principle of entropy increase).
An interesting link between macroscopically observable quantities of an
ensemble (state variables) and the thermal velocity of its individual
constituents such as molecules in a liquid is provided by the Brownian motion
of suspended larger particles. We postulate a "frustrated Brownian motion" that
occurs if these particles get partially trapped in an environment of suitable
geometrical conditions. This dissipates a small fraction of the kinetic energy
attended with the Brownian motion and deposits it inside the trap, and so this
constitutes a mechanism that by itself transfers thermal energy from cold to
warm. We note that this is just a marginally admitted, slowly evolving effect
driven by a thermodynamic quasi-equilibrium, thus being of limited efficiency
in terms of energy density attainable per unit of time. However, a simple
experiment suggests that this process indeed is allowed to take place, and the
envisaged applications then are straightforward.
