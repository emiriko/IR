We report a method to pattern monolayer graphene nanoconstriction field
effect transistors (NCFETs) with critical dimensions below 10 nm. NCFET
fabrication is enabled by the use of feedback controlled electromigration (FCE)
to form a constriction in a gold etch mask that is first patterned using
conventional lithographic techniques. The use of FCE allows the etch mask to be
patterned on size scales below the limit of conventional nanolithography. We
observe the opening of a confinement-induced energy gap as the NCFET width is
reduced, as evidenced by a sharp increase in the NCFET on/off ratio. The on/off
ratios we obtain with this procedure can be larger than 1000 at room
temperature for the narrowest devices; this is the first report of such large
room temperature on/off ratios for patterned graphene FETs.
