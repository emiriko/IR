For nanostructured materials, strain is of fundamental importance in
stabilizing a specific crystallographic phase, modifying electronic properties,
and in consequence their magnetism when it applies. Here we describe a magnetic
shape memory alloy in which nanostructure confinement strain influences the
crystallographic phase and the electronic and magnetic properties of the
resulting nanowires. We use first-principles calculations on shape memory MnAs
nanostructures to study the influence of strain on crystal phases, which arises
from surfaces. We show that MnAs nanowires down to two nanometers can be stable
in a new crystal phase different from bulk hexagonal and induced by
one-dimensionality. The changes between structures through use of strain
require the existence of twin domains. Our analysis suggests that the
strain-induced structural transition, demonstrated here in MnAs compounds,
could be extended to other (magnetic) shape memory nanowire systems for
applications ranging from mechanical to magneto-electronic devices.
