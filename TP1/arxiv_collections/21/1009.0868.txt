We investigate whether and how different fragmentation properties of quarks
and gluons affect identified particle spectra. We present a systematic study of
$\pi$, $K$ and $p$ production in minimum bias (inelastic, non-diffractive),
two- and three-jet events at RHIC, Tevatron and LHC energies. Through the study
of two- and three-jet events and various jet-production channels we can
directly access the fragmentation properties of quark and gluon jets. We
present MC estimate for the contribution of quark and gluon jets to individual
particle species spectra, that can be compared to experimental results and test
our current knowledge of the physics behind particle production inside jets.
