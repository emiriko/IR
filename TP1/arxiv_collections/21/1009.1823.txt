We employ infinite ergodic theory to show that the even Stern-Brocot sequence
and the Farey sequence are uniformly distributed mod 1 with respect to certain
canonical weightings. As a corollary we derive the precise asymptotic for the
Lebesgue measure of continued fraction sum-level sets as well as connections to
asymptotic behaviours of geometrically and arithmetically restricted Poincar\'e
series. Moreover, we give relations of our main results to elementary
observations for the Stern-Brocot tree.
