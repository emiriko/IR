In this paper, we study the statistical properties of bookmarking behaviors
in Delicious.com. We find that the interevent time distributions of bookmarking
decays powerlike as interevent time increases at both individual and population
level. Remarkably, we observe a significant change in the exponent when
interevent time increases from intra-day to inter-day range. In addition,
dependence of exponent on individual Activity is found to be different in the
two ranges. These results suggests that mechanisms driving human actions are
different in intra- and inter-day range. Instead of monotonically increasing
with Activity, we find that inter-day exponent peaks at value around 3. We
further show that less active users are more likely to resemble poisson process
in bookmarking. Based on the temporal-preference model, preliminary
explanations for this dependence have been given . Finally, a universal
behavior in inter-day scale is observed by considering the rescaled variable.
