New estimates of the critical exponents have been obtained from the
field-theoretical renormalization group using a new method for summing
divergent series. The results almost coincide with the central values obtained
by Le Guillou and Zinn-Justin (the so-called "standard values"), but have lower
uncertainty. It has been shown that usual field-theoretical estimates
implicitly imply the smoothness of the coefficient functions. The last
assumption is open for discussion in view of the existence of the oscillating
contribution to the coefficient functions. The appropriate interpretation of
the last contribution is necessary both for the estimation of the systematic
errors in the "standard values" and for a further increase in accuracy.
