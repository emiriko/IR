The common attribute of all Big Bang cosmologies is that they are based on
the assumption that the universe is expanding. However examination of the
evidence for this expansion clearly favours a static universe. The major topics
considered are: Tolman surface brightness, angular size, type 1a supernovae,
gamma ray bursts, galaxy distributions, quasar distributions, X-ray background
radiation, cosmic microwave background radiation, radio source counts, quasar
variability and the Butcher--Oemler effect. An analysis of the best raw data
for these topics shows that they are consistent with expansion only if there is
evolution that cancels the effects of expansion. An alternate cosmology,
curvature cosmology, is in full agreement with the raw data. This tired-light
cosmology predicts a well defined static and stable universe and is fully
described. It not only predicts accurate values for the Hubble constant and the
temperature of cosmic microwave background radiation but shows excellent
agreement with most of the topics considered. Curvature cosmology also predicts
the deficiency in solar neutrino production rate and can explain the anomalous
acceleration of {\it Pioneer} 10.
