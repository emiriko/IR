Based on density functional calculations we predict water ice to attain two
new crystal structures with Pbca and Cmcm symmetry at 7.6 and 15.5 Mbar,
respectively. The known high pressure ice phases VII, VIII, X, and Pbcm as well
as the Pbca phase are all insulating and composed of two interpenetrating
hydrogen bonded networks, but the Cmcm structure is metallic and consists of
corrugated sheets of H and O atoms. The H atoms are squeezed into octahedral
positions between next-nearest O atoms while they occupy tetrahedral positions
between nearest O atoms in the ice X, Pbcm, and Pbca phases.
