The problem of estimating the tail index from truncated data is addressed in
Chakrabarty and Samorodnitsky (2009). In that paper, a sample based (and hence
random) choice of k is suggested, and it is shown that the choice leads to a
consistent estimator of the inverse of the tail index. In this paper, the
second order behavior of the Hill estimator with that choice of k is studied,
under some additional assumptions. In the untruncated situation, it is well
known that asymptotic normality of the Hill estimator follows from the
assumption of second order regular variation of the underlying distribution.
Motivated by this, we show the same in the truncated case in light of the
second order regular variation.
