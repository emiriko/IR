Binder liked ratios of baryon number are firstly suggested in relativistic
heavy ion collisions. Using 3D-Ising model, the critical behavior of Binder
ratios and ratios of high order cumulants of order parameter are fully
presented. Binder ratio is shown to be a step function of temperature. The
critical point is the intersection of the ratios of different system sizes
between two platforms. From low to high temperature through the critical point,
the ratios of third order cumulants change their values from negative to
positive in a valley shape, and ratios of fourth order cumulants oscillate
around zero. The normalized ratios, like the Skewness and Kurtosis, do not
diverge with correlation length, in contrary with corresponding cumulants.
Applications of these characters in search critical point in relativistic heavy
ion collisions are discussed.
