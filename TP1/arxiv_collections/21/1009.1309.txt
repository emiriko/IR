The methods of statistical mechanics are applied to two-dimensional foams
under macroscopic agitation. A new variable -- the total cell curvature -- is
introduced, which plays the role of energy in conventional statistical
thermodynamics. The probability distribution of the number of sides for a cell
of given area is derived. This expression allows to correlate the distribution
of sides ("topological disorder") to the distribution of sizes ("geometrical
disorder") in a foam. The model predictions agree well with available
experimental data.
