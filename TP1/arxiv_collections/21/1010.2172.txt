We have developed a general formalism to compute Sommerfeld enhancement (SE)
factors for a multi-state system of fermions, in all possible spin
configurations and with generic long-range interactions. We show how to include
such SE effects in an accurate calculation of the thermal relic density for
WIMP dark matter candidates. We apply the method to the MSSM and perform a
numerical study of the relic abundance of neutralinos with arbitrary
composition and including the SE due to the exchange of the W and Z bosons,
photons and Higgses. We find that the relic density can be suppressed by a
factor of a few in a seizable region of the parameter space, mostly for
Wino-like neutralino with mass of a few TeV, and up to an order of magnitude
close to a resonance.
