We develop a Galois theory for systems of linear difference equations with
periodic parameters, for which we also introduce linear difference algebraic
groups. We then apply this to constructively test if solutions of linear
q-difference equations, with complex q, not a root of unity, satisfy any
polynomial q'-difference equations with q' being a root of unity.
