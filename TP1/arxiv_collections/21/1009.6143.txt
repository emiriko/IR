Scattering of electromagnetic (EM) waves by many small particles (bodies)
embedded in a homogeneous medium is studied. Physical properties of the
particles are described by their boundary impedances. The limiting equation is
obtained for the effective EM field in the limiting medium, in the limit $a\to
0$, where $a$ is the characteristic size of a particle and the number $M(a)$ of
the particles tends to infinity at a suitable rate. The proposed theory allows
one to create a medium with an inhomogeneous permeability. The main new
physical result is the explicit analytical formula for the permeability
$\mu(x)$ of the limiting medium. While the initial medium has a constant
permeability $\mu_0$, the limiting medium, obtained as a result of embedding
many small particles with prescribed boundary impedances, has a non-homogeneous
permeability which is expressed analytically in terms of the density of the
distribution of the small particles and their boundary impedances.
