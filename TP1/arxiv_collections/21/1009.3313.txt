Renormalization of non-magnetic and magnetic impurities due to electron
double occupancy prohibition is derived analytically by an improved Gutzwiller
approximation. Non-magnetic impurities are effectively weakened by the same
renormalization factor as that for the hopping amplitude, whereas magnetic
impurities are strengthened by the square root of the spin-exchange
renormalization factor, in contrast to results by the conventional Gutzwiller
approximation. We demonstrate it by showing that transition matrix elements of
number operators between assumed excited states and between an assumed ground
state and excited states are renormalized differently than diagonal matrix
elements. Deviation from such simple renormalization with a factor is also
discussed. In addition, as related calculation, we correct an error in
treatment of renormalization of charge interaction in the literature. Namely,
terms from the second order of the transition matrix elements are strongly
suppressed. Since all these results do not depend on the signs of impurity
potential or charge interaction parameter, they are valid both in attractive
and repulsive cases.
