An understanding of wind speed and direction as a function of height are
critical to the proper modeling of atmospheric turbulence. We have used
radiosonde data from launch sites near significant astronomical observatories
and created mean profiles of wind speed and direction and have also computed
Richardson number profiles. Using data from the last 30 years, we extend the
1977 Greenwood wind profile to include parameters that show seasonal variations
and differences in location. The added information from our models is useful
for the design of adaptive optics systems and other imaging systems. Our
analysis of the Richardson number suggests that persistent turbulent layers may
be inferred when low values are present in our long term averaged data.
Knowledge of the presence of these layers may help with planning for adaptive
optics and laser communications.
