For this study we have simulated the 28Ni58+28Ni58 and 26Fe58+26Fe58 systems
at incident energies ranging from 45 MeV/nucleon to 105 MeV/nucleon by using
soft equation of state. The geometry of reactions chosen are = b/bmax = 0.2,
0.4, 0.5, 0.6, and 0.7.The Px/A is becoming more positive for neutron - rich
system 26Fi58 as compared to neutron-poor system 28Ni58. This point towards the
higher value of balance energy for 26Fi58 system. Further study in this
direction is ongoing.
