Using symmetry analysis we systematically present a higher-dimensional
similarity transformation reducing the (3+1)-dimensional inhomogeneous
nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) equation with variable coefficients and parabolic
potential to the (1+1)-dimensional NLS equation with constant coefficients.
This transformation allows us to relate certain class of localized exact
solutions of the (3+1)-dimensional case to the variety of solutions of
integrable NLS equation of (1+1)-dimensional case. As an example, we
illustrated our technique using two lowest order rational solutions of the NLS
equation as seeding functions to obtain rogue wave-like solutions localized in
three dimensions that have complicated evolution in time including interactions
between two time-dependent rogue wave solutions. The obtained three-dimensional
rogue wave-like solutions may raise the possibility of relative experiments and
potential applications in nonlinear optics and BECs.
