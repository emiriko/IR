Additional component in multi-layer epitaxial graphene grown on the
C-terminated surface of SiC, which exhibits the characteristic electronic
properties of a AB-stacked graphene bilayer, is identified in magneto-optical
response of this material. We show that these inclusions represent a
well-defined platform for accurate magneto-spectroscopy of unperturbed graphene
bilayers.
