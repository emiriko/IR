Multi-epoch X-ray spectroscopy (0.3-25 keV) of the Seyfert 1.2 galaxy Mrk 79
(UGC 3973) spanning nearly eight years and a factor of three in broadband flux
are analysed. The data are obtained at seven epochs with either XMM-Newton or
Suzaku. Comparison with contemporaneous RXTE monitoring indicate that all flux
states of Mrk 79 are represented by the data. The spectra are fitted in a
self-consistent manner adopting a power law and ionised reflection to describe
the broadband continuum. Modification of the spectra by a distant photoionised
medium, seen predominantly in emission, are also included. Under the assumption
that the inner disk is at the innermost stable circular orbit, our blurred
reflection models give a spin of a = 0.7+/-0.1. The reflection component in
each spectrum is weaker than predicted by simple reflection models. If the
illuminating X-ray emission is produced by flares above the disk that move at
mildly relativistic velocities, however, diminished reflection is expected.
Light bending due to strong gravity near black holes can influence how the
illuminating and reflected flux are observed; variations in Mrk 79 do not
suggest that light bending is important in this source.
