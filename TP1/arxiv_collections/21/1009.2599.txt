We investigate the behaviour of the accretion discs in the outbursts of the
low-mass black-hole X-ray binaries (BHXRB), an overview of which we have
presented previously. Almost all of the systems in which there are sufficient
observations in the most disc dominated states show a variation of the disc
luminosity with temperature close to L ~\propto T^4. This in turn implies that
in these states, the disc radius, R_in, and the colour correction factor,
f_col, are almost constant. Deviations away from the T^4 law are observed at
the beginning and end of the most disc dominated states, during the
intermediate states. Although these could be explained by an inward motion of
the accretion disc, they are more likely to be the result of an increase in the
value of f_col as the disc fraction decreases. By comparing the expected and
observed disc luminosities, we place approximate limits on the allowed
distances and masses of the BHXRB system. In a number of cases, the measured
distances and masses of the BHXRB system indicate that it is possible that the
black hole may be spinning.
