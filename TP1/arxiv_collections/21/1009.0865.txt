We investigate whether size imposes a fundamental constraint on the
efficiency of small thermal machines. We analyse in detail a model of a small
self-contained refrigerator consisting of three qubits. We show analytically
that this system can reach the Carnot efficiency, thus demonstrating that there
exists no complementarity between size and efficiency.
