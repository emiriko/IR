Circumstellar discs of Be stars are thought to be formed from material
ejected from a fast-spinning central star. This material possesses large
amounts of angular momentum and settles in a quasi-Keplerian orbit around the
star. This simple description outlines the basic issues that a successful disc
theory must address: 1) What is the mechanism responsible for the mass
ejection? 2) What is the final configuration of the material? 3) How the disc
grows? With the very high angular resolution that can be achieved with modern
interferometers operating in the optical and infrared we can now resolve the
photosphere and immediate vicinity of nearby Be stars. Those observations are
able to provide very stringent tests for our ideas about the physical processes
operating in those objects. This paper discusses the basic hydrodynamics of
viscous decretion discs around Be stars. The model predictions are
quantitatively compared to observations, demonstrating that the viscous
decretion scenario is currently the most viable theory to explain the discs
around Be stars.
