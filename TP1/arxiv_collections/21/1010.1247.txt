We present stellar population age and metallicity trends for a sample of 59
S0 galaxies based on optical SDSS and NIR J & H photometry. When combined with
optical g and r passband imaging data from the SDSS archive and stellar
population models, we obtain radial age and metallicity trends out to at least
5 effective radii for most of the galaxies in our sample. The sample covers a
range in stellar mass and light concentration. We find an average central
light-weighted age of ~ 4 Gyr and central metallicity [Z/H] ~ 0.2 dex. Almost
all galaxies show a negative metallicity gradient from the center out, with an
average value of Delta[Z/H]/Delta(log(r/Re)) = -0.6. An age increase, decrease,
and minimal change with radius is observed for 58%, 19%, and 23%, respectively,
for a mean age gradient of Delta(age)/Delta(log(r/Re)) = 2.3 Gyr dex^{-1}. For
14 out of 59 galaxies, the light-weighted age of the outer region is greater
than 10 Gyr. We find that galaxies with both lower mass and lower concentration
have younger light-weighted ages and lower light-weighted metallicities. This
mass-metallicity relation extends into the outer regions of our S0 galaxies.
Our results are consistent with the formation of S0 galaxies through the
transformation of spiral galaxy disks. Determining the structural component
that makes up the outer region of galaxies with old outksirts is a necessary
step to understand the formation history of S0 galaxies.
