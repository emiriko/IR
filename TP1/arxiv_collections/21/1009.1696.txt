We study the equilibrium properties of dipolar Bose and Fermi gases at finite
temperatures. We recently developed a variational ansatz for the phase-space
distribution function of a dipolar Fermi gas at finite temperatures. We extend
the variational formalism to a Bose gas and discuss the effect of dipolar
interactions with different statistics on the thermal equilibrium, with
particular emphasis on the deformation in momentum space. We examine the
stability of the system by varying the temperature, trap aspect ratio and the
dipole moment. In addition, we discuss how deformation in both real and
momentum space can be observed in the high-temperature regime, which is
relevant for the current experiments at JILA [Ni et al. Science 322, 231
(2008)] and at University of Tokyo [Aikawa et al. New. J. Phys. 11, 055035
(2009)].
