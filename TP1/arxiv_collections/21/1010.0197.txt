The methods of light-front quantization and Pauli-Villars regularization are
applied to a nonperturbative calculation of the dressed-electron state in
quantum electrodynamics. This is intended as a test of the methods in a gauge
theory, as a precursor to possible methods for the nonperturbative solution of
quantum chromodynamics. The electron state is truncated to include at most two
photons and no positrons in the Fock basis, and the wave functions of the
dressed state are used to compute the electrons's anomalous magnetic moment. A
choice of regularization that preserves the chiral symmetry of the massless
limit is critical for the success of the calculation.
