We measured a spin polarization above a Pt (111) surface in the vicinity of a
Co nanostripe by spin-polarized scanning tunneling spectroscopy. The spin
polarization is exponentially decaying away from the Pt/Co interface and is
detectable at distances larger than 1 nm. By performing self-consistent
ab-initio calculations of the electronic-structure for a related model system
we reveal the interplay between the induced magnetic moments within the Pt
surface and the spin-resolved electronic density of states above the surface.
