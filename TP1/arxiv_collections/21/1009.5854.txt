The greatest root distribution occurs everywhere in classical multivariate
analysis, but even under the null hypothesis the exact distribution has
required extensive tables or special purpose software. We describe a simple
approximation, based on the Tracy--Widom distribution, that in many cases can
be used instead of tables or software, at least for initial screening. The
quality of approximation is studied, and its use illustrated in a variety of
setttings.
