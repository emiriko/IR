We investigate effects of the Coulomb force on the nuclear pairing properties
by performing the Gogny Hartree-Fock-Bogolyubov calculations for the $N=20$,
$28$, $50$, $82$ and $126$ nuclei. The Coulomb force reduces the proton pair
energy and the even-odd mass difference by about 25%, except for nuclei at and
around the proton shell or subshell closure. We then propose a renormalization
scheme via a reduction factor $\gamma_p$ for the proton pairing channel. It is
found that a single value of $\gamma_p(=0.90)$ well takes account of the
Coulombic effect, for nuclei covering wide range of the mass number and the
neutron excess including the nuclei around the shell or subshell closure.
