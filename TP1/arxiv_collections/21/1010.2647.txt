In these three lectures I discuss the present status of high-energy
astroparticle physics including Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECR),
high-energy gamma rays, and neutrinos. The first lecture is devoted to
ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. After a brief introduction to UHECR I discuss
the acceleration of charged particles to highest energies in the astrophysical
objects, their propagation in the intergalactic space, recent observational
results by the Auger and HiRes experiments, anisotropies of UHECR arrival
directions, and secondary gamma rays produced by UHECR. In the second lecture I
review recent results on TeV gamma rays. After a short introduction to
detection techniques, I discuss recent exciting results of the H.E.S.S., MAGIC,
and Milagro experiments on the point-like and diffuse sources of TeV gamma
rays. A special section is devoted to the detection of extragalactic magnetic
fields with TeV gamma-ray measurements. Finally, in the third lecture I discuss
Ultra-High-Energy (UHE) neutrinos. I review three different UHE neutrino
detection techniques and show the present status of searches for diffuse
neutrino flux and point sources of neutrinos.
