We study spin squeezing, negative correlations, and concurrence in the
quantum kicked top model. We prove that the spin squeezing and negative
correlations are equivalent for spin systems with only symmetric Dicke states
populated. We numerically analyze spin squeezing parameters and concurrence in
this model, and find that the maximal spin squeezing direction, which refers to
the minimal pairwise correlation direction, is strongly influenced by quantum
chaos. Entanglement (spin squeezing) sudden death and sudden birth occur
alternatively for the periodic and quasi-periodic cases, while only
entanglement (spin squeezing) sudden death is found for the chaotic case.
