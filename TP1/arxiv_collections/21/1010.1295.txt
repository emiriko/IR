We consider the optimal packet scheduling problem in a single-user energy
harvesting wireless communication system. In this system, both the data packets
and the harvested energy are modeled to arrive at the source node randomly. Our
goal is to adaptively change the transmission rate according to the traffic
load and available energy, such that the time by which all packets are
delivered is minimized. Under a deterministic system setting, we assume that
the energy harvesting times and harvested energy amounts are known before the
transmission starts. For the data traffic arrivals, we consider two different
scenarios. In the first scenario, we assume that all bits have arrived and are
ready at the transmitter before the transmission starts. In the second
scenario, we consider the case where packets arrive during the transmissions,
with known arrival times and sizes. We develop optimal off-line scheduling
policies which minimize the time by which all packets are delivered to the
destination, under causality constraints on both data and energy arrivals.
