Two-electron correlated spectra of non-sequential double ionization below
laser-intensity threshold are known to exhibit back-to-back scattering of the
electrons, viz., the anticorrelation of the electrons. Currently, the widely
accepted interpretation of the anticorrelation is recollision-induced
excitation of the ion plus subsequent field ionization of the second electron.
We argue that another mechanism, namely simultaneous electron emission, when
the time of return of the rescattered electron is equal to the time of
liberation of the bounded electron (the ion has no time for excitation), can
also explain the anticorrelation of the electrons in the deep below
laser-intensity threshold regime. Our conclusion is based on the results of the
numerical solution of the time-dependent Schr\"{o}dinger equation for a model
system of two one-dimensional electrons as well as an adiabatic analytic model
that allows for a closed-form solution.
