The leading $1/N_c$ behaviour of Unitarised Chiral Perturbation Theory
distinguishes the nature of the $\rho$ and the $\sigma$. At one loop order the
$\rho$ is a ${\bar q}q$ meson, while the $\sigma$ is not. However, semi-local
duality between resonances and Regge behaviour cannot be satisfied for larger
$N_c$, if such a distinction holds. While the $\sigma$ at $N_c=3$ is inevitably
dominated by its di-pion component, Unitarised Chiral Perturbation Theory
beyond one loop order reveals that as $N_c$ increases above 6-8, the $\sigma$
has a sub-dominant ${\bar q}q$ fraction up at 1.2 GeV. Remarkably this ensures
semi-local duality is fulfilled for the range of $N_c \lesssim 15$, where the
unitarisation procedure adopted applies.
