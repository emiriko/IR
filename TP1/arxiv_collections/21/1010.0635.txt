We obtained the exact expression of the electric potential in the space
around a nanowall that is vertically mounted on a planar cathode. The system is
designed as a cold field electron emitter or an electron tunneling line
scanner. The finite cathode-anode distance has been taking into account. The
analytical results are compared with that obtained by the finite- element
method.
