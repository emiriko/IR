In Little Randall-Sundrum models, the bulk couplings of the radion to
massless gauge fields can yield a greatly enhanced diphoton signal at hadron
colliders. We examine the implications of the Tevatron data for the Little
radion and also show that the 7 TeV run at the Large Hadron Collider will have
an impressive reach in this channel. The diphoton signal is crucial in the
search for a light radion, or the dual dilaton, and can potentially probe the
ultraviolet scale of the theory.
