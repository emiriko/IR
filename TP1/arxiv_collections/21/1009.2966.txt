Imaging systems based on a narrow-band tunable filter are used to obtain
Doppler velocity maps of solar features. These velocity maps are created by
taking the difference between the blue- and red-wing intensity images of a
chosen spectral line. This method has the inherent assumption that these two
images are obtained under identical conditions. With the dynamical nature of
the solar features as well as the Earth's atmosphere, systematic errors can be
introduced in such measurements. In this paper, a quantitative estimate of the
errors introduced due to variable seeing conditions for ground-based
observations is simulated and compared with real observational data for
identifying their reliability. It is shown, under such conditions, that there
is a strong cross-talk from the total intensity to the velocity estimates.
These spurious velocities are larger in magnitude for the umbral regions
compared to the penumbra or quiet-sun regions surrounding the sunspots. The
variable seeing can induce spurious velocities up to about 1 km/s It is also
shown that adaptive optics, in general, helps in minimising this effect.
