One can view contraction operators given by a canonical model of Sz.-Nagy and
Foias as being defined by a quotient module where the basic building blocks are
Hardy spaces. In this note we generalize this framework to allow the Bergman
and weighted Bergman spaces as building blocks, but restricting attention to
the case in which the operator obtained is in the Cowen-Douglas class and
requiring the multiplicity to be one. We view the classification of such
operators in the context of complex geometry and obtain a complete
classification up to unitary equivalence of them in terms of their associated
vector bundles and their curvatures.
