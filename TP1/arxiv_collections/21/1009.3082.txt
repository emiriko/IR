We developed the quasi-particle random phase approximation (QRPA) for the
neutrino scattering off even-even nuclei via neutral current (NC) and charged
cur- rent (CC). The QRPA has been successfully applied for the \beta and
\beta\beta decay of relevant nuclei. To describe neutrino scattering, general
multipole transitions by weak interactions with a finite momentum transfer are
calculated for NC and CC reaction with detailed formalism. Since we consider
neutron-proton (np) pairing as well as neutron-neutron (nn) and proton-proton
(pp) pairing correlations, the nn + pp QRPA and np QRPA are combined in a
framework, which enables to describe both NC and CC reactions in a consistent
way. Numerical results for \nu-^{12}C, -^{56}Fe and -^{56}Ni reactions are
shown to comply with other theoretical calculations and reproduce well
available experimental data.
