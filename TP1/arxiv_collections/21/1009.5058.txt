In a wino LSP scenario the annihilation cross section of winos
gravitationally bound in galaxies can be boosted by a Sommerfeld enhancement
factor which arises due to the ladder of exchanged W bosons between the initial
states. The boost factor obtained can be in the range S ~ 10^4 if the mass is
close to the resonance value of M ~ 4 TeV. In this paper we show that if one
takes into account the Sommerfeld enhancement in the relic abundance
calculation then the correct relic density is obtained for 4 TeV wino mass due
to the enhanced annihilation after their kinetic decoupling. At the same time
the Sommerfeld enhancement in the \chi \chi --> W^+ W^- annihilation channel is
sufficient to explain the positron flux seen in PAMELA data without
significantly exceeding the observed antiproton signal. We also show that (e^-
+ e^+) and gamma ray signals are broadly compatible with the Fermi-LAT
observations. In conclusion we show that a 4 TeV wino DM can explain the
positron and antiproton fluxes observed by PAMELA and at the same time give a
thermal relic abundance of CDM consistent with WMAP observations.
