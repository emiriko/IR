Hamiltonian models based on two different infrared approximations are studied
in order to obtain an explicit comparison with the standard analysis of the
infrared contributions, occurring in the relativistically covariant
perturbative formulation of Quantum Electrodynamics. Moller operators,
preserving respectively the Hilbert scalar product, for the Coulomb-gauge
models, and an indefinite metric, for the models formulated in Feynman's gauge,
are obtained in the presence of an infrared cutoff, after the removal of an
adiabatic switching and with the aid of a suitable mass renormalization. In the
presence of a dipole approximation, spurious contributions to the infrared
factors are shown to necessarily arise in Feynman's gauge, with respect both to
the Coulomb-gauge model and to the amplitudes of Quantum Electrodynamics, and
the connection of this result with a recent work on the Gupta-Bleuler
formulation of non-relativistic models is discussed. It is finally proven that
by dropping the dipole approximation and adopting an expansion around a fixed
charged particle four-momentum, first introduced and employed in the study of
the infrared problem by Bloch and Nordsieck, the infrared diagrammatic is fully
reproduced and spurious low-energy effects are avoided.
