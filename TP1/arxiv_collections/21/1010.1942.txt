Recent approaches to quark confinement are reviewed, with an emphasis on
their connection to renormalization group methods. Basic concepts related to
confinement are introduced: the string tension, Wilson loops and Polyakov
lines, string breaking, string tension scaling laws, center symmetry breaking,
and the deconfinement transition at non-zero temperature. Current topics
discussed include confinement on $R^3\times S^1$, the real-space
renormalization group, the functional renormalization group, and the
Schwinger-Dyson equation approach to confinement.
