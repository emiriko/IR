The pair-correlations between the positions of the six known planets in the
exoplanetary system HD 10180 are studied. There are six non-trivial and almost
equally spaced peaks. This demonstrates longer-ranged positional order between
the orbits and suggests a seventh orbit at 0.92 AU that is consistent with
these correlations.
