In the present paper, the method for describing inhomogeneous states with
local translational symmetry is proposed, based on the symmetry-dependent
interaction between the order parameter (OP) and compensating field in the
phenomenological Landau theory. It is shown that dimensionality of the
compensating field in the extended derivative is associated with representation
of the OP and does not coincide with the dimensionality of the derivative
itself. This results in the correct definition of transformational properties
of physical fields in the local Landau theory and in the equations of continuum
theory of dislocations in the system of equations of state. The mechanism is
proposed to construct the Ginzburg-Landau potential for states with local
translational symmetry that correspond to HTS states. It is shown that minimal
interaction between the superconducting OP and tensor compensating field is
responsible for electron-phonon interaction in the BCS model.
