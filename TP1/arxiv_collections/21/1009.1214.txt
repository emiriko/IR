It is found by Cai and Su that the interaction between dark energy and cold
dark matter is likely to change the sign during the cosmological evolution.
Motivated by this, we suggest a new form of interaction between dark energy and
dark matter, which changes from negative to positive as the expansion of our
universe changes from decelerated to accelerated. We find that the interacting
model is consistent with the second law of thermodynamics and the observational
constraints. And, we also discuss the unified adiabatic-squared sound speed of
the model.
