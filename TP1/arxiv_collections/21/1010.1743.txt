NF-{\kappa}B, one of key regulators of inflammation, apoptosis, and
differentiation, was found to have noisy oscillatory shuttling between the
nucleus and the cytoplasm in single cells when cells are stimulated by cytokine
TNF{\alpha}. We present the analytical analysis which uncovers the underlying
physical mechanisms of this spectacular noise-induced transition in biological
networks. Starting with the master equation describing both signaling and
transcription events in NF-{\kappa}B signaling network, we derived the
macroscopic and the Fokker-Planck equations by using van Kampen's sysem size
expansion. Using the noise-induced oscillatory signatures present in the power
spectrum, we constructed the two-dimensional phase diagram where the
noise-induced oscillation emerges in the dynamically stable parameter space.
