Observational evidence for strong magnetic fields throughout the envelopes of
evolved stars is increasing. Many of the instruments coming on line in the
near-future will be able to make further contributions to this field.
Specifically, maser polarization observations and dust/line polarization in the
sub-mm regime has the potential to finally provide a definite picture of the
magnetic field strength and configuration from the Asymptotic Giant Branch
(AGB) all the way to the Planetary Nebula phase. While current observations are
limited in sample size, strong magnetic fields appear ubiquitous at all stages
of (post-)AGB evolution. Recent observations also strongly support a field
structure that is maintained from close to the star to several thousands of AU
distance. While its origin is still unclear, the magnetic field is thus a
strong candidate for shaping the stellar outflows on the path to the planetary
nebula phase and might even play a role in determining the stellar mass-loss.
