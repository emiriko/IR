Stars of sufficiently low mass are convective throughout their interiors, and
so do not possess an internal boundary layer akin to the solar tachocline.
Because that interface figures so prominently in many theories of the solar
magnetic dynamo, a widespread expectation had been that fully convective stars
would exhibit surface magnetic behavior very different from that realized in
more massive stars. Here I describe how recent observations and theoretical
models of dynamo action in low-mass stars are partly confirming, and partly
confounding, this basic expectation. In particular, I present the results of
3--D MHD simulations of dynamo action by convection in rotating spherical
shells that approximate the interiors of 0.3 solar-mass stars at a range of
rotation rates. The simulated stars can establish latitudinal differential
rotation at their surfaces which is solar-like at ``rapid'' rotation rates
(defined within) and anti-solar at slower rotation rates; the differential
rotation is greatly reduced by feedback from strong dynamo-generated magnetic
fields in some parameter regimes. I argue that this ``flip'' in the sense of
differential rotation may be observable in the near future. I also briefly
describe how the strength and morphology of the magnetic fields varies with the
rotation rate of the simulated star, and show that the maximum magnetic
energies attained are compatible with simple scaling arguments.
