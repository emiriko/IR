The salient features of models of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking are
reviewed. The ideal walking idea is introduced according to which one should
carefully take into account the effects of the extended technicolor dynamics on
the technicolor dynamics itself. The effects amount at the enhancement of the
anomalous dimension of the mass of the techniquarks allowing to decouple the
Flavor Changing Neutral Currents problem from the one of the generation of the
top mass. Precision data constraints are reviewed focussing on the latest
crucial observation that the S-parameter can be computed exactly near the upper
end of the conformal window (Conformal S-parameter) with relevant consequences
on the selection of nature's next strong force. We will then introduce the
Minimal Walking Technicolor (MWT) models. In the second part of this review we
consider the interesting possibility to marry supersymmetry and technicolor.
The reason is to provide a unification of different extensions of the standard
model. For example, this means that one can recover, according to the
parameters and spectrum of the theory distinct extensions of the standard
model, from supersymmetry to technicolor and unparticle physiscs. A surprising
result is that a minimal (in terms of the smallest number of fields)
supersymmetrization of the MWT model leads to the maximal supersymmetry in four
dimensions, i.e. N=4 SYM.
