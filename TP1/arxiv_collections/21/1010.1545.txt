By using the integral method in the muon propagation through water, we
calculate the range fluctuation of high and ultra high energy muons. Many
authors divide all radiative processes into two parts, namely, the continuous
part and radiative part in their Monte Carlo simulation in order to consider
the fluctuation in the both ranges and energies of the muons, while we treat
all stochastic processes as exactly as possible, without the introduction of
the continuous parts in all stochastic processes. The validity of our Monte
Carlo method is checked by the corresponding analytical method which is
methodologically independent on the Monte Carlo procedure. Accompanied cascade
showers are generated by the direct electron pair production, bremsstrahlung
and photo-nuclear interaction. These showers are calculated by the exact Monte
Carlo Method in one dimensional way. We report survival probabilities, range
distributions and examples of individual muon behavior.
