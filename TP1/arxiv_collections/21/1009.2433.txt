Two special calorimeters are foreseen for the instrumentation of the very
forward region of the ILC detector, a luminometer designed to measure the rate
of low angle Bhabha scattering events with a precision better than 10-3 and a
low polar angle calorimeter, adjacent to the beam-pipe. The latter will be hit
by a large amount of beamstrahlung remnants. The amount and shape of these
depositions will allow a fast luminosity estimate and the determination of beam
parameters. The sensors of this calorimeter must be radiation hard. Both
devices will improve the hermeticity of the detector in the search for new
particles. Finely segmented and very compact calorimeters will match the
requirements. Due to the high occupancy fast front-end electronics is needed.
The design of the calorimeters developed and optimised with Monte Carlo
simulations is presented. Sensors and readout electronics ASICs have been
designed and prototypes are available. Results on the performance of these
major components are summarised.
