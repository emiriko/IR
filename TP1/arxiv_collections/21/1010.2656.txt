With the recent advances in DNA sequencing, it is now possible to have
complete genomes of individuals sequenced and assembled. This rich and focused
genotype information can be used to do different population-wide studies, now
first time directly on whole genome level. We propose a way to index population
genotype information together with the complete genome sequence, so that one
can use the index to efficiently align a given sequence to the genome with all
plausible genotype recombinations taken into account. This is achieved through
converting a multiple alignment of individual genomes into a finite automaton
recognizing all strings that can be read from the alignment by switching the
sequence at any time. The finite automaton is indexed with an extension of
Burrows-Wheeler transform to allow pattern search inside the plausible
recombinant sequences. The size of the index stays limited, because of the high
similarity of individual genomes. The index finds applications in variation
calling and in primer design. On a variation calling experiment, we found about
1.0% of matches to novel recombinants just with exact matching, and up to 2.4%
with approximate matching.
