This paper proposes a relational constraint driven technique that synthesizes
test cases automatically for web applications. Using a static analysis,
servlets can be modeled as relational transducers, which manipulate backend
databases. We present a synthesis algorithm that generates a sequence of HTTP
requests for simulating a user session. The algorithm relies on backward
symbolic image computation for reaching a certain database state, given a code
coverage objective. With a slight adaptation, the technique can be used for
discovering workflow attacks on web applications.
