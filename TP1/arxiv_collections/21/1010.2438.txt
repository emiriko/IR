The stochastic simulation of biological systems is an increasingly popular
technique in bioinformatics. It often is an enlightening technique, which may
however result in being computational expensive. We discuss the main
opportunities to speed it up on multi-core platforms, which pose new challenges
for parallelisation techniques. These opportunities are developed in two
general families of solutions involving both the single simulation and a bulk
of independent simulations (either replicas of derived from parameter sweep).
Proposed solutions are tested on the parallelisation of the CWC simulator
(Calculus of Wrapped Compartments) that is carried out according to proposed
solutions by way of the FastFlow programming framework making possible fast
development and efficient execution on multi-cores.
