The goal of the work is to implement molecular phylogenetic calculations
using the Grid paradigm by means of the MrBayes software using Directed Acyclic
Graphs (DAG) jobs. In this method, a set of jobs depends on the input or the
output of other jobs. Once the runs have been successfully done, all the
results can be collected by a specific Perl script inside the defined DAG job.
For testing this methodology, we calculate the evolution of papillomavirus with
121 sequences.
