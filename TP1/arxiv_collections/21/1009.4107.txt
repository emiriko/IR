We study the frictional torque acting on particles rotating in empty space.
At zero temperature, vacuum friction transforms mechanical energy into light
emission and produces particle heating. However, particle cooling relative to
the environment occurs at finite temperatures and low rotation velocities.
Radiation emission is boosted and its spectrum significantly departed from a
hot-body emission profile as the velocity increases. Stopping times ranging
from hours to billions of years are predicted for materials, particle sizes,
and temperatures accessible to experiment. Implications for the behavior of
cosmic dust are discussed.
