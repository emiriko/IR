We develop a formalism to study tetraquarks using the generalized flip-flop
potential, which include the tetraquark potential component. Technically this
is a difficult problem, needing the solution of the Schr\"odinger equation in a
multidimensional space. Since the tetraquark may at any time escape to a pair
of mesons, here we study a simplified two-variable toy model and explore the
analogy with a cherry in a glass, but a broken one where the cherry may escape
from. We also compute the decay width in this two-variable picture, solving the
Schr\"odinger equation for the outgoing spherical wave.
