For a robust interpretation of upcoming observations from PLANCK and LHC
experiments it is imperative to understand how the inflationary dynamics of a
non-minimally coupled Higgs scalar field with gravity may affect the
determination of the inflationary observables. We make a full proper analysis
of the WMAP7+SN+BAO dataset in the context of the non-minimally coupled Higgs
inflation field with gravity. For the central value of the top quark pole mass
m_T=171.3 GeV, the fit of the inflation model with non-minimally coupled Higgs
scalar field leads to the Higgs boson mass between 143.7 and 167 GeV (95% CL).
We show that the inflation driven by a non-minimally coupled scalar field to
the Einstein gravity leads to significant constraints on the scalar spectral
index and tensor-to-scalar ratio when compared with the similar constraints
tensor to from the standard inflation with minimally coupled scalar field. We
also show that an accurate reconstruction of the Higgs potential in terms of
inflationary observables requires an improved accuracy of other parameters of
the Standard Model of particle physics as the top quark mass and the effective
QCD coupling constant.
