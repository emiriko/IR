The spin dynamics of the ferromagnetic Kondo lattice CeRuPO is investigated
by Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) at microwave frequencies of 1, 9.4, and
34~GHz. The measured resonance can be ascribed to a rarely observed bulk Ce3+
resonance in a metallic Ce compound and can be followed below the ferromagnetic
transition temperature Tc=14 K. At T>Tc the interplay between the RKKY-exchange
interaction and the crystal electric field anisotropy determines the ESR
parameters. Near Tc the spin relaxation rate is influenced by the critical
fluctuations of the order parameter.
