We present a grid of nonequilibrium ionization models for the X-ray spectra
from supernova remnants undergoing efficient diffusive shock acceleration. The
calculation follows the hydrodynamics of the blast wave as well as the
time-dependent ionization of the plasma behind the shock. The ionization state
is passed to a plasma emissivity code to compute the thermal X-ray emission,
which is combined with the emission from nonthermal synchrotron emission to
produce a self-consistent model for the thermal and nonthermal emission from
cosmic-ray dominated shocks. We show how plasma diagnostics such as the
G'-ratio of He-like ions, defined as the ratio of the sum of the
intercombination, forbidden, and satellite lines to the resonance line, can
vary with acceleration efficiency, and discuss how the thermal X-ray emission,
when the time-dependent ionization is not calculated self-consistently with the
hydrodynamics, can differ from the thermal X-ray emission from models which do
account for the hydrodynamics. Finally we compare the thermal X-ray emission
from models which show moderate acceleration (~ 35%) to the thermal X-ray
emission from test-particle models.
