Recent progress in the applications of covariant density functional theory
(CDFT) to the description of the spectroscopy of the heaviest nuclei is
reviewed. The analysis of quasiparticle spectra in actinides and the heaviest A
~ 250 nuclei provides a measure of the accuracy of the description of
single-particle energies in CDFT and an additional constraint for the choice of
effective interactions for the description of superheavy nuclei. The response
of these nuclei to the rotation is rather well described by cranked
relativistic Hartree+Bogoliubov theory and it serves as a supplementary tool in
configuration assignment in odd-mass nuclei. A systematic analysis of the
fission barriers with allowance for triaxial deformation shows that covariant
density functional theory is able to describe fission barriers on a level of
accuracy comparable with the best phenomenological macroscopic+microscopic
approaches.
