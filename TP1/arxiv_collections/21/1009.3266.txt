(Abriged) Assuming that the hydrostatic equilibrium holds between the
intracluster medium and the gravitational potential, we constrain the NFW
profiles in a sample of 44 X-ray luminous galaxy clusters observed with
XMM-Newton in the redshift range 0.1-0.3. We evaluate several systematic
uncertainties that affect our reconstruction of the X-ray masses. We measure
the concentration c200, the dark mass M200 and the gas mass fraction within
R500 in all the objects of our sample, providing the largest dataset of mass
parameters for galaxy clusters in this redshift range. We confirm that a tight
correlation between c200 and M200 is present and in good agreement with the
predictions from numerical simulations and previous observations. When we
consider a subsample of relaxed clusters that host a Low-Entropy-Core (LEC), we
measure a flatter c-M relation with a total scatter that is lower by 40 per
cent. From the distribution of the estimates of c200 and M200, with associated
statistical (15-25%) and systematic (5-15%) errors, we use the predicted values
from semi-analytic prescriptions calibrated through N-body numerical runs and
measure sigma_8*Omega_m^(0.60+-0.03)= 0.45+-0.01 (at 2 sigma level, statistical
only) for the subsample of the clusters where the mass reconstruction has been
obtained more robustly, and sigma_8*Omega_m^(0.56+-0.04) = 0.39+-0.02 for the
subsample of the 11 more relaxed LEC objects. With the further constraint from
the fgas distribution in our sample, we break the degeneracy in the
sigma_8-Omega_m plane and obtain the best-fit values sigma_8~1.0+-0.2
(0.75+-0.18 when the subsample of the more relaxed objects is considered) and
Omega_m = 0.26+-0.01.
