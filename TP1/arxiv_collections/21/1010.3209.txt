The Durham adaptive optics real-time controller was initially a proof of
concept design for a generic adaptive optics control system. It has since been
developed into a modern and powerful CPU based real-time control system,
capable of using hardware acceleration (including FPGAs and GPUs), based
primarily around commercial off the shelf hardware. It is powerful enough to be
used as the real-time controller for all currently planned 8~m class telescope
adaptive optics systems. Here we give details of this controller and the
concepts behind it, and report on performance including latency and jitter,
which is less than 10~$\mu$s for small adaptive optics systems.
