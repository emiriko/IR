We investigate quantum properties of pulsed light fields point by point in
phase space. We probe the negative region of the Wigner function of a single
photon generated by the means of waveguided parametric down-conversion. This
capability is achieved by employing loss-tolerant photon-number resolving
detection, allowing us to directly observe the oscillations of the photon
statistics in dependence of applied displacements in phase space. Our scheme is
highly mode sensitive and can reveal the single-mode character of the signal
state.
