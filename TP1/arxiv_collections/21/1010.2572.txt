This manuscript serves as an online supplement of a preprint, which presents
a study on a kind of bilayer networks where some nodes (called interconnecting
nodes) in two layers merge. A model showing an important general property of
the bilayer networks is proposed. Then the analytic discussion of the model is
compared with empirical conclusions. We present all the empirical observations
in this online supplement.
