In order to derive tensorial exchange interactions and local magnetic
anisotropies in itinerant magnetic systems, an approach combining the
Spin-Cluster Expansion with the Relativistic Disordered Local Moment scheme is
introduced. The theoretical background and computational aspects of the method
are described in detail. The exchange interactions and site resolved anisotropy
contributions for the IrMn3/Co(111) interface, a prototype for an exchange bias
system, are calculated including a large number of magnetic sites from both the
antiferromagnet and ferromagnet. Our calculations reveal that the coupling
between the two subsystems is fairly limited to the vicinity of the interface.
The magnetic anisotropy of the interface system is discussed, including effects
of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions that appear due to symmetry breaking
at the interface.
