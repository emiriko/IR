The process pe -> pe+gamma with the photon emitted along the electron beam
axis is used for luminosity measurement at HERA. In this paper the process is
calculated including one-loop QED radiative corrections. In the ZEUS
experiment, both the electron and the photon can be detected. Therefore both
photon and electron spectra with and without the gamma-e coincidence are
analyzed. We also calculate the process pe -> pel+l- which contributes to the
background in the electron tagger.
