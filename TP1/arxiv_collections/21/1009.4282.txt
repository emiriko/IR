Full-potential linearized augmented plane-wave method with the generalized
gradient approximation for the exchange-correlation potential was applied for
comparative study of elastic and electronic properties of six cubic thorium
pnictides ThPn and Th3Pn4, where Pn = P, As, and Sb. Optimized lattice
parameters, theoretical density, independent elastic constants (Cij), bulk
moduli (B), shear moduli (G), Young's moduli (Y), and Poisson's ratio ({\nu})
were obtained for the first time and analyzed in comparison with available
theoretical and experimental data. The electronic band structures, total and
partial densities of states for all ThPn and Th3Pn4 phases were examined
systematically. Moreover, the inter-atomic bonding pictures in thorium
pnictides, as well as the relative stability of ThPn versus Th3Pn4 phases were
discussed.
