We report on a deep, multiwavelength study of the galaxy cluster MACS
J1931.8-2634 using Chandra X-ray, Subaru optical, and VLA 1.4 GHz radio data.
This cluster (z=0.352) harbors one of the most X-ray luminous cool cores yet
discovered, with an equivalent mass cooling rate within the central 50 kpc is
approximately 700 solar masses/yr. Unique features observed in the central core
of MACSJ1931.8-2634 hint to a wealth of past activity that has greatly
disrupted the original cool core. We observe a spiral of relatively cool,
dense, X-ray emitting gas connected to the cool core, as well as highly
elongated intracluster light (ICL) surrounding the cD galaxy. Extended radio
emission is observed surrounding the central AGN, elongated in the east-west
direction, spatially coincident with X-ray cavities. The power input required
to inflate these `bubbles' is estimated from both the X-ray and radio emission
to reside between 4 and 14e45 erg/s, putting it among the most powerful jets
ever observed. This combination of a powerful AGN outburst and bulk motion of
the cool core have resulted in two X-ray bright ridges to form to the north and
south of the central AGN at a distance of approximately 25 kpc. The northern
ridge has spectral characteristics typical of cool cores and is consistent with
being a remnant of the cool core after it was disrupted by the AGN and bulk
motions. It is also the site of H-alpha filaments and young stars. The X-ray
spectroscopic cooling rate associated with this ridge is approximately 165
solar masses/yr, which agrees with the estimate of the star formation rate from
broad-band optical imaging (170 solar masses/yr). MACS J1931.8-2634 appears to
harbor one of most profoundly disrupted low entropy cores observed in a
cluster, and offers new insights into the survivability of cool cores in the
context of hierarchical structure formation.
