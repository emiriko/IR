Inelastic neutron scattering is used to investigate the collective magnetic
excitations of the high-temperature superconductor parent antiferromagnet
La2CuO4. We find that while the lower energy excitations are well described by
spin-wave theory, including one- and two-magnon scattering processes, the
high-energy spin waves are strongly damped near the (1/2,0) position in
reciprocal space and merge into a momentum dependent continuum. This anomalous
damping indicates the decay of spin waves into other excitations, possibly
unbound spinon pairs.
