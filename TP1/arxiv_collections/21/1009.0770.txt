Two proof-of-principle experiments towards T1-limited magnetic resonance
imaging with NV centers in diamond are demonstrated. First, a large number of
Rabi oscillations is measured and it is demonstrated that the hyperfine
interaction due to the NV's 14N can be extracted from the beating oscillations.
Second, the Rabi beats under V-type microwave excitation of the three hyperfine
manifolds is studied experimentally and described theoretically.
