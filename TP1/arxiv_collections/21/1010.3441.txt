We present results of high-resolution, low-temperature measurements of the
Hall coefficient, thermopower, and specific heat on stoichiometric YbRh2Si2.
They support earlier conclusions of an electronic (Kondo-breakdown) quantum
critical point concurring with a field induced antiferromagnetic one. We also
discuss the detachment of the two instabilities under chemical pressure. Volume
compression/expansion (via substituting Rh by Co/Ir) results in a
stabilization/weakening of magnetic order. Moderate Ir substitution leads to a
non-Fermi-liquid phase, in which the magnetic moments are neither ordered nor
screened by the Kondo effect. The so-derived zero-temperature global phase
diagram promises future studies to explore the nature of the Kondo breakdown
quantum critical point without any interfering magnetism.
