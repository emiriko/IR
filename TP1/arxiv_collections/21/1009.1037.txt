We describe the design of the Sunrise Filter Imager (SuFI) and the Image
Stabilization and Light Distribution (ISLiD) unit onboard the Sunrise balloon
borne solar observatory. This contribution provides the necessary information
which is relevant to understand the instruments working principles, the
relevant technical data, and the necessary information about calibration issues
directly related to the science data.
