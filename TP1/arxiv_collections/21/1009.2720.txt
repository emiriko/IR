We describe a deconstructed Higgsless model in which electroweak symmetry
breaking results largely from a Higgsless mechanism while the top quark mass is
generated by a topcolor mechanism. The top quark mass arises from a Yukawa
coupling to an effective top-Higgs which develops a small vacuum expectation
value. Both the heavy partners of the electoweak gauge bosons and those for the
SM fermions can be light enough to be visible at LHC.
