We present here a brief review and discussion on recent developments in the
theory of spacetime singularities. After mentioning some key motivations on the
main ideas and concepts involved, we take the approach that the singularities
will be eventually resolved by the quantum gravity effects. Some consequences
are indicated when such singularities are visible to far away observers in the
universe.
