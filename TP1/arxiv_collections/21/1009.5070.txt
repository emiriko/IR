The effects of pinning between fluxoids and vortices in the core of a neutron
star, on the dynamics of the core neutron superfluid are considered. The
pinning impedes, but does not absolutely block, any radial as well as {\em
azimuthal} motion of the neutron vortices with respect to the lattice of
fluxoids. The time scale for the coupling of rotation of the core superfluid to
the rest of the star is calculated, allowing for the effect of the finite
frictional force on the neutron vortices due to their pinning with the
fluxoids. This turns out to be the dominant mechanism for the coupling of the
core of a neutron star to its crust, as compared to the role of electron
scattering, for most cases of interest. Furthermore, different behaviors for
the post-glitch response of the core superfluid are distinguished that might be
tested against the relevant observational data. Also, a conceptually important
case (and controversial too, in the earlier studies on the role of the crustal
superfluid) is realized where a superfluid may remain decoupled in spite of an
spinning up of its vortices.
