Motivated by recent experimental observations [U. Delabre et al, Langmuir 24,
3998, 2008] we reconsider an instability of ultrathin nematic films, spread on
liquid substrates. Within a continuum elastic theory of liquid crystals, in the
harmonic approximation, we find an analytical expressions for the critical
thickness as well as for the critical wavenumber, characterizing the onset of
instability towards the stripe phase. Comparing theoretical predictions with
experimental observations, we establish the utility of surface-like term such
as an azimuthal anchoring.
