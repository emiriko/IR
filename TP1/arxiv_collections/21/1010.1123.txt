The algebraic study of the Bel-Robinson tensor proposed and initiated in a
previous work (Gen. Relativ. Gravit. {\bf 41}, see ref [11]) is achieved. The
canonical form of the different algebraic types is obtained in terms of
Bel-Robinson eigen-tensors. An algorithmic determination of the Weyl tensor
from the Bel-Robinson tensor is presented.
