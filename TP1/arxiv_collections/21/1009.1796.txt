Now a days, power has become a primary consideration in hardware design, and
is critical in computer systems especially for portable devices with high
performance and more functionality. Clock-gating is the most common technique
used for reducing processor's power. In this work clock gating technique is
applied to optimize the power of fully programmable Embedded Controller (PEC)
employing RISC architecture. The CPU designed supports i) smart instruction
set, ii) I/O port, UART iii) on-chip clocking to provide a range of frequencies
, iv) RISC as well as controller concepts. The whole design is captured using
VHDL and is implemented on FPGA chip using Xilinx .The architecture and clock
gating technique together is found to reduce the power consumption by 33.33% of
total power consumed by this chip.
