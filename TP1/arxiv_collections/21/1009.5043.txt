The broad-line region (BLR) disappears in many low-luminosity AGNs, the
reason of which is still controversial. The BLRs in AGNs are believed to be
associated with the outflows from the accretion disks. Most of the
low-luminosity AGNs (LLAGNs) contain advection dominated accretion flows
(ADAFs), which are very hot and have a positive Bernoulli parameter. ADAFs are
therefore associated with strong outflows. We estimate the cooling of the
outflows from the ADAFs, and find that the gases in such hot outflows always
cannot be cooled efficiently by bremsstrahlung radiation. The ADAF may co-exist
with the standard disk, i.e., the inner ADAF connects to the outer thin
accretion disk at radius R_tr, in the sources accreting at slightly lower than
the critical rate. For the ADAFs with >0.001 L_edd, a secondary small inner
cold disk is suggested to co-exist with the ADAF due to the condensation
process. We estimate the Compton cooling of the outflow, of which the soft seed
photons either come from the outer cold disk or the secondary inner cold disk.
It is found that the gas in the outflow far from the ADAF may be efficiently
cooled to form BLR clouds due to the soft seed photons emitted from the cold
disks, provided the transition radius of the ADAF to the outer cold disk is
small or/and the secondary small cold disk has a luminosity >0.003L_edd. The
BLR clouds can still be formed in the outflows from the outer cold thin disks,
if the transition radius is not very large. For the sources with <0.001L_edd,
the inner small cold disk is evaporated completely in the ADAF and outer thin
accretion disk may be suppressed by the ADAF, which leads to the disappearance
of the BLR. The physical implications of this scenario on the double-peaked
broad-line emitters are also discussed.
