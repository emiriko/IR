We have investigated the dynamics of entanglement between two spin-1/2 qubits
that are subject to independent kick and Gaussian pulse type external magnetic
fields analytically as well as numerically. Dyson time ordering effect on the
dynamics is found to be important for the sequence of kicks. We show that
"almost-steady" high entanglement can be created between two initially
unentangled qubits by using carefully designed kick or pulse sequences.
