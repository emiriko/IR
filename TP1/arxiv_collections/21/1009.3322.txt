Plasmon mode in a silver nanowire is theoretically studied when the nanowire
is placed on or near a silica substrate. It is found that the substrate has
much influence on the plasmon mode. For the nanowire on the substrate, the
plasmon (hybrid) mode possesses not only a long propagation length but also an
ultrasmall mode area. From the experimental point of view, this cavity-free
structure holds a great potential to study a strong coherent interaction
between the plasmon mode and single quantum system (for example, quantum dots)
embedded in the substrate.
