In May 1, 2008, researchers at Hewlett Packard (HP) announced the first
physical realization of a fundamental circuit element called memristor that
attracted so much interest worldwide. This newly found element can easily be
combined with crossbar interconnect technology which this new structure has
opened a new field in designing configurable or programmable electronic
systems. These systems in return can have applications in signal processing and
artificial intelligence. In this paper, based on the simple memristor crossbar
structure, we propose new and simple circuits for hardware implementation of
fuzzy membership functions. In our proposed circuits, these fuzzy membership
functions can have any shapes and resolutions. In addition, these circuits can
be used as a basis in the construction of evolutionary systems.
