High energy p-p, p-Pb and Pb-Pb collisions at the CERN-LHC offer
unprecedented opportunities for studying wide variety of physics at small
Bjorken-x. Here we discuss capabilities of the ALICE experiment at the CERN-LHC
for probing small-x QCD physics. A new forward electromagnetic calorimeter is
being proposed as an ALICE upgrade to explore the small-x region in more
detail.
