In the context of the Randall-Sundrum braneworld, the minimal geometric
deformation approach, which has been successfully used to generate exact
interior solutions to Einstein's field equations for static braneworld stars
with local and non-local bulk terms, is used to obtain the braneworld version
of the Schwarzschild's interior solution. Using this new solution, the
behaviour of the Weyl functions is elucidated in terms of the compactness for
different stellar distributions.
