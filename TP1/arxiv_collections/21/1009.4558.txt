All visible bodies are bound dense vertices of overlapping astroparticles
with extremely weak r^{-4} radial densities of elementary (and summary) matter
beyond human perception and instrumental resolutions. The non-empty material
space of the ancient Greeks have mathematical grounds in the self-consistent
reading of Maxwell's phenomenology and Einstein's gravitation through
continuous radial sources of classical fields.
