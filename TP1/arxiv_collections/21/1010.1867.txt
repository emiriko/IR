We device and investigate numerically a minimal yet detailed spin polaron
model that describes lightly doped CuO$_2$ layers. The low-energy physics of a
hole is studied by total-spin-resolved exact diagonalization on clusters of up
to 32 CuO$_2$ unit cells, revealing features missed by previous studies. In
particular, spin-polaron states with total spin 3/2 are the lowest eigenstates
in several regions of the Brillouin zone. In these regions, and also at other
points the quasiparticle weight is identically zero, indicating orthogonal
states to those represented in the one electron Green's function. This
highlights the importance of proper treatment of spin fluctuations in the
many-body background.
