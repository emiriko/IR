Following the famous Dirac equation, in which space, time and matter are all
connected with spinor, this paper uses the combination of these spinors to
express the state of quantum field in a new style - the global state. Thus, the
state, state equation and action function of quantum fields are all expressed
in an integrated system. Based upon this, it seems that the origin of the
principle of least action, the intrinsic connection between classical mechanics
and quantum theory can be fully exposed.
