Recent observations of UGC4879 with the Advanced Camera for Surveys on the
Hubble Space Telescope confirm that it is a nearby isolated dwarf irregular
galaxy. We measure a distance of 1.36+/-0.03 Mpc using the Tip of the Red Giant
Branch method. This distance puts UGC4879 beyond the radius of first turnaround
of the Local Group and ~700 kpc from its nearest neighbor Leo A. This isolation
makes this galaxy an ideal laboratory for studying pristine star formation
uncomplicated by interactions with other galaxies. We present the star
formation history of UGC4879 derived from simulated color-magnitude diagrams.
