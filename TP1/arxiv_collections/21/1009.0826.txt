A recapitulatory analysis of total nuclear cross sections of various nuclei
is presented, which yields detailed knowledge on the different physical
processes such as potential/resonance scatter and nuclear reactions. The
physical base for potential/resonance scatter and the threshold energy
resulting from Coulomb repulsion of nuclei are collective/oscillator models.
The part pertaining to the nuclear reactions can only be determined by the
microscopic theory (Schr\"odinger equation and strong interactions). The
physical impact is the fluence decrease of proton beams in different media and
the scatter behavior of secondary particles.
