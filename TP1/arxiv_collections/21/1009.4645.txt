Generalized mesonic Super-\v{C}erenkov Radiations (S\v{C}R) are investigated.
The energy behavior of the pionic refractive index in the low energy pionic
SCR-sector is presented. We estimated that the true coherent SCR-pion emission
is possible mainly in the SCRS-energy bands 190-315 MeV for all pions; 910-960
MeV only for positive pions, and 80-1000 GeV for all pions, in certain nuclear
reactions. We predicted that S\v{C}R-pionic band will be enlarged for the pion
energies higher than 80 GeV. The strong correlations between angle of SCR-pion
emission and (meson and projectile)-energies are evidentiated. The spectral
distributions of the SCR-pions are presented and the position of their maxima
are estimated. The agreement with the available experimental data is discussed.
