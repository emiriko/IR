(Non-)portability of Prolog programs is widely considered as an important
factor in the lack of acceptance of the language. Since 1995, the core of the
language is covered by the ISO standard 13211-1. Since 2007, YAP and SWI-Prolog
have established a basic compatibility framework. This article describes and
evaluates this framework. The aim of the framework is running the same code on
both systems rather than migrating an application. We show that today, the
portability within the family of Edinburgh/Quintus derived Prolog
implementations is good enough to allow for maintaining portable real-world
applications.
