Gribov viewed the axial anomaly as a manifestation of the collective motion
of charged fermions with arbitrarily high momenta in the vacuum. In the
presence of an external magnetic field and a chirality imbalance, this
collective motion becomes directly observable in the form of the electric
current - this is the chiral magnetic effect (CME). I give an elementary
introduction into the physics of CME, and discuss some recent developments.
