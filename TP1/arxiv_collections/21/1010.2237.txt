Attractor solutions that give dynamical reasons for dark energy to act like
the cosmological constant, or behavior close to it, are interesting
possibilities to explain cosmic acceleration. Coupling the scalar field to
matter or to gravity enlarges the dynamical behavior; we consider both
couplings together, which can ameliorate some problems for each individually.
Such theories have also been proposed in a Higgs-like fashion to induce gravity
and unify dark energy and dark matter origins. We explore restrictions on such
theories due to their dynamical behavior compared to observations of the cosmic
expansion. Quartic potentials in particular have viable stability properties
and asymptotically approach general relativity.
