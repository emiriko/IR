The understanding of the physics of lasermatter interactions in the strongly
relativistic regime is of fundamental importance. In this article, a new
mechanism of fast electron generation at the vacuum-solid boundary of intense
laser pulse interaction with overdense plasma is described. It is one that has
no analogue in classical, non-relativistic laser-plasma interactions. Here,
conclusive proof is provided that the key contribution to the fast electron
generation is given by the zero points of the vector potential. We demonstrate
that the new mechanism leads to scalings for the fast electron energy, which
explicitly depend on the plasma density, thus providing a new insight into
relativistic laser-matter interaction. Furthermore, it is shown that this new
mechanism provides the dominant contribution to the interaction by the
injection of energy into the overdense plasma delivered by attosecondduration
electron bunches. This new understanding will allow the future generation of a
single ultra-bright attosecond X-ray pulse by suitable control of the laser
pulse polarization [1]-[7]. This process will also allow single pulse
attosecond electron bunches to be generated that can be further accelerated in
laser wakefield accelerators [8]-[10]. Other applications that will benefit
from this new insight include laser driven ion accelerators [11]-[15], fast
ignition inertial confinement fusion [16]-[18] as well as fundamental studies
at the intensity frontier [19]-[20].
