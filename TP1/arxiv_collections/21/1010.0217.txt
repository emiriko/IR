We briefly summarize recent results of five TeV SNRs from radio and X-ray
observations. We focus on remeasuring kinematic distances of 5 TeV SNRs, i.e.
HESS J1732-347/SNR G353.6-0.7 (3.2 kpc), HESS J1834-087/G23.3-0.3 (also W41,
4.0 kpc), HESS J1833-105/G21.5-0.9 (4.8 kpc), HESS J1846-029/G29.7-0.3 (Kes 75,
6.3 kpc) and TeV SNR G54.1-0.3 (6.5 kpc), and studying non-thermal X-ray
emissions from two old SNRs (G353.6-0.7 and W41). These not only allow
constraining the TeV SNR basic physical properties, but also help reveal
acceleration mechanisms of TeV Gamma-rays in the SNRs which are either related
with the SNRs or the pulsar wind nebulae.
