The equation of state of a system of fermions in a uniform magnetic field is
obtained in terms of the thermodynamic quantities of the theory by using
functional methods. It is shown that the breaking of the O(3) rotational
symmetry by the magnetic field results in a pressure anisotropy, which leads to
the distinction between longitudinal- and transverse-to-the-field pressures. A
criterion to find the threshold field at which the asymmetric regime becomes
significant is discussed. This threshold magnetic field is shown to be the same
as the one required for the pure field contribution to the energy and pressures
to be of the same order as the matter contribution. A graphical representation
of the field-dependent anisotropic equation of state of the fermion system is
given. Estimates of the upper limit for the inner magnetic field in self-bound
stars, as well as in gravitationally bound stars with inhomogeneous
distributions of mass and magnetic fields, are also found.
