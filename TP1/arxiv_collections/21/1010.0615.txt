A new full-sky catalog of Radial Velocity standard stars is being built for
the determination of the Radial Velocity Zero Point of the RVS on board of
Gaia. After a careful selection of 1420 candidates matching well defined
criteria, we are now observing all of them to verify that they are stable
enough over several years to be qualified as reference stars. We present the
status of this long-term observing programme on three spectrographs : SOPHIE,
NARVAL and CORALIE, complemented by the ELODIE and HARPS archives. Because each
instrument has its own zero-point, we observe intensively IAU RV standards and
asteroids to homogenize the radial velocity measurements. We can already
estimate that ~8% of the candidates have to be rejected because of variations
larger than the requested level of 300 m/s.
