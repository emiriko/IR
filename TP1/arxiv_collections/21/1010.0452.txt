M dwarfs produce explosive flare emission in the near-UV and optical
continuum, and the mechanism responsible for this phenomenon is not
well-understood. We present a near-UV/optical flare spectrum from the rise
phase of a secondary flare, which occurred during the decay of a much larger
flare. The newly formed flare emission resembles the spectrum of an early-type
star, with the Balmer lines and continuum in absorption. We model this
observation phenomonologically as a temperature bump (hot spot) near the
photosphere of the M dwarf. The amount of heating implied by our model (\Delta
T_phot ~ 16,000K) is far more than predicted by chromospheric backwarming in
current 1D RHD flare models (\Delta T_phot ~ 1200K).
