We present a statistical study of dynamical and kinetic characteristics of
CMEs which show temporal and spatial association with flares and type II radio
bursts or complex radio events of type II bursts and type IV continua. This
study is based on a set of earth-directed full halo CMEs occurring during the
present solar cycle, with data from the Large Angle Spectrometric Coronagraphs
(LASCO) and Extreme-Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT) aboard the Solar and
Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) mission and the Magnetic Fields Investigation
(MFI) and 3-D Plasma and Energetic Particle Analyzer Investigation experiment
on board the WIND spacecraft.
