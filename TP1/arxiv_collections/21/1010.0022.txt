We present a systematic cosmological study of a universe in which the visible
sector is coupled, albeit very weakly, to a hidden sector comprised of its own
set of particles and interactions. Assuming that dark matter (DM) resides in
the hidden sector and is charged under a stabilizing symmetry shared by both
sectors, we determine all possible origins of weak-scale DM allowed within this
broad framework. We show that DM can arise only through a handful of
mechanisms, lending particular focus to Freeze-Out and Decay and Freeze-In, as
well as their variations involving late time re-annihilations of DM and DM
particle anti-particle asymmetries. Much like standard Freeze-Out, where the
abundance of DM depends only on the annihilation cross-section of the DM
particle, these mechanisms depend only on a very small subset of physical
parameters, many of which may be measured directly at the LHC. In particular,
we show that each DM production mechanism is associated with a distinctive
window in lifetimes and cross-sections for particles which may be produced in
the near future. We evaluate prospects for employing the LHC to definitively
reconstruct the origin of DM in a companion paper.
