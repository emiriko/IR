The resistance of dual-gated bilayer graphene is measured as a function of
temperature and gating electric fields in the Corbino geometry which precludes
edge transport. The temperature-dependent resistance is quantitatively
described by a two channel conductance model including parallel thermal
activation and variable range hopping channels, which gives the
electric-field-dependent band gap whose magnitude is found to be in good
agreement with infrared absorption experiments. Low temperature transport is
similar to previous studies of dual-gated bilayer graphene with edges,
suggesting that edge transport does not play an important role.
