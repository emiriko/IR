We implement the DiVincenzo-Shor 5 qubit quantum error correcting code into a
solid-state quantum register. The quantum register is a multi charge-qubit
system in a semiconductor environment, where the main sources of noise are
phase decoherence and relaxation. We evaluate the decay of the density matrix
for this multi-qubit system and perform regular quantum error corrections. The
performance of the error correction in this realistic system is found to yield
an improvement of the fidelity. The fidelity can be maintained arbitrarily
close to one by sufficiently increasing the frequency of error correction. This
opens the door for arbitrarily long quantum computations.
