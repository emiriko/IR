The origin of ferromagnetism in the prototype ferromagnetic semiconductor
GaMnAs is still controversial due to the insufficient understanding of its band
structure and Fermi level position. Here, we show the universal valence-band
(VB) picture of GaMnAs obtained by resonant tunneling spectroscopy for a
variety of surface GaMnAs layers with the Mn concentrations from 6 to 15% and
the Curie temperatures from 71 to 154 K. We find that the Fermi level exists in
the bandgap, and that the VB structure of GaAs is almost perfectly maintained
in all the GaMnAs samples, i.e. VB is not merged with the impurity band.
Furthermore, the p-d exchange splitting of VB is found to be quite small (only
several meV) even in GaMnAs with a high Curie temperature (154 K). These
results indicate that the VB structure of GaMnAs is quite insensitive to the Mn
doping.
