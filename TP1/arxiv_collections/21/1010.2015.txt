The dynamics of time-dependent coupled oscillator model for the charged
particle motion subjected to a time-dependent external magnetic field is
investigated. We used canonical transformation approach for the classical
treatment of the system, whereas unitary transformation approach is used when
managing the system in the framework of quantum mechanics. For both approaches,
the original system is transformed to a much more simple system that is the sum
of two independent harmonic oscillators which have time-dependent frequencies.
We therefore easily identified the wave functions in the transformed system
with the help of invariant operator of the system. The full wave functions in
the original system is derived from the inverse unitary transformation of the
wave functions associated to the transformed system.
