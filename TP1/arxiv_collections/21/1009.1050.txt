We present high-resolution images of the Sun in the near ultraviolet spectral
range between 214 nm and 397 nm as obtained from the first science flight of
the 1-m Sunrise balloon-borne solar telescope. The quiet-Sun rms intensity
contrasts found in this wavelength range are among the highest values ever
obtained for quiet-Sun solar surface structures - up to 32.8% at a wavelength
of 214 nm. We compare with theoretical intensity contrasts obtained from
numerical magneto-hydrodynamic simulations. For 388 nm and 312 nm the
observations agree well with the numerical simulations whereas at shorter
wavelengths discrepancies between observed and simulated contrasts remain.
