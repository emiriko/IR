The doping dependence of dry thermal oxidation rates in n-type 4H-SiC was
investigated. The oxidation was performed in the temperature range 1000C to
1200C for samples with nitrogen doping in the range of 6.5e15/cm3 to
9.3e18/cm3, showing a clear doping dependence. Samples with higher doping
concentrations displayed higher oxidation rates. The results were interpreted
using a modified Deal-Grove model. Linear and parabolic rate constants and
activation energies were extracted. Increasing nitrogen led to an increase in
linear rate constant pre-exponential factor from 10-6m/s to 10-2m/s and the
parabolic rate constant pre-exponential factor from 10e9m2/s to 10e6m2/s. The
increase in linear rate constant was attributed to defects from doping-induced
lattice mismatch, which tend to be more reactive than bulk crystal regions. The
increase in the diffusion-limited parabolic rate constant was attributed to
degradation in oxide quality originating from the doping-induced lattice
mismatch. This degradation was confirmed by the observation of a decrease in
optical density of the grown oxide films from 1.4 to 1.24. The linear
activation energy varied from 1.6eV to 2.8eV, while the parabolic activation
energy varied from 2.7eV to 3.3eV, increasing with doping concentration. These
increased activation energies were attributed to higher nitrogen content,
leading to an increase in effective bond energy stemming from the difference in
C-Si (2.82eV) and Si-N (4.26eV) binding energies. This work provides crucial
information in the engineering of SiO2 dielectrics for SiC MOS structures,
which typically involve regions of very different doping concentrations, and
suggests that thermal oxidation at high doping concentrations in SiC may be
defect mediated.
