The spectrum of a class of gaugino mediation models with arbitrary hidden
sector is considered. These models are defined by a diagonal breaking of the
mediating gauge group, which places them outside the realm of General Gauge
Mediation. While gauginos get masses as in ordinary gauge mediation, the scalar
masses are screened.
