Recent studies showed that hardness, a complex property, can be calculated
using very simple approaches or even analytical formulae. These form the basis
for evaluating controversial experimental results (as we illustrate for
TiO2-cotunnite) and enable a systematic search for novel hard materials, for
instance, using global optimization algorithms (as we show on the example of
SiO2 polymorphs).
