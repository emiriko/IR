Cellular responses in the single cells are known to be highly heterogeneous
and individualistic due to the strong influence by extrinsic and intrinsic
noise. Here, we are concerned about how to model the extrinsic noise-induced
heterogeneous response in the single cells under the constraints of
experimentally obtained population-averaged response, but without much detailed
kinetic information. We propose a novel statistical ensemble scheme where
extrinsic noise is regarded as fluctuations in the values of kinetic parameters
and such fluctuations are modeled by randomly sampling the kinetic rate
constants from a uniform distribution. We consider a large number of signaling
system replicates, each of which has the same network topology, but a uniquely
different set of kinetic rate constants. A protein dynamic response from each
replicate should represent the dynamics in a single cell and the statistical
ensemble average should be regarded as a population-level response averaged
over a population of the cells. We devise an optimization algorithm to find the
correct uniform distribution of the network parameters, which produces the
correct statistical distribution of the response whose ensemble average and
distribution agree well with the population-level experimental data and the
experimentally observed heterogeneity. We apply this statistical ensemble
analysis to a NF-{\kappa}B signaling system and (1) predict the distributions
of the heterogeneous NF-{\kappa}B (either oscillatory or non-oscillatory)
dynamic patterns and of the dynamic features (e.g., period), (2) predict that
both the distribution and the statistical ensemble average of the NF-{\kappa}B
dynamic response depends sensitively on the dosage of stimulant, and lastly (3)
demonstrate the sigmoidally shaped dose-response from the statistical ensemble
average and the individual replicates.
