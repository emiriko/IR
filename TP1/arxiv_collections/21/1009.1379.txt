In the second half of February the impending Giotto encounter of 13 March
concentrated our minds on what the encounter might reveal. As an outcome, we
issued a fairly widely circulated preprint with the title "Some Predictions on
the Nature of Comet Halley," (1 March, 1996, Cardiff Series 121) whose contents
were reported in the issue of the Times for 12 March. This publication in the
Times was fortunate for us, because it appeared indisputably ahead of the
encounter, whereas a contemporaneous submission to the Royal Astronomical
Society has suffered long delays to acceptance on advice to the Society from
two persons of unknown identities.
