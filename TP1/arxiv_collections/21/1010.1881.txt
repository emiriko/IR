Copper ferrite thin films were deposited on amorphous quartz substrates. The
as deposited films were annealed in air and either quenched or slow cooled.
Magnetization studies were carried out on the as deposited as well as annealed
films using a SQUID magnetometer. The M-H curves were measured up to a field of
7T, at temperatures varying from 5K to 300K. The magnetization in the films did
not saturate, even at the highest field. The expression, M(H)= Q(1- a/H^n)
fitted the approach to saturation best with n=1/2, for all films and at all
temperatures. The coefficient a was the highest for the as deposited film and
was the smallest for the quenched film. In the case of as deposited film, the
value of coefficient a increased with increasing temperature, while for the
annealed films, the value of a showed a decrease as temperature increases.
