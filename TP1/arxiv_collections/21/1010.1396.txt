The propagation of s- and p-polarized light through quasiperiodic
multilayers, consisting of layers with different refractive indices, is studied
by the transfer matrix method. In particular, we focus on the transmission
coefficient of the systems in dependency on the incidence angle and on the
ratio of the refractive indices. We obtain additional bands with almost
complete transmission in the quasiperiodic systems at frequencies in the range
of the photonic band gap of a system with a periodic alignment of the two
materials for both types of light polarization. With increasing incidence angle
these bands bend towards higher frequencies, where the curvature of the
transmission bands in the quasiperiodic stack depends on the metallic mean of
the construction rule. Additionally, in the quasiperiodic systems for
p-polarized light the bands show almost complete transmission near the
Brewster's angle in contrast to the results for s-polarized light. Further, we
present results for the influence of the refractive indices at the midgap
frequency of the periodic stack, where the quasiperiodicity was found to be
most effective.
