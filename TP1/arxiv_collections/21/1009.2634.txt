We analyze the evolution of cumulative national shares of Nobel Prizes since
1901, properly taking into account that most prizes were divided among several
laureates. We rank by citizenship at the moment of the award, and by country of
birth. Surprisingly, graphs of this type have not been published before, even
though they powerfully illustrate the century's migration patterns (brain
drains and gains) in the sciences and other fields.
