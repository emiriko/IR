This article reports world averages for measurements of b-hadron, c-hadron,
and tau-lepton properties obtained by the Heavy Flavor Averaging Group (HFAG)
using results available at least through the end of 2009. Some of the world
averages presented use data available through the spring of 2010. For the
averaging, common input parameters used in the various analyses are adjusted
(rescaled) to common values, and known correlations are taken into account. The
averages include branching fractions, lifetimes, neutral meson mixing
parameters, CP violation parameters, and parameters of semileptonic decays.
