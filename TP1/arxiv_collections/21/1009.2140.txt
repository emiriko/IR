Using resistive magnetohydrodynamics simulation, we investigate circumstellar
disk formation in a strongly magnetized cloud. As the initial state, an
isolated cloud core embedded in a low-density interstellar medium with a
uniform magnetic field is adopted. The cloud evolution is calculated until
almost all gas inside the initial cloud falls onto either the circumstellar
disk or a protostar, and a part of the gas is ejected into the interstellar
medium by the protostellar outflow driven by the circumstellar disk. In the
early main accretion phase, the disk size is limited to \sim 10 AU because the
angular momentum of the circumstellar disk is effectively transferred by both
magnetic braking and the protostellar outflow. In the later main accretion
phase, however, the circumstellar disk grows rapidly and exceeds 100 AU by the
end of the main accretion phase. This rapid growth of the circumstellar disk is
caused by the depletion of the infalling envelope, while magnetic braking is
effective when the infalling envelope is more massive than the circumstellar
disk. The infalling envelope cannot brake the circumstellar disk when the
latter is more massive than the former. In addition, the protostellar outflow
weakens and disappears in the later main accretion phase, because the outflow
is powered by gas accretion onto the circumstellar disk. Although the
circumstellar disk formed in a magnetized cloud is considerably smaller than
that in an unmagnetized cloud, a circumstellar disk exceeding 100 AU can form
even in a strongly magnetized cloud.
