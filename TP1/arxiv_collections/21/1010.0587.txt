We study the radiative decay properties of the charmonium-like X, Y and Z
mesons generated dynamically from vector meson-vector meson interaction in the
framework of a unitarized hidden-gauge formalism. In the present work we
calculate the one- and two-photon decay widths of the hidden-charm Y(3940),
Z(3930) (or X(3915)) and X(4160) mesons in the framework of the vector meson
dominance formalism. We obtain good agreement with experiment in case of the
two photon width of the X(3915) which we associate with the $2^+$ resonance
that we find at 3922 MeV.
