We give a comprehensive review of the quantization of midisuperspace models.
Though the main focus of the paper is on quantum aspects, we also provide an
introduction to several classical points related to the definition of these
models. We cover some important issues, in particular, the use of the principle
of symmetric criticality as a very useful tool to obtain the required
Hamiltonian formulations. Two main types of reductions are discussed: those
involving metrics with two Killing vector fields and spherically symmetric
models. We also review the more general models obtained by coupling matter
fields to these systems. Throughout the paper we give separate discussions for
standard quantizations using geometrodynamical variables and those relying on
loop quantum gravity inspired methods.
