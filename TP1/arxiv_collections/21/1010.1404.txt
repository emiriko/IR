We present an illustration of using a quantum three-body code being prepared
for public release. The code is based on iterative solving of the
three-dimensional Faddeev equations. The code is easy to use and allows users
to perform highly-accurate calculations of quantum three-body systems. The
previously known results for He$_3$ ground state are well reproduced by the
code.
