We present a superconducting qubit for the circuit quantum electrodynamics
architecture that has a tunable coupling strength g. We show that this coupling
strength can be tuned from zero to values that are comparable with other
superconducting qubits. At g = 0 the qubit is in a decoherence free subspace
with respect to spontaneous emission induced by the Purcell effect. Furthermore
we show that in the decoherence free subspace the state of the qubit can still
be measured by either a dispersive shift on the resonance frequency of the
resonator or by a cycling-type measurement.
