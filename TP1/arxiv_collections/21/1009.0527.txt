Molecular electronics is envisioned as a promising candidate for the
nanoelectronics of the future. More than a possible answer to ultimate
miniaturization problem in nanoelectronics, molecular electronics is foreseen
as a possible way to assemble a large numbers of nanoscale objects (molecules,
nanoparticules, nanotubes and nanowires) to form new devices and circuit
architectures. It is also an interesting approach to significantly reduce the
fabrication costs, as well as the energetical costs of computation, compared to
usual semiconductor technologies. Moreover, molecular electronics is a field
with a large spectrum of investigations: from quantum objects for testing new
paradigms, to hybrid molecular-silicon CMOS devices. However, problems remain
to be solved (e.g. a better control of the molecule-electrode interfaces,
improvements of the reproducibility and reliability, etc...).
