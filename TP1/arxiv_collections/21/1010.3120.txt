This research describes a three dimensional quantum cellular automaton (QCA)
which can simulate all other 3D QCA. This intrinsically universal QCA belongs
to the simplest subclass of QCA: Partitioned QCA (PQCA). PQCA are QCA of a
particular form, where incoming information is scattered by a fixed unitary U
before being redistributed and rescattered. Our construction is minimal amongst
PQCA, having block size 2 x 2 x 2 and cell dimension 2. Signals, wires and
gates emerge in an elegant fashion.
