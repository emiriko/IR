In this article we investigate the Casimir effect in the presence of a medium
by quantizing the Electromagnetic (EM) field in the presence of a
magnetodielectric medium by using the path integral formalism. For a given
medium with definite electric and magnetic susceptibilities, explicit
expressions for the Casimir force are obtained which are in agree with the
original Casimir force between two conducting parallel plates immersed in the
quantum electromagnetic vacuum.
