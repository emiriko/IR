We present 25 accounts of comets from 40 Australian Aboriginal communities,
citing both supernatural perceptions of comets and historical accounts of
bright comets. Historical and ethnographic descriptions include the Great
Comets of 1843, 1861, 1901, 1910, and 1927. We describe the perceptions of
comets in Aboriginal societies and show that they are typically associated with
fear, death, omens, malevolent spirits, and evil magic, consistent with many
cultures around the world. We also provide a list of words for comets in 16
different Aboriginal languages.
