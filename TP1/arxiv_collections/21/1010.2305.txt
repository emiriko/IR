We perform axisymmetric resistive MHD calculations that demonstrate that
centrifugal disks can indeed form around Class 0 objects despite magnetic
braking. We follow the evolution of a prestellar core all the way to
near-stellar densities and stellar radii. Under flux-freezing, the core is
braked and disk formation is inhibited, while Ohmic dissipation renders
magnetic braking ineffective within the first core. In agreement with
observations that do not show evidence for large disks around Class 0 objects,
the resultant disk forms in close proximity to the second core and has a radius
of only $\approx 10~R_{\odot}$ early on. Disk formation does not require
enhanced resistivity. We speculate that the disks can grow to the sizes
observed around Class II stars over time under the influence of both Ohmic
dissipation and ambipolar diffusion, as well as internal angular momentum
redistribution.
