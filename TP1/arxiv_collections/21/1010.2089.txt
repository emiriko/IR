Recent experimental advances at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC)
and the large center-of-mass energies available to the heavy-ion program at the
Large Hadron Collider (LHC) will enable strongly interacting matter at high
temperatures and densities, that is, the quark-gluon plasma (QGP), to be probed
in unprecedented ways. Among these exciting new probes are fully-reconstructed
inclusive jets and the away-side hadron showers associated with a weakly or
electromagnetically interacting boson, or, tagged jets. Full jet reconstruction
provides an experimental window into the mechanisms of quark and gluon dynamics
in the QGP which is not accessible via leading particles and leading particle
correlations. Theoretical advances in this growing field can help resolve some
of the most controversial points in heavy ion physics today. I here discuss the
power of jets to reveal the spectrum of induced radiation, thereby shedding
light on the applicability of the commonly used energy loss formalisms and
present results on the production and subsequent suppression of high energy
jets tagged with Z bosons in relativistic heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and LHC
energies using the Gyulassy-Levai-Vitev (GLV) parton energy loss approach.
