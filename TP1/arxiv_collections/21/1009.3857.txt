Some optimization or equilibrium problems involving somehow the concept of
optimal transport are presented in these notes, mainly devoted to applications
to economic and game theory settings. A variant model of transport, taking into
account traffic congestion effects is the first topic, and it shows various
links with Monge-Kantorovich theory and PDEs. Then, two models for urban
planning are introduced. The last section is devoted to two problems from
economics and their translation in the language of optimal transport.
