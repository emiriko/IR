In this paper we prove the weak and strong convergence of the implicit
iterative process with errors to a common fixed point of a finite family
$\{T_j\}_{i=1}^N$ of asymptotically quasi $I_j-$nonexpansive mappings as well
as a family of $\{I_j\}_{j=1}^N$ of asymptotically quasi nonexpansive mappings
in the framework of Banach spaces.
