We offer a brief survey of existent and planned experimental tests for
quantum gravity. First, we outline the questions we wish to address, and then
introduce some of the phenomenological models that are currently used in
quantum gravity, both with and without a lowered Planck scale. After that, we
summarize experimental areas where these models can be tested or constrained
and discuss the status of the field.
