We study the quantum corrections to the oblique propagation of the
magnetosonic waves in a warm quantum magnetoplasma composed by mobile ions and
electrons. We use a fluid formalism to include quantum corrections due to the
Bohm potential and to magnetization energy of electrons due to its spin. The
effects of both quantum corrections are shown in the dispersion relation for
perpendicular, parallel and oblique propagation. We find that the quantum
contributions to the low-frequency depends on the type of propagation we are
studying.
