We give a complete classification of torsion pairs in the cluster category of
Dynkin type A_n. Along the way we give a new combinatorial description of
Ptolemy diagrams, an infinite version of which was introduced by Ng. This
allows us to count the number of torsion pairs in the cluster category of type
A_n. We also count torsion pairs up to Auslander-Reiten translation.
