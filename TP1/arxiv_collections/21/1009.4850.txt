The unitary Critical Pomeron connects to a unique massless left-handed SU(5)
theory that, remarkably, might provide an unconventional underlying unification
for the Standard Model. Multi-regge theory suggests the existence of a {\it
bound-state high-energy S-Matrix} that replicates Standard Model states and
interactions via massless fermion anomaly dynamics. Configurations of anomalous
wee gauge boson reggeons play a vacuum-like role. All particles, including
neutrinos, are bound-states with dynamical masses (there is no Higgs field)
that are formed (in part) by anomaly poles. The contributing zero-momentum
chirality transitions break the SU(5) symmetry to vector SU(3)xU(1) in the
S-Matrix. The high-energy interactions are vector reggeon exchanges accompanied
by wee boson sums (odd-signature for the strong interaction and even-signature
for the electroweak interaction) that strongly enhance couplings. The very
small SU(5) coupling, ~ 1/120, should be reflected in small (Majorana) neutrino
masses. A color sextet quark sector, still to be discovered, produces both Dark
Matter and Electroweak Symmetry Breaking. Anomaly color factors imply this
sector could be produced at the LHC with large cross-sections, and would be
definitively identified in double pomeron processes.
