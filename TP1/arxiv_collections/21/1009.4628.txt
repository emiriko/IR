We report results of microwave surface impedance measurements of LiFeAs
single crystals. The in-plane penetration depth depends on temperature
exponentially at low temperatures, which strongly suggests that this material
has the nodeless superconducting gap. The temperature dependence of the
superfluid density indicates that LiFeAs is a multi-gap superconductor with at
least two isotropic gaps. In addtion, the real part of the microwave
conductivity exhibits a large enhancement below $T_\mathrm{c}$, indicating that
the quasi-particle relaxation time, $\tau$, increases rapidly below
$T_\mathrm{c}$. We believe that this enhancement is rather common to all
superconductors where an inelastic scattering is dominant above $T_\mathrm{c}$,
irrespective of the strength of the electron correlation.
