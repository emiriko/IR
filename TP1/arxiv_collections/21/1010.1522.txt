We study the interaction of atomic and molecular hydrogen with a surface of
tholin, a man-made polymer considered to be an analogue of aerosol particles
present in Titan's atmosphere, using thermal programmed desorption at low
temperatures below 30 K. The results are fitted and analyzed using a
fine-grained rate equation model that describes the diffusion, reaction and
desorption processes. We obtain the energy barriers for diffusion and
desorption of atomic and molecular hydrogen. These barriers are found to be in
the range of 30 to 60 meV, indicating that atom/molecule-surface interactions
in this temperature range are dominated by weak adsorption forces. The
implications of these results for the understanding of the atmospheric
chemistry of Titan are discussed.
