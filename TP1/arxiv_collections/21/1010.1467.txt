Symmetries and transformations are explored in the framework of entropic
quantum dynamics. Two conditions arise that are required for any transformation
to qualify as a symmetry. The heart of this work lies in the application of
these conditions to the extended Galilean transformation, which admits features
of both special and general relativity. The effective gravitational potential
that arises in a non-inertial frame through the strong equivalence principle
arises naturally through an equivalence of information.
