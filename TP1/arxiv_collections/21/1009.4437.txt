High-pressure electrical resistivity, r(T), measurements on intermetallic
Pr(Co, Ni, Pt)2B2C compounds were performed down to 2K. At room pressure the
r(T) in a-b direction curves for the non superconducting Pr(Co, Ni)2B2C
compounds exhibit magnetic correlations at about 10 and 4 K, respectively. At
low temperatures, PrCo2B2C shows a large spin-dependent electron scattering in
comparison to PrNi2B2C. Under applied pressure the magnetic scattering tends to
be suppressed more effectively in PrCo2B2C than in PrNi2 B2C. The low
temperature behavior of r(T,P) for PrNi2B2C and PrCo2B2C suggests a spin
fluctuations mechanism. In the other hand PrPt2B2C compound shows
superconductivity at about 6 K and under pressure its superconducting
transition temperature tends to be degraded at a rate dTc/dP = -0.34 K/GPa, as
expected in compounds with transition metals. The experimental results in Co,
Ni and Pt based compounds are analyzed from the point of view of the external
and chemical internal pressure effects.
