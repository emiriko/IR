We consider the static and spherically symmetric field equations of general
relativity for charged perfect fluid spheres in the presence of a cosmological
constant. Following work by Florides (1983) we find new exact solutions of the
field equations, and discuss their mass radius ratios. These solutions, for
instance, require the charged Nariai metric to be the vacuum part of the
spacetime. We also find charged generalizations of the Einstein static universe
and speculate that the smallness problem of the cosmological constant might
become less problematic if charge is taken into account.
