Detailed derivation of the master equation and the corresponding time
evolution of the cavity radiation of a coherent beat laser when the atoms are
initially prepared in a partial coherent superposition is presented. It turns
out that the quantum features and intensity of the cavity radiation are
considerably modified by the phase fluctuation arising due to the practical
incapability of preparing atoms in the intended coherent superposition. New
terms having an opposite sign with the contribution of the driving radiation
emerged in the master equation. This can be taken as an indication for a
competing effect between the two in the manifestation of the nonclassical
features. This, on the other hand, entails that there is a chance for regaining
the quantum properties that might have lost due to faulty preparation by
engineering the driving mechanism and vice versa. In light of this, quite
remarkably, the cavity radiation is shown to exhibit nonclassical features
including two-mode squeezing and entanglement when there is no driving and if
the atoms are initially prepared in a partial maximum atomic coherence
superposition, contrary to earlier predictions for the case of perfect
coherence.
