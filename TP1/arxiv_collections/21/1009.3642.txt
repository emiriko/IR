In the past few years considerable attention has been given to the design of
Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) Eigenmode Transmission Systems (EMTS).
This paper presents an in-depth analysis of a new MIMO eigenmode transmission
strategy. The non-linear decomposition technique called Geometric Mean
Decomposition (GMD) is employed for the formation of eigenmodes over MIMO
flatfading channel. Exploiting GMD technique, identical, parallel and
independent transmission pipes are created for data transmission at higher
rate. The system based on such decomposition technique is referred to as MIMO
Identical Eigenmode Transmission System (IETS). The comparative analysis of the
MIMO transceiver design exploiting nonlinear and linear decomposition
techniques for variable constellation is presented in this paper. The new
transmission strategy is tested in combination with the Vertical Bell Labs
Layered Space Time (V-BLAST) decoding scheme using different number of antennas
on both sides of the communication link. The analysis is supported by various
simulation results.
