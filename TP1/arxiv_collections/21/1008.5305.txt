We utilize a fractional exclusion statistics of Haldane and Wu hypothesis to
study the thermodynamics of a unitary Fermi gas trapped in a harmonic
oscillator potential at ultra-low finite temperature. The entropy per particle
as a function of the energy per particle and energy per particle versus
rescaled temperature are numerically compared with the experimental data. The
study shows that, except the chemical potential behavior, there exists a
reasonable consistency between the experimental measurement and theoretical
attempt for the entropy and energy per particle. In the fractional exclusion
statistics formalism, the behavior of the isochore heat capacity for a trapped
unitary Fermi gas is also analyzed.
