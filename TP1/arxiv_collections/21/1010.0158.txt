Motivated by several observational and theoretical developments concerning
the variability of Newton's gravitational constant with time $G(t)$, we
calculate the varying $G$ correction to the statefinder parameters for four
models of dark energy namely interacting dark energy, holographic dark energy,
new-agegraphic dark energy and generalized Chaplygin gas.
