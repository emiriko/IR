Nowadays cell phone is the most common communicating used by mass people. SMS
based communication is a cheap and popular communication method. It is human
tendency to have the opportunity to write SMS in their mother language. Text
input in mother language is more flexible when the alphabets of that language
are printed on the keypad. Bangla mobile keypad based on phonetics has been
proposed earlier. But the keypad is not scientific from frequency and
flexibility point of view. Since it is not a feasible solution in this paper we
have proposed an efficient Bengali keypad for cell phone and other cellular
device. The proposed keypad is based on the frequency of the alphabets in
Bengali language and also with the view of structure of human finger movements.
We took the two points in count to provide a flexible and fast cell phone
keypad.
