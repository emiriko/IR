We report a study on the field-driven propagation of vortex-like domain walls
in ferromagnetic nanotubes. This particular geometry gives rise to a special
feature of the static wall configuration, which significantly influences its
dynamics. Unlike domain walls in flat strips, the left-right symmetry of domain
wall propagation is broken. Furthermore, the domain wall velocity is not
limited by the Walker breakdown. Under sufficiently large magnetic fields, the
domain wall velocity reaches the velocity of spin waves (about 1000 m/s) and is
thereafter connected with a direct emission of spin waves. The moving domain
wall maintains its main structure but has characteristic spin-wave tails
attached. The spatial profile of this topological soliton is determined by the
spin-wave dispersion.
