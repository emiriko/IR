The article presents a translation of some widespread financial terminology
into the language of decision theory. For instance, financial leverage can be
regarded as an object of choice or a decision. We show how the optics of
decision theory allows perceiving the recently introduced metrics of
see-through-leverage, which proved to be very useful in understanding the
phenomenology of the recent economic crisis. The importance for practical
decision making of specification of the statistical regularity of the random
phenomena at hand as well as of the rationality class of the decision maker is
discussed.
