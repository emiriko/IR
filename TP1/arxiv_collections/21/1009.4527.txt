We investigate the physical and chemical evolution of population II stars
with initial masses in the range 6.5-8 Msun, which undergo an off centre carbon
ignition under partially degenerate conditions, followed by a series of thermal
pulses, and supported energetically by a CNO burning shell, above a O-Ne
degenerate core. In agreement with the results by other research groups, we
find that the O-Ne core is formed via the formation of a convective flame that
proceeds to the centre of the star. The evolution which follows is strongly
determined by the description of the mass loss mechanism. Use of the
traditional formalism with the super-wind phase favours a long evolution with
many thermal pulses, and the achievement of an advanced nucleosynthesis, due
the large temperatures reached by the bottom of the external mantle. Use of a
mass loss recipe with a strong dependence on the luminosity favours an early
consumption of the stellar envelope, so that the extent of the nucleosynthesis,
and thus the chemical composition of the ejecta, is less extreme. The
implications for the multiple populations in globular clusters are discussed.
If the "extreme" populations present in the most massive clusters are a result
of direct formation from the super-AGB ejecta, their abundances may constitute
a powerful way of calibrating the mass loss rate of this phase. This
calibration will also provide informations on the fraction of super-AGBs
exploding as single e-capture supernova, leaving a neutron star remnant in the
cluster.
