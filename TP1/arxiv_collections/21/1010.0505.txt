A two-state system (TSS) under time-periodic perturbations (to be regarded as
input signals) is studied in connection with self-tuning (ST) of threshold and
stochastic resonance (SR). By ST, we observe the improvement of signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) in a weak noise region. Analytic approach to a tuning equation
reveals that SNR improvement is possible also for a large noise region and this
is demonstrated by Monte Carlo simulations of hopping processes in a TSS. ST
and SR are discussed from a little more physical point of energy transfer
(dissipation) rate, which behaves in a similar way as SNR. Finally ST is
considered briefly for a double-well potential system (DWPS), which is closely
related to the TSS.
