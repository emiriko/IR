The possibility that Pamir data at very high energy cannot be fully explained
by standard physics has recently led to the suggestion that the peculiar jet
structure observed above ~ 10E16 eV could be due to a suppression of effective
space transverse dimensions. The new pattern considered violates Lorentz
symmetry. We point out that, in models with Lorentz symmetry violation, a
suppression of available transverse energy for jets while conserving
longitudinal momentum can be generated by new forms of energy losses at very
high energy without altering space-time structure. An illustrative example can
be superbradyon emission, where in all cases the superbradyon energy would be
much larger than its momentum times c (speed of light). More generally, such
phenomena could be due to the interaction of the high-energy cosmic ray with
new vacuum and/or particle structure below the 10E-20 cm scale. Scenarios
involving Lorentz symmetry violation but not superbradyons are also briefly
considered.
