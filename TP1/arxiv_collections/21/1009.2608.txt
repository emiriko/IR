When a guided mode is excited in a dielectric slab coupled to a backward
surface wave at the interface between a dielectric and a left-handed medium,
light is confined in the structure : this is a light wheel. Complex plane
analysis of the dispersion relation and coupled-mode formalism give a deep
insight into the physics of this phenomenon (lateral confinement and the
presence of a dark zone).
