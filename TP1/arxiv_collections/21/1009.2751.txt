We present a new method for resolving combinatorial ambiguities that arise in
multi-particle decay chains at hadron colliders where the assignment of visible
particles to the different decay chains has ambiguities. Our method, based on
selection cuts favoring high transverse momentum and low invariant mass
pairings, is shown to be significantly superior to the more traditional
hemisphere method for a large class of decay chains, producing an increase in
signal retention of up to a factor of 2. This new method can thus greatly
reduce the combinatorial ambiguities of decay chain assignments.
