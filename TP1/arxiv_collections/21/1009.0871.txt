The manipulation of the motion of neutral molecules with electric or magnetic
fields has seen tremendous progress over the last decade. Recently, these
techniques have been extended to the manipulation of large and complex
molecules. In this article we introduce experimental approaches to the
manipulation of large molecules, i.e., the deflection, focusing and
deceleration using electric fields. We detail how these methods can be
exploited to spatially separate quantum states and how to select individual
conformers of complex molecules. We briefly describe mixed-field orientation
experiments made possible by the quantum-state selection. Moreover, we provide
an outlook on ultrafast diffraction experiments using these highly controlled
samples.
