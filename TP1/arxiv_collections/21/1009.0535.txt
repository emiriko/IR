There are many formalisms to describe quantum decoherence. However, many of
them give a non general and ad hoc definition of "pointer basis" or "moving
preferred basis", and this fact is a problem for the decoherence program. In
this paper we will consider quantum systems under a general theoretical
framework for decoherence and present a tentative very general definition of
the moving preferred basis. which is implemented in a well known open system
model. The obtained decoherence and the relaxation times are defined and
compared with those of this model.
