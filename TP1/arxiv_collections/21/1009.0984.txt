Based on the stochastic theory developed by Kubo and Anderson, we present an
exact result of the decoherence function of a qubit in telegraph-like noises
under dynamical decoupling control. We prove that for telegraph-like noises,
the decoherence can be suppressed at most to the third order of the time and
the periodic Carr-Purcell-Merboom-Gill sequences are the most efficient scheme
in protecting the qubit coherence in the short-time limit.
