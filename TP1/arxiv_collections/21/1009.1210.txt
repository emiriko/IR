Cyg X-3 is a well-known microquasar with a bipolar relativistic jet. Its
famous giant radio outbursts have been repeated once every several years.
However, the behavior of the millimeter wave emission has remained unclear
because of limitations of time resolution in previous observations. We report
here millimeter wave observations of Cyg X-3 experiencing giant outbursts with
one of the finest time resolutions. We find a series of short-lived flares with
amplitude of 1-2 Jy in the millimeter light curve of the 2008 April-May
outburst. They have flat spectra around 100 GHz. We also find abrupt and large
amplitude flux density changes with e-folding time of 3.6 minutes or less. The
source size of Cyg X-3 is constrained within 0.4 AU and the brightness
temperature is estimated to be $T_B \gtrsim 1\times10^{11}$ K.
