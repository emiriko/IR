Mapping the magnetic exchange interactions from model Hamiltonian to density
functional theory is a crucial step in multi-scale modeling calculations.
Considering the usual magnetic force theorem but with arbitrary rotational
angles of the spin moments, a spurious anisotropy in the standard mapping
procedure is shown to occur provided by bilinear-like contributions of high
order spin interactions. The evaluation of this anisotropy gives a hint on the
strength of non-bilinear terms characterizing the system under investigation.
