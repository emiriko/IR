Bright points (BPs) are manifestations of small magnetic elements in the
solar photosphere. Their brightness contrast not only gives insight into the
thermal state of the photosphere (and chromosphere) in magnetic elements, but
also plays an important role in modulating the solar total and spectral
irradiance. Here we report on simultaneous high-resolution imaging and
spectropolarimetric observations of BPs using Sunrise balloon-borne observatory
data of the quiet Sun at disk center. BP contrasts have been measured between
214 nm and 525 nm, including the first measurements at wavelengths below 388
nm. The histograms of the BP peak brightness show a clear trend toward broader
contrast distributions and higher mean contrasts at shorter wavelengths. At 214
nm we observe a peak brightness of up to five times the mean quiet-Sun value,
the highest BP contrast so far observed. All BPs are associated with a magnetic
signal, although in a number of cases it is surprisingly weak. Most of the BPs
show only weak downflows, the mean value being 240 m/s, but some display strong
down- or upflows reaching a few km/s.
