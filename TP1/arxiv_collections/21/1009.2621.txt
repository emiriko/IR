We review some results for the dynamics of first-order phase transitions in
functional materials. We especially focus on simple models of athermal
evolution in driven ferromagnets that give a global picture of metastability
and hysteresis, showing that first-order phase transitions in such systems
proceed by avalanches. Within this theoretical framework, we then discuss
recent experiments on acoustic emission avalanches in structural phase
transitions.
