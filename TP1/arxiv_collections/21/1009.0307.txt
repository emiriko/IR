At $\sqrt{s} = 7$ TeV, the standard model needs at least $10\, (fb)^{-1}$
integrated luminosity at LHC to make a definitive discovery of the Higgs boson.
Using binary tetrahedral ($T^{'}$) discrete flavor symmetry, we discuss how the
decay of the lightest $T'$ Higgs into $\gamma\,\gamma$ can be effectively
enhanced and dominate over its decay into $b \, \bar{b}$. Since the two-photon
final state allows for a clean reconstruction, a decisive Higgs discovery may
be possible at 7 TeV with the integrated luminosity only of $\sim 1\,
(fb)^{-1}$.
