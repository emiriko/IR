We present an explicit computation of the CP asymmetry in scattering
processes involving the heavy right-handed neutrinos of the type I seesaw
framework and the Standard Model gauge bosons. Compared to CP violation in
two--body decays and in scatterings with top quarks there are new contributions
at one loop in the form of new type of vertex corrections as well as of box
diagrams. We show that their presence implies that, unlike the CP asymmetry in
scatterings with top quarks, the CP asymmetry in scatterings with gauge bosons
is different from the two-body decay asymmetry even for hierarchical
right-handed neutrinos. This also holds for the L-conserving CP asymmetry in
scatterings with U(1)$_Y$ gauge bosons.
