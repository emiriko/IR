In experiments for direct dark matter searches, neutrinos coherently
scattering off nuclei can produce similar events as Weakly Interacting Massive
Particles (WIMPs). To reach sensitivities better than about 10^-10 pb for the
elastic WIMP nucleon spin-independent cross section in the zero-background
limit, energy thresholds for nuclear recoils should be >2.05 keV for CaWO_4,
>4.91 keV for Ge, >2.89 keV for Xe, >8.62 keV for Ar and >15.93 keV for Ne as
target material. Atmospheric neutrinos limit the achievable sensitivity for the
background-free direct dark matter search to >10^-12 pb.
