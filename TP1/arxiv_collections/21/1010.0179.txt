We report the discovery by the CoRoT space mission of a transiting brown
dwarf orbiting a F7V star with an orbital period of 3.06 days. CoRoT-15b has a
radius of 1.12 +0.30 -0.15 Rjup, a mass of 63.3 +- 4.1 Mjup, and is thus the
second transiting companion lying in the theoretical mass domain of brown
dwarfs. CoRoT-15b is either very young or inflated compared to standard
evolution models, a situation similar to that of M-dwarfs stars orbiting close
to solar-type stars. Spectroscopic constraints and an analysis of the
lightcurve favors a spin period between 2.9 and 3.1 days for the central star,
compatible with a double-synchronisation of the system.
