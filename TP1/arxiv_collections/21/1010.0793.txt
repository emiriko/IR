Quantum electrodynamics describes the interactions of electrons and photons.
Electric charge (the gauge coupling constant) is energy dependent, and there is
a previous claim that charge is affected by gravity (described by general
relativity) with the implication that the charge is reduced at high energies.
But that claim has been very controversial with the situation inconclusive.
Here I report an analysis (free from earlier controversies) demonstrating that
that quantum gravity corrections to quantum electrodynamics have a quadratic
energy dependence that result in the reduction of the electric charge at high
energies, a result known as asymptotic freedom.
