Recent testing and validation have found that the Geostationary Operational
Environmental Satellite (GOES) microburst products are effective in the
assessment and short-term forecasting of downburst potential and associated
wind gust magnitude. Two products, the GOES sounder Microburst Windspeed
Potential Index (MWPI) and a new two-channel GOES imager brightness temperature
difference (BTD) product have demonstrated capability in downburst potential
assessment. The MWPI, a diagnostic nowcasting product, is designed to infer
attributes of a favorable microburst environment: large CAPE and a convective
mixed layer with a steep temperature lapse rate and low relative humidity in
the surface layer. These conditions foster intense convective downdrafts due to
evaporational cooling as precipitation descends in the sub-cloud layer. More
recently, a new application of the brightness temperature difference (BTD)
between GOES imager channels 3 and 4 has been developed. It has been found that
the BTD between GOES infrared channel 3 (water vapor) and channel 4 (thermal
infrared) can highlight regions where severe outflow wind generation (i.e.
downbursts, microbursts) is likely due to the channeling of dry
mid-tropospheric air into the precipitation core of a deep, moist convective
storm. This paper provides an updated assessment of the MWPI and new GOES BTD
algorithm, presents case studies demonstrating effective operational use of the
microburst products, and presents validation results for the 2010 convective
season over the United States Great Plains and Atlantic Coast regions.
