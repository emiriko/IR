Computational aspects of the optimal consumption and investment with the
partially observed stochastic volatility of the asset prices are considered.
The new quantization approach to filtering - density quantization - is
introduced which reduces the original infinite dimensional state space of the
problem to the finite quantization set. The density quantization is embedded
into the numerical algorithm to solve the dynamic programming equation related
to the portfolio optimization.
