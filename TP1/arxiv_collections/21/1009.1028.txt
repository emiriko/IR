Effect of irradiation on graphene oxide by sunlight, UV light and KrF excimer
laser has been investigated in detail. Both sunlight and ultraviolet light
reduce graphene oxide well after prolonged irradiation, but laser irradiation
produces graphene with negligible oxygen functionalities within a short time.
Laser irradiation is also useful for one-step synthesis of metal particle
decorated graphene. Laser irradiation of graphene oxide appears to be an
efficient procedure for large-scale synthesis of graphene.
