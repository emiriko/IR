In given article preliminary results of the research of the electron
multiplication in MPGD are presented at a high level of alpha-particles
background. This work has expanded borders of understanding of the streamer
mode nature. It is seen as a complex from electrostatic and electromagnetic
interactions which begin with appearance of the precursor in plasma state. In
an inter-electrode gap the plasma oscillations occur, accompanied by
longitudinal elastic waves of ionization, which can reach the cathode surface
with induced negative charge. With the release of this charge due to previously
established conducting channel there is a strong current pulse, accompanied by
the emission due to recombination of positive and negative ions and a thin cord
or streamer derive.
  In the aim of the MPGD protection from the spark breakdown at a high level of
the alpha-particle background the next gas composition from a buffer, cooling
and electronegative components are offered: 70% He +28% CF4 +2% SF6.
