An approximate method is proposed to solve position dependent mass
Schr\"odinger equation. The procedure suggested here leads to the solution of
the PDM Schr\"odinger equation without transforming the potential function to
the mass space or vice verse. The method based on asymptotic Taylor expansion
of the function, produces an approximate analytical expression for
eigenfunction and numerical results for eigenvalues of the PDM Schr\"odinger
equation. The results show that PDM and constant mass Schr\"odinger equations
are not isospectral. The calculations are carried out with the aid of a
computer system of symbolic or numerical calculation by constructing a simple
algorithm.
