This article comprises a review of both the quasi-probability representations
of infinite-dimensional quantum theory (including the Wigner function) and the
more recently defined quasi-probability representations of finite-dimensional
quantum theory. We focus on both the characteristics and applications of these
representations with an emphasis toward quantum information theory. We discuss
the recently proposed unification of the set of possible quasi-probability
representations via frame theory and then discuss the practical relevance of
negativity in such representations as a criteria for quantumness.
