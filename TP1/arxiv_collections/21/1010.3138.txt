Besides giant elliptical galaxies, a number of low-mass stellar systems
inhabit the cores of galaxy clusters, such as dwarf elliptical galaxies
(dEs/dSphs), ultra-compact dwarf galaxies (UCDs), and globular clusters. The
detailed morphological examination of faint dwarf galaxies has, until recently,
been limited to the Local Group (LG) and the two very nearby galaxy clusters
Virgo and Fornax. Here, we compare the structural parameters of a large number
of dEs/dSphs in the more distant clusters Hydra I and Centaurus to other
dynamically hot stellar systems.
