Generalizations of the quantum Fano inequality are considered. The notion of
$q$-entropy exchange is introduced. This quantity is concave in each of its two
arguments. For $q\geq0$, the inequality of Fano type with $q$-entropic
functionals is established. The notion of coherent information and the perfect
reversibility of a quantum operation are discussed in the context of
$q$-entropies. By the monotonicity property, the lower bound of Pinsker type in
terms of the trace norm distance is obtained for the Tsallis relative
$q$-entropy of order $q=1/2$. For $0\leq{q}\leq2$, Fano type quantum
inequalities with freely variable parameters are obtained.
