A brief review of recent microscopic calculations of nuclear pairing gap is
given. A semi-microscopic model is suggested in which the ab-initio effective
pairing interaction is supplemented with a small phenomenological addendum. It
involves a parameter which is universal for all medium and heavy nuclei.
Calculations for several isotopic and isotonic chains of semi-magic nuclei
confirm the relevance of the model.
