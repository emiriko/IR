The molecular structure of a multilayer of
1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC) adsorbed on the surface of
the hydrosol of silica nanoparticles has been studied by the synchrotron
radiation scattering method. According to the reflectometry data, the
multilayer is formed by planar phospholipid bilayers with a thickness of 69 +/-
1 Angstrom and its total thickness is about 400 Angstrom. Grazing-incidence
diffraction indicates that the bilayers are in the crystal state with an area
of 41.6 +/- 0.7 Angstrom^2 per molecule.
