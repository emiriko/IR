We derive an exact analytical expression for the one-loop partition function
of a string in AdS_5xS^5 background with world-surface ending on two
anti-parallel lines. All quantum fluctuations are shown to be governed by
integrable, single-gap Lame' operators. The first strong coupling correction to
the quark-antiquark potential, as defined in N=4 SYM, is derived as the sum of
known mathematical constants and a one-dimensional integral representation. Its
full numerical value can be given with arbitrary precision and confirms a
previous result.
