We introduce two new eccentricity measures to analyze numerical simulations.
Unlike earlier definitions these eccentricity measures do not involve any free
parameters which makes them easy to use. We show how relatively inexpensive
grid setups can be used to estimate the eccentricity during the early inspiral
phase. Furthermore, we compare standard puncture data and post-Newtonian data
in ADMTT gauge. We find that both use different coordinates. Thus low
eccentricity initial momentum parameters for a certain separation measured in
ADMTT coordinates are hard to use in puncture data, because it is not known how
the separation in puncture coordinates is related to the separation in ADMTT
coordinates. As a remedy we provide a simple approach which allows us to
iterate the momentum parameters until our numerical simulations result in
acceptably low eccentricities.
