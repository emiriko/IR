A model of distribution of the wealth in a society based on the properties of
complex networks has been proposed. The wealth is interpreted as a consequence
of communication possibilities and proportional to the number of connections
possessed by a person (as a vertex of the social network). Numerical simulation
of wealth distribution shows a transition from the Pareto law to distribution
with a gap demonstrating the absence of the middle class. Such a transition has
been described as a second-order phase transition, the order parameter has been
introduced and the value of the critical exponent has been found.
