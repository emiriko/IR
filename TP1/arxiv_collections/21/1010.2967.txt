The aim is to laboratory simulation of convective plumes in the lower mantle,
generated by a hot spot on the Earth's core. In the fluid dynamics video,
presented results of experimental modeling of the plume from the hot point
generated by the laser. Demonstrated that in a fluid with a high Prandtl
number, point heating can generate complex spiral plumes. This experimental
result allows us to question the classical notion of a mantle plume, as the
column of heat.
