We present the first measurement of the scale-dependent power anisotropy of
Elsasser variables in imbalanced fast solar wind turbulence. The dominant
Elsasser mode is isotropic at lower spacecraft frequencies but becomes
increasingly anisotropic at higher frequencies. The sub-dominant mode is
anisotropic throughout, but in a scale-independent way (at higher frequencies).
There are two distinct subranges exhibiting different scalings within what is
normally considered the inertial range. The low Alfven ratio and shallow
scaling of the sub-dominant Elsasser mode suggest an interpretation of the
observed discrepancy between the velocity and magnetic field scalings. The
total energy is dominated by the latter. These results do not appear to be
fully explained by any of the current theories of incompressible imbalanced MHD
turbulence.
