Nearly free electron (NFE) state is an important kind of unoccupied state in
low dimensional systems. Although it is intensively studied, a clear picture on
its physical origin and its response behavior to external perturbations is
still not available. Our systematic first-principles study based on graphene
nanoribbon superlattices suggests that there are actually two kinds of NFE
states, which can be understood by a simple Kronig-Penney potential model. An
atom-scattering-free NFE transport channel can be obtained via electron doping,
which may be used as a conceptually new field effect transistor.
