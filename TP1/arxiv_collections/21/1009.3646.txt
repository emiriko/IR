The 28 October 2003 flare gave us the unique opportunity to compare the
acceleration time of high-energy protons with the escaping time of those
particles which have been measured onboard spacecraft and by neutron monitors
network as GLE event. High-energy emission time scale and shock wave height and
velocity time dependencies were also studied.
