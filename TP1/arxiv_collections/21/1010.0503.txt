We present an exact solution of a modifed Dirac equation for topological
insulator in the presence of a hole or vacancy to demonstrate that vacancies
may induce bound states in the band gap of topological insulators. They arise
due to the Z_2 classification of time-reversal invariant insulators, thus are
also topologically-protected like the edge states in the quantum spin Hall
effect and the surface states in three-dimensional topological insulators.
Coexistence of the in-gap bound states and the edge or surface states in
topological insulators suggests that imperfections may affect transport
properties of topological insulators via additional bound states near the
system boundary.
