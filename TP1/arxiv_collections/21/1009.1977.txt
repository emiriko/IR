Uncertainty in Logic Programming has been investigated during the last
decades, dealing with various extensions of the classical LP paradigm and
different applications. Existing proposals rely on different approaches, such
as clause annotations based on uncertain truth values, qualification values as
a generalization of uncertain truth values, and unification based on proximity
relations. On the other hand, the CLP scheme has established itself as a
powerful extension of LP that supports efficient computation over specialized
domains while keeping a clean declarative semantics. In this report we propose
a new scheme SQCLP designed as an extension of CLP that supports qualification
values and proximity relations. We show that several previous proposals can be
viewed as particular cases of the new scheme, obtained by partial
instantiation. We present a declarative semantics for SQCLP that is based on
observables, providing fixpoint and proof-theoretical characterizations of
least program models as well as an implementation-independent notion of goal
solutions.
