In a coupled-channel model, we explore the effects of coupling between
configurations on the radial behavior of the wave function and, in particular,
on the spectroscopic factor (SF) and the asymptotic normalization coefficient
(ANC). We evaluate the extraction of a SF from the ratio of the ANC of the
coupled-channel model to that of a single-particle approximation of the wave
function. We perform this study within a core + n collective model, which
includes two states of the core that connect by a rotational coupling. To get
additional insights, we also use a simplified model that takes a delta function
for the coupling potential. Calculations are performed for 11Be. Fair agreement
is obtained between the SF inferred from the single-particle approximation and
the one obtained within the coupled-channel models. Significant discrepancies
are observed only for large coupling strength and/or large admixture, that is,
a small SF. This suggests that reliable SFs can be deduced from the
wave-function asymptotics when the structure is dominated by one configuration,
that is, for a large SF.
