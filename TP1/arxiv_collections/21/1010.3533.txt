Mechanical exfoliation of a graphite surface with an adhesive nanoasperity is
studied under different temperatures ranging from 298 K to 2 K using classical
molecular dynamics. Two types of the interlayer interaction are investigated.
For a pairwise Lennard-Jones potential the complete removal of the upper
graphene layer during the retraction of the nanoasperity occurs in the whole
range of the temperatures considered. The results obtained using registry
dependent potential, which takes into account electronic delocalization
contribution besides the van der Waals one, exhibit more pronounced temperature
dependence. In this case the exfoliation takes place for temperatures higher
than 16 K, but beginning from 8 K down to 2 K the system behavior manifests
qualitative changes with the absence of cleavage of the sample. Analytical
estimates combined with the results of the simulations reveal that the
contribution of the overlap of pi orbitals of carbon atoms plays an important
role in the exfoliation of graphite.
