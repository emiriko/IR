Spin precession was nonthermally induced by an ultrashort laser pulse in
orthoferrite DyFeO3 with a pump-probe technique. Both circularly and linearly
polarized pulses led to spin precessions; these phenomena are interpreted as
the inverse Faraday effect and the inverse Cotton-Mouton effect, respectively.
For both cases, the same mode of spin precession was excited; the precession
frequencies and polarization were the same, but the phases of oscillations were
different. We have shown theoretically and experimentally that the analysis of
phases can distinguish between these two mechanisms. We have demonstrated
experimentally that in the visible region, the inverse Faraday effect was
dominant, whereas the inverse Cotton-Mouton effect became relatively prominent
in the near-infrared region.
