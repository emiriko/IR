The paper proposes a hybrid method for calculating scattering processes that
combines the $J$-matrix method with exterior complex scaling as an absorbing
boundary condition. It represents the wave function as a finite sum of
oscillator eigenstates in the inner region and on grid in the outer region. The
method is validated for one and two dimensional model partial wave equation
equations. Finally, the method calculates nuclear $p$-shell scattering.
