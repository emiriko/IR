We study a generalisation of the Hatano-Nelson Hamiltonian in which a
periodic modulation of the site energies is present in addition to the usual
random distribution. The system can then become localized by disorder or
develop a band gap, and the eigenspectrum shows a wide variety of topologies.
We determine the phase diagram, and perform a finite size scaling analysis of
the localization transition.
