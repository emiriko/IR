Systems where resource availability approaches a critical threshold are
common to many engineering and scientific applications and often necessitate
the estimation of first passage time statistics of a Brownian motion (Bm)
driven by time-dependent drift and diffusion coefficients. Modeling such
systems requires solving the associated Fokker-Planck equation subject to an
absorbing barrier. Transitional probabilities are derived via the method of
images, whose applicability to time dependent problems is shown to be limited
to state-independent drift and diffusion coefficients that only depend on time
and are proportional to each other. First passage time statistics, such as the
survival probabilities and first passage time densities are obtained
analytically. The analysis includes the study of different functional forms of
the time dependent drift and diffusion, including power-law time dependence and
different periodic drivers. As a case study of these theoretical results, a
stochastic model for water availability from surface runoff in snowmelt
dominated regions is presented, where both temperature effects and
snow-precipitation input are incorporated.
