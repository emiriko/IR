We study the topologically non-trivial semi-metals by means of the 6-band
Kane model. Existence of surface states is explicitly demonstrated by
calculating the LDOS on the material surface. In the strain free condition,
surface states are divided into two parts in the energy spectrum, one part is
in the direct gap, the other part including the crossing point of surface state
Dirac cone is submerged in the valence band. We also show how uni-axial strain
induces an insulating band gap and raises the crossing point from the valence
band into the band gap, making the system a true topological insulator. We
predict existence of helical edge states and spin Hall effect in the thin film
topological semi-metals, which could be tested with future experiment. Disorder
is found to significantly enhance the spin Hall effect in the valence band of
the thin films.
