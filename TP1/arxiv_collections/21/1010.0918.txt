It is claimed that elliptic flow, ridge and alignment are effects of
azimuthal asymmetry, which have a common origin evolving with primary energy
and stemming from the general structure of field-theoretical matrix elements.
It interrelates a new ridge-phenomenon, recently found at the LHC and RHIC,
with known coplanarity feature observed in collider jet physics as well as in
cosmic ray studies.
