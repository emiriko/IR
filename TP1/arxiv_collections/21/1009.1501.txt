We study the thermal and mechanical behavior of DNA denaturation in the frame
of the mesoscopic Peyrard- Bishop-Dauxois model with the inclusion of solvent
interaction. By analyzing the melting transition of a homogeneous A-T sequence,
we are able to set suitable values of the parameters of the model and study the
formation and stability of bubbles in the system. Then, we focus on the case of
the P5 promoter sequence and use the Principal Component Analysis of the
trajectories to extract the main information on the dynamical behavior of the
system. We find that this analysis method gives an excellent agreement with
previous biological results.
