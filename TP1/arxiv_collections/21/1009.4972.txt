Speech recognition and speaker identification are important for
authentication and verification in security purpose, but they are difficult to
achieve. Speaker identification methods can be divided into text-independent
and text-dependent. This paper presents a technique of text-dependent speaker
identification using MFCC-domain support vector machine (SVM). In this work,
melfrequency cepstrum coefficients (MFCCs) and their statistical distribution
properties are used as features, which will be inputs to the neural network.
This work firstly used sequential minimum optimization (SMO) learning technique
for SVM that improve performance over traditional techniques Chunking, Osuna.
The cepstrum coefficients representing the speaker characteristics of a speech
segment are computed by nonlinear filter bank analysis and discrete cosine
transform. The speaker identification ability and convergence speed of the SVMs
are investigated for different combinations of features. Extensive experimental
results on several samples show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
