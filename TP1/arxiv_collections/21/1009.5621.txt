This paper studies two kinds of simulation between cellular automata:
simulations based on factor and simulations based on sub-automaton. We show
that these two kinds of simulation behave in two opposite ways with respect to
the complexity of attractors and factor subshifts. On the one hand, the factor
simulation preserves the complexity of limits sets or column factors (the
simulator CA must have a higher complexity than the simulated CA). On the other
hand, we show that any CA is the sub-automaton of some CA with a simple limit
set (NL-recognizable) and the sub-automaton of some CA with a simple column
factor (finite type). As a corollary, we get intrinsically universal CA with
simple limit sets or simple column factors. Hence we are able to 'hide' the
simulation power of any CA under simple dynamical indicators.
