In this and the associated article 'BioBlender: Fast and Efficient All Atom
Morphing of Proteins Using Blender Game Engine', by Zini et al., we present
BioBlender, a complete instrument for the elaboration of motion (Zini et al.)
and the visualization (here) of proteins and other macromolecules, using
instruments of computer graphics. The availability of protein structures
enables the study of their surfaces and surface properties such as
electrostatic potential (EP) and hydropathy (MLP), based on atomic
contribution. Recent advances in 3D animation and rendering software have not
yet been exploited for the representation of proteins and other biological
molecules in an intuitive, animated form. Taking advantage of an open-source,
3D animation and rendering software, Blender, we developed BioBlender, a
package dedicated to biological work: elaboration of proteins' motions with the
simultaneous visualization of chemical and physical features. EP and MLP are
calculated using physico-chemical programs and custom programs and scripts,
organized and accessed within BioBlender interface. A new visual code is
introduced for MLP visualization: a range of optical features that permits a
photorealistic rendering of its spatial distribution on the surface of the
protein. EP is represented as animated line particles that flow along field
lines proportional to the total charge of the protein. Our system permits EP
and MLP visualization of molecules and, in the case of moving proteins, the
continuous perception of these features, calculated for each intermediate
conformation. Using real world tactile/sight feelings, the nanoscale world of
proteins becomes more understandable, familiar to our everyday life, making it
easier to introduce "un-seen" phenomena (concepts) such as hydropathy or
charges.
