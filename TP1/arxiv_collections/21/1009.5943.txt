Holas and March (Phys. Rev. A51, 2040 (1995)) wrote the gradient of the
one-body potential V(r) in terms of low-order derivatives of the idempotent
Dirac density matrix built from a single Slater determinant of Kohn-Sham
orbitals. Here, this is first combined with the study of Dawson and March (J.
Chem. Phys. 81, 5850 (1984)) to express the single-particle kinetic energy
density of the Be atom ground-state in terms of both the electron density n(r)
and potential V(r). While this is the more compact formulation, we then, by
removing V(r), demonstrate that the ratio t(r)/n(r) depends, though
non-locally, only on the single variable n'(r)/n(r), no high-order gradients
entering for the spherical Be atom.
