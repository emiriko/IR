We show with explicit formulas that one can completely identify an unknown
quantum process with only one weakly entangled state; and identify a quantum
optical Gaussian process with either one two-mode squeezed state or a few
different coherent states. In tomography of a multi-mode process, our method
reduces the number of different test states exponentially compared with
existing methods.
