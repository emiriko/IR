The non-interacting energy spectrum of graphene and its bilayer counterpart
consists of multiple degeneracies owing to the inherent spin, valley and layer
symmetries. Interactions among charge carriers are expected to spontaneously
break these symmetries, leading to gapped ordered states. In the quantum Hall
regime these states are predicted to be ferromagnetic in nature whereby the
system becomes spin polarized, layer polarized or both. In bilayer graphene,
due to its parabolic dispersion, interaction-induced symmetry breaking is
already expected at zero magnetic field. In this work, the underlying order of
the various broken-symmetry states is investigated in bilayer graphene that is
suspended between top and bottom gate electrodes. By controllably breaking the
spin and sublattice symmetries we are able to deduce the order parameter of the
various quantum Hall ferromagnetic states. At small carrier densities, we
identify for the first time three distinct broken symmetry states, one of which
is consistent with either spontaneously broken time-reversal symmetry or
spontaneously broken rotational symmetry.
