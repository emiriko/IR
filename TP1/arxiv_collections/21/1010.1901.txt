The Fermi $\gamma$-ray space telescope reported the observation of several
Galactic supernova remnants recently, with the $\gamma$-ray spectra well
described by hadronic $pp$ collisions. The possible neutrino emissions from
these Fermi detected supernova remnants are discussed in this work, assuming
the hadronic origin of the $\gamma$-ray emission. The muon event rates induced
by the neutrinos from these supernova remnants on typical km$^3$ neutrino
telescopes, such as the IceCube and the KM3NeT, are calculated. The results
show that for most of these supernova remnants the neutrino signals are too
weak to be detected by the on-going or up-coming neutrino experiment. Only for
the TeV bright sources RX J1713.7-3946 and possibly W28 the neutrino signals
can be comparable with the atmospheric background in the TeV region, if the
protons can be accelerated to very high energies. The northern hemisphere based
neutrino telescope might detect the neutrinos from these two sources.
