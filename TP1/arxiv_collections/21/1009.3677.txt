We propose a new extended theory of Ho\v{r}ava gravity based on the following
three conditions: (i) UV completion, (ii) healthy IR behavior and (iii) a
stable vacuum state in quantized version of the theory. Compared with other
extended theories, we stress that any realistic theory of gravity must have
physical ground states when quantization is performed. To fulfill the three
conditions, we softly break the detailed balance but keep its basic structure
unchanged. It turns out that the new model constructed in this way can avoid
the strong coupling problem and remains power-counting renormalizable,
moreover, it has a stable vacuum state by an appropriate choice of parameters.
