Recent observational and theoretical arguments suggest that magnetic OB stars
may suffer more mixing than their non magnetic analogs. We present the results
of an NLTE abundance study revealing a lack of CN-cycled material at the
surface of two magnetic stars discovered by the MiMeS project (NGC2244 #201 and
HD 57682). The existence of a strong magnetic field is therefore not a
sufficient condition for deep mixing in main-sequence OB stars.
