Recently, Lagos et al. (Nature Nanotechnology 4, 149 (2009)) reported the
discovery of the smallest possible silver square cross-section nanotube. A
natural question is whether similar carbon nanotubes can exist. In this work we
report ab initio results for the structural, stability and electronic
properties for such hypothetical structures. Our results show that stable (or
at least metastable) structures are possible with metallic properties. They
also show that these structures can be obtained by a direct interconversion
from SWNT(2,2). Large finite cubane-like oligomers, topologically related to
these new tubes were also investigated.
