We present a supersymmetric analysis for the d-dimensional Schroedinger
equation with the generalized isotonic nonlinear-oscillator potential
  V(r)={B^2}/{r^{2}}+\omega^{2} r^{2}+2g{(r^{2}-a^{2})}/{(r^{2}+a^{2})^{2}},
B\geq 0. We show that the eigenequation for this potential is exactly solvable
provided g=2 and (\omega a^2)^2 = B^2 +(\ell +(d-2)/2)^2. Under these
conditions, we obtain explicit formulae for all the energies and normalized
bound-state wavefunctions.
