Biological and social networks have recently attracted enormous attention
between physicists. Among several, two main aspects may be stressed: A non
trivial topology of the graph describing the mutual interactions between agents
exists and/or, typically, such interactions are essentially (weighted)
imitative. Despite such aspects are widely accepted and empirically confirmed,
the schemes currently exploited in order to generate the expected topology are
based on a-priori assumptions and in most cases still implement constant
intensities for links. Here we propose a simple shift in the definition of
patterns in an Hopfield model to convert frustration into dilution: By varying
the bias of the pattern distribution, the network topology -which is generated
by the reciprocal affinities among agents - crosses various well known regimes
(fully connected, linearly diverging connectivity, extreme dilution scenario,
no network), coupled with small world properties, which, in this context, are
emergent and no longer imposed a-priori. The model is investigated at first
focusing on these topological properties of the emergent network, then its
thermodynamics is analytically solved (at a replica symmetric level) by
extending the double stochastic stability technique, and presented together
with its fluctuation theory for a picture of criticality. At least at
equilibrium, dilution simply decreases the strength of the coupling felt by the
spins, but leaves the paramagnetic/ferromagnetic flavors unchanged. The main
difference with respect to previous investigations and a naive picture is that
within our approach replicas do not appear: instead of (multi)-overlaps as
order parameters, we introduce a class of magnetizations on all the possible
sub-graphs belonging to the main one investigated: As a consequence, for these
objects a closure for a self-consistent relation is achieved.
