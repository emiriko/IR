Recently a minimalistic scenario has been developed to explain dark matter
and tiny but nonzero neutrino masses. In this scenario, a new scalar called
SLIM plays the role of the dark matter. Neutrinos achieve Majorana mass through
a one-loop diagram. This scenario can be realized for both real and complex
SLIM. Simultaneously explaining the neutrino mass and dark matter abundance
constrains the scenario. In particular for real SLIM, an upper bound of a few
MeV on the masses of the new particles and a lower bound on their coupling are
obtained which make the scenario testable. The low energy scenario can be
embedded within various $SU(2)\times U(1)$ symmetric models. I shall briefly
review the scenario and a specific model that embeds the scenario, with special
emphasis on the effects in the charged Kaon decay which might be observable at
the KLOE and NA62 experiments.
