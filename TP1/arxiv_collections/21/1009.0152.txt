Three controlled experiments testing the benefits that Java programmers gain
from using the Two-Tier Programming Toolkit have recently been concluded. The
first experiment offers statistically significant evidence (p-value: 0.02) that
programmers who undertook only minimal (1-hour) training in using the current
prototype exhibit 76% productivity gains in key tasks in software development
and maintenance. The second experiment shows that the use of the TTP Toolkit is
likely (p-value: 0.10) to almost triple the accuracy of programmers performing
tasks associated with software quality. The third experiment shows that the TTP
Toolkit does not offer significant productivity gains in performing very short
(under 10 min.) tasks.
