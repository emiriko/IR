The existing polar continuum theory contains unresolved indeterminacies in
the spherical part of the couple-stress tensor. This severely restricts its
applicability in the study of micro and nano-scale solid and fluid mechanics
and, perhaps more importantly, in the investigation of fluid turbulence
phenomena, which involve a broad range of scales. In this paper, we rely on the
energy equation, along with some kinematical considerations, to establish a
consistent couple-stress theory for polar continua that resolves all
indeterminacies. After presenting the general formulation and obtaining
conservation laws, we concentrate exclusively on couple stress theory for polar
fluid mechanics. We specialize the theory for linear viscous flow and consider
several boundary value problems in couple-stress fluid mechanics. More
generally, the resulting theory presented here may provide a basis for
fundamental continuum-level studies at the finest scales.
