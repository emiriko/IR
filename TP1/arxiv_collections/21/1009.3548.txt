We adopted the form of v.e.v. of the bulk scalar field proposed by P.Zhang in
this paper, and changed the dilaton background from $e^{-\kappa^2z^2}$ to
$e^{-\kappa^2z^2+\alpha z}$ accordingly. The calculation shows that, as if we
choose proper parameters, we can get a better result than both the present
soft-wall models and the hard-wall model while keeping Regge behavior
unchanged.
