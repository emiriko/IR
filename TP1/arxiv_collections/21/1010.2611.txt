We present a fluid dynamics video showing the behavior of drops of liquid
oxygen, at room temperature. Due to their low boiling point, these drops
levitate on a cushion of their own vapour. This property gives them a high
mobility, as known more generally in such Leidenfrost situations. But liquid
oxygen is also paramagnetic, and thus likely to be manipulated using a magnet.
It is first shown that the shape of the drop can be modified by changing the
drop/magnet distance; approaching the magnet acts as reinforcing gravity, so
that the drops get flattened by this action. The transformation is of course
reversible: as the magnet is withdrawn, the liquid recovers its quasi-spherical
shape. Magnets can also be used to trap the oxygen drops. As they pass above a
magnet, they slow down significantly, a consequence of their deformation:
despite a very low friction, the vibrations induced by the drop deformations
represent an important source of dissipation: below a well-defined velocity,
drops can even be stopped in the magnetic trap. Quicker ones can be decelerated
and then captured by series of magnets. Oberving the same events from the top
reveals the complex shapes adopted by the liquid as it crosses the traps.
