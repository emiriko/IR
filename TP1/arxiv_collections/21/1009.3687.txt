This paper introduces a knowledge recognition algorithm (KRA) for solving the
3SAT problem in polynomial time. KRA learns member-class relations and
retrieves information through deductive and reductive iterative reasoning. It
applies the principle of Chinese COVA* (equivalent to a set of eight 3-variable
conjunctive clauses) and eliminates the "OR" operation to solve 3-SAT problem.
That is, KRA does not search the assignment directly. It recognizes the
complements as rejections at each level of the set through iterative set
relation recognition. KRA recognizes which conjunctive 3-variable-clause is not
satisfiable. If all the eight clauses of any set of 3-variable clauses are
rejected, then there is not an assignment for the formula. If there is at least
one clause in each set that remains, then there is at least one assignment that
is the union of clauses of each set. If there is more than one clause in each
set that remains, then there are multiple assignments that are the unions of
the clauses of each set respectively.
