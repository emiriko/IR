We present time-resolved photometry of six faint (V>17mag) cataclysmic
variables (CVs); one of them is V849 Oph and the others are identified from the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS J0920+0042, SDSS J1327+6528, SDSS J1227+5139,
SDSS J1607.02+3623, SDSS J1457+5148). The optical CCD photometric observations
of these objects were performed at the T\"UB\.ITAK National Observatory
(Turkey) between February 2006 and March 2009. We aimed to detect short time
scale orbital variability arisen from hot-spot modulation, flickering
structures which occur from rapid fluctuations of material transferring from
red star to white dwarf and orbital period changes for selected short-period
(P<4h) CVs at quiescence. Results obtained from eclipse timings and light
curves morphology related to white dwarf stars, accretion disks and hot-spots
are discussed for each system. Analysis of the short time coverage of data,
obtained for SDSS J1227+5139 indicates a cyclical period change arisen from
magnetic activity on the secondary star. Photometric period of SDSS J1607+3623
is derived firstly in this study, while for the other five systems light
elements are corrected using the previous and new photometric observations. The
nature of SDSS J1457+5148 is not precisely revealed that its light curve shows
any periodicity that could be related to the orbital period.
