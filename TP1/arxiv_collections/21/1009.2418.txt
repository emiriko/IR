In Jurek 1985 and 1988 the random integral representations conjecture was
stated. It claims that (some) limit laws can be written as probability
distributions of random integrals of the form $\int_{(a,b]}h(t)dY_{\nu}(r(t))$,
for some deterministic functions $h$, $r$ and a L\'evy process $Y_{\nu}(t),t\ge
0$. Here we review situations where a such claim holds true. Each theorem is
followed by a remark which gives references to other related papers, results as
well as some historical comments. Moreover, some open questions are stated.
