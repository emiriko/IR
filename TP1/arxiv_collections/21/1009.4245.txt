Kinetic barriers cause polymers to crystallize incompletely, into nanoscale
lamellae interleaved with amorphous regions. As a result, crystalline polymers
are full of crystal-melt interfaces, which dominate their physical properties.
The longstanding theoretical challenge to understand these interfaces has new
relevance, because of accumulating evidence that polymer crystals often
nucleate via a metastable, partially ordered "rotator" phase. To test this idea
requires a theory of the bulk and interfacial free energies of the critical
nucleus. We present a new approach to the crystal-melt interface, which
represents the amorphous region as a grafted brush of loops in a
self-consistent pressure field. We combine this theory with estimates of bulk
free energy differences, to calculate nucleation barriers and rates via rotator
versus crystal nuclei for polyethylene. We find rotator-phase nucleation is
indeed favored throughout the temperature range where nucleation is observed.
Our methods can be extended to other polymers.
