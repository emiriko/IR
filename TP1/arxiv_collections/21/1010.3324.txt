A multiple exp-function method to exact multiple wave solutions of nonlinear
partial differential equations is proposed. The method is oriented towards ease
of use and capability of computer algebra systems, and provides a direct and
systematical solution procedure which generalizes Hirota's perturbation scheme.
With help of Maple, an application of the approach to the $3+1$ dimensional
potential-Yu-Toda-Sasa-Fukuyama equation yields exact explicit 1-wave and
2-wave and 3-wave solutions, which include 1-soliton, 2-soliton and 3-soliton
type solutions. Two cases with specific values of the involved parameters are
plotted for each of 2-wave and 3-wave solutions.
