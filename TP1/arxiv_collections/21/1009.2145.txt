Light scattering by atmospheric dust particles is responsible for the
polarization observed in some L dwarfs. Whether this polarization arises from
an inhomogeneous distribution of dust across the disk or an oblate shape
induced by rotation remains unclear. Here we argue that the latter case is
plausible and, for many L dwarfs, the more likely one. Furthermore evolutionary
models of mature field L dwarfs predict surface gravities ranging from about
200 to 2500 m/s^2 (corresponding to masses of about 15 to 70 times of Jupiter
mass). Yet comparison of observed spectra to available synthetic spectra often
does not permit more precise determination of the surface gravity of individual
field L dwarfs, leading to important uncertainties in their properties. Since
rotationally-induced non-sphericity, which gives rise to non-zero
disk-integrated polarization, is more pronounced at lower gravities,
polarization is a promising low gravity indicator. Here we combine a rigorous
multiple scattering analysis with a self-consistent cloudy atmospheric model
and observationally inferred rotational velocities and find that the observed
optical polarization can be explained if the surface gravity of the polarized
objects is about 300 m/s^2 or less, potentially providing a new method for
constraining L dwarf masses.
