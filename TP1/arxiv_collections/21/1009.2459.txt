In the present work, we reconstruct different f(T)-gravity models
corresponding to the original and entropy-corrected version of the holographic
and new agegraphic dark energy models. We also obtain the equation of state
parameters of the corresponding f(T)-gravity models. We conclude that the
holographic and new agegraphic f(T)-gravity models behave like phantom or
quintessence model. Whereas in the entropy-corrected models, the equation of
state parameter can justify the transition from the quintessence state to the
phantom regime as indicated by the recent observations.
