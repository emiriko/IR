Dynamical models of prototype gravastars made of anisotropic dark energy are
constructed, in which an infinitely thin spherical shell of a perfect fluid
with the equation of state $p = (1-\gamma)\sigma$ divides the whole spacetime
into two regions, the internal region filled with a dark energy fluid, and the
external Schwarzschild region. The models represent "bounded excursion" stable
gravastars, where the thin shell is oscillating between two finite radii, while
in other cases they collapse until the formation of black holes. Here we show,
for the first time in the literature, a model of gravastar and formation of
black hole with both interior and thin shell constituted exclusively of dark
energy. Besides, the sign of the parameter of anisotropy ($p_t - p_r$) seems to
be relevant to the gravastar formation. The formation is favored when the
tangential pressure is greater than the radial pressure, at least in the
neighborhood of the isotropic case ($\omega=-1$).
