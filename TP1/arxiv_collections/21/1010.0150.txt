Since many of the currently available multi-agent frameworks are generally
mostly intended for research, it can be difficult to built multi-agent systems
using physical robots. In this report I describe a way to combine the
multi-agent framework Jason, an extended version of the agent-oriented
programming language AgentSpeak, with Lego robots to address this problem. By
extending parts of the Jason reasoning cycle I show how Lego robots are able to
complete tasks such as following lines on a floor and communicating to be able
to avoid obstacles with minimal amount of coding. The final implementation is a
functional extension that is able to built multi-agent systems using Lego
agents, however there are some issues that have not been addressed. If the
agents are highly dependent on percepts from their sensors, they are required
to move quite slowly, because there currently is a high delay in the reasoning
cycle, when it is combined with a robot. Overall the system is quite robust and
can be used to make simple Lego robots perform tasks of an advanced agent in a
multi-agent environment.
