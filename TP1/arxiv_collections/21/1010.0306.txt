We review some aspects of Bayesian and frequentist interval estimation,
focusing first on their relative strengths and weaknesses when used in "clean"
or "textbook" contexts. We then turn attention to observational-data situations
which are "messy," where modeling that acknowledges the limitations of study
design and data collection leads to nonidentifiability. We argue, via a series
of examples, that Bayesian interval estimation is an attractive way to proceed
in this context even for frequentists, because it can be supplied with a
diagnostic in the form of a calibration-sensitivity simulation analysis. We
illustrate the basis for this approach in a series of theoretical
considerations, simulations and an application to a study of silica exposure
and lung cancer.
