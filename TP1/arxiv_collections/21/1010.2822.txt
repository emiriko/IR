The notion of contract aware components has been published roughly ten years
ago and is now becoming mainstream in several fields where the usage of
software components is seen as critical. The goal of this paper is to survey
domains such as Embedded Systems or Service Oriented Architecture where the
notion of contract aware components has been influential. For each of these
domains we briefly describe what has been done with this idea and we discuss
the remaining challenges.
