The phenomenon of vacuum decay, i.e. electron-positron pair production due to
the instability of the quantum electrodynamics vacuum in an external field, is
a remarkable prediction of Dirac theory whose experimental observation is still
lacking. Here a classic wave optics analogue of vacuum decay, based on light
propagation in curved waveguide superlattices, is proposed. Our photonic
analogue enables a simple and experimentally-accessible visualization in space
of the process of pair production as break up of an initially negative-energy
Gaussian wave packet, representing an electron in the Dirac sea, under the
influence of an oscillating electric field.
