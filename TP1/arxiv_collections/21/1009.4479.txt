We have measured velocity dispersions for a sample of 36 galaxies with J <
21.2 or Mr < -20.6 mag in MS1054-03, a massive cluster of galaxies at z = 0.83.
Our data are of uniformly high quality down to our selection limit, our 16-hour
exposures typically yielding errors of only \delta(dispersion)~10% for L* and
fainter galaxies. By combining our measurements with data from the literature,
we have 53 cluster galaxies with measured dispersions, and HST/ACS-derived
sizes, colors and surface brightnesses. This sample is complete for the typical
L* galaxy at z~1, unlike most previous z~1 cluster samples which are complete
only for the massive cluster members (>1e11 M_sun). We find no evidence for a
change in the tilt of the fundamental plane (FP). Nor do we find evidence for
evolution in the slope of the color-dispersion relation and M/L_B-dispersion
relations; measuring evolution at a fixed dispersion should minimize the impact
of size evolution found in other work. The M/L_B at fixed dispersion evolves by
\Delta log10 M/L_B=-0.50 +/- 0.03 between z=0.83 and z=0.02 or d(log10
M/L_B)=-0.60 +/- 0.04 dz, and we find \Delta (U-V)_z=-0.24 +/- 0.02 mag at
fixed dispersion in the rest-frame, matching the expected evolution in M/L_B
within 2.25 standard deviations. The implied formation redshift from both the
color and M/L_B evolution is z*=2.0 +/- 0.2 +/- 0.3 (sys), during the epoch in
which the cosmic star-formation activity peaked, with the systematic
uncertainty showing the dependence of z* on the assumptions we make about the
stellar populations. The lack of evolution in either the tilt of the FP or in
the M/L- and color-dispersion relations imply that the formation epoch depends
weakly on mass, ranging from z*=2.3 +1.3 -0.3 at 300 km/s to z*=1.7 +0.3 -0.2
at 160 km/s and implies that the IMF similarly varies slowly with galaxy mass.
