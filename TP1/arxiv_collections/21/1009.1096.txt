We discuss here the issue of regularity of initial data for dynamical
spherically symmetric massless scalar field models in a spacetime. Generalizing
the known solutions of Einstein equations given in this case by Wyman and
Roberts, we examine the issue of regularity on a given spacelike surface,
especially when the gradient of the field is spacelike. In particular, we
isolate the class of models which would have necessarily a singularity at the
center, and therefore these would be unsuitable for studying either
gravitational collapse or dynamical evolutions in cosmology.
