Three-wave interactions in plasmas are described, in the framework of kinetic
theory, by the quadratic response tensor (QRT). The cold-plasma QRT is a common
approximation for interactions between three fast waves. Here, the first-order
thermal correction (FOTC) to the cold-plasma QRT is derived for interactions
between three fast waves in a warm unmagnetized collisionless plasma, whose
particles have an arbitrary isotropic distribution function. The FOTC to the
cold-plasma QRT is shown to depend on the second moment of the distribution
function, the phase speeds of the waves, and the interaction geometry. Previous
calculations of the rate for second harmonic plasma emission (via Langmuir-wave
coalescence) assume the cold-plasma QRT. The FOTC to the cold-plasma QRT is
used here to calculate the FOTC to the second harmonic emission rate, and its
importance is assessed in various physical situations. The FOTC significantly
increases the rate when the ratio of the Langmuir phase speed to the electron
thermal speed is less than about 3.
