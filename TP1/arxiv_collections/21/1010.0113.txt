We present a Regge-inspired effective-Lagrangian framework for neutral-kaon
photoproduction from the deuteron. Quasi-free kaon production is investigated
using the Regge-plus-resonance elementary operator within the relativistic
plane-wave impulse approximation. The Regge-plus-resonance model was developed
to describe photoinduced and electroinduced charged-kaon production off
protons. We show how this elementary operator can be transformed to account for
the production of neutral kaons from both protons and neutrons. Our results
compare favourably to the sole 2H(gamma,K0)YN dataset published to date.
