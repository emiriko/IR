A very recent paper by the CMS collaboration \cite{cms_ridge} has created
large discussion in the media, which call it important but did not explain why,
in some places even calling it "unundestandable". While it is of course too
soon to know what causes the correlations in question, a very similar
observation in heavy ion collisions at RHIC has rather simple explanation
related to explosion of high energy density matter. Perhaps this observation is
the first hint for an explosive behavior in pp, which was anticipated and
looked for for decades, yet never been seen.
