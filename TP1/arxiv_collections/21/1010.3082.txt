The history of acoustic neutrino detection technology is shortly reviewed
from first ideas 50 years ago to the detailed R&D programs of the last decade.
The physics potential of ultra-high energy neutrino interaction studies is
discussed for some examples. Ideas about the necessary detector size and
suitable design are presented.
