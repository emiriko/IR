The paper proposes an ancient landscape design as an example of graphic
design for an age and place where no written documents existed. It is created
by a network of earthworks, which constitute the remains of an extensive
ancient agricultural system. It can be seen by means of the Google satellite
imagery on the Peruvian region near the Titicaca Lake, as a texture
superimposed to the background landform. In this texture, many drawings
(geoglyphs) can be observed.
