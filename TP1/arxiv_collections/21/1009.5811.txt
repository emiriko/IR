Inspired by bacterial chemotaxis we propose a hydrodynamic molecular scale
hunter that can swim and find its target. The system is essentially a
stochastic low Reynolds swimmer with ability to move in two dimensional space
and sense the local value of the chemical concentration emitted by a target. We
show that by adjusting the geometrical and dynamical variables of the swimmer
we can always achieve a swimmer that can navigate and search for the region
with higher concentration of a chemical emitted from a source. The system
discussed here can also be considered as a theoretical framework for describing
the bacterial chemotaxis.
