In this work the gravitational lensing in the strong field limit around the
Schwarzschild black hole pierced by a cosmic string is studied. We find that
the deflection angle and the time delay of the relativistic images depend on
the tension of cosmic string. It is interesting that the deflection angle is
greater when the tension of cosmic string is stronger. The time delay between
two images is more obvious in the case of weaker tension.
