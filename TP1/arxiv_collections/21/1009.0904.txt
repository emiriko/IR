We theoretically demonstrate the capability of a ferromagnetic-normal (FN)
interface in graphene to focus an electron-wave with a certain spin direction.
The essential feature is the negative refraction Klein tunneling, which is
spin-resolved when the exchange energy of F graphene exceeds its Fermi energy.
Exploiting this property, we propose a graphene NFN electronic spin lens
through which an unpolarized electronic beam can be collimated with a finite
spin-polarization. Our study reveals that magnetic graphene has the potential
to be the electronic counterpart of the recently discovered photonic chiral
meta-materials that exhibit a negative refractive index for only one direction
of the circular polarization of the photon-wave.
