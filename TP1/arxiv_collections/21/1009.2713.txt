Two particles that are just shy of binding may develop an infinite number of
shallow bound states when a third particle is added. This counter intuitive
quantum mechanical result was first predicted by V. Efimov for identical bosons
interacting with a short-range pair-wise potential. The so-called Efimov effect
persists even for non-identical particles, provided at least two of the three
bonds are almost bound. The Efimov effect has recently been verified
experimentally using ultra-cold atoms. In this article, we explain the origin
of this effect using only elementary quantum mechanics, and summarize the
experimental evidence for the Efimov effect. A new, simple derivation for the
number of Efimov states is given in the Appendix.
