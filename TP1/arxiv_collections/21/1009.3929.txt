The discovery of charged Higgs bosons is of particular importance, since
their existence is predicted by supersymmetry and they are absent in the
Standard Model (SM). If the charged Higgs bosons are too heavy to be produced
in pairs at future linear colliders, single production associated with a top
and a bottom quark is enhanced in parts of the parameter space. We present the
next-to-leading-order calculation in supersymmetric QCD within the minimal
supersymmetric SM (MSSM), completing a previous calculation of the SM-QCD
corrections. In addition to the usual approach to perform the loop integration
analytically, we apply a numerical approach based on the Bernstein-Tkachov
theorem. In this framework, we avoid some of the generic problems connected
with the analytical method.
