Dwarf elliptical galaxies are the most common galaxy type in nearby galaxy
clusters, yet they remain relatively poorly studied objects and many of their
basic properties have yet to be quantified. In this contribution we present the
preliminary results of a study of 4 Virgo and 1 field galaxy obtained with the
SAURON integral field unit on the William Herschel Telescope (La Palma). While
traditional long-slit observations are likely to miss more complicated
kinematic features, with SAURON we are able to study both kinematics and
stellar populations in two dimensions, obtaining a much more detailed view of
the mass distribution and star formation histories.
