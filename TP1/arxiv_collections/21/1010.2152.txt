At fast rotation rates the coronal activity of G- and K-type stars has been
observed to "saturate" and then decline again at even faster rotation rates --
a phenomenon dubbed "super-saturation". In this paper we investigate coronal
activity in fast-rotating M-dwarfs using deep XMM-Newton observations of 97
low-mass stars of known rotation period in the young open cluster NGC 2547, and
combine these with published X-ray surveys of low-mass field and cluster stars
of known rotation period. Like G- and K-dwarfs, we find that M-dwarfs exhibit
increasing coronal activity with decreasing Rossby number N_R, the ratio of
period to convective turnover time, and that activity saturates at L_x/L_bol ~
10^-3 for log N_R < -0.8. However, super-saturation is not convincingly
displayed by M-dwarfs, despite the presence of many objects in our sample with
log N_R < -1.8, where super-saturation is observed to occur in higher mass
stars. Instead, it appears that a short rotation period is the primary
predictor of super-saturation; P <=0.3d for K-dwarfs and perhaps P <=0.2d for
M-dwarfs. These observations favour the "centrifugal stripping" model for
super-saturation, where coronal structures are forced open or become
radiatively unstable as the Keplerian co-rotation radius moves inside the X-ray
emitting coronal volume.
