We report on the noise of a lumped element Direct Current Superconducting
Quantum Interference Device amplifier. We show that the noise temperature in
the 4 GHz-8 GHz range over ranges of 10's of MHz is below 1 kelvin (three
photons of added noise), characterize the overall behavior of the noise as a
function of bias parameters, and discuss potential mechanisms which determine
the noise performance in this amplifier. We show that this device can provide
more than a factor of 10 improvement in practical system noise over existing
phase-preserving microwave measurement systems in this frequency band.
