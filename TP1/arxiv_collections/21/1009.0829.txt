Recently a model has been proposed that links dark matter and neutrino
masses. The dark matter candidate which is dubbed as SLIM has a mass of MeV
scale and can show up at low energy experiments. The model also has a high
energy sector which consists of a scalar doublet, $(\phi^-, \phi^0)$. We
discuss the potential of the LHC for discovering the new scalars. We focus on
the $\phi^+\phi^-$ and $\phi^{\pm} \phi^0$ production and the subsequent decay
of the charged scalar to a charged lepton and the SLIM which appears as missing
energy. Identifying the background, we estimate the signal significance and
find that it can exceed $5 \sigma$ at 30 ${\rm fb}^{-1}$ for the 14 TeV run at
the LHC. We comment on the possibility of extracting the flavor structure of
the Yukawa couplings which also determine the neutrino mass matrix. Finally, we
discuss the prospects of this search at the current 7 TeV run of the LHC.
