A major factor affecting the readability of a graph drawing is its
resolution. In the graph drawing literature, the resolution of a drawing is
either measured based on the angles formed by consecutive edges incident to a
common node (angular resolution) or by the angles formed at edge crossings
(crossing resolution). In this paper, we evaluate both by introducing the
notion of "total resolution", that is, the minimum of the angular and crossing
resolution. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time where the
problem of maximizing the total resolution of a drawing is studied.
  The main contribution of the paper consists of drawings of asymptotically
optimal total resolution for complete graphs (circular drawings) and for
complete bipartite graphs (2-layered drawings). In addition, we present and
experimentally evaluate a force-directed based algorithm that constructs
drawings of large total resolution.
