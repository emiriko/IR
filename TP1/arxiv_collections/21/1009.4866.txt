Triple-differential cross sections for two-photon double ionization of
molecular hydrogen are presented for a central photon energy of 30 eV. The
calculations are based on a fully {\it ab initio}, nonperturbative, approach to
the time-dependent Schroedinger equation in prolate spheroidal coordinates,
discretized by a finite-element discrete-variable-representation. The wave
function is propagated in time for a few femtoseconds using the short,
iterative Lanczos method to study the correlated response of the two
photoelectrons to short, intense laser radiation. The current results often lie
in between those of Colgan {\it et al} [J. Phys. B {\bf 41} (2008) 121002] and
Morales {\it et al} [J. Phys. B {\bf 41} (2009) 134013]. However, we argue that
these individual predictions should not be compared directly to each other, but
preferably to experimental data generated under well-defined conditions.
