The objective of this work is to investigate the coupling of fluid dynamics,
heat transfer and mass transfer during the impact and evaporation of droplets
on a heated solid substrate. A laser-based thermoreflectance method is used to
measure the temperature at the solid-liquid interface, with a time and space
resolution of 100 {\mu}s and 20 {\mu}m, respectively. Isopropanol droplets with
micro- and nanoliter volumes are considered. A finite-element model is used to
simulate the transient fluid dynamics and heat transfer during the droplet
deposition process, considering the dynamics of wetting as well as Laplace and
Marangoni stresses on the liquid-gas boundary. For cases involving evaporation,
the diffusion of vapor in the atmosphere is solved numerically, providing an
exact boundary condition for the evaporative flux at the droplet-air interface.
High-speed visualizations are performed to provide matching parameters for the
wetting model used in the simulations. Numerical and experimental results are
compared for the transient heat transfer and the fluid dynamics involved during
the droplet deposition. Our results describe and explain temperature
oscillations at the drop-substrate interface during the early stages of impact.
For the first time, a full simulation of the impact and subsequent evaporation
of a drop on a heated surface is performed, and excellent agreement is found
with the experimental results. Our results also shed light on the influence of
wetting on the heat transfer during evaporation.
