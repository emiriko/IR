Consider a relatively hyperbolic group G. We prove that if G is finitely
presented, so are its parabolic subgroups. Moreover, a presentation of the
parabolic subgroups can be found algorithmically from a presentation of G, a
solution of its word problem, and generating sets of the parabolic subgroups.
We also give an algorithm that finds parabolic subgroups in a given recursively
enumerable class of groups.
