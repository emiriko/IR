The charged fermion mass matrices are invariant under $U(1)^3$ symmetry
linked to the fermion number transformation. Under the condition that the
definition of this symmetry in arbitrary weak basis does not depend upon Higgs
parameters such as ratio of vacuum expectation values, a class of two Higgs
doublet models (2HDM) can be identified in which tree level flavor changing
neutral currents normally present in 2HDM are absent. However unlike the type I
or type II Higgs doublet models, the charged Higgs couplings in these models
contain additional flavor dependent CP violating phases. These phases can
account for the recent hints of the beyond standard model CP violation in the
$B_d$ and $B_s$ mixing. In particular, there is a range of parameters in which
new phases do not contribute to the $K$ meson CP violation but give identical
new physics phases in the $B_d$ and $B_s$ meson mixing.
