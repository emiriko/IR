When a slightly defective rutile TiO$_2$(110) surface is exposed to O$_2$ at
elevated temperatures, the molecule dissociates at defects, filling O vacancies
(\ov) and creating O adatoms (\oad) on {\tifc} rows. The adsorption of
molecular O$_2$ at low temperatures has remained controversial. Low-Temperature
Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (LT-STM) of O$_2$, dosed on TiO$_2$(110) at a
sample temperature of $\approx$ 100 K and imaged at 17 K, shows a molecular
precursor at \ov as a faint change in contrast. The adsorbed O$_2$ easily
dissociates during the STM measurements, and formation of \oad's at both sides
of the original \ov is observed.
