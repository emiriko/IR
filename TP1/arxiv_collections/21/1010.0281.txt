We develop a unitarized formalism to study tetraquarks using the triple
flip-flop potential, which includes two meson-meson potentials and the
tetraquark four-body potential. This can be related to the Jaffe-Wilczek and to
the Karliner-Lipkin tetraquark models, where we also consider the possible open
channels, since the four quarks and antiquarks may at any time escape to a pair
of mesons. Here we study a simplified two-variable toy model and explore the
analogy with a cherry in a glass, but a broken one where the cherry may escape
from. It is quite interesting to have our system confined or compact in one
variable and infinite in the other variable. In this framework we solve the
two-variable Schr\"odinger equation in configuration space. With the finite
difference method, we compute the spectrum, we search for localized states and
we attempt to compute phase shifts. We then apply the outgoing spherical wave
method to compute in detail the phase shifts and and to determine the decay
widths. We explore the model in the equal mass case, and we find narrow
resonances. In particular the existence of two commuting angular momenta is
responsible for our small decay widths.
