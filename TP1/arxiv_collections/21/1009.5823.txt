Hyperspectral imaging has proven its efficiency for target detection
applications but the acquisition mode and the data rate are major issues when
dealing with real-time detection applications. It can be useful to use snapshot
spectral imagers able to acquire all the spectral channels simultaneously on a
single image sensor. Such snapshot spectral imagers suffer from the lack of
spectral resolution. It is then mandatory to carefully select the spectral
content of the acquired image with respect to the proposed application. We
present a novel approach of hyperspectral band selection for target detection
which maximizes the contrast between the background and the target by proper
optimization of positions and linewidths of a limited number of filters. Based
on a set of tunable band-pass filters such as Fabry-Perot filters, the device
should be able to adapt itself to the current scene and the target looked for.
Simulations based on real hyperspectral images show that such snapshot imagers
could compete well against hyperspectral imagers in terms of detection
efficiency while allowing snapshot acquisition, and real-time detection.
