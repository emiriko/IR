Several photometric surveys for short-period transiting giant planets have
targeted a number of open clusters, but no convincing detections have been
made. Although each individual survey typically targeted an insufficient number
of stars to expect a detection assuming the frequency of short-period giant
planets found in surveys of field stars, we ask whether the lack of detections
from the ensemble of open cluster surveys is inconsistent with expectations
from the field planet population. We select a subset of existing transit
surveys with well-defined selection criteria and quantified detection
efficiencies, and statistically combine their null results to show that the
upper limit on the planet fraction is 5.5% and 1.4% for 1.0 $R_{J}$ and 1.5
$R_{J}$ planets, respectively in the $3<P<5$ day period range. For the period
range of $1<P<3$ days we find upper limits of 1.4% and 0.31% for 1.0 $R_{J}$
and 1.5 $R_{J}$, respectively. Comparing these results to the frequency of
short-period giant planets around field stars in both radial velocity and
transit surveys, we conclude that there is no evidence to suggest that open
clusters support a fundamentally different planet population than field stars
given the available data.
