A theory of light diffraction from planar quasicrystalline lattice with
resonant scatterers is presented. Rich structure, absent in the periodic case,
is found in specular reflection spectra, and interpreted as a specific kind of
Wood anomalies, characteristic for quasicrystals. The theory is applied to
semiconductor quantum dots arranged in Penrose tiling.
