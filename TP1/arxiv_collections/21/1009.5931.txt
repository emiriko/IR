We study the emergence of several magnetic phases in dipolar bosonic gases
subject to three-body loss mechanism employing numerical simulations based on
the density matrix renormalization group(DMRG) algorithm. After mapping the
original Hamiltonian in spin language, we find a strong parallelism between the
bosonic theory and the spin-1 Heisenberg model with single ion anisotropy and
long-range interactions. A rich phase diagram, including ferromagnetic,
antiferromagnetic and non-local ordered phases, emerges in the half-filled
one-dimensional case, and is preserved even in presence of a trapping
potential.
