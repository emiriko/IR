Experiments of water droplets impacting small geometric posts of equal
dimension to the drop diameter are shown in this fluid dynamics video. High
speed photography shows that the dynamics of drop splashing are significantly
affected by the geometrical boundary of the target and that finger formation
and drop break up are accurately controlled.
