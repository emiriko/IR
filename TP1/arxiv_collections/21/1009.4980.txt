The enhanced frequency based keypad is designed to speed up the typing
process. This paper will show that the proposed layout will increase the typing
speed and be flexible for thumb. Traditional cell phone keypad is not a
scientific keypad from the frequency point of view. Approaches have been
explored to speed up the typing process. We found that no manufacturer has
considered the frequency of the alphabet. The current architecture does not
provide flexibility although the users are accustomed to the currently
available multi-tapping keypad. Since the currently available keypad layouts
are not best suited for users, this paper will suggest a keypad for cell phone
and other cellular device based on the frequency of the alphabet in English
language and also with the view of structure of human finger movements to
provide a flexible and fast cell phone keypad. It also takes into consideration
the key jamming problem that was available in typewriter. At first we
identified those keys of cell phone, which are easily reachable and create less
pressure on the thumb. Thus the key frequency order is calculated from
anatomical point of view. In our proposed layout we arranged the alphabet in
the frequent keys based on the frequency of the alphabet.
