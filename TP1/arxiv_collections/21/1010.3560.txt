The superconducting properties of Lu2Fe3Si5 with Tc = 6.1 K have been
investigated using low-temperature transverse-field muon spin rotation
(${\mu}$SR) and specific heat measurements. The magnetic penetration depth at
zero temperature is 353(1) nm. However, the temperature dependence of the
magnetic penetration depth is consistent with a two gap s+s-wave model.
Low-temperature specific heat measurements on the same sample also show
evidence of two distinct superconducting gaps.
