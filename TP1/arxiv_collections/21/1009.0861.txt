Low-rank matrix approximations are often used to help scale standard machine
learning algorithms to large-scale problems. Recently, matrix coherence has
been used to characterize the ability to extract global information from a
subset of matrix entries in the context of these low-rank approximations and
other sampling-based algorithms, e.g., matrix com- pletion, robust PCA. Since
coherence is defined in terms of the singular vectors of a matrix and is
expensive to compute, the practical significance of these results largely
hinges on the following question: Can we efficiently and accurately estimate
the coherence of a matrix? In this paper we address this question. We propose a
novel algorithm for estimating coherence from a small number of columns,
formally analyze its behavior, and derive a new coherence-based matrix
approximation bound based on this analysis. We then present extensive
experimental results on synthetic and real datasets that corroborate our
worst-case theoretical analysis, yet provide strong support for the use of our
proposed algorithm whenever low-rank approximation is being considered. Our
algorithm efficiently and accurately estimates matrix coherence across a wide
range of datasets, and these coherence estimates are excellent predictors of
the effectiveness of sampling-based matrix approximation on a case-by-case
basis.
