With an effective Lagrangian approach, we give a full analysis on the $NN \to
NN\pi\pi$ and $\bar{N}N\to \bar{N}N\pi\pi$ reactions by exploring the roles of
various resonances with mass up to 1.72 GeV. We find large contributions from
$\Delta$, $N^*(1440)$, $\Delta(1600)$ and $\Delta(1620)$ resonances. Our
calculations also indicate sizeable contributions from nucleon poles for the
energies close to the threshold. A good description to the existing data of
different isospin channels of $NN\to NN\pi\pi$ and $\bar{N}N\to \bar{N}N\pi\pi$
for beam energies up to 2.2 GeV is reached. Our results provide important
implications to the ABC effect and guildlines to the future experimental
projects at COSY, HADES and HIRFL-CSR. We point out that the \={P}ANDA at FAIR
could be an essential place for studying the properties of baryon resonances
and the data with baryon and anti-baryon in final states are worth analyzing.
