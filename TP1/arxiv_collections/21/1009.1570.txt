We investigate some QCD corrections that contribute to the Gross-Llewellyn
Smith (GLS) sum rule, but have not been included in previous analyses of it. We
first review the techniques by which the xF3 structure function is extracted
from combinations of neutrino and antineutrino cross sections. Next we
investigate corrections to the GLS sum rule, with particular attention to
contributions arising from strange quark contributions and from charge symmetry
violating (CSV) parton distributions. We find that additional corrections from
strange quarks and parton CSV are likely to have a small but potentially
significant role in decreasing the current discrepancy between the experimental
and theoretical estimates of the Gross-Llewellyn Smith sum rule.
