We obtain limits on the anomalous coupling $HZ\gamma$ through data published
by the L3 Collaboration on the process $e^+e^-\to \tau^+\tau^- \gamma$. Our
analysis leads to bounds on this coupling of order $10^{-2}$, for an
intermediate mass Higgs boson $115 < M_H < 145$ $GeV$, two orders of magnitude
above the Standard Model prediction.
