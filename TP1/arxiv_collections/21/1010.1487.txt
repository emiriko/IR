In this paper, we show that first-principle calculations using a van der
Waals density functional (vdW-DF), [Phys. Rev. Lett. $\mathbf{92}$, 246401
(2004)] permits determination of molecular crystal structure. We study the
crystal structures of hexamine and the platonic hydrocarbons (cubane and
dodecahedrane). The calculated lattice parameters and cohesion energy agree
well with experiments. Further, we examine the asymptotic accounts of the van
der Waals forces by comparing full vdW-DF with asymptotic atom-based pair
potentials extracted from vdW-DF. The character of the binding differ in the
two cases, with vdW-DF giving a significant enhancement at intermediate and
relevant binding separations. We analyze consequences of this result for
methods such as DFT-D, and question DFT-D's transferability over the full range
of separations.
