We report the creation of Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states with up to 14
qubits. By investigating the coherence of up to 8 ions over time, we observe a
decay proportional to the square of the number of qubits. The observed decay
agrees with a theoretical model which assumes a system affected by correlated,
Gaussian phase noise. This model holds for the majority of current experimental
systems developed towards quantum computation and quantum metrology.
