We show that a source-to-detector distance of 2540 km offers multiple
advantages for a low energy neutrino factory with a detector that can identify
muon charge. At this baseline, for any neutrino hierarchy, the wrong-sign muon
signal is almost independent of CP violation and $\theta_{13}$ in certain
energy ranges. This reduces the uncertainties due to these parameters and
allows the identification of the hierarchy in a clean way. In addition, part of
the muon spectrum is also sensitive to the CP violating phase and
$\theta_{13}$, so that the same setup can be used to probe these parameters as
well.
