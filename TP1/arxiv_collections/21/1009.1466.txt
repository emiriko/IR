We present animations based on the aggregated journal-journal citations of
Leonardo during the period 1974-2008. Leonardo is mainly cited by journals
outside the arts domain for cultural reasons, for example, in neuropsychology
and physics. Articles in Leonardo itself cite a large number of journals, but
with a focus on the arts. Animations at this level of aggregation enable us to
show the history of the journal from a network perspective.
