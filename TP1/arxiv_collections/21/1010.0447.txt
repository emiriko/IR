Let $g$ be a simple Lie algebra and $V[0]=V_1\otimes...\otimes V_n[0]$ the
zero weight subspace of a tensor product of $g$-modules. The trigonometric KZB
operators are commuting differential operators acting on $V[0]$-valued
functions on the Cartan subalgebra of $g$. Meromorphic eigenfunctions to the
operators are constructed by the Bethe ansatz. We introduce a scalar product on
a suitable space of functions such that the operators become symmetric, and the
square of the norm of a Bethe eigenfunction equals the Hessian of the master
function at the corresponding critical point.
