We study statistics of first passage inside a cone in arbitrary spatial
dimension. The probability that a diffusing particle avoids the cone boundary
decays algebraically with time. The decay exponent depends on two variables:
the opening angle of the cone and the spatial dimension. In four dimensions, we
find an explicit expression for the exponent, and in general, we obtain it as a
root of a transcendental equation involving associated Legendre functions. At
large dimensions, the decay exponent depends on a single scaling variable,
while roots of the parabolic cylinder function specify the scaling function.
Consequently, the exponent is of order one only if the cone surface is very
close to a plane. We also perform asymptotic analysis for extremely thin and
extremely wide cones.
