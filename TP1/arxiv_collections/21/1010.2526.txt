Co-Higgs bundles are Higgs bundles in the sense of Simpson, but with Higgs
fields that take values in the tangent bundle instead of the cotangent bundle.
Given a vector bundle on P^1, we find necessary and sufficient conditions on
its Grothendieck splitting for it to admit a stable Higgs field. We
characterize the rank-2, odd-degree moduli space as a universal elliptic curve
with a globally-defined equation. For ranks r=2,3,4, we explicitly verify the
conjectural Betti numbers emerging from the recent work of Chuang, Diaconescu,
Pan, and Mozgovoy on the ADHM formula. We state the result for r=5.
