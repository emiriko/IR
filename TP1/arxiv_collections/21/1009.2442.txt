In the present paper we prove a classification (uniqueness) theorem for
stationary, asymptotically flat black hole spacetimes with connected and
non-degenerate horizon in 4D Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theory with an arbitrary
dilaton coupling parameter $\alpha$. We show that such black holes are uniquely
specified by the length of the horizon interval, angular momentum, electric and
magnetic charge and the value of the dilaton field at infinity when the dilaton
coupling parameter satisfies $0\le \alpha^2\le3$. The proof is based on the
nonpositivity of the Riemann curvature operator on the space of the potentials.
A generalization of the classification theorem for spacetimes with disconnected
horizons is also given.
