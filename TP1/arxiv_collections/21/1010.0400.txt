In $pp$ scattering at LHC energies, large numbers of elementary scatterings
will contribute significantly, and the corresponding high multiplicity events
will be of particular interest. Elementary scatterings are parton ladders,
identified with color flux-tubes. In high multiplicity events, many of these
flux tubes are produced in the same space region, creating high energy
densities. We argue that there are good reasons to employ the successful
procedure used for heavy ion collisions: matter is assumed to thermalizes
quickly, such that the energy from the flux-tubes can be taken as initial
condition for a hydrodynamic expansion. This scenario gets spectacular support
from very recent results on Bose-Einstein correlations in $pp$ scattering at
900 GeV at LHC.
