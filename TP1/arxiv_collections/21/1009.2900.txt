Constraint Handling Rules (CHR) is a declarative committed-choice programming
language with a strong relationship to linear logic. Its generalization CHR
with Disjunction (CHRv) is a multi-paradigm declarative programming language
that allows the embedding of horn programs. We analyse the assets and the
limitations of the classical declarative semantics of CHR before we motivate
and develop a linear-logic declarative semantics for CHR and CHRv. We show how
to apply the linear-logic semantics to decide program properties and to prove
operational equivalence of CHRv programs across the boundaries of language
paradigms.
