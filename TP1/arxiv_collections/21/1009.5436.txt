Starting from the canonical formalism of relativistic (timeless) quantum
mechanics, the formulation of timeless path integral is rigorously derived. The
transition amplitude is reformulated as the sum, or functional integral, over
all possible paths in the constraint surface specified by the (relativistic)
Hamiltonian constraint, and each path contributes with a phase identical to the
classical action divided by $\hbar$. The timeless path integral manifests the
timeless feature as it is completely independent of the parametrization for
paths. For the special case that the Hamiltonian constraint is a quadratic
polynomial in momenta, the transition amplitude admits the timeless Feynman's
path integral over the (relativistic) configuration space. Meanwhile, the
difference between relativistic quantum mechanics and conventional
nonrelativistic (with time) quantum mechanics is elaborated on in light of
timeless path integral.
