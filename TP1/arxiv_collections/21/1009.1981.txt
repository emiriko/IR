We investigate Lie-Trotter product formulae for abstract nonlinear evolution
equations with delay. Using results from the theory of nonlinear contraction
semigroups in Hilbert spaces, we explain the convergence of the splitting
procedure. The order of convergence is also investigated in detail, and some
numerical illustrations are presented.
