The basic motivation of the KLOE-2 experiment is the test of fundamental
symmetries and Quantum Mechanics coherence of the neutral kaon system, and the
search for phenomena beyond the Standard Model in the hadronic and leptonic
decays of ground-state mesons. Perspectives for experimentation by means of the
KLOE-2 apparatus equipped with the inner tracker, new scintillation
calorimeters, and the gamma-gamma taggers at the DA\$Phi$NE electron-positron
collider upgraded in luminosity and energy are presented.
