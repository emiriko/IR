In This paper we present a genetic algorithm for mulicriteria optimization of
a multipickup and delivery problem with time windows (m-PDPTW). The m-PDPTW is
an optimization vehicles routing problem which must meet requests for transport
between suppliers and customers satisfying precedence, capacity and time
constraints. This paper purposes a brief literature review of the PDPTW,
present an approach based on genetic algorithms and Pareto dominance method to
give a set of satisfying solutions to the m-PDPTW minimizing total travel cost,
total tardiness time and the vehicles number.
