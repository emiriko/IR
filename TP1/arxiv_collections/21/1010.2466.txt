The $n$-dimensional hypercube network $Q_n$ is one of the most popular
interconnection networks since it has simple structure and is easy to
implement. The $n$-dimensional locally twisted cube, denoted by $LTQ_n$, an
important variation of the hypercube, has the same number of nodes and the same
number of connections per node as $Q_n$. One advantage of $LTQ_n$ is that the
diameter is only about half of the diameter of $Q_n$. Recently, some
interesting properties of $LTQ_n$ were investigated. In this paper, we
construct two edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles in the locally twisted cube
$LTQ_n$, for any integer $n\geqslant 4$. The presence of two edge-disjoint
Hamiltonian cycles provides an advantage when implementing algorithms that
require a ring structure by allowing message traffic to be spread evenly across
the locally twisted cube.
