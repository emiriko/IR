In the framework of the nuclear spectral function approach for incoherent
primary proton-nucleon and secondary pion-nucleon production processes we study
the inclusive Lambda(1520) hyperon production in the interaction of 2.83 GeV
protons with nuclei. In particular, the A and momentum dependences of the
absolute and relative Lambda(1520) hyperon yields are investigated in two
scenarios for its in-medium width. Our model calculations show that the
pion-nucleon production channel contributes distinctly to the "low-momentum"
Lambda(1520) creation both in light and heavy nuclei in the chosen kinematics
and, hence, has to be taken into consideration on close examination of the
dependences of the Lambda(1520) hyperon yields on the target mass number with
the aim of getting information on its width in the medium. They also
demonstrate that both the A dependence of the relative Lambda(1520) hyperon
production cross section and momentum dependence of the absolute Lambda(1520)
hyperon yield at incident energy of interest are appreciably sensitive to the
Lambda(1520) in-medium width, which means that these observables may be an
important tool to determine the above width.
