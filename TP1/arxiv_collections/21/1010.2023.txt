In theories with Universal Extra-Dimensions (UED), the gamma_1 particle,
first excited state of the hypercharge gauge boson, provides an excellent Dark
Matter (DM) candidate. Here we use a modified version of the SuperBayeS code to
perform a Bayesian analysis of the minimal UED scenario, in order to assess its
detectability at accelerators and with DM experiments. We derive in particular
the most probable range of mass and scattering cross sections off nucleons,
keeping into account cosmological and electroweak precision constraints. The
consequences for the detectability of the gamma_1 with direct and indirect
experiments are dramatic. The spin-independent cross section probability
distribution peaks at ~ 10^{-11} pb, i.e. below the sensitivity of ton-scale
experiments. The spin-dependent cross-section drives the predicted neutrino
flux from the center of the Sun below the reach of present and upcoming
experiments. The only strategy that remains open appears to be direct detection
with ton-scale experiments sensitive to spin-dependent cross-sections. On the
other hand, the LHC with 1 1/fb of data should be able to probe the current
best-fit UED parameters.
