In the present paper we begin studies on the large time asymptotic behavior
for solutions of the Cauchy problem for the Novikov--Veselov equation (an
analog of KdV in 2 + 1 dimensions) at positive energy. In addition, we are
focused on a family of reflectionless (transparent) potentials parameterized by
a function of two variables. In particular, we show that there are no isolated
soliton type waves in the large time asymptotics for these solutions in
contrast with well-known large time asymptotics for solutions of the KdV
equation with reflectionless initial data.
