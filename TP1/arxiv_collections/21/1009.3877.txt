Software development in high energy physics experiments offers unique
experience with rapidly changing environment and variety of different standards
and frameworks that software must be adapted to. As such, regular methods of
software development are hard to use as they do not take into account how
greatly some of these changes influence the whole structure. The following
thesis summarizes development of TAUOLA C++ Interface introducing tau decays to
new event record standard. Documentation of the program is already published.
That is why it is not recalled here again. We focus on the development cycle
and methodology used in the project, starting from the definition of the
expectations through planning and designing the abstract model and concluding
with the implementation. In the last part of the paper we present installation
of the software within different experiments surrounding Large Hadron Collider
and the problems that emerged during this process.
