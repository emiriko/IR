Heteroepitaxially grown bilayers of ferromagnetic La$_{0.7}$Ca$_{0.3}$MnO$_3$
(LCMO) on top of superconducting YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$ (YBCO) thin films were
investigated by focusing on electric transport properties as well as on
magnetism and orbital occupation at the interface. Transport measurements on
YBCO single layers and on YBCO/LCMO bilayers, with different YBCO thickness
$d_Y$ and constant LCMO thickness $d_L=50$\,nm, show a significant reduction of
the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ only for $d_Y<10$\,nm,with
only a slightly stronger $T_c$ suppression in the bilayers, as compared to the
single layers. X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) measurements confirm
recently published data of an induced magnetic moment on the interfacial Cu by
the ferromagnetically ordered Mn ions, with antiparallel alignment between Cu
and Mn moments. However, we observe a significantely larger Cu moment than
previously reported, indicating stronger coupling between Cu and Mn at the
interface. This in turn could result in an interface with lower transparency,
and hence smaller spin diffusion length, that would explain our electric
transport data, i.e.smaller $T_c$ suppression. Moreover, linear dichroism
measurements did not show any evidence for orbital reconstruction at the
interface, indicating that a large change in orbital occupancies through
hybridization is not necessary to induce a measurable ferromagnetic moment on
the Cu atoms.
