We consider the development of Monte Carlo schemes for molecules with Coulomb
interactions. We generalize the classic algorithms of Bird and Nanbu-Babovsky
for rarefied gas dynamics to the Coulomb case thanks to the approximation
introduced by Bobylev and Nanbu (Theory of collision algorithms for gases and
plasmas based on the Boltzmann equation and the Landau-Fokker-Planck equation,
Physical Review E, Vol. 61, 2000). Thus, instead of considering the original
Boltzmann collision operator, the schemes are constructed through the use of an
approximated Boltzmann operator. With the above choice larger time steps are
possible in simulations; moreover the expensive acceptance-rejection procedure
for collisions is avoided and every particle collides. Error analysis and
comparisons with the original Bobylev-Nanbu (BN) scheme are performed. The
numerical results show agreement with the theoretical convergence rate of the
approximated Boltzmann operator and the better performance of Bird-type schemes
with respect to the original scheme.
