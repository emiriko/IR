We present optical nuclear spectra for nine 3CR radio sources obtained with
the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo, that complete our spectroscopic observations
of the sample up to redshifts $<$ 0.3. We measure emission line luminosities
and ratios, and derive a spectroscopic classification for these sources.
