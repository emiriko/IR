We exploit the tripartite negativity to study the thermal correlations in a
tripartite system, that is the three outer spins interacting with the central
one in a spin-star system. We analyze the dependence of such correlations on
the homogeneity of the interactions, starting from the case where central-outer
spin interactions are identical and then focusing on the case where the three
coupling constants are different. We single out some important differences
between the negativity and the concurrence.
