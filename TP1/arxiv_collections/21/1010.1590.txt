The various thermodynamic functions dependence on degree of energy band
occupation and temperature was studied. The one-band tight binding
approximation for the electron energy spectrum was used. The Fermi energy,
density of states, degeneracy temperature, chemical potential, partition
function, thermodynamic potential, energy, free energy, entropy, heat capacity,
spin magnetization and initial susceptibility were calculated. The limited
energetic spectrum leads to the peculiarities in the behavior of these
quantities in comparison with free electron gas.
