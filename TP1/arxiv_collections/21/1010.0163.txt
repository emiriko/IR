We propose a combinatorial game on finite graphs, called Salmagundy, that is
played by two protagonists, Dido and Mephisto. The game captures the logical
structure of a proof of the resolution of singularities. In each round, the
graph of the game is modified by the moves of the players. When it assumes a
final configuration, Dido has won. Otherwise, the game goes on forever, and
nobody wins. In particular, Mephisto cannot win himself, he can only prevent
Dido from winning.
  We show that Dido always possesses a winning strategy, regardless of the
initial shape of the graph and of the moves of Mephisto. This implies --
translating back to algebraic geometry -- that there is a choice of centers for
the blowup of singular varieties in characteristic zero which eventually leads
to their resolution. The algebra needed for this implication is elementary. The
transcription from varieties to graphs and from blowups to modifications of the
graph thus axiomatizes the proof of the resolution of singularities. In
principle, the same logic could also work in positive characteristic, once an
appropriate descent in dimension is settled.
