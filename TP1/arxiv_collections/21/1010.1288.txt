Shubnikov-de Haas measurements of high quality URu2Si2 single crystals reveal
two previously unobserved Fermi surface branches in the so-called hidden order
phase. Therefore about 55% of the enhanced mass is now detected. Under pressure
in the antiferromagnetic state, the Shubnikov-de Haas frequencies for magnetic
fields applied along the crystalline c axis show little change compared with
the zero pressure data. This implies a similar Fermi surface in both the hidden
order and antiferromagnetic states, which strongly suggests that the lattice
doubling in the antiferromagnetic phase due to the ordering vector QAF = (0 0
1) already occurs in the hidden order. These measurements provide a good test
for existing or future theories of the hidden order parameter.
