With the dissemination of affordable parallel and distributed hardware,
parallel and distributed constraint solving has lately been the focus of some
attention. To effectually apply the power of distributed computational systems,
there must be an effective sharing of the work involved in the search for a
solution to a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) between all the
participating agents, and it must happen dynamically, since it is hard to
predict the effort associated with the exploration of some part of the search
space. We describe and provide an initial experimental assessment of an
implementation of a work stealing-based approach to distributed CSP solving.
