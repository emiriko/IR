The distribution of a gluon condensate in a flux tube is calculated. The
result is that the chromoelectric fields are confined with a surrounding coset
chromomagnetic field. Such picture presents the concrete realization of dual
QCD model in a scalar model of the flux tube. In the scalar model the SU(3)
gauge fields are separated on two parts: (1) is the $SU(2) \subset SU(3)$
subgroup, (2) is the coset $SU(3) / SU(2)$. The SU(2) degrees of freedom are
almost classical and the coset degrees of freedom are quantum ones. A
nonperturbative approach for the quantization of the coset degrees of freedom
is applied. In this approach 2-point Green's function is a bilinear combination
of scalar fields and 4-point Green's function is the product of 2-points
Green's functions. The gluon condensate is an effective Lagrangian describing
the SU(2) gauge field with broken gauge symmetry and coupling with the scalar
field. Corresponding field equations give us the flux tube.
