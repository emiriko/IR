The mass function and statistics of binaries provide important diagnostics of
the star formation process. Despite this importance, the mass function at low
masses remains poorly known due to observational difficulties caused by the
faintness of the objects. Here we report the microlensing discovery and
characterization of a binary lens composed of very low-mass stars just above
the hydrogen-burning limit. From the combined measurements of the Einstein
radius and microlens parallax, we measure the masses of the binary components
of $0.10\pm 0.01\ M_\odot$ and $0.09\pm 0.01\ M_\odot$. This discovery
demonstrates that microlensing will provide a method to measure the mass
function of all Galactic populations of very low mass binaries that is
independent of the biases caused by the luminosity of the population.
