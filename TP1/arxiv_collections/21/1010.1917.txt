We consider the problem of a rotating charged spherical shell of radius a
carrying an axially symmetric distribution of charge. We give the interior and
exterior solutions to this problem for arbitrary zonal dependence of the
surface charge distribution and for arbitrary time dependence of the rotation
rate. Surprisingly, these general solutions involve the rotation rate and its
time integrals, and do not depend on the time derivatives of the rotation rate.
We present numerical solutions for various distributions of surface charge, and
we consider the case where the sphere instantaneously goes from rest to
rotating at a constant rate. For a time 2a/c after this instantaneously
spin-up, the sphere radiates even though it is rotating at a constant rate. In
this time interval, the sphere radiates away an amount of energy exactly equal
to the magnetic energy stored in the static fields a long time after the sphere
has been spun up. Animations of our solutions can be found at
