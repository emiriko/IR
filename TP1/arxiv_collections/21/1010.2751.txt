We use high spatial resolution (~7pc) CARMA observations to derive detailed
properties for 8 giant molecular clouds (GMCs) at a galactocentric radius
corresponding to approximately two CO scale lengths, or ~0.5 optical radii
(r25), in the Local Group spiral galaxy M33. At this radius, molecular gas
fraction, dust-to-gas ratio and metallicity are much lower than in the inner
part of M33 or in a typical spiral galaxy. This allows us to probe the impact
of environment on GMC properties by comparing our measurements to previous data
from the inner disk of M33, the Milky Way and other nearby galaxies. The outer
disk clouds roughly fall on the size-linewidth relation defined by
extragalactic GMCs, but are slightly displaced from the luminosity-virial mass
relation in the sense of having high CO luminosity compared to the inferred
virial mass. This implies a different CO-to-H2 conversion factor, which is on
average a factor of two lower than the inner disk and the extragalactic
average. We attribute this to significantly higher measured brightness
temperatures of the outer disk clouds compared to the ancillary sample of GMCs,
which is likely an effect of enhanced radiation levels due to massive star
formation in the vicinity of our target field. Apart from brightness
temperature, the properties we determine for the outer disk GMCs in M33 do not
differ significantly from those of our comparison sample. In particular, the
combined sample of inner and outer disk M33 clouds covers roughly the same
range in size, linewidth, virial mass and CO luminosity than the sample of
Milky Way GMCs. When compared to the inner disk clouds in M33, however, we find
even the brightest outer disk clouds to be smaller than most of their inner
disk counterparts. This may be due to incomplete sampling or a potentially
steeper cloud mass function at larger radii.
