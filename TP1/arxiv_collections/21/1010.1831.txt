We consider the Dirac equation in 1+1 space-time dimension with vector,
scalar and pseudo-scalar coupling. In the traditional spin (or pseudo-spin)
symmetry, the difference between (or sum of) the scalar and vector potentials
is a constant. Here, however, we introduce an alternative symmetry where the
scalar or pseudo-scalar potential is proportional to the vector potential. This
leads to a model with significant extensions to supersymmetric quantum
mechanics. We present a formal solution of the problem but give explicit
analytic results for specific examples.
