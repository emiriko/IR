Theoretical study on H$_2^+$ in an intense infrared laser field on the
attosecond time-scale reveals that the molecular ion shows multiple bursts of
ionization within a half-cycle of the laser field oscillation, in contrast to
the widely accepted tunnel ionization picture for an atom. These bursts are
found to be induced by transient localization of the electron at one of the
nuclei, and a relation between the time instants of the localization and the
vector potential of the laser light is derived. Furthermore, an experimental
scheme is proposed to probe the localization dynamics by an extreme ultraviolet
laser pulse.
