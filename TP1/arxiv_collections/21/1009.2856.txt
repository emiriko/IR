At the mesoscale friction occurs through the breaking and formation of local
contacts. This is often described by the earthquake-like model which requires
numerical studies. We show that this phenomenon can also be described by a
master equation, which can be solved analytically in some cases and provides an
efficient numerical solution for more general cases. We examine the effect of
temperature and aging of the contacts and discuss the statistical properties of
the contacts for different situations of friction and their implications,
particularly regarding the existence of stick-slip.
