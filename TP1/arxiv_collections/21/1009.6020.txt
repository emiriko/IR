Neutral outflows have been detected in many ultraluminous infrared galaxies
(ULIRGs) via the Na I D $\lambda\lambda 5890, 5896$ absorption-line doublet.
For the first time, we have mapped and analyzed the 2-D kinematics of a cool
neutral outflow in a ULIRG, F10565+2448, using the integral field unit (IFU) on
Gemini North to observe the Na I D feature. At the same time we have mapped the
ionized outflow with the [NII] and H$\alpha$ emission lines. We find a systemic
rotation curve that is consistent with the rotation of the molecular disk
determined from previous CO observations. The absorption lines show evidence of
a nuclear outflow with a radial extent of at least 3 kpc, consistent with
previous observations. The strength of the Na I D lines have a strong,
spatially resolved correlation with reddening, suggesting that dust is present
in the outflow. Surprisingly, the outflow velocities of the neutral gas show a
strong asymmetry in the form of a major-axis gradient that is opposite in sign
to disk rotation. This is inconsistent with entrained material rotating along
with the galaxy or with a tilted minor-axis outflow. We hypothesize that this
unusual behavior is due to an asymmetry in the distribution of the ambient gas.
We also see evidence of asymmetric ionized outflow in the emission-line
velocity map, which appear to be decoupled from the neutral outflow. Our
results strengthen the hypothesis that ULIRG outflows differ in morphology from
those in more quiescent disk galaxies.
