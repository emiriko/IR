Using ATLAS data corresponding to 70 +- 8 nb^-1 of integrated luminosity from
the 7 TeV proton-proton collisions at the LHC, distributions of relevant
supersymmetry-sensitive variables are shown for the final state containing
jets, missing transverse momentum and one isolated electron or muon. With
increased integrated luminosities, selections based on these distributions will
be used in the search for supersymmetric particles: it is thus important to
show that the Standard Model backgrounds to these searches are under good
control.
