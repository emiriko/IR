We present an ultra-deep survey for Neptune Trojans using the Subaru 8.2-m
and Magellan 6.5-m telescopes. The survey reached a 50% detection efficiency in
the R-band at 25.7 magnitudes and covered 49 square degrees of sky. This depth
corresponds to Neptune Trojans that are about 16 km in radius (assuming an
albedo of 0.05). A paucity of smaller Neptune Trojans (radii < 45 km) compared
to larger ones was found. The brightest Neptune Trojans appear to follow a
steep power-law slope (q = 5+-1) similar to the brightest objects in the other
known stable reservoirs such as the Kuiper Belt, Jupiter Trojans and main belt
asteroids. We find a roll-over for the Neptune Trojans that occurs around a
radii of r=45+-10 km (23.5+-0.3 mags), which is also very similar to the other
stable reservoirs. All the observed stable regions in the the solar system show
evidence for Missing Intermediate Sized Planetesimals (MISPs). This indicates a
primordial and not collisional origin, which suggests planetesimal formation
proceeded directly from small to large objects. The scarcity of intermediate
and smaller sized Neptune Trojans may limit them as being a strong source for
the short period comets.
