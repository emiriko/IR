Density functional theory (DFT) became a universal approach to compute
ground-state and excited configurations of many-electron systems held together
by an external one-body potential in condensed-matter, atomic, and molecular
physics. At present, the DFT strategy is also intensely studied and applied in
the area of nuclear structure. The nuclear DFT, a natural extension of the
self-consistent mean-field theory, is a tool of choice for computations of
ground-state properties and low-lying excitations of medium-mass and heavy
nuclei. Over the past thirty-odd years, a lot of experience was accumulated in
implementing, adjusting, and using the density-functional methods in nuclei.
This research direction is still extremely actively pursued. In particular,
current developments concentrate on (i) attempts to improve the performance and
precision delivered by the nuclear density-functional methods, (ii) derivations
of density functionals from first principles rooted in the low-energy
chromodynamics and effective theories, and (iii) including effects of
low-energy correlations and symmetry restoration. In this study, we present an
overview of recent results and achievements gained in nuclear
density-functional methods.
