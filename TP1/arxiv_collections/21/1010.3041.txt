Using the solutions of the gap equations of the magnetic-color-flavor-locked
(MCFL) phase of paired quark matter in a magnetic field, and taking into
consideration the separation between the longitudinal and transverse pressures
due to the field-induced breaking of the spatial rotational symmetry, the
equation of state (EoS) of the MCFL phase is self-consistently determined. This
result is then used to investigate the possibility of absolute stability, which
turns out to require a field-dependent bag constant to hold. That is, only if
the bag constant varies with the magnetic field, there exists a window in the
magnetic field vs. bag constant plane for absolute stability of strange matter.
Implications for stellar models of magnetized (self-bound) strange stars and
hybrid (MCFL core) stars are calculated and discussed.
