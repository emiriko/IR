We study the quantum anomalous Hall states in the $p$-orbital bands of the
honeycomb optical lattices loaded with the single component fermions. Such an
effect has not been realized in both condensed matter and cold atom systems
yet. By applying the available experimental technique developed by Gemelke
\textit{et al.} to rotate each lattice site around its own center, the band
structures become topologically non-trivial. At a certain rotation angular
velocity $\Omega$, a flat band structure appears with localized eigenstates
carrying chiral current moments. With imposing the soft confining potential,
the density profile exhibits a wedding-cake shaped distribution with insulating
plateaus at commensurate fillings. Moreover, the inhomogeneous confining
potential induces dissipationless circulation currents whose magnitudes and
chiralities vary with the distance from the trap center. In the insulating
regions the Hall conductances are quantized, and in the metallic regions the
directions and magnitudes of chiral currents cannot be described by the usual
local-density-approximation. The quantum anomalous Hall effects are robust at
temperature scales small compared to band gaps, which increases the feasibility
of experimental realizations.
