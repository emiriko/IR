In this Letter we demonstrate that Permalloy (Py), a widely used Ni/Fe alloy,
forms contacts to carbon nanotubes (CNTs) that meet the requirements for the
injection and detection of spin-polarized currents in carbon-based spintronic
devices. We establish the material quality and magnetization properties of Py
strips in the shape of suitable electrical contacts and find a sharp
magnetization switching tunable by geometry in the anisotropic
magnetoresistance (AMR) of a single strip at cryogenic temperatures. In
addition, we show that Py contacts couple strongly to CNTs, comparable to Pd
contacts, thereby forming CNT quantum dots at low temperatures. These results
form the basis for a Py-based CNT spin-valve exhibiting very sharp resistance
switchings in the tunneling magnetoresistance, which directly correspond to the
magnetization reversals in the individual contacts observed in AMR experiments.
