It has been shown that, in the context of the MSSM, the Supersymmetric
Flavour Problem cannot be solved by just letting the sfermions of the first two
generations be relatively heavy. The reason is twofold: naturalness of the
Fermi scale on one side, need for positive squared stop masses on the other.
The situation is much more promising in models without a light Higgs boson, in
which the goal can be met. The prices are: a relatively low messenger scale,
semiperturbativity before the GUT scale, and some amount of
degeneracy/alignement of order of the Cabibbo angle in the sfermion sector. A
crucial role is played by the increased quartic coupling. The resulting
phenomenology is quite different from the MSSM one in many respects.
