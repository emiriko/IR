A search for narrow resonances in the dijet mass spectrum is performed using
data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.9 inverse pb collected by
the CMS experiment at the LHC. Upper limits at the 95% confidence level (CL)
are presented on the product of the resonance cross section, branching fraction
into dijets, and acceptance, separately for decays into quark-quark,
quark-gluon, or gluon-gluon pairs. The data exclude new particles predicted in
the following models at the 95% CL: string resonances, with mass less than 2.50
TeV, excited quarks, with mass less than 1.58 TeV, and axigluons, colorons, and
E_6 diquarks, in specific mass intervals. This extends previously published
limits on these models.
