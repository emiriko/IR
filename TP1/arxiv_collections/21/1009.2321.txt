It is well known that there are only two low-frequency-peaked BL Lac objects
(LBLs: BL Lacertae and S5 0716+714) and one flat spectrum radio quasar (FSRQ:
3C 279) among more than 30 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with detected TeV
emissions. We study the spectral energy distribution (SED) of a famous LBL OJ
287, whose light curve has a 12-y period. Using a homogeneous one-zone
synchrotron + synchrotron-self Compton model, we model the quasi-simultaneous
broad-band SED of OJ 287. With some reasonable assumptions, we extrapolate the
model to the high state of OJ 287 and predict its {\gamma}-ray emissions.
Taking into account the absorption of {\gamma}-ray by the extragalactic
background light (EBL), we find that the TeV emission of OJ 287 in high state
is slightly higher than the sensitivity of H.E.S.S. The study on SEDs of OJ 287
has implications to unveil the origin of jet activity during its 12-y period
and the properties of EBL.
