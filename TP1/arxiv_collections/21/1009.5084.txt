Purpose of the present paper is to view the correspondence between Ricci and
other dark energies. We have considered the Ricci dark energy in presence of
dark matter in non-interacting situation. Subsequently, we have derived the
pressure and energy density for Ricci dark energy. The equation of state
parameter has been generated from these pressure and energy density. Next, we
have considered the correspondence between Ricci and other dark energy models,
namely tachyonic field, DBI-essence and new agegraphic dark energy without any
interaction and investigated possible cosmological consequences.
