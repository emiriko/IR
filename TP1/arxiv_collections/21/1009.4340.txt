We consider the thermal and non-thermal emission from the inner 200 pc of the
Galaxy. The radiation from this almost star-burst-like region is ultimately
driven dominantly by on-going massive star formation. We show that this
region's radio continuum (RC) emission is in relative deficit with respect to
the expectation afforded by the Far- infrared-Radio Continuum Correlation
(FRC). Likewise we show that the region's gamma-ray emission falls short of
that expected given its star formation and resultant supernova rates. These
facts are compellingly explained by positing that a powerful (400-1200 km/s)
wind is launched from the region. This wind probably plays a number of
important roles including advecting positrons into the Galactic bulge thus
explaining the observed ~kpc extension of the 511 keV positron annihilation
signal around the GC. We also show that the large-scale GC magnetic field falls
in the range ~100-300 microG and that - in the time they remain in the region -
GC cosmic rays do not penetrate into the region's densest molecular material.
