Extending a Pade approximant method used for studying compactons in the
Rosenau-Hyman (RH) equation, we study the numerical stability of single
compactons of the Cooper-Shepard-Sodano (CSS) equation and their pairwise
interactions. The CSS equation has a conserved Hamiltonian which has allowed
various approaches for studying analytically the nonlinear stability of the
solutions. We study three different compacton solutions and find they are
numerically stable. Similar to the collisions between RH compactons, the CSS
compactons reemerge with same coherent shape when scattered. The time evolution
of the small-amplitude ripple resulting after scattering depends on the values
of the parameters $l$ and $p$ characterizing the corresponding CSS equation.
The simulation of the CSS compacton scattering requires a much smaller
artificial viscosity to obtain numerical stability, than in the case of RH
compactons propagation.
