We propose to couple a trapped single electron to superconducting structures
located at a variable distance from the electron. The electron is captured in a
cryogenic Penning trap using electric fields and a static magnetic field in the
Tesla range. Measurements on the electron will allow investigating the
properties of the superconductor such as vortex structure, damping and
decoherence. We propose to couple a superconducting microwave resonator to the
electron in order to realize a circuit QED-like experiment, as well as to
couple superconducting Josephson junctions or superconducting quantum
interferometers (SQUIDs) to the electron. The electron may also be coupled to a
vortex which is situated in a double well potential, realized by nearby pinning
centers in the superconductor, acting as a quantum mechanical two level system
that can be controlled by a transport current tilting the double well
potential. When the vortex is trapped in the interferometer arms of a SQUID,
this would allow its detection both by the SQUID and by the electron.
