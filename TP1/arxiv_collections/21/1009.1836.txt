A wide class of Higgs sectors is investigated in supersymmetric standard
models. When the lightest Higgs boson (h) looks the standard model one, the
mass (m_h) and the triple Higgs boson coupling (the hhh coupling) are evaluated
at the one-loop level in each model. While m_h is at most 120-130 GeV in the
minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM), that in models with an additional
neutral singlet or triplet fields can be much larger. The hhh coupling can also
be sensitive to the models: while in the MSSM the deviation from the standard
model prediction is not significant, that can be 30-60 % in some models such as
the MSSM with the additional singlet or with extra doublets and charged
singlets. These models are motivated by specific physics problems like the
mu-problem, the neutrino mass, the scalar dark matter and so on. Therefore,
when h is found at the CERN Large Hadron Collider, we can classify
supersymmetric models by measuring m_h and the hhh coupling accurately at
future collider experiments.
