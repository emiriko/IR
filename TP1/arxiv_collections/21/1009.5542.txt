Superconducting wires without time-reversal and spin-rotation symmetries can
be driven into a topological phase that supports Majorana bound states. Direct
detection of these zero-energy states is complicated by the proliferation of
low-lying excitations in a disordered multi-mode wire. We show that the phase
transition itself is signaled by a quantized thermal conductance and electrical
shot noise power, irrespective of the degree of disorder. In a ring geometry,
the phase transition is signaled by a period doubling of the magnetoconductance
oscillations. These signatures directly follow from the identification of the
sign of the determinant of the reflection matrix as a topological quantum
number.
