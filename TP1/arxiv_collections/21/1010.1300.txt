The Magellan Adaptive Secondary AO system, scheduled for first light in the
fall of 2011, will be able to simultaneously perform diffraction limited AO
science in both the mid-IR, using the BLINC/MIRAC4 10\{mu}m camera, and in the
visible using our novel VisAO camera. The VisAO camera will be able to operate
as either an imager, using a CCD47 with 8.5 mas pixels, or as an IFS, using a
custom fiber array at the focal plane with 20 mas elements in its highest
resolution mode. In imaging mode, the VisAO camera will have a full suite of
filters, coronagraphic focal plane occulting spots, and SDI prism/filters. The
imaging mode should provide ~20% mean Strehl diffraction-limited images over
the band 0.5-1.0 \{mu}m. In IFS mode, the VisAO instrument will provide R~1,800
spectra over the band 0.6-1.05 \{mu}m. Our unprecedented 20 mas spatially
resolved visible spectra would be the highest spatial resolution achieved to
date, either from the ground or in space. We also present lab results from our
recently fabricated advanced triplet Atmospheric Dispersion Corrector (ADC) and
the design of our novel wide-field acquisition and active optics lens. The
advanced ADC is designed to perform 58% better than conventional doublet ADCs
and is one of the enabling technologies that will allow us to achieve broadband
(0.5-1.0\{mu}m) diffraction limited imaging and wavefront sensing in the
visible.
