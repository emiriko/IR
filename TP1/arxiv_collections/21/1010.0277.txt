The planet GJ 1214b is the second known super-Earth with a measured mass and
radius. Orbiting a quiet M-star, it receives considerably less mass-loss
driving X-ray and UV radiation than CoRoT-7b, so that the interior may be quite
dissimilar in composition, including the possibility of a large fraction of
water. We model the interior of GJ 1214b assuming a two-layer (envelope+rock
core) structure where the envelope material is either H/He, pure water, or a
mixture of H/He and H2O. Within this framework we perform models of the thermal
evolution and contraction of the planet. We discuss possible compositions that
are consistent with Mp=6.55 ME, Rp=2.678 RE, an age tau=3-10 Gyr, and the
irradiation level of the atmosphere. These conditions require that if water
exists in the interior, it must remain in a fluid state, with important
consequences for magnetic field generation. These conditions also require the
atmosphere to have a deep isothermal region extending down to 80-800 bar,
depending on composition. Our results bolster the suggestion of a
metal-enriched H/He atmosphere for the planet, as we find water-world models
that lack an H/He atmosphere to require an implausibly large water-to-rock
ratio of more than 6:1. We instead favor a H/He/H2O envelope with high water
mass fraction (~0.5-0.85), similar to recent models of the deep envelope of
Uranus and Neptune. Even with these high water mass fractions in the H/He
envelope, generally the bulk composition of the planet can have subsolar
water:rock ratios. Dry, water-enriched, and pure water envelope models differ
to an observationally significant level in their tidal Love numbers k2 of
respectively ~0.018, 0.15, and 0.7.
