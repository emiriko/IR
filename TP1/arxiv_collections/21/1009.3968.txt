Maxwell's equations are formulated in arbitrary moving frames by means of
tetrad fields, which are interpreted as reference frames adapted to observers
in space-time. We assume the existence of a general distribution of charges and
currents in an inertial frame. Tetrad fields are used to project the
electromagnetic fields and sources on accelerated frames. The purpose is to
study several configurations of fields and observers that in the literature are
understood as paradoxes. For instance, are the two situations, (i) an
accelerated charge in an inertial frame, and (ii) a charge at rest in an
inertial frame described from the perspective of an accelerated frame,
physically equivalent? Is the electromagnetic radiation the same in both
frames? Normally in the analysis of these paradoxes the electromagnetic fields
are transformed to (uniformly) accelerated frames by means of a coordinate
transformation of the Faraday tensor. In the present approach coordinate and
frame transformations are disentangled, and the electromagnetic field in the
accelerated frame is obtained through a frame (local Lorentz) transformation.
Consequently the fields in the inertial and accelerated frames are described in
the same coordinate system. This feature allows the investigation of paradoxes
such as the one mentioned above.
