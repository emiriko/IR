We prove approach to thermal equilibrium for the fully Hamiltonian dynamics
of a dynamical Lorentz gas, by which we mean an ensemble of particles moving
through a $d$-dimensional array of fixed soft scatterers that each possess an
internal harmonic or anharmonic degree of freedom to which moving particles
locally couple. We establish that the momentum distribution of the moving
particles approaches a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution at a certain temperature
$T$, provided that they are initially fast and the scatterers are in a
sufficiently energetic but otherwise arbitrary stationary state of their free
dynamics--they need not be in a state of thermal equilibrium. The temperature
$T$ to which the particles equilibrate obeys a generalized equipartition
relation, in which the associated thermal energy $k_{\mathrm B}T$ is equal to
an appropriately defined average of the scatterers' kinetic energy. In the
equilibrated state, particle motion is diffusive.
