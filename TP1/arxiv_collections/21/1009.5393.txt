Dimerized antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 ladders are known to exhibit a quantum
critical phase transition in the ground state, the existence or absence of
which is dependent on the dimerization pattern of the ladder. The gapped phases
cannot be distinguished by the conventional Landau long-range order parameter.
However, they possess a non-local (hidden) string order parameter, which is
non-zero in one phase and vanishes in the other. We use an exact
diagonalization technique to calculate ground state energies, energy gaps and
string order parameters of dimerized two- and three-leg Heisenberg ladders, as
well as a critical scaling analysis to yield estimates of the critical
exponents nu and beta.
