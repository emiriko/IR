Metamaterials are being used to model various exotic "optical spaces" for
such applications as novel lenses and cloaking. While most effort is directed
towards engineering of continuously changing dielectric permittivity and
magnetic permeability tensors, an alternative approach may be based on lattices
of metamaterial waveguides. Here we demonstrate the power of the latter
technique by presenting metamaterial lattice models of various 4D spaces.
