One prediction of particle acceleration in the supernova remnants in the
magnetic wind of exploding Wolf Rayet and Red Super Giant stars is that the
final spectrum is a composition of a spectrum $E^{-7/3}$ and a polar cap
component of $E^{-2}$ at the source. This polar cap component contributes to
the total energy content with only a few percent, but dominates the spectrum at
higher energy. The sum of both components gives spectra which curve upwards.
The upturn was predicted to occur always at the same rigidity. An additional
component of cosmic rays from acceleration by supernovae exploding into the
Inter-Stellar Medium (ISM) adds another component for Hydrogen and for Helium.
After transport the predicted spectra $J(E)$ for the wind-SN cosmic rays are
$E^{-8/3}$ and $E^{-7/3}$; the sum leads to an upturn from the steeper
spectrum. An upturn has now been seen. Here, we test the observations against
the predictions, and show that the observed properties are consistent with the
predictions. Hydrogen can be shown to also have a noticeable wind-SN-component.
The observation of the upturn in the heavy element spectra being compatible
with the same rigidity for all heavy elements supports the magneto-rotational
mechanism for these supernovae. This interpretation predicts the observed
upturn to continue to curve upwards and approach the $E^{-7/3}$ spectrum. If
confirmed, this would strengthen the case that supernovae of very massive stars
with magnetic winds are important sources of Galactic cosmic rays.
