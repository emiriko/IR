In the bottom-up approach to AdS/QCD based on a five-dimensional gravity
dilaton action the exponential of the dilaton field is usually identified as
the strong or 't Hooft coupling. There is currently no model known which fits
the measurements of the running coupling and lattice results for pressure at
the same time. With a one parametric toy model we demonstrate the effect of
fitting the pressure on the coupling and vice versa.
