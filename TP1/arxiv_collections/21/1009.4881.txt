We study the decay of dynamically generated resonances from the interaction
of two vectors into a $\gamma$ and a pseudoscalar meson. The dynamics requires
anomalous terms involving vertices with two vectors and a pseudoscalar, which
renders it special. We compare our result with data on $K^{*+}(1430)\to
K^+\gamma$ and $K^{*0}(1430)\to K^0\gamma$ and find a good agreement with the
data for the $K^{*+}(1430)$ case and a width considerably smaller than the
upper bound measured for the $K^{*0}(1430)$ meson.
