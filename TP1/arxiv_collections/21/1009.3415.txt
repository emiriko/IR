It is well known that links in CSMA wireless networks are prone to
starvation. Prior works focused almost exclusively on equilibrium starvation.
In this paper, we show that links in CSMA wireless networks are also
susceptible to temporal starvation. Specifically, although some links have good
equilibrium throughputs and do not suffer from equilibrium starvation, they can
still have no throughput for extended periods from time to time. Given its
impact on quality of service, it is important to understand and characterize
temporal starvation. To this end, we develop a "trap theory" to analyze
temporal throughput fluctuation. The trap theory serves two functions. First,
it allows us to derive new mathematical results that shed light on the
transient behavior of CSMA networks. For example, we show that the duration of
a trap, during which some links receive no throughput, is insensitive to the
distributions of the backoff countdown and transmission time (packet duration)
in the CSMA protocol. Second, we can develop analytical tools for computing the
"degrees of starvation" for CSMA networks to aid network design. For example,
given a CSMA network, we can determine whether it suffers from starvation, and
if so, which links will starve. Furthermore, the likelihood and durations of
temporal starvation can also be computed. We believe that the ability to
identify and characterize temporal starvation as established in this paper will
serve as an important first step toward the design of effective remedies for
it.
