We report on the recent developments of a new effective field theory for
nuclear matter [1,2,3]. We present first the nuclear matter chiral power
counting that takes into account both short-- and long--range inter-nucleon
interactions. It also identifies non-perturbative strings of diagrams, related
to the iteration of nucleon-nucleon interactions, which have to be re-summed.
The methods of unitary chiral perturbation theory has been shown to be a useful
tool in order to perform those resummations. Results up to next-to-leading
order for the ground state energy per particle of nuclear matter, the in-medium
chiral quark condensate and pion self-energy are discussed.
