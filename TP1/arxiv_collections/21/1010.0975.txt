We demonstrate a remote sensing design of phase qubits by separating the
control and readout circuits from the qubit loop. This design improves
measurement reliability because the control readout chip can be fabricated
using more robust materials and can be reused to test different qubit chips.
Typical qubit measurements such as Rabi oscillations, spectroscopy, and
excited-state energy relaxation are presented.
