Almost all known secret sharing schemes work on numbers. Such methods will
have difficulty in sharing graphs since the number of graphs increases
exponentially with the number of nodes. We propose a secret sharing scheme for
graphs where we use graph intersection for reconstructing the secret which is
hidden as a sub graph in the shares. Our method does not rely on heavy
computational operations such as modular arithmetic or polynomial interpolation
but makes use of very basic operations like assignment and checking for
equality, and graph intersection can also be performed visually. In certain
cases, the secret could be reconstructed using just pencil and paper by
authorised parties but cannot be broken by an adversary even with unbounded
computational power. The method achieves perfect secrecy for (2, n) scheme and
requires far fewer operations compared to Shamir's algorithm. The proposed
method could be used to share objects such as matrices, sets, plain text and
even a heterogeneous collection of these. Since we do not require a previously
agreed upon encoding scheme, the method is very suitable for sharing
heterogeneous collection of objects in a dynamic fashion.
