We investigate the emergence of a large-scale magnetic field. This field is
dynamo-generated by turbulence driven with a helical forcing function. Twisted
arcade-like field structures are found to emerge in the exterior above the
turbulence zone. Time series of the magnetic field structure show recurrent
plasmoid ejections.
