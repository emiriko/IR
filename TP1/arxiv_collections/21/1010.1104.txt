The three dimensional Gribov-Zwanziger Lagrangian is analysed at one and two
loops. Specifically, the two loop gap equation is evaluated and the Gribov mass
is expressed in terms of the coupling constant. The one loop corrections to the
propagators of all the fields are determined. It is shown that when the gap
equation is satisfied the Faddeev-Popov ghost and both Bose and Grassmann
localizing ghosts all enhance in the infrared limit at one loop. This verifies
that the Kugo-Ojima confinement criterion holds to this order and we also show
that both Grassmann ghosts are enhanced at two loops. For the Bose ghost we
determine the full form of the propagator in the zero momentum limit for both
the transverse and longitudinal pieces and confirm Zwanziger's recent general
analysis for the low energy behaviour. We provide an alternative but equivalent
version of the horizon condition expressing it as the vacuum expectation value
of an operator involving only the localizing Bose ghost field. The one loop
static potential is also determined.
