The purpose of this work is to calculate the vibrational modes of an
elastically anisotropic sphere embedded in an isotropic matrix. This has
important application to understanding the spectra of low-frequency Raman
scattering from nanoparticles embedded in a glass matrix. First some low
frequency vibrational modes of a free cubically elastic sphere are found to be
nearly independent of one combination of elastic constants. This is then
exploited to obtain an isotropic approximation for these modes which enables to
take into account the surrounding isotropic matrix. This method is then used to
quantatively explain recent spectra of gold and copper nanocrystals in glasses.
