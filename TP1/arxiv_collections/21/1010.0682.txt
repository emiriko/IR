I begin with a review of quantum impurity models in condensed matter physics,
in which a localized spin degree of freedom is coupled to an interacting
conformal field theory in d = 2 spatial dimensions. Their properties are
similar to those of supersymmetric generalizations which can be solved by the
AdS/CFT correspondence; the low energy limit of the latter models is described
by a AdS2 geometry. Then I turn to Kondo lattice models, which can be described
by a mean- field theory obtained by a mapping to a quantum impurity coupled to
a self-consistent environment. Such a theory yields a 'fractionalized Fermi
liquid' phase of conduction electrons coupled to a critical spin liquid state,
and is an attractive mean-field theory of strange metals. The recent
holographic description of strange metals with a AdS2 x R2 geometry is argued
to be related to such mean-field solutions of Kondo lattice models.
