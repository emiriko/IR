We study the kinematic properties of dense gas surrounding massive protostars
recognized by Bontemps et a. (2010) in a sample of five Massive Dense Cores in
Cygnus-X. We investigate whether turbulent support plays a major role in
stabilizing the core against fragmentation into Jeans-mass objects or
alternatively, the observed kinematics could indicate a high level of dynamics.
We present IRAM 30m single-dish (HCO+ and H13CO+) and IRAM PdBI high
angular-resolution observations of dense gas tracers (H13CO+ and H13CN) to
reveal the kinematics of molecular gas at scales from 0.03 to 0.1 pc. Radiative
transfer modeling shows that H13CO+ is depleted within the envelopes of massive
protostars and traces the bulk of material surrounding the protostars rather
than their inner envelopes. H13CN shows a better correspondence with the peak
of the continuum emission, possibly due to abundance anomalies and specific
chemistry in the close vicinity of massive protostars. Analyzing the
line-widths we show that the observed line-dispersion of H13CO+ at the scale of
MDCs is smaller than expected from the quasi-static, turbulent-core model. At
large-scales, global organized bulk motions are identified for 3 of the MDCs.
At small-scales, several spectral components are identified in all MDCs showing
filamentary structures and intrinsic velocity gradients towards the continuum
peaks. The dynamics of these flows show diversity among the sample and we link
this to the specific fragmentation properties of the MDCs. No clear evidence is
found for a turbulence regulated, equilibrium scenario within the sample of
MDCs. We propose a picture in which MDCs are not in equilibrium and their
dynamics is governed by small-scale converging flows, which may initiate
star-formation via their shears.
