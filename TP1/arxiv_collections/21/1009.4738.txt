A protocol employing weak values (WVs) to obtain ultra sensitive
amplification of weak signals in the context of a solid state setup is
proposed. We consider an Aharonov-Bohm interferometer where both the orbital
and the spin degrees of freedom are weakly affected by the presence of an
external charge to be detected. The interplay between the spin and the orbital
WVs leads to a significant amplification even in the presence of finite
temperature, voltage, and external noise.
