We investigate the performance of a hybrid plasma solver on the test problem
of an ion beam. The parallel solver is based on cell centered finite
differences in space, and a predictor-corrector leapfrog scheme in time. The
implementation is done in the FLASH software framework. It is shown that the
solver conserves energy well over time, and that the parallelization is
efficient (it exhibits weak scaling).
