LHCb is an experiment dedicated to study CP violation and other rare
phenomena in B mesons decays with very high precision. It is one of the four
experiments that will operate at the 14Tev proton-proton Large Hadron Collider
(LHC) at CERN in 2008. Here we briefly describe the current status of the
experiment, as well as plans towards a future upgrade.
