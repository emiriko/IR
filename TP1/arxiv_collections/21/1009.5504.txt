We study deviations from tri-bimaximality (TBM) and quark-lepton
complementarity (QLC) in a model independent way. The current neutrino
experimental data is well approximated by tri-bimaximal generation mixing but
the QLC relations are not satisfied with each data of 1$\sigma$ level. This
means that there exist deviations from the complementarity. The same fact for
the TBM might be checked in the future neutrino experiments. We discuss such
deviations from the TBM and QLC, simultaneously. A new ratio between the
deviations is introduced, and some interesting points are presented. We also
show predicted correlations among leptonic mixing angles at the points.
