We present Keck high-quality rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) through optical
spectra of 21 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) in the redshift range 0.11 < z < 0.37
and a mean redshift of 0.22 that were discovered during the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey-II (SDSS-II) SN Survey. Using the broad-band photometry of the SDSS
survey, we are able to reconstruct the SN host-galaxy spectral energy
distributions (SEDs), allowing for a correction for the host-galaxy
contamination in the SN Ia spectra. Comparison of composite spectra constructed
from a subsample of 17 high-quality spectra to those created from a
low-redshift sample with otherwise similar properties shows that the Keck/SDSS
SNe Ia have, on average, extremely similar rest-frame optical spectra but show
a UV flux excess. This observation is confirmed by comparing synthesized
broad-band colors of the individual spectra, showing a difference in mean
colors at the 2.4 - 4.4 sigma level for various UV colors. We further see a
slight difference in the UV spectral shape between SNe with low-mass and
high-mass host galaxies. Additionally, we detect a relationship between the
flux ratio at 2770 and 2900 A and peak luminosity that differs from that
observed at low redshift. We find that changing the UV SED of an SN Ia within
the observed dispersion can change the inferred distance moduli by ~0.1 mag.
This effect only occurs when the data probe the rest-frame UV. We suggest that
this discrepancy could be due to differences in the host-galaxy population of
the two SN samples or to small-sample statistics.
