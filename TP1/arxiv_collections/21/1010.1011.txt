We study the production and decay of fourth generation leptons at the Large
Hadron Collider (LHC).We find that for charged leptons with masses under a few
hundred GeV, the dominant collider signal comes from the production through a
W-boson of a charged and neutral fourth generation lepton. We present a
sensitivity study for this process in events with two like-sign charged leptons
and at least two associated jets. We show that with sqrts = 7 TeV and 1 inverse
fb of data, the LHC can exclude fourth generation charged leptons with masses
up to 250 GeV.
