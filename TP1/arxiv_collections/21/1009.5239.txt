We construct an effective model for the QCD equation of state, taking into
account chiral symmetry restoration as well as the deconfinement phase
transition. The correct asymptotic degrees of freedom at the high and low
temperature limits are included (quarks $\leftrightarrow$ hadrons). The model
shows a rapid crossover for both order parameters, as is expected from lattice
calculations. We then compare the thermodynamic properties of the model at
$\mu_B=0$ which turn out to be in qualitative agreement with lattice data,
while apparent quantitative differences can be attributed to hadronic
contributions and excluded volume corrections. Furthermore we discuss the
effects of a repulsive vector type quark interaction at finite baryon number
densities on the resulting phase diagram of the model. Our current model is
able to reproduce a first-order liquid gas phase transition as expected, but
does not show any signs of a first order deconfinement or chiral phase
transition. Both transitions rather appear as a very wide crossover in which
heavily medium modified hadron coexist with free quarks.
