As an alternative to either directly assimilating radiances or the naive use
of retrieved profiles (of temperature, humidity, aerosols, and chemical
species), a strategy is described that makes use of the so-called averaging
kernel (AK) and other information from the retrieval process. This AK approach
has the potential to improve the use of remotely sensed observations of the
atmosphere. First, we show how to use the AK and the retrieval noise covariance
to transform the retrieved quantities into observations that are unbiased and
have uncorrelated errors, and to eliminate both the smoothing inherent in the
retrieval process and the effect of the prior. Since the effect of the prior is
removed, any prior, including the forecast from the data assimilation cycle can
be used. Then we show how to transform this result into EOF space, when a
truncated EOF series has been used in the retrieval process. This provides a
degree of data compression and eliminates those transformed variables that have
very small information content. In both approaches a vertical interpolation
from the dynamical model coordinate to the radiative transfer coordinate is
required. We define an algorithm using the EOF representation to optimize this
vertical interpolation
