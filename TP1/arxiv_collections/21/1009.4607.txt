A few simple if not obvious statements at the end of the conference: This was
an useful conference. It has shown us the rapidly widening scope of the binary
star research which now extends in its applications from the realm of planets
to black holes and binary galactic nuclei. The binary star domain appears to be
-- in parallel to searched for extra-solar planets and star formation -- the
most active areas of stellar astrophysics. I am glad I attended this
conference.
