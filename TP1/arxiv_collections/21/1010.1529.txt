The origin of highly-magnetized white dwarfs has remained a mystery since
their initial discovery. Recent observations indicate that the formation of
high-field magnetic white dwarfs is intimately related to strong binary
interactions during post-main-sequence phases of stellar evolution. If a
low-mass companion, such as a planet, brown dwarf, or low-mass star is engulfed
by a post-main-sequence giant, the hydrodynamic drag in the envelope of the
giant leads to a reduction of the companion's orbit. Sufficiently low-mass
companions in-spiral until they are shredded by the strong gravitational tides
near the white dwarf core. Subsequent formation of a super-Eddington accretion
disk from the disrupted companion inside a common envelope can dramatically
amplify magnetic fields via a dynamo. Here, we show that these disk-generated
fields are sufficiently strong to explain the observed range of magnetic field
strengths for isolated, high-field magnetic white dwarfs. A higher-mass binary
analogue may also contribute to the origin of magnetar fields.
