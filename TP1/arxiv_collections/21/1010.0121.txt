We present results of our study of the infrared properties of massive stars
in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, which are based on the Spitzer SAGE
surveys of these galaxies. We have compiled catalogs of spectroscopically
confirmed massive stars in each galaxy, as well as photometric catalogs for a
subset of these stars that have infrared counterparts in the SAGE database,
with uniform photometry from 0.3 to 24 microns in the UBVIJHKs+IRAC+MIPS24
bands. These catalogs enable a comparative study of infrared excesses of OB
stars, classical Be stars, yellow and red supergiants, Wolf-Rayet stars,
Luminous Blue Variables and supergiant B[e] stars, as a function of
metallicity, and provide the first roadmaps for interpreting luminous, massive,
resolved stellar populations in nearby galaxies at infrared wavelengths.
