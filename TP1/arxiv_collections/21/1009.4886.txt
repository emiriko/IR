The pricing of options in exponential Levy models amounts to the computation
of expectations of functionals of Levy processes. In many situations,
Monte-Carlo methods are used. However, the simulation of a Levy process with
infinite Levy measure generally requires either to truncate small jumps or to
replace them by a Brownian motion with the same variance. We will derive bounds
for the errors generated by these two types of approximation.
