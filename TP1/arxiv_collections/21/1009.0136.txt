We present numerical calculations of quantum transport in perfect octagonal
approximants. These calculations include a Boltzmann (intra-band) contribution
and a non-Boltzmann (inter-band) contribution. When the unit cell size of the
approximant increases, the magnitude of Boltzmann terms decreases, whereas the
magnitude of non-Boltzmann terms increases. It shows that, in large
approximants, the non-Boltzmann contributions should dominate the transport
properties of electrons. This confirms the break-down of the Bloch-Boltzmann
theory to understand the transport properties in approximants with very large
unit cells, and then in quasicrystals, as found in actual Al-based
approximants.
