The chemical composition of ultra-high energy cosmic rays is a key question
in particle astrophysics. The measured composition, inferred from the
elongation rates of cosmic ray showers, looks in general very different from
the initial source composition: resonant photo-disintegration in the cosmic
radiation background proceeds rapidly at the highest energies and the initial
composition quickly becomes lighter during propagation. For a statistical
analysis of continuously improving cosmic ray data it is desirable to know the
secondary spectra as precisely as possible. Here, we discuss exact analytic
solutions of the evolution equation of ultra-high energy cosmic ray nuclei. We
introduce a diagrammatic formalism that leads to a systematic analytic
expansion of the exact solution in terms of second order effects of the
propagation. We show how the first order corrections of this expansion can
improve the predictions of secondary spectra in a semi-analytical treatment.
