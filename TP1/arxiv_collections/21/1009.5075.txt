We study the informational efficiency of a market with a single traded asset.
The price initially differs from the fundamental value, about which the agents
have noisy private information (which is, on average, correct). A fraction of
traders revise their price expectations in each period. The price at which the
asset is traded is public information. The agents' expectations have an
adaptive component and a social-interactions component with confirmatory bias.
We show that, taken separately, each of the deviations from rationality worsen
the information efficiency of the market. However, when the two biases are
combined, the degree of informational inefficiency of the market (measured as
the deviation of the long-run market price from the fundamental value of the
asset) can be non-monotonic both in the weight of the adaptive component and in
the degree of the confirmatory bias. For some ranges of parameters, two biases
tend to mitigate each other's effect, thus increasing the informational
efficiency.
