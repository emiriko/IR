Resonant-mass gravitational waves detectors are reviewed from the concept of
gravitational waves and its mathematical derivation, using Einstein's general
relativity, to the present status of bars and spherical detectors, and their
prospects for the future, which include dual detectors and spheres with
non-resonant transducers. The review covers not only the technical aspects of
detectors and the science that will be done, but also analyses the subject in a
historic perspective, covering the various detection efforts over four decades,
starting from Weber's pioneering work.
