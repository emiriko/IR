We study a certain cycle map defined on finite dimensional modules for the
W-algebra with regular integral central character. Via comparison with the
theory in postive characteristic, we show that this map injects into the top
Borel-Moore homology group of a Springer fibre. This is the first result in a
larger program to completely desribe the finite dimensional modules for the W
algebras.
