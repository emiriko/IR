The spectral--kinetic characteristics of a ZnO:Ga single crystal upon
excitation in the vacuum UV region have been studied. At a temperature of 8 K,
the exciton luminescence line peaking at 3.356 eV has an extremely small
half-width (7.2 meV) and a short decay time (360 ps). In the visible range, a
wide luminescence band peaking at ~2.1 eV with a long luminescence time at 8 K
and a decay time in the nanosecond range at 300 K is observed. The luminescence
excitation spectra of ZnO:Ga have been measured in the range from 4 to 12.5 eV
