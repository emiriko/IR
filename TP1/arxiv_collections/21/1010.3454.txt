Many edible mushrooms eject their spores (about 10 microns in size) at high
speed (about 1 m/s) using surface tension forces in a few microseconds.
Basically the coalescence of a droplet with the spore generates the necessary
momentum to eject the spore. We have detailed this mechanism in \cite{noblin2}.
In this article, we give some details about the high speed movies (up to 250000
fps) of mushrooms' spores ejection attached to this submission. This video was
submitted as part of the Gallery of Fluid Motion 2010 which is showcase of
fluid dynamics videos.
