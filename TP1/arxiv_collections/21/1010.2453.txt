We use numerical simulations to show how noninteracting hard particles
binding to a deformable elastic shell may self-assemble into a variety of
linear patterns. This is a result of the nontrivial elastic response to
deformations of shells. The morphology of the patterns can be controlled by the
mechanical properties of the surface, and can be fine-tuned by varying the
binding energy of the particles. We also repeat our calculations for a fully
flexible chain and find that the chain conformations follow patterns similar to
those formed by the nanoparticles under analogous conditions. We propose a
simple way of understanding and sorting the different structures and relate it
to the underlying shape transition of the shell. Finally, we discuss the
implications of our results.
