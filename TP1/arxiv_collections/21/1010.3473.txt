It is shown the role of a scalar potential in the Schr\"{o}dinger equation
for a steady-state two-particle system is equivalent to an isometric
entanglement of the position coordinates of the particles in space and time.
The entangled coordinates of each particle are complex quantities related
through the entangling transformation to the real positions of both particles.
The transformation takes into account all of the states in the Hilbert space of
the composite system. Transforming the Schr\"{o}dinger equation into these
entangled coordinates eliminates the scalar potential.
