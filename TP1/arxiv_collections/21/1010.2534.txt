It has recently been suggested that galaxies in the early Universe can grow
through the accretion of cold gas, and that this may have been the main driver
of star formation and stellar mass growth. Because the cold gas is essentially
primordial, it has a very low abundance of elements heavier than helium
(metallicity). As it is funneled to the centre of a galaxy, it will lead the
central gas having an overall lower metallicity than gas further from the
centre, because the gas further out has been enriched by supernovae and stellar
winds, and not diluted by the primordial gas. Here we report chemical
abundances across three rotationally-supported star-forming galaxies at z~3,
only 2 Gyr after the Big Bang. We find an 'inverse' gradient, with the central,
star forming regions having a lower metallicity than less active ones, opposite
to what is seen in local galaxies. We conclude that the central gas has been
diluted by the accretion of primordial gas, as predicted by 'cold flow' models.
