Given the return series for a set of instruments, a \emph{trading strategy}
is a switching function that transfers wealth from one instrument to another at
specified times. We present efficient algorithms for constructing (ex-post)
trading strategies that are optimal with respect to the total return, the
Sterling ratio and the Sharpe ratio. Such ex-post optimal strategies are useful
analysis tools. They can be used to analyze the "profitability of a market" in
terms of optimal trading; to develop benchmarks against which real trading can
be compared; and, within an inductive framework, the optimal trades can be used
to to teach learning systems (predictors) which are then used to identify
future trading opportunities.
