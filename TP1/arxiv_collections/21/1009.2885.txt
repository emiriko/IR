In the quasi-one-dimensional cuprate PrBa$_2$Cu$_4$O$_8$, the Pr cations
order antiferromagnetically at 17 K in zero field. Through a combination of
magnetic susceptibility, torque magnetometry, specific heat and interchain
transport measurements, the anisotropic temperature-magnetic field phase
diagram associated with this ordering has been mapped out. A low-temperature
spin-flop transition in the Pr sub-lattice is found to occur at the same
magnetic field strength and orientation as a dimensional crossover in the
ground state of the metallic CuO chains. This coincidence suggests that the
spin reorientation is driven by a change in the anisotropic
Rudermann-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction induced by a corresponding
change in effective dimensionality of the conduction electrons.
