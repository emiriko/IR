Spherical symmetry is ubiquitous in nature. It's therefore unfortunate that
spherical system simulations are so hard, and require complete spheres with
millions of interacting particles. Here we introduce an approach to model
spherical systems, using revised periodic boundary conditions adapted to
spherical symmetry. Method reduces computational costs by orders of magnitude,
and is applicable for both solid and liquid membranes, provided the curvature
is sufficiently small. We demonstrate the method by calculating the bending and
Gaussian curvature moduli of single- and multi-layer graphene. Method works
with any interaction (ab initio, classical interactions), with any approach
(molecular dynamics, Monte Carlo), and with applications ranging from science
to engineering, from liquid to solid membranes, from bubbles to balloons.
