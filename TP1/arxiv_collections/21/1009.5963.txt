SuperB is a proposed high luminosity Super Flavour Factory capable of
accumulating 75/ab of data at the Y(4S) as well as at other center of mass
energies. These proceedings summarise highlights of the SuperB physics
programme, and in particular there is emphasis on the unique aspects of SuperB
over other planned or existing experiments.
