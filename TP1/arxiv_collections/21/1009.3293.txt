We continue our study of patch effect (PE) for two close cylindrical
conductors with parallel axes, slightly shifted against each other in the
radial and by any length in the axial direction, started in [1], where the
potential and energy in the gap were calculated to the second order in the
small transverse shift, and to lowest order in the gap to cylinder radius
ratio. Based on these results, here we derive and analyze PE force. It consists
of three parts: the usual capacitor force due to the uniform potential
difference, the one from the interaction between the voltage patches and the
uniform voltage difference, and the force due to patch interaction, entirely
independent of the uniform voltage. General formulas for these forces are
found, and their general properties are described. A convenient model of a
localized patch is then suggested that allows us to calculate all the forces in
a closed elementary form. Using this, a detailed analysis of the patch
interaction for one pair of patches is carried out, and the dependence of
forces on the patch parameters (width and strength) and their mutual position
is examined. We also give various estimates of the axial patch effect force
important for the Satellite Test of the Equivalence Principle (STEP), and
recommend intensive pre-flight simulations employing our results.
