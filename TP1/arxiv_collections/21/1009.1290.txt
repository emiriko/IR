Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) gives us the opportunity to map the
surface of functionalized carbon nanotubes in an energy resolved manner and
with atomic precision. But this potential is largely untapped, mainly due to
sample stability issues which inhibit reliable measurements. Here we present a
simple and straightforward solution that makes away with this difficulty, by
incorporating the functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) into a
few layer graphene - nanotube composite. This enabled us to measure energy
resolved tunneling conductance maps on the nanotubes, which shed light on the
level of doping, charge transfer between tube and functional groups and the
dependence of defect creation or functionalization on crystallographic
orientation.
