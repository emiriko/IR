The automated detection of solar features is a technique which is relatively
underused but if we are to keep up with the flow of data from spacecraft such
as the recently launched Solar Dynamics Observatory, then such techniques will
be very valuable to the solar community. Automated detection techniques allow
us to examine a large set of data in a consistent way and in relatively short
periods of time allowing for improved statistics to be carried out on any
results obtained. This is particularly useful in the field of sunspot study as
catalogues can be built with sunspots detected and tracked without any human
intervention and this provides us with a detailed account of how various
sunspot properties evolve over time. This article details the use of the
Sunspot Tracking And Recognition Algorithm (STARA) to create a sunspot
catalogue. This catalogue is then used to analyse the magnetic fields in
sunspot umbrae from 1996-2010, taking in the whole of solar cycle 23.
