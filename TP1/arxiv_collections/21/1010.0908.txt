Among the many interesting features displayed by graphene, one of the most
attractive is the simplicity with which its electronic structure can be
described. The study of its physical properties is significantly simplified by
the linear dispersion relation of electrons in a narrow range around the Fermi
level. Unfortunately, the mathematical simplicity of graphene electrons is only
limited to this narrow energy region and is useless when dealing with problems
that involve energies outside the linear dispersion part of the spectrum. In
this letter we remedy this limitation by deriving a set of closed-form
analytical expressions for the real-space single-electron Green function of
graphene which are valid across an enormous fraction of the energy spectrum. By
extending to a wider energy range the simplicity with which graphene electrons
are described, it is now possible to derive more mathematically transparent and
insightful expressions for a number of physical properties that involve higher
energy scales. The power of this new formalism is illustrated in the case of
the magnetic (RKKY) interaction in graphene.
