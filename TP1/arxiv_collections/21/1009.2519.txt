Polar ring galaxies are systems with nearly orthogonally rotated components.
We have found the gas on polar (or strongly inclined) orbits in two BCD
galaxies using ionized gas velocity fields taken with a Fabry-Perot
interferometer of the SAO RAS 6-m telescope. Our analysis shows that all
ionized gas in Mrk 33 is concentrated in a compact disk (3 kpc in diameter)
which rotates in the polar plane relative to the main stellar body. The gaseous
disk in Mrk 370 has a more complex structure with a heavily warped innermost
part. The presence of polar gaseous structures supports an idea that current
the burst of star formation in these galaxies is due to the external gas
accretion or merging. A possible fraction of polar structures among BCD
galaxies seems to be very large (up to 10-15%)
