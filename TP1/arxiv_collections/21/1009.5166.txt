We consider general stochastic systems of interacting particles with noise
which are relevant as models for the collective behavior of animals, and
rigorously prove that in the mean-field limit the system is close to the
solution of a kinetic PDE. Our aim is to include models widely studied in the
literature such as the Cucker-Smale model, adding noise to the behavior of
individuals. The difficulty, as compared to the classical case of globally
Lipschitz potentials, is that in several models the interaction potential
between particles is only locally Lipschitz, the local Lipschitz constant
growing to infinity with the size of the region considered. With this in mind,
we present an extension of the classical theory for globally Lipschitz
interactions, which works for only locally Lipschitz ones.
