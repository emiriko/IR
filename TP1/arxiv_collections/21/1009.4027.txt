For the first time the inverse Laplace transform was applied for analysis of
3He relaxation in porous media. It was shown that inverse Laplace transform
gives new information about these systems. The uniform-penalty algorithm has
been performed to obtain the 3He relaxation times distribution in pores of clay
sample. It is possible to obtain pores' sizes distribution by using applicable
model. Keywords: inverse Laplace transform, uniform-penalty algorithm, liquid
3He, 3He, He3, He-3, helium-3, pulse nuclear magnetic resonance, clay, porous
media.
