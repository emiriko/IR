We consider electron transport in a quantum wire with a side-coupled quantum
ring in a two-dimensional model that accounts for a finite width of the
channels. We use the finite difference technique to solve the scattering
problem as well as to determine the ring-localized states of the energy
continuum. The backscattering probability exhibits Fano peaks for magnetic
fields for which a ring-localized states appear at the Fermi level. We find
that the width of the Fano resonances changes at high magnetic field. The width
is increased (decreased) for resonant states with current circulation that
produce the magnetic dipole moment that is parallel (antiparallel) to the
external magnetic field. We indicate that the opposite behavior of Fano
resonances due to localized states with clockwise and counterclockwise currents
results from the magnetic forces which change the strength of their coupling to
the channel and modify the lifetime of localized states.
