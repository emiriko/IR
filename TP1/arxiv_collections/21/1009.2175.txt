We study the hyperbolic scaling limit for a chain of N coupled anharmonic
oscillators. The chain is attached to a point on the left and there is a force
(tension) $\tau$ acting on the right. In order to provide good ergodic
properties to the system, we perturb the Hamiltonian dynamics with random local
exchanges of velocities between the particles, so that momentum and energy are
locally conserved. We prove that in the macroscopic limit the distributions of
the elongation, momentum and energy, converge to the solution of the Euler
system of equations, in the smooth regime.
