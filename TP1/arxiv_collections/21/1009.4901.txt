We report the results of a study of the intermediate and high mass stars in
the young, rich star-forming complex IC 1805, based on a combination of
optical, near-infrared, and mid-infrared photometry, and classification
spectra. These data provide the basis for characterizing the masses and ages
for stars more massive than ~2 Msun and enable a study of the frequency and
character of circumstellar disks associated with intermediate- and high-mass
stars. Optically thick accretion disks among stars with masses 2 < M/Msun <4
are rare (~2% of members) and absent among more massive stars. A larger
fraction (~10%) of stars with masses 2 < M/Msun < 4 appear to be surrounded by
disks that have evolved from the initial optically thick accretion phase. We
identify four classes of such disks. These classes are based on spectral energy
distributions (SEDs) of excess emsission above photospheric levels: disks that
are (1) optically thin based on the magnitude of the observed excess emission
from 2 to 24 um; (2) optically thin in their inner regions (r< 20 AU) and
optically thick in their outer regions; (3) exhibit empty inner regions (r < 10
AU) and optically thin emission in their outer regions; and (4) exhibit empty
inner regions and optically thick outer regions. We discuss, and assess the
merits and liabilities of, proposed explanations for disks exhibiting these SED
types and suggest additional observations that would test these proposals.
