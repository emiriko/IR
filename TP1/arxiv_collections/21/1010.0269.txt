Using previously developed exciton scattering model accounting for the
interband, i.e., exciton-biexciton, Coulomb interactions in semiconductor
nanocrystals (NCs), we derive a closed set of equations for 2D double-quantum
coherence signal. The signal depends on the Liouville space pathways which
include both the interband scattering processes and the inter- and intraband
optical transitions. These processes correspond to the formation of different
cross-peaks in the 2D spectra. We further report on our numerical calculations
of the 2D signal using reduced level scheme parameterized for PbSe NCs. Two
different NC excitation regimes considered and unique spectroscopic features
associated with the interband Coulomb interactions are identified.
