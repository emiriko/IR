We study a coupled quintessence model in which the interaction with the dark
matter sector is a function of the quintessence potential. Such a coupling can
arise from a field dependent mass term for the dark matter field. The dynamical
analysis of a standard quintessence potential coupled with the interaction
explored here shows that the system possesses a late time accelerated
attractor. In light of these results, we perform a fit to the most recent
Supernovae Ia, Cosmic Microwave Background and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation data
sets. Constraints arising from weak equivalence principle violation arguments
are also discussed.
