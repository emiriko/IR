A method to calculate light curves of the gravitational microlensing of the
Ellis wormhole is derived in the weak-field limit. In this limit, lensing by
the wormhole produces one image outside the Einstein ring and one other image
inside. The weak-field hypothesis is a good approximation in Galactic lensing
if the throat radius is less than $10^{11} km$. The light curves calculated
have gutters of approximately 4% immediately outside the Einstein ring crossing
times. The magnification of the Ellis wormhole lensing is generally less than
that of Schwarzschild lensing. The optical depths and event rates are
calculated for the Galactic bulge and Large Magellanic Cloud fields according
to bound and unbound hypotheses. If the wormholes have throat radii between 100
and $10^7 km$, are bound to the galaxy, and have a number density that is
approximately that of ordinary stars, detection can be achieved by reanalyzing
past data. If the wormholes are unbound, detection using past data is
impossible.
