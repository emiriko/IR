Homogeneous, nearly-isotropic Bianchi cosmological models are considered.
Their time evolution is expressed as a complete set of non-interacting linear
modes on top of a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker background model. This connects
the extensive literature on Bianchi models with the more commonly-adopted
perturbation approach to general relativistic cosmological evolution.
Expressions for the relevant metric perturbations in familiar coordinate
systems can be extracted straightforwardly. Amongst other possibilities, this
allows for future analysis of anisotropic matter sources in a more general
geometry than usually attempted.
  We discuss the geometric mechanisms by which maximal symmetry is broken in
the context of these models, shedding light on the origin of different Bianchi
types. When all relevant length-scales are super-horizon, the simplest Bianchi
I models emerge (in which anisotropic quantities appear parallel transported).
  Finally we highlight the existence of arbitrarily long near-isotropic epochs
in models of general Bianchi type (including those without an exact isotropic
limit).
