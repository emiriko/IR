Assembling simulation software along with the associated tools and utilities
is a challenging endeavor, particularly when the components are distributed
across multiple source code versioning systems. It is problematic for
researchers compiling and running the software across many different
supercomputers, as well as for novices in a field who are often presented with
a bewildering list of software to collect and install. In this paper, we
describe a language (CRL) for specifying software components with the details
needed to obtain them from source code repositories. The language supports
public and private access. We describe a tool called GetComponents which
implements CRL and can be used to assemble software. We demonstrate the tool
for application scenarios with the Cactus Framework on the NSF TeraGrid
resources. The tool itself is distributed with an open source license and
freely available from our web page.
