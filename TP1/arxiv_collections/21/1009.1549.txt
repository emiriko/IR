Local non-Gaussianity causes correlations between large scale perturbation
modes and the small scale power. The large-scale CMB signal has contributions
from the integrated Sachs Wolfe (ISW) effect, which does not correlate with the
small scale power. If this ISW contribution can be removed, the sensitivity to
local non-Gaussianity is improved. Gravitational lensing and galaxy counts can
be used to trace the ISW contribution; in particular we show that the CMB
lensing potential is highly correlated with the ISW signal. We construct a
nearly-optimal estimator for the local non-Gaussianity parameter $\fnl$ and
investigate to what extent we can use this to decrease the variance on
${\fnl}$. We show that the variance can be decreased by up to $20\%$ at Planck
sensitivity using galaxy counts. CMB lensing is a good bias-independent ISW
tracer for future more sensitive observations, though the fractional decrease
in variance is small if good polarization data is also available.
