We review the computation of correlations of successive projections of the
spin onto axes for spin-1/2 particles and EPRB pairs (in the Singlet state). We
assume forms of Realism (at least as general as the Predictive Hidden Variables
in the classical Bell's Theory), to review one particle correlations before we
further assume Locality and analyze EPRB pairs. To our surprise, we find that
the Abstract Bell Inequalities with three or four axes cannot have physical
meaning i.e., two spin projections cannot belong to one particle or some
correlations that one would need cannot be evaluated. A recent version of
Bell's Theory without Locality turns out to be unaffected by our results that
refocus the open issues on "realism" rather than "local realism", inviting us
to leave locality alone so to speak.
