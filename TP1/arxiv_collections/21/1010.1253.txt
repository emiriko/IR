We construct efficient Monte Carlo updating algorithms for two classes of
pure SU(N) lattice gauge actions with non-linear dependence on the link
variables. Our construction generalises the method of auxiliary variables used
by Fabricius and Haan in the framework of Eguchi-Kawai models. We first review
the original Fabricius-Haan method of constructing a pseudo-heatbath algorithm
for fully reduced models, and discuss its extension to lattices with any number
of reduced directions. We then use a similar method to construct updating
algorithms for generic SU(N) mixed Wilson actions. We construct explicit
examples of algorithms for Wilson actions whose plaquettes are in an
irreducible representation of SU(N) with N-ality up to 3. We also construct
updating algorithms for the lattice version of centre-stabilised SU(N)
Yang-Mills theories defined on R^{d-1} x S^1, including the case of a fully
reduced compact direction. We simulate the new algorithms and show that they
are, in general, significantly more efficient than their Metropolis
counterparts.
