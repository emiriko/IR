The strong decay properties of the newly observed $D(2550)$, $D(2600)$,
$D(2750)$ and $D(2760)$ are studied in a constituent quark model. It is
predicted that the $D(2760)$ and $D(2750)$ seem to be two overlapping
resonances. The $D(2760)$ could be identified as the $1^3D_3$ with $J^P=3^-$,
while the $D(2750)$ is most likely to be the high-mass mixed state
$|1{D_2}'>_H$ ($J^P=2^-$) via the $1^1D_2$-$1^3D_2$ mixing. The $D(2600)$
favors the low-mass mixed state $|(SD)_1>_L$ $(J^P=1^-)$ via the
$1^3D_1$-$2^3S_1$ mixing. The $D(2550)$ as the $2^1S_0$ assignment bears
controversies for its too broad width given in experiments.
