We consider a mixture of two-component Fermi and (one-component) bose gases
under the repulsive Bose-Fermi and attractive Fermi-Fermi interaction. We
perform a systematic study of the finite-temperature phase diagrams in the
chemical potential space, identifying, using the Landau-Ginzburg theory, the
features generic to the phase diagrams within the validity of our model. We
apply the theory to explore the physics of correlated BCS pairing among
fermions in a tightly confined trap surrounded by a large BEC gas.
