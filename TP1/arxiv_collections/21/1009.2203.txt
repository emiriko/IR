Quantum error correction allows for faulty quantum systems to behave in an
effectively error free manner. One important class of techniques for quantum
error correction is the class of quantum subsystem codes, which are relevant
both to active quantum error correcting schemes as well as to the design of
self-correcting quantum memories. Previous approaches for investigating these
codes have focused on applying theoretical analysis to look for interesting
codes and to investigate their properties. In this paper we present an
alternative approach that uses computational analysis to accomplish the same
goals. Specifically, we present an algorithm that computes the optimal quantum
subsystem code that can be implemented given an arbitrary set of measurement
operators that are tensor products of Pauli operators. We then demonstrate the
utility of this algorithm by performing a systematic investigation of the
quantum subsystem codes that exist in the setting where the interactions are
limited to 2-body interactions between neighbors on lattices derived from the
convex uniform tilings of the plane.
