We investigate the topological structure of entangled qudits under unitary
local operations. Different sectors are identified in the evolution, and their
geometrical and topological aspects are analyzed. The geometric phase is
explicitly calculated in terms of the concurrence. As a main result, we predict
a fractional topological phase for cyclic evolutions in the multiply connected
space of maximally entangled states.
