One of the most important questions in studying quantum computation is:
whether a quantum computer can solve NP-complete problems more efficiently than
a classical computer? In 2000, Farhi, et al. (Science, 292(5516):472--476,
2001) proposed the adiabatic quantum optimization (AQO), a paradigm that
directly attacks NP-hard optimization problems. How powerful is AQO? Early on,
van Dam and Vazirani claimed that AQO failed (i.e. would take exponential time)
for a family of 3SAT instances they constructed. More recently, Altshuler, et
al. (Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 107(28): 12446--12450, 2010) claimed that AQO
failed also for random instances of the NP-complete Exact Cover problem. In
this paper, we make clear that all these negative results are only for a
specific AQO algorithm. We do so by demonstrating different AQO algorithms for
the same problem for which their arguments no longer hold. Whether AQO fails or
succeeds for solving the NP-complete problems (either the worst case or the
average case) requires further investigation. Our AQO algorithms for Exact
Cover and 3SAT are based on the polynomial reductions to the NP-complete
Maximum-weight Independent Set (MIS) problem.
