We present the calculations necessary to obtain next-to-leading order QCD
precision with the Herwig++ event generator using the MC@NLO approach, and
implement them for all the processes that were previously available from
Fortran HERWIG with MC@NLO. We show a range of results comparing the two
implementations. With these calculations and recent developments in the
automatic generation of NLO matrix elements, it will be possible to obtain NLO
precision with Herwig++ for a much wider range of processes
