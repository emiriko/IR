We study the effects of disorder on the slope of the disorder--temperature
phase boundary near the Onsager point (Tc = 2.269...) in spin-glass models. So
far, studies have focused on marginal or irrelevant cases of disorder. Using
duality arguments, as well as exact Pfaffian techniques we reproduce these
analytical estimates. In addition, we obtain different estimates for spin-glass
models on hierarchical lattices where the effects of disorder are relevant. We
show that the phase-boundary slope near the Onsager point can be used to probe
for the relevance of disorder effects.
