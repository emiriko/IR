The tilings of the 2-dimensional sphere by congruent triangles have been
extensively studied, and the edge-to-edge tilings have been completely
classified. However, not much is known about the tilings by other congruent
polygons. In this paper, we classify the simplest case, which is the
edge-to-edge tilings of the 2-dimensional sphere by 12 congruent pentagons. We
find one major class allowing two independent continuous parameters and four
classes of isolated examples. The classification is done by first separately
classifying the combinatorial, edge length, and angle aspects, and then
combining the respective classifications together.
