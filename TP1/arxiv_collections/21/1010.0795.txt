In the reversed field pinch RFX-mod strong electron temperature gradients
develop when the Single-Helical-Axis regime is achieved. Gyrokinetic
calculations show that in the region of the strong temperature gradients
microtearing instabilities are the dominant turbulent mechanism acting on the
ion Larmor radius scale. The quasi-linear evaluation of the electron thermal
conductivity is in good agreement with the experimental estimates.
