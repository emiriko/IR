Studying the statistical properties of solar ultraviolet emission lines could
provide information about the nature of small scale coronal heating. We expand
on previous work to investigate these properties. We study whether the
predicted statistical distribution of ion emission line intensities produced by
a specified heating function is affected by the isoelectronic sequence to which
the ion belongs, as well as the characteristic temperature at which it was
formed. Particular emphasis is placed on the strong resonance lines belonging
to the lithium isoelectronic sequence. Predictions for emission lines observed
by existing space-based UV spectrometers are given. The effects on the
statistics of a line when observed with a wide-band imaging instrument rather
than a spectrometer are also investigated. We use a hydrodynamic model to
simulate the UV emission of a loop system heated by nanoflares on small,
spatially unresolved scales. We select lines emitted at similar temperatures
but belonging to different isoelectronic groups: Fe IX and Ne VIII, Fe XII and
Mg X, Fe XVII, Fe XIX and Fe XXIV. Our simulations confirm previous results
that almost all lines have an intensity distribution that follows a power-law,
in a similar way to the heating function. However, only the high temperature
lines best preserve the heating function's power law index (Fe XIX being the
best ion in the case presented here). The Li isoelectronic lines have different
statistical properties with respect to the lines from other sequences, due to
the extended high temperature tail of their contribution functions. However,
this is not the case for Fe XXIV which may be used as a diagnostic of the
coronal heating function. We also show that the power-law index of the heating
function is effectively preserved when a line is observed by a wide-band
imaging instrument rather than a spectromenter.
