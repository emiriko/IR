We study in detail the role of short-cuts in promoting the emergence of
cooperation in a network of agents playing the Prisoner's Dilemma Game (PDG).
We introduce a model whose topology interpolates between the one-dimensional
euclidean lattice (a ring) and the complete graph by changing the value of one
parameter (the probability p to add a link between two nodes not already
connected in the euclidean configuration). We show that there is a region of
values of p in which cooperation is largely enhanced, whilst for smaller values
of p only a few cooperators are present in the final state, and for p
\rightarrow 1- cooperation is totally suppressed. We present analytical
arguments that provide a very plausible interpretation of the simulation
results, thus unveiling the mechanism by which short-cuts contribute to promote
(or suppress) cooperation.
