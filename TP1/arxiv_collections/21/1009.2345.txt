We present here the summary of the "Electroweak and Searches in DIS and
Hadron Colliders" working group activities at the DIS 2010 conference. The
theory contributions will be presented first, followed by the experimental
ones. The experimental results include measurements from the Tevatron (CDF and
\DO) and HERA (H1 and ZEUS) experiments, and studies from the LHC (ATLAS and
CMS). Results from the B-factories (BaBar and Belle) and from NA62 are also
summarised.
