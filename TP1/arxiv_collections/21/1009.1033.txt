We investigate quantum pumping of massless Dirac fermions in an ideal
(impurity free) double layer of graphene. The pumped current is generated by
adiabatic variation of two gate voltages in the contact regions to a weakly
doped double graphene sheet. At the Dirac point and for a wide bilayer with
width W much larger then length L, we find that the pumped current scales
linearly with the interlayer coupling length l_{perp} for L/l_{perp} << 1, is
maximal for L/l_{perp} ~ 1, and crosses over to a
log(L/l_{perp})/(L/l_{perp})-dependence for L/l_{perp} >> 1. We compare our
results with the behavior of the conductance in the same system and discuss
their experimental feasibility.
