Different deformations of the Poincare symmetries have been identified for
various non-commutative spaces (e.g. $\kappa$-Minkowski, $sl(2,R)$, Moyal). We
present here the deformation of the Poincare symmetries related to Snyder
space-time. The notions of smooth "K-loop", a non-associative generalization of
Abelian Lie groups, and its infinitesimal counterpart given by the Lie triple
system are the key objects in the construction.
