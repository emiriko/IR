We analyze the collider signals of composite scalars that emerge in certain
little Higgs models and models of vectorlike confinement. Similar to the decay
of the pion into photon pairs, these scalars mainly decay through
anomaly-induced interactions into electroweak gauge bosons, leading to a
distinct signal with three or more photons in the final state. We study the
standard model backgrounds for these signals, and find that the LHC can
discover these models over a large range of parameter space with 30 fb$^{-1}$
at 14 TeV. An early discovery at the current 7 TeV run is possible in some
regions of parameter space. We also discuss possibilities to measure the spin
of the particles in the $\gamma \gamma $ and $Z\gamma $ decay channels.
