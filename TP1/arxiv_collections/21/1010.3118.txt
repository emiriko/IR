Transiting exoplanets (TEPs) observed just about 10 Myrs after formation of
their host systems may serve as the Rosetta Stone for planet formation
theories. They would give strong constraints on several aspects of planet
formation, e.g. time-scales (planet formation would then be possible within 10
Myrs), the radius of the planet could indicate whether planets form by
gravitational collapse (being larger when young) or accretion growth (being
smaller when young). We present a survey, the main goal of which is to find and
then characterise TEPs in very young open clusters.
