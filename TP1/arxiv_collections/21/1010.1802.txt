The recent discovery of topological insulators has revived interest in the
topological properties of insulating band structures. In this work, we extend
the topological classification of insulating band structures to include certain
point group symmetry of crystals. We find a class of three-dimensional
"topological crystalline insulators" which have metallic surface states on
certain high symmetry crystal surfaces. These topological crystalline
insulators can be viewed as the counterpart of topological insulators in
materials without spin-orbit coupling. Their surface states have quadratic band
degeneracy instead of linear Dirac dispersion. Their band structures are
characterized by new Z2 invariants. We hope this work will enlarge the family
of topological phases in band insulators and stimulate the search for them in
real materials.
