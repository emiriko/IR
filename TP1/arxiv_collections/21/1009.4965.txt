Recent experiments have reached the neutron-rich Cr isotope with N=40 and
confirmed enhanced collectivity near this sub-shell. The current data focus on
low-spin spectroscopy only, with little information on the states where high-j
particles align their spins with the system rotation. By applying the Projected
Shell Model, we show that rotation alignment occurs in neutron-rich even-even
Cr nuclei as early as spin 8 and, due to shell filling, the aligning particles
differ in different isotopes. It is suggested that observation of
irregularities in moments of inertia is a direct probe of the deformed
single-particle scheme in this exotic mass region.
