We present a search for the lightest supersymmetric partner of the top quark
in proton-antiproton collisions at a center-of-mass energy sqrt(s)=1.96 TeV.
This search was conducted within the framework of the R-parity conserving
minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model, assuming the stop
decays dominantly to a lepton, a sneutrino, and a bottom quark. We searched for
events with two oppositely-charged leptons, at least one jet, and missing
transverse energy in a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of
1fb^-1 collected by the CDF experiment. No significant evidence of a stop quark
signal was found. Exclusion limits at 95% confidence level in the stop quark
versus sneutrino mass plane are set. Stop quark masses up to 180 GeV/c^2 are
excluded for sneutrino masses around 45 GeV/c^2, and sneutrino masses up to 116
GeV/c^2 are excluded for stop quark masses around 150 GeV/c^2.
