We propose a scalable neutral atom quantum computer with an on-demand
interaction. Artificial lattice of near field optical traps is employed to trap
atom qubits. Interactions between atoms can be turned off if the atoms are
separated by a high enough potential barrier so that the size of the atomic
wave function is much less than the interatomic distance. One-qubit gate
operation is implemented by a gate control laser beam which is attached to an
individual atom. Two-qubit gate operation between a particular pair of atoms is
introduced by leaving these atoms in an optical lattice and making them collide
so that a particular two-qubit state acquires a dynamical phase. Our proposal
is feasible within existing technology developed in cold atom gas, MEMS,
nanolithography, and various areas in optics.
