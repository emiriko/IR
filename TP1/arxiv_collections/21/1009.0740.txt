The theoretical approach proposed recently for description of redistribution
of electronic charge in multilayered selectively doped systems is modified for
a system with finite number of layers. A special attention is payed to the case
of a finite heterostructure made of copper-oxide layers which are all
non-superconducting (including non-conducting) because of doping levels being
beyond the well-known characteristic interval for superconductivity. Specific
finite structures and doping configurations are proposed to obtain atomically
thin superconducting heterojunctions of different compositions.
