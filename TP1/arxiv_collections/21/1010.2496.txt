What are the properties of accretion flows in the vicinity of coalescing
supermassive black holes (SBHs)? The answer to this question has direct
implications for the feasibility of coincident detections of electromagnetic
(EM) and gravitational wave (GW) signals from coalescences. Such detections are
considered to be the next observational grand challenge that will enable
testing general relativity in the strong, nonlinear regime and improve our
understanding of evolution and growth of these massive compact objects. In this
paper we review the properties of the environment of coalescing binaries in the
context of the circumbinary disk and hot, radiatively inefficient accretion
flow models and use them to mark the extent of the parameter space spanned by
this problem. We report the results from an ongoing, general relativistic,
hydrodynamical study of the inspiral and merger of black holes, motivated by
the latter scenario. We find that correlated EM+GW oscillations can arise
during the inspiral phase followed by the gradual rise and subsequent drop-off
in the light curve at the time of coalescence. While there are indications that
the latter EM signature is a more robust one, a detection of either signal
coincidentally with GWs would be a convincing evidence for an impending SBH
binary coalescence. The observability of an EM counterpart in the hot accretion
flow scenario depends on the details of a model. In the case of the most
massive binaries observable by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, upper
limits on luminosity imply that they may be identified by EM searches out to
z~0.1-1. However, given the radiatively inefficient nature of the gas flow, we
speculate that a majority of massive binaries may appear as low luminosity AGN
in the local universe.
