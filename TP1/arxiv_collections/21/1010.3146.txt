We carry out a series of experiments with a special interest on growing and
condensing processes of vapor bubble(s) injected into a subcooled pool. We
examine effects of the degree of subcooling of the bulk in the pool and
injection rate of the vapor into the pool. We pay their special attention to
(i) abrupt collapse of the injected vapor bubble to form micrometer-scale
bubbles, and (ii) interaction of adjacent vapor bubbles laterally injected to
the pool through the orifices. We have found that a fine disturbance does arise
on the surface of the vapor bubble just prior to its abrupt collapse. The
bubble never exhibits an abrupt collapse without such instability over the free
surface. In the case of the injection of a pair of vapor bubbles through the
neighboring orifices, the interaction between the bubbles and the effects of
the induced flows by the bubble behaviors control the surface dynamics. This
fluid dynamics video introduces those phenomena.
