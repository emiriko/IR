We demonstrate orientation-sensitive multimodal nonlinear optical polarizing
microscopy capable of probing orientational, polar, and biaxial features of
mesomorphic ordering in soft matter. This technique achieves simultaneous
imaging in broadband coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering, multi-photon
excitation fluorescence, and multi-harmonic generation polarizing microscopy
modes and is based on the use of a single femtosecond laser and a photonic
crystal fiber as sources of the probing light. We show the viability of this
technique for mapping of three dimensional patterns of molecular orientations
and that images obtained in different microscopy modes are consistent with each
other.
