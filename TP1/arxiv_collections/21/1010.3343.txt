At low metallicity the B-type stars rotate faster than at higher metallicity,
typically in the SMC. As a consequence, it was expected a larger number of fast
rotators in the SMC than in the Galaxy, in particular more Be/Oe stars. With
the ESO-WFI in its slitless mode, the SMC open clusters were examined and an
occurence of Be stars 3 to 5 times larger than in the Galaxy was found. The
evolution of the angular rotational velocity seems to be the main key on the
understanding of the specific behaviour and of the stellar evolution of such
stars at different metallicities. With the results of this WFI study and using
observational clues on the SMC WR stars and massive stars, as well as the
theoretical indications of long gamma-ray burst progenitors, we identify the
low metallicity massive Be and Oe stars as potential LGRB progenitors.
Therefore the expected rates and numbers of LGRB are calculated and compared to
the observed ones, leading to a good probability that low metallicity Be/Oe
stars are actually LGRB progenitors.
