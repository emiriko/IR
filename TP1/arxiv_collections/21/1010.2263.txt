The matrix element method (MEM) has been extensively used for the analysis of
top-quark and W-boson physics at the Tevatron, but in general without dedicated
treatment of initial state QCD radiation. At the LHC, the increased center of
mass energy leads to a significant increase in the amount of QCD radiation,
which makes it mandatory to carefully account for its effects. We here present
several methods for inclusion of QCD radiation effects in the MEM, and apply
them to mass determination in the presence of multiple invisible particles in
the final state. We demonstrate significantly improved results compared to the
standard treatment.
