Given the absence of observations of black hole binaries, it is critical that
the full range of accessible parameter space be explored in anticipation of
future observation with gravitational wave detectors. To this end, we compile
the Hamiltonian equations of motion describing the conservative dynamics of the
most general black hole binaries, as computed by Will and collaborators, and
incorporate an effective treatment of dissipation through gravitational
radiation. We evolve these equations for systems with orbital eccentricity and
precessing spins. We find that, while spin-spin coupling corrections can
destroy constant radius orbits in principle, the effect is so small that orbits
will reliably tend to quasi-spherical orbits as angular momentum and energy are
lost to gravitational radiation. Still, binaries that are initially highly
eccentric may retain eccentricity as they pass into the detectable bandwidth of
ground-based gravitational wave detectors. We also show that a useful set of
natural frequencies for an orbit demonstrating both spin precession and
periastron precession is comprised of (1) the frequency of angular motion in
the orbital plane, (2) the frequency of the plane precession, and (3) the
frequency of radial oscillations. These three natural harmonics shape the
observed waveform.
