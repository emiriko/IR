Transport measurements indicate strong oscillations in the Hall-,$R_{xy}$,
and the diagonal-, $R_{xx}$, resistances and exhibit Hall plateaus at the
lowest temperatures, in three-dimensional Highly Oriented Pyrolytic Graphite
(HOPG). At the same time, a comparative Shubnikov-de Haas-oscillations-based
Berry's phase analysis indicates that graphite is unlike the GaAs/AlGaAs 2D
electron system, the 3D n-GaAs epilayer, semiconducting $Hg_{0.8}Cd_{0.2}Te$,
and some other systems. Finally, we observe the transport data to follow
$B\times dR_{xy}/dB \approx - \Delta R_{xx}$. This feature is consistent with
the observed relative phases of the oscillatory $R_{xx}$ and $R_{xy}$.
