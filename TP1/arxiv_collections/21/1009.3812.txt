We discuss the dynamical current-current correlation function of the
hexagonal lattice using a local current operator defined on a continuum-replica
model of the original lattice model. In the Dirac approximation, the
correlation function can be decomposed into a parallel and perpendicular
contribution. We show that this is not possible for the hexagonal lattice even
in the Dirac regime. A comparison between the analytical isotropic solution and
the numerical results for the honeycomb lattice is given.
