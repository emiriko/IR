We recently put in evidence (\cite{noblin2}) that combined vertical and
horizontal vibrations can induced a controlled motion of a sessile supported
drop. In this video we generalize this finding and demonstrate that a remote 2d
controlled motion is possible. This video was submitted as part of the Gallery
of Fluid Motion 2010 which is showcase of fluid dynamics videos.
