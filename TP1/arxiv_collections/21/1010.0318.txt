We show that treating gravitation as a thermodynamical theory leads to the
modified Newton dynamics (MOND) equations if one takes into account the
Hubble's expansion. Then the universal MOND acceleration a0 is exactly twice
the product of the light velocity c and the Hubble constant H. No dark matter
is needed for the description of the galaxy rotational curves as well as for
the accounting for the additional gravitational lensing at large distances.
