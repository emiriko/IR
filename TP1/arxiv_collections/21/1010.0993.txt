Recently, Dymarsky, Kuperstein and Sonnenschein constructed an embedding of
flavor D7- and anti-D7-branes in the Klebanov-Strassler geometry that breaks
the supersymmetry of the background, yet is stable. In this article, we study
in detail the spectrum of vector mesons in this new model of flavor chiral
symmetry breaking and commence an analytical analysis of the scalar mesons in
this setup.
