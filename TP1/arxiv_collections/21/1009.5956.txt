In this paper, we suggested eleven protein targets to be used as possible
vaccines against Plasmodium falciparum causative agent of almost two to three
million deaths per year. A comprehensive analysis of protein target have been
selected from the small experimental fragment of antigen in the P. falciparum
genome, all of them common to the four stages of the parasite life cycle (i.e.,
sporozoites, merozoites, trophozoites and gametocytes). The potential vaccine
candidates should be analyzed in silico technique using various bioinformatics
tools. Finally, the possible protein target according to PlasmoDB gene ID are
PFC0975c, PFE0660c, PF08_0071, PF10_0084, PFI0180w, MAL13P1.56, PF14_0192,
PF13_0141, PF14_0425, PF13_0322, y PF14_0598.
