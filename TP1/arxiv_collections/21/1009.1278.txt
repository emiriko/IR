I describe the parton picture at strong coupling emerging from the
gauge/gravity duality, with emphasis on the universality of the phenomenon of
parton saturation. I discuss several consequences of this picture for the
phenomenology of a strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma, which are potentially
relevant for heavy ion collisions at RHIC and LHC.
