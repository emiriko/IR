The rf sputtered copper ferrite films contain nanocrystalline grains. In
these films, the magnetization does not saturate even in high magnetic fields.
This phenomenon of high field susceptibility is attributed to the defects
and/or superparamagnetic grains in the films. A simple model is developed to
describe the observed high field magnetization behavior of these films. The
model is found to fit well to the high field part for all the studied films. An
attempt is also made to explain the temperature variation of the ferrimagnetic
contribution on the basis of reported exchange constants.
