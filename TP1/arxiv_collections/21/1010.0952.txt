We have applied the Andreev-Lifshitz hydrodynamic theory of supersolids to an
ordinary solid. This theory includes an internal pressure $P$, distinct from
the applied pressure $P_a$ and the stress tensor $\lambda_{ik}$. Under uniform
static $P_{a}$, we have $\lambda_{ik} = (P-P_{a})\delta_{ik}$. For $P_{a} \ne
0$, Maxwell relations imply that $P \sim P_{a}^{2}$. The theory also permits
vacancy diffusion but treats vacancies as conserved. It gives three sets of
propagating elastic modes; it also gives two diffusive modes, one largely of
entropy density and one largely of vacancy density (or, more generally, defect
density). For the vacancy diffusion mode (or, equivalently, the lattice
diffusion mode) the vacancies behave like a fluid within the solid, with the
deviations of internal pressure associated with density changes nearly
canceling the deviations of stress associated with strain. We briefly consider
pressurization experiments in solid $^4$He at low temperatures in light of this
lattice diffusion mode, which for small $P_{a}$ has diffusion constant $D_{L}
\sim P_{a}^{2}$. The general principles of the theory -- that both volume and
strain should be included as thermodynamic variables, with the result that both
$P$ and $\lambda_{ik}$ appear -- should apply to all solids under pressure,
especially near the solid-liquid transition. The lattice diffusion mode
provides an additional degree of freedom that may permit surfaces with
different surface treatments to generate different responses in the bulk.
