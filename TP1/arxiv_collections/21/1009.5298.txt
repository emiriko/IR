The first part of this paper is a survey on algebro-geometric aspects of
sheaves of logarithmic vector fields of hyperplane arrangements. In the second
part we prove that the relative de Rham cohomology (of degree two) of ADE-type
adjoint quotient map is naturally isomorphic to the module of certain
multiderivations. The isomorphism is obtained by the Gauss-Manin derivative of
the Kostant-Kirillov form.
