Currently it is thought that in order to explain the phenomenon of
superconductivity is necessary to understand the mechanism of formation of
electron pairs. However, the paired electrons cannot form a superconducting
condensate. They perform disorderly zero-point oscillations and there are no
attractive forces in their ensemble. To create a unified ensemble of particles,
the pairs must order their zero-point fluctuations so that an attraction
between the particles appears. For this reason, the ordering of zero-point
oscillations in the electron gas is the cause of superconductivity and the
parameters characterizing this order determine the properties of
superconductors. The model of condensation of zero-point oscillations creates
the possibility to obtain estimates for the critical parameters of elementary
superconductors, which are also in the satisfactory agreement with measured
data. On the another hand, the phenomenon of superfluidity in He-4 and He-3 can
be similarly explained due to the ordering of zero-point fluctuations. Thus it
is established that the both related phenomena are based on the same physical
mechanism.
