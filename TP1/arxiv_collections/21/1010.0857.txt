We demonstrate that the high-magnetic field pulsar J1119-6127 exhibits three
different types of behaviour in the radio band. Trailing the "normal" profile
peak there is an "intermittent" peak and these components are flanked by two
additional components showing very erratic "RRAT-like" emission. Both the
intermittent and RRAT-like events are extremely rare and are preceded by a
large amplitude glitch in the spin-down parameters. The post-glitch spin-down
rate is smaller than the pre-glitch rate. This type of relaxation is very
unusual for the pulsar population as a whole, but is observed in the glitch
recovery of a RRAT. The abnormal emission behaviour in PSR J1119-6127 was
observed up to three months after the epoch of the large glitch, suggestive of
changes in the magnetospheric conditions during the fast part of the recovery
process. We argue that both the anomalous recoveries and the emission changes
could be related to reconfigurations of the magnetic field. Apart from the
glitches, the spin-down of PSR J1119-6127 is relatively stable, allowing us to
refine the measurement of the braking index (n=2.684\pm0.002) using more than
12 years of timing data. The properties of this pulsar are discussed in light
of the growing evidence that RRATs do not form a distinct class of pulsar, but
rather are a combination of different extreme emission types seen in other
neutron stars. Different sub-classes of the RRATs can potentially be separated
by calculating the lower limit on the modulation index of their emission. We
speculate that if the abnormal behaviour in PSR J1119-6127 is indeed glitch
induced then there might exist a population of neutron stars which only become
visible in the radio band for a short duration in the immediate aftermath of
glitch activity. These neutron stars will be visible in the radio band as
sources that only emit some clustered pulses every so many years.
