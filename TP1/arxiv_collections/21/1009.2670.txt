Nanophotonic devices seek to generate, guide, and/or detect light using
structures whose nanoscale dimensions are closely tied to their functionality.
Semiconducting nanowires, grown with tailored optoelectronic properties, have
been successfully placed into devices for a variety of applications. However,
the integration of photonic nanostructures with electronic circuitry has always
been one of the most challenging aspects of device development. Here we report
the development of rewritable nanoscale photodetectors created at the interface
between LaAlO3 and SrTiO3. Nanowire junctions with characteristic dimensions
2-3 nm are created using a reversible AFM writing technique. These nanoscale
devices exhibit a remarkably high gain for their size, in part because of the
large electric fields produced in the gap region. The photoconductive response
is gate-tunable and spans the visible-to-near-infrared regime. The ability to
integrate rewritable nanoscale photodetectors with nanowires and transistors in
a single materials platform foreshadows new families of integrated
optoelectronic devices and applications.
