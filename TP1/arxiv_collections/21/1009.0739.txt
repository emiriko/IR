We study the meta-stable states in high temperature phase of QCD
characterised by nonzero expectation values for the imaginary part of the
Polyakov loop. We consider $N_f= 2, 3$ dynamical staggered quarks, and carry
out simulations at various values of the coupling $\beta$ to observe these
states. In particular, we find the value of the coupling ($\beta_m$) above
which the meta-stable states appear. The resulting value of $\beta_m$
corresponds to temperature $T_m \gtrsim 750$MeV for $N_f=2$.
