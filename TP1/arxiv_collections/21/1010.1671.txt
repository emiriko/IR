Several ways are discussed how to control the Landau-Zener tunneling in the
Wannier-Stark system. We focus on a realization of this system with interacting
and noninteracting ultracold bosons. The tunneling from the ground band to the
continuum is shown to depend crucially on the initial condition and system
parameters and, more interestingly, on added timedependent disorder -- noise --
on the lattice beams.
