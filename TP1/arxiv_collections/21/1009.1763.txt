The performance of the nine RHESSI germanium detectors has been gradually
deteriorating since its launch in 2002 because of radiation damage. To restore
its former sensitivity, the spectrometer underwent an annealing procedure in
November 2007. However, it changed the RHESSI response and affected gamma-ray
burst measurements, e.g., the hardness ratios and the spectral capabilities
below ~100keV.
