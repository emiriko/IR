In this theoretical study we analyze contrast transfer of weak-phase objects
in a transmission electron microscope, which is equipped with an aberration
corrector (Cs-corrector) in the imaging lens system and a physical phase plate
in the back focal plane of the objective lens. For a phase shift of pi/2
between scattered and unscattered electrons induced by a physical phase plate,
the sine-type phase contrast transfer function is converted into a cosine-type
function. Optimal imaging conditions could theoretically be achieved if the
phase shifts caused by the objective lens defocus and lens aberrations would be
equal zero. In reality this situation is difficult to realize because of
residual aberrations and varying, non-zero local defocus values, which in
general result from an uneven sample surface topography. We explore the
conditions - i.e. range of Cs-values and defocus - for most favourable contrast
transfer as a function of the information limit, which is only limited by the
effect of partial coherence of the electron wave in Cs-corrected transmission
electron microscopes. Under high-resolution operation conditions we find that a
physical phase plate improves strongly low- and medium-resolution object
contrast, while improving tolerance to defocus and Cs-variations, compared to a
microscope without a phase plate.
