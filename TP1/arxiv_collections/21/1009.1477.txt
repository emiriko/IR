An algorithm is presented that combines the ME+PS approach to merge sequences
of tree-level matrix elements into inclusive event samples with the POWHEG
method, which combines exact next-to-leading order matrix elements with parton
showers. The quality of the approach and its implementation in Sherpa are
exemplified by results for e+e- annihilation into hadrons at LEP, for Drell-Yan
lepton-pair production at the Tevatron and for Higgs-boson and W+W- production
at LHC energies.
