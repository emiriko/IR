Nanotubed titanic acid (H2Ti2O4(OH)2) was prepared from nanotubed sodium
titanate (Na2Ti2O4(OH)2) by an ion exchange reaction in a pH=1 HCl solution.
The effect of annealing temperature on the morphology, structure and
photocatalytic behavior of nanotubed H2Ti2O4(OH)2 was studied by means of TEM,
XRD, DTG, DSC, BET and ESR. The results showed that nanotubed H2Ti2O4(OH)2 is
thermally unstable. Its dehydration consists of two steps. In the first-step
dehydration, single-electron-trapped oxygen vacancies (SETOVs) were generated.
Accompanying the second-step dehydration, the transition of crystal form from
orthorhombic system to anatase took place, at the same time the nanotubes
broke. At T>300 {\deg}C, when the SETOV concentration greatly increased, the
interaction between SETOV happened. (VOo)x formed could play the role of
recombination center of photogenerated e--h+ and make the photocatalytic
behavior of TiO2 (anatase, obtained from 500 {\deg}C-treated nanotubed
H2Ti2O4(OH)2) to become bad.
