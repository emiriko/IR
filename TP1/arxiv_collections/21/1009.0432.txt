We present Edaq530, a low-cost, compact and easy-to-use digital measurement
solution consisting of a thumb-sized USB-to-sensor interface and a measurement
software. The solution is fully open-source, our aim being to provide a viable
alternative to professional solutions. Our main focus in designing Edaq530 has
been versatility and transparency. In this paper, we shall introduce the
capabilities of Edaq530, complement it by showing a few sample experiments, and
discuss the feedback we have received in the course of a teacher training
workshop in which the participants received personal copies of Edaq530 and
later made reports on how they could utilise Edaq530 in their teaching.
