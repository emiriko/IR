This contribution is devoted to a review of some recent results on existence,
symmetry and symmetry breaking of optimal functions for
Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg and weighted logarithmic Hardy inequalities. These
results have been obtained in a series of papers in collaboration with M. del
Pino, S. Filippas, M. Loss, G. Tarantello and A. Tertikas and are presented
from a new viewpoint.
