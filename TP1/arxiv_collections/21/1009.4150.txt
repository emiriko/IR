The Solar Radiospectrograph of the University of Athens (ARTEMIS-IV) is in
operation at the Thermopylae Satellite Communication Station since 1996. The
observations extend from the base of the Solar Corona (650 MHz) to about 2
Solar Radii (20 MHz) with time resolution 1/10-1/100 sec. The instruments
recordings, being in the form of dynamic spectra, measure radio flux as a
function of height in the corona; our observations are combined with spatial
data from the Nancay Radioheliograph whenever the need for 3D positional
information arises. The ARTEMIS-IV contribution in the study of solar radio
bursts is two fold- Firstly, in investigating new spectral characteristics
since its high sampling rate facilitates the study of fine structures in radio
events. On the other hand it is used in studying the association of solar
bursts with interplanetary phenomena because of its extended frequency range
which is, furthermore, complementary to the range of the WIND/WAVES receivers
and the observations may be readily combined. This reports serves as a brief
account of this operation. Joint observations with STEREO/WAVES and LOFAR low
frequency receivers are envisaged in the future.
