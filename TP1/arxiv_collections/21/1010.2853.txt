We use non-equilibrium dynamical mean field theory and a real-time
diagrammatic impurity solver to study the heating associated with
time-dependent changes of the interaction in a fermionic Hubbard model. Optimal
ramp shapes U(t) which minimize the excitation energy are determined for an
infinitesimal change. For ramp times of a few inverse hoppings, these optimal
U(t) are strongly oscillating with a frequency determined by the bandwidth. We
show that the scaled versions of the optimized ramps yield substantially lower
temperatures than linear ramps even far outside the perturbative regime.
