We give minimal values for the smallest lepton mixing parameter U_{e3},
applying 2-loop renormalization group equations in an effective theory
approach. This is relevant in scenarios that predict an inverted neutrino mass
spectrum with the smallest mass and U_{e3} being zero at tree level, a
situation known to be preserved at 1-loop order. At 2-loop, U_{e3} is generated
at a level of 10^{-12}-10^{-14}. Such small values are of interest in supernova
physics. Corresponding limits for the normal mass ordering are several orders
of magnitude larger. Our results show that U_{e3} can in general expected be to
be non-zero.
