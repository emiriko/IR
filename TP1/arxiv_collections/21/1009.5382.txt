The possibility is explored that accretion on an intermediate mass black hole
contributes to the ionisation of the interstellar medium of the Compact Blue
Dwarf galaxy MRK996. Chandra observations set tight upper limits (99.7 per cent
confidence level) in both the X-ray luminosity of the posited AGN,
Lx(2-10keV)<3e40erg/s, and the black hole mass, <1e4/\lambda Msolar, where
\lambda, is the Eddington ratio. The X-ray luminosity upper limit is
insufficient to explain the high ionisation line [OIV]25.89\mu m, which is
observed in the mid-infrared spectrum of the MRK996 and is proposed as evidence
for AGN activity. This indicates that shocks associated with supernovae
explosions and winds of young stars must be responsible for this line. It is
also found that the properties of the diffuse X-ray emission of MRK996 are
consistent with this scenario, thereby providing direct evidence for shocks
that heat the galaxy's interstellar medium and contribute to its ionisation.
