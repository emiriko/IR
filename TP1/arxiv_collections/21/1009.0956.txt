The contribution of the axial triangle anomalous graph to the parity
non-conservation effect in atoms is evaluated. The final answer looks like the
emission of the electric photon by the magnetic dipole. The relative
contribution to the parity non-conservation effect in neutral atoms appears to
be negligible but is essentially larger in case of multicharged ions.
