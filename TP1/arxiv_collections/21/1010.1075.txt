We used the Gross--Pitaevskii equations to investigate ferromagnetic
resonance in spin-1 Bose--Einstein condensates with a magnetic dipole-dipole
interaction. By introducing the dipole interaction, we obtained equations
similar to the Kittel equations used to represent ferromagnetic resonance in
condensed matter physics. These equations indicated that the ferromagnetic
resonance originated from dipolar interaction, and that the resonance frequency
depended upon the shape of the condensate. Furthermore, spin currents driven by
spin diffusions are characteristic of this system.
