It is well-known that the coset spaces G(k((z)))/G(k[[z]]), for a reductive
group G over a field k, carry the geometric structure of an inductive limit of
projective k-schemes. This k-ind-scheme is known as the affine Grassmannian for
G. From the point of view of number theory it would be interesting to obtain an
analogous geometric interpretation of quotients of the form
G(W(k)[1/p])/G(W(k)), where p is a rational prime, W denotes the ring scheme of
p-typical Witt vectors, k is a perfect field of characteristic p and G is a
reductive group scheme over W(k). The present paper is an attempt to describe
which constructions carry over from the function field case to the p-adic case,
more precisely to the situation of the p-adic affine Grassmannian for the
special linear group G=SL_n. We start with a description of the R-valued points
of the p-adic affine Grassmannian for SL_n in terms of lattices over W(R),
where R is a perfect k-algebra. In order to obtain a link with geometry we
further construct projective k-subvarieties of the multigraded Hilbert scheme
which map equivariantly to the p-adic affine Grassmannian. The images of these
morphisms play the role of Schubert varieties in the p-adic setting. Further,
for any reduced k-algebra R these morphisms induce bijective maps between the
sets of R-valued points of the respective open orbits in the multigraded
Hilbert scheme and the corresponding Schubert cells of the p-adic affine
Grassmannian for SL_n.
