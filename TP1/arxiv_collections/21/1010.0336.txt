We study in this work the existence of minimizing solutions to the
critical-power type equation $\triangle_{\textbf{g}}u+h.u=f
.u^{\frac{n+2}{n-2}} $ on a compact riemannian manifold in the limit case
normally not solved by variational methods. For this purpose, we use a concept
of "critical function" that was originally introduced by E. Hebey and M. Vaugon
for the study of second best constant in the Sobolev embeddings. Along the way,
we prove an important estimate concerning concentration phenomena's when $f$ is
a non-constant function. We give here intuitive details.
