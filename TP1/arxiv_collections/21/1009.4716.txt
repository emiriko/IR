The all-particle energy spectrum as measured by the KASCADE-Grande experiment
for E = 10^{16} - 10^{18} eV is presented within the framework of the QGSJET
II/FLUKA hadronic interaction models. Three different methods were applied
based on the muon size and the total number of charged particles individually
and in combination. From the study it is found that the spectrum cannot be
completely described by a smooth power law due to the presence of
characteristic features.
