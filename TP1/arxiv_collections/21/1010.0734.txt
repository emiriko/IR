Experimental measurements of photoionization rates of $nD_{5/2}$ Rydberg
states of Cs ($50 \leq n \leq 75$) in a 1064 nm far off-resonance dipole trap
are presented. The photoionization rates are obtained by measuring the
lifetimes of Rydberg atoms produced inside of a 1064 nm far off-resonance trap
and comparing the lifetimes to corresponding control experiments in a
magneto-optical trap. Experimental results for the control experiments agree
with recent theoretical predictions for Rydberg state lifetimes and measured
photoionization rates are in agreement with transition rates calculated from a
model potential.
