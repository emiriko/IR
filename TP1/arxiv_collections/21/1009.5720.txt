In 1970, the Soviet Lunokhod 1 rover delivered a French-built laser reflector
to the Moon. Although a few range measurements were made within three months of
its landing, these measurements---and any that may have followed---are
unpublished and unavailable. The Lunokhod 1 reflector was, therefore,
effectively lost until March of 2010 when images from the Lunar Reconnaissance
Orbiter (LRO) provided a positive identification of the rover and determined
its coordinates with uncertainties of about 100 m. This allowed the Apache
Point Observatory Lunar Laser-ranging Operation (APOLLO) to quickly acquire a
laser signal. The reflector appears to be in excellent condition, delivering a
signal roughly four times stronger than its twin reflector on the Lunokhod 2
rover. The Lunokhod 1 reflector is especially valuable for science because it
is closer to the Moon's limb than any of the other reflectors and, unlike the
Lunokhod 2 reflector, we find that it is usable during the lunar day. We report
the selenographic position of the reflector to few-centimeter accuracy, comment
on the health of the reflector, and illustrate the value of this reflector for
achieving science goals.
