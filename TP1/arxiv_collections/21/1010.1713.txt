We present a scheme to realize a deterministic solid state source of time-bin
entangled photon pairs using cavity-assisted stimulated Raman adiabatic passage
(STIRAP) in a single quantum dot. The quantum dot is embedded inside a
semiconductor cavity, and the interaction of a coherent superposition of two
temporally separated input pulses and the cavity mode leads to a two-photon
Raman transition, which produces a time-bin entangled photon pair through the
biexciton-exciton cascade. We show that the entanglement of the generated state
can be measured using triple coincidence detection, and the degree of
entanglement is quantified as the visibility of the interference. We also
discuss the effect of pure dephasing on entanglement of the generated photon
pair. Pronounced interference visibility values of greater than $1/\sqrt{2}$
are demonstrated in triple coincidence measurement using experimentally
achievable parameters, thus demonstrating that the generated photons are
suitable for applications with Bell's inequality violation and quantum
cryptography.
