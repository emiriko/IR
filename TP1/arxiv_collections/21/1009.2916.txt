Cavity quantum electrodynamics describes the fundamental interactions between
light and matter, and how they can be controlled by shaping the local
environment. For example, optical microcavities allow high-efficiency detection
and manipulation of single atoms. In this regime fluctuations of atom number
are on the order of the mean number, which can lead to signal fluctuations in
excess of the noise on the incident probe field. Conversely, we demonstrate
that nonlinearities and multi-atom statistics can together serve to suppress
the effects of atomic fluctuations when making local density measurements on
clouds of cold atoms. We measure atom densities below 1 per cavity mode volume
near the photon shot-noise limit. This is in direct contrast to previous
experiments where fluctuations in atom number contribute significantly to the
noise. Atom detection is shown to be fast and efficient, reaching fidelities in
excess of 97% after 10 us and 99.9% after 30 us.
