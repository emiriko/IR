The Maxwell approach from electrostatics is applied for calculation of
transport coefficients in composites. The viscosity of a dilute emulsion is
obtained as a function of the volume fraction of dispersed phase. The derived
new formula is asymptotically correct and more general than the linear
relationships usually used. The method is applied also for description of the
influence of fluctuations on the transport coefficients.
