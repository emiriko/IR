Flares are dynamic events which involve rapid changes in coronal magnetic
topology end energy release. Even if they may be localized phenomena, the
magnetic disturbance at their origin may propagate and be effective in a larger
part of the active region. We investigate the temporal evolution of a flaring
active region with respect to the loops morphology, the temperature, and
emission measure distributions. We consider $Hinode/XRT$ data of a the 2006
November 12th C1.1 flare. We inspect the evolution of the morphology of the
flaring region also with the aid of TRACE data. XRT filter ratios are used to
derive temperature and emission measure maps and evolution. The analyzed flare
includes several brightenings. We identify a coherent sequence of tangled and
relaxed loop structures before, during, and after the brightenings. Although
the thermal information is incomplete because of pixel saturation at the flare
peak, thermal maps show fine, evolving spatial structuring. Temperature and
emission measure variations show up in great detail, and we are able to detect
a secondary heating of larger loops close to the proper flaring region. Finally
we estimate the amount of energy released in these flaring loops during the
flare decay.
