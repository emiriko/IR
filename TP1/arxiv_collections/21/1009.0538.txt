Direct imaging of exoplanets requires both high contrast and high spatial
resolution. Here, we present the first scientific results obtained with the
newly commissioned Apodizing Phase Plate coronagraph (APP) on VLT/NACO. We
detected the exoplanet beta Pictoris b in the narrow band filter centered at
4.05 micron (NB4.05). The position angle (209.13 +- 2.12 deg) and the projected
separation to its host star (0."354 +- 0".012, i.e., 6.8 +- 0.2 AU at a
distance of 19.3 pc) are in good agreement with the recently presented data
from Lagrange et al. (2010). Comparing the observed NB4.05 magnitude of 11.20
+- 0.23 mag to theoretical atmospheric models we find a best fit with a 7-10
M_Jupiter object for an age of 12 Myr, again in agreement with previous
estimates. Combining our results with published L' photometry we can compare
the planet's [L' - NB4.05] color to that of cool field dwarfs of higher surface
gravity suggesting an effective temperature of ~1700 K. The best fit
theoretical model predicts an effective temperature of ~1470 K, but this
difference is not significant given our photometric uncertainties. Our results
demonstrate the potential of NACO/APP for future planet searches and provides
independent confirmation as well as complementary data for beta Pictoris b.
