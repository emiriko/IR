Measurements of the flux densities of the extended components of seven giant
radio galaxies obtained using the RATAN-600 radio telescope at wavelengths of
6.25 and 13 cm ar e presented. The spectra of components of these radio
galaxies are constructed using these new RA TAN-600 data together with data
from the WENSS, NVSS, and GB6 surveys. The spectral indices in the stu died
frequency range are calculated, and the need for detailed estimates of the
integrated contributi on of such objects to the background emission is
demonstrated.
