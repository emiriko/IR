In this paper, we study face vectors of simplicial posets that are the face
posets of cell decompositions of topological manifolds without boundary. We
characterize all possible face vectors of simplicial posets whose geometric
realizations are homeomorphic to the product of spheres. As a corollary, we
obtain the characterization of face vectors of simplicial posets whose
geometric realizations are odd dimensional manifolds without boundary.
