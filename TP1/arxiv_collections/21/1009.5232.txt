The internal structure of self-interacting quantum particle like electron is
independent on space-time position. Then at least infinitesimal kinematic
space-time shift, rotation or boost lead to the equivalent internal quantum
state. This assumption may be treated as internal (quantum) formulation of the
inertia principle. Dynamical transformation of quantum setup generally leads to
deformation of internal quantum state and measure of this deformation may be
used as quantum counterpart of force instead of a macroscopic acceleration. The
reason of inertia arises, thereby, as a consequence an internal motion of
quantum state and its reaction on dynamical quantum setup deformation.
  The quantum origin of the inertia has been discussed in this article in the
framework of "eigen-dynamics" of self-interacting relativistic extended quantum
electron. Namely, a back reaction of spin and charge "fast" degrees of freedom
on "slow" driving environment during "virtual measurement" leads to the
appearance of state dependent non-Abelian gauge fields in dynamical 4D
space-time. Analysis of simplified dynamics has been applied to the
energy-momentum behavior in the relation with runaway solutions of previous
models of an electron.
