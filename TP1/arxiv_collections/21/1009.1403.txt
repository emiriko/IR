A general coherent control scenario to suppress, or accelerate, tunneling of
quantum states decaying into a continuum, is investigated. The method is based
on deterministic, or stochastic, sequences of unitary pulses that affect the
underlying interference phenomena responsible for quantum dynamics, without
inducing decoherence, or collapsing the coherent evolution of the system. The
influence of control sequences on the ensuing quantum dynamics is analyzed by
using perturbation theory to first order in the control pulse fields and
compared to dynamical decoupling (DD) protocols and sequences of pulses that
collapse the coherent evolution and induce quantum Zeno (QZE) or quantum
anti-Zeno effects (AZE). The analysis reveals a subtle interplay between
coherent and incoherent phenomena and demonstrating that dynamics analogous to
evolution due to QZE or AZE can be generated from stochastic sequences of
unitary pulses when averaged over all possible realizations.
