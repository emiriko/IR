We have carried out binocular rivalry experiments with a large number of
subjects to obtain high quality statistics on probability distribution of
dominance duration (PDDD) for two cases where (a) the rival stimulus is
continuously presented and (b) the rival stimulus is periodically removed, with
stimulus-on and stimulus-off intervals Ton and Toff respectively. It is shown
that the PDDD obtained for the latter case can be reproduced to a reasonable
degree of approximation by simply using the PDDD of part (a) and slicing it at
pieces of time extent Ton and by introducing intervals of length Toff between
the on-intervals where the PDDD is set to zero. This suggests that the
variables representing the perceptual state do not change significantly during
long blank intervals. We argue that these findings impose challenges to
theoretical models which aim at describing visual perception.
