We demonstrate the control of the hole concentration in Ga1-xMnxP over a wide
range by introducing compensating vacancies. The resulting evolution of the
Curie temperature from 51 K to 7.5 K is remarkably similar to that observed in
Ga1-xMnxAs despite the dramatically different character of hole transport
between the two material systems. The highly localized nature of holes in
Ga1-xMnxP is reflected in the accompanying increase in resistivity by many
orders of magnitude. Based on variable-temperature resistivity data we present
a general picture for hole conduction in which variable-range hopping is the
dominant transport mechanism in the presence of compensation.
