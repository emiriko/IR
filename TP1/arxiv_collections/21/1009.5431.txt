An one-dimensional finite element model of a sandwich panel with insert is
derived using the approach used in the Thomsen model. The one-dimensional model
produces results that are close to those of a two-dimensional axisysmmetric
model. Both models assume that the core is homogeneous. Our results indicate
that the one-dimensional model may be well suited for small deformations of
sandwich specimens with foam cores.
