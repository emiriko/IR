To illustrate the general results of the previous paper, we discuss here a
large concrete example of the orbifold-string theories of permutation-type. For
each of the many subexamples, we focus on evaluation of the \emph{target
space-time dimension} $\hat{D}_j(\sigma)$, the \emph{target space-time
signature} and the \emph{target space-time symmetry} of each cycle $j$ in each
twisted sector $\sigma$. We find in particular a gratifying \emph{space-time
symmetry enhancement} which naturally matches the space-time symmetry of each
cycle to its space-time dimension. Although the orbifolds of
$\Z_{2}$-permutation-type are naturally Lorentzian, we find that the target
space-times associated to larger permutation groups can be Lorentzian,
Euclidean and even null (\hat{D}_{j}(\sigma)=0), with varying space-time
dimensions, signature and symmetry in a single orbifold.
