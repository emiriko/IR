We present the equations of motion for multiple M0-brane (mM0) system in an
arbitrary curved supergravity superspace which generalizes the M(atrix) model
equations for the case of arbitrary supergravity background. Although these
were obtained in the frame of superembedding approach to mM0, we do not make a
review of this approach in this contribution but concentrate discussion on the
structure of the equations.
