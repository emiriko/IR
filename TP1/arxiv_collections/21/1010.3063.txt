The activity of collections of synchronizing neurons can be represented by
weakly coupled nonlinear phase oscillators satisfying Kuramoto's equations. In
this article, we build such neural-oscillator models, partly based on
neurophysiological evidence, to represent approximately the learning behavior
predicted and confirmed in three experiments by well-known stochastic learning
models of behavioral stimulus-response theory. We use three Kuramoto
oscillators to model a continuum of responses, and we provide detailed
numerical simulations and analysis of the three-oscillator Kuramoto problem,
including an analysis of the stability points for different coupling
conditions. We show that the oscillator simulation data are well-matched to the
behavioral data of the three experiments.
