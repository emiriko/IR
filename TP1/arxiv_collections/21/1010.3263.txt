The state complexity of a regular language is the number of states in the
minimal deterministic automaton accepting the language. The syntactic
complexity of a regular language is the cardinality of its syntactic semigroup.
The syntactic complexity of a subclass of regular languages is the worst-case
syntactic complexity taken as a function of the state complexity $n$ of
languages in that class. We study the syntactic complexity of the class of
regular ideal languages and their complements, the closed languages. We prove
that $n^{n-1}$ is a tight upper bound on the complexity of right ideals and
prefix-closed languages, and that there exist left ideals and suffix-closed
languages of syntactic complexity $n^{n-1}+n-1$, and two-sided ideals and
factor-closed languages of syntactic complexity $n^{n-2}+(n-2)2^{n-2}+1$.
