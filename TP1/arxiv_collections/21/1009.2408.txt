Marcella [arXiv:quant-ph/0703126] has presented a straightforward technique
employing the Dirac formalism to calculate single- and double-slit interference
patterns. He claims that no reference is made to classical optics or scattering
theory and that his method therefore provides a purely quantum mechanical
description of these experiments. He also presents his calculation as if no
approximations are employed. We show that he implicitly makes the same
approximations found in classical treatments of interference and that no new
physics has been introduced. At the same time, some of the quantum mechanical
arguments Marcella gives are, at best, misleading.
