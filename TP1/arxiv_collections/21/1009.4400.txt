We refine HO/N game semantics with an additional notion of pointer
(mu-pointers) and extend it to first-order classical logic with completeness
results. We use a Church style extension of Parigot's lambda-mu-calculus to
represent proofs of first-order classical logic. We present some relations with
Krivine's classical realizability and applications to type isomorphisms.
