This correspondence presents an efficient method for reconstructing a
band-limited signal in the discrete domain from its crossings with a sine wave.
The method makes it possible to design A/D converters that only deliver the
crossing timings, which are then used to interpolate the input signal at
arbitrary instants. Potentially, it may allow for reductions in power
consumption and complexity in these converters. The reconstruction in the
discrete domain is based on a recently-proposed modification of the Lagrange
interpolator, which is readily implementable with linear complexity and
efficiently, given that it re-uses known schemes for variable fractional-delay
(VFD) filters. As a spin-off, the method allows one to perform spectral
analysis from sine wave crossings with the complexity of the FFT. Finally, the
results in the correspondence are validated in several numerical examples.
