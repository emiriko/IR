We investigate the mechanisms responsible for the low-frequency noise in
liquid-gated nano-scale silicon nanowire field-effect transistors (SiNW-FETs)
and show that the charge-noise level is lower than elementary charge. Our
measurements also show that ionic strength of the surrounding electrolyte has a
minimal effect on the overall noise. Dielectric polarization noise seems to be
at the origin of the 1/f noise in our devices. The estimated spectral density
of charge noise Sq = 1.6x10-2 e/sqr(Hz) at 10 Hz opens the door to metrological
studies with these SiNW-FETs for the electrical detection of a small number of
molecules.
