We calculate the probability of the birth of a circular phonon (c-phonon) in
He II by a c-photon of the resonator. It is shown that this probability has
sharp maxima at frequencies, where the effective group velocity of the c-phonon
is equal to zero; the density of states of c-phonons strongly grows at such
frequencies. For He II, these frequencies correspond to a roton and a maxon.
From the probability of the c-roton birth, we calculate the roto line width
which is found to approximately agree with the experimental one. We conclude
that the roton line observed in the super-high-frequency (SHF) absorption
spectrum of helium is related to the birth of c-rotons. A possible
interpretation of the Stark effect observed for the roton line is also
proposed.
