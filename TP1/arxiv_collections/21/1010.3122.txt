Photometric follow-ups of transiting exoplanets (TEPs) may lead to
discoveries of additional, less massive bodies in extrasolar systems. This is
possible by detecting and then analysing variations in transit timing of
transiting exoplanets. In 2009 we launched an international observing campaign,
the aim of which is to detect and characterise signals of transit timing
variation (TTV) in selected TEPs. The programme is realised by collecting data
from 0.6--2.2-m telescopes spread worldwide at different longitudes. We present
our observing strategy and summarise first results for WASP-3b with evidence
for a 15 Earth-mass perturber in an outer 2:1 orbital resonance.
