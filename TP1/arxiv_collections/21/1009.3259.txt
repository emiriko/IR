We present ground-based high resolution N-band spectra (\Delta v = 15 km/s)
of pure rotational lines of water vapor in two protoplanetary disks surrounding
the pre-main sequence stars AS 205N and RNO 90, selected based on detections of
rotational water lines by the Spitzer IRS. Using VISIR on the Very Large
Telescope, we spectrally resolve individual lines and show that they have
widths of 30-60 km/s, consistent with an origin in Keplerian disks at radii of
~1 AU. The water lines have similar widths to those of the CO at 4.67 micron,
indicating that the mid-infrared water lines trace similar radii. The
rotational temperatures of the water are 540 and 600K in the two disks,
respectively. However, the lines ratios show evidence of non-LTE excitation,
with low-excitation line fluxes being over-predicted by 2-dimensional disk LTE
models. Due to the limited number of observed lines and the non-LTE line
ratios, an accurate measure of the water ortho/para ratio is not available, but
a best estimate for AS 205N is ortho/para = 4.5 +/- 1.0, apparently ruling out
a low-temperature origin of the water. The spectra demonstrate that high
resolution spectroscopy of rotational water lines is feasible from the ground,
and further that ground-based high resolution spectroscopy is likely to
significantly improve our understanding of the inner disk chemistry recently
revealed by recent Spitzer observations.
