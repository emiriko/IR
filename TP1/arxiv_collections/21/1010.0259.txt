Thermodynamics, the branch of physics concerned with the description of
macroscopic bodies, heat exchange and the conversion of different forms of
energy is based on four laws: the zeroth law, which states that bodies in
thermal contact reach a state of thermal equilibrium, the first law, which
postulates the energy conservation and establishes the way in which different
forms of energy transform into each-other, the second law, which states that
the entropy increases or stays constant in time in any isolated system, and,
finally, the third law (or Nernst postulate), which states that the entropy of
any system approaches a constant minimum when temperature approaches 0 K. One
of the direct consequences of the third law is that the specific heat of any
system converges to zero when its temperature decreases to zero Kelvins. Here
we show that the third law is violated in a wide class of fermionic systems, by
calculating the specific heat and showing that it diverges to infinity when the
absolute zero temperature is approached. Until now, no exception to these four
laws is know in physics. These findings ask for the revision of one of the most
fundamental laws of nature.
