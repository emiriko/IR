Several phenomenologically viable walking technicolor models have been
proposed recently. I demonstrate that these models can have first order
electroweak phase transitions, which are sufficiently strong for electroweak
baryogenesis. Strong dynamics can also lead to several separate transitions at
the electroweak scale, with the possibility of a temporary restoration and an
extra breaking of the electroweak symmetry. First order phase transitions will
produce gravitational waves, which may be detectable at future experiments.
