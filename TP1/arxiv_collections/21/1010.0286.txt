We give a criterion for a projective surface to become a quotient of a fake
projective plane. We also give a detailed information on the elliptic fibration
of a $(2,3)$-elliptic surface that is the minimal resolution of a quotient of a
fake projective plane. As a consequence, we give a classification of ${\mathbb
Q}$-homology projective planes with cusps only.
