We consider star polymers, consisting of two different polymer species, in a
solvent subject to quenched correlated structural obstacles. We assume that the
disorder is correlated with a power-law decay of the pair correlation function
g(x)\sim x^{-a}. Applying the field-theoretical renormalization group approach
in d dimensions, we analyze different scenarios of scaling behavior working to
first order of a double \epsilon=4-d, \delta=4-a expansion. We discuss the
influence of the correlated disorder on the resulting scaling laws and possible
manifestations such as diffusion controlled reactions in the vicinity of
absorbing traps placed on polymers as well as the effective short-distance
interaction between star copolymers.
