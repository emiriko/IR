Let $\{M_i\}_{i=1}^\ell$ be a non-trivial family of $d\times d$ complex
matrices, in the sense that for any $n\in \N$, there exists $i_1... i_n\in
\{1,..., \ell\}^n$ such that $M_{i_1}... M_{i_n}\neq {\bf 0}$. Let $P \colon
(0,\infty)\to \R$ be the pressure function of $\{M_i\}_{i=1}^\ell$. We show
that for each $q>0$, there are at most $d$ ergodic $q$-equilibrium states of
$P$, and each of them satisfies certain Gibbs property.
