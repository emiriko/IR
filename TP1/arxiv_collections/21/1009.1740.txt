Dynamical instabilities at the interface between two Bose--Einstein
condensates that are moving relative to each other are investigated using
mean-field and Bogoliubov analyses. Kelvin--Helmholtz instability is dominant
when the interface thickness is much smaller than the wavelength of the
unstable interface mode, whereas the counter-superflow instability becomes
dominant in the opposite case. These instabilities emerge not only in an
immiscible system but also in a miscible system where an interface is produced
by external potential. Dynamics caused by these instabilities are numerically
demonstrated in rotating trapped condensates.
