Recent infrared spectroscopic observations have shown that proto-planetary
nebulae (PPNs) are sites of active synthesis of organic compounds in the late
stages of stellar evolution. This paper presents a study of Spitzer/IRS spectra
for a sample of carbon-rich PPNs, all except one of which show the unidentified
21 micron emission feature. The strengths of the aromatic infrared band (AIB),
21 micron, and 30 micron features are obtained by decomposition of the spectra.
The observed variations in the strengths and peak wavelengths of the features
support the model that the newly synthesized organic compounds gradually change
from aliphatic to aromatic characteristics as stars evolve from PPNs to
planetary nebulae.
