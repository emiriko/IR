Over 800 sq. deg. of high Galactic latitude sky have been mapped at 21 cm
with the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope (GBT). An improved knowledge of
the telescope's beam characteristics has allowed us to reliably map not only
regions of high column density, but also such regions as ELAIS N1, a targeted
Spitzer field, which have very low HI column density. The additional fields we
have observed cover a cross-section of dynamically and chemically interesting
regions as indicated by the presence of intermediate/high velocity gas and/or
anomalous far-IR (dust) colour.
