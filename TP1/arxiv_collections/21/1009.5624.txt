A new method is presented for the quantitative measurement of charge
separation about the reaction plane. A correlation function is obtained whose
shape is concave when there is a net separation of positive and negative
charges. Correlations not specifically associated with charge, from flow, jets
and momentum conservation, do not influence the shape or magnitude of the
correlation function. Detailed simulations are used to demonstrate the
effectiveness of the method for the quantitative measurement of charge
separation. Such measurements are a pre-requisite to the investigation of
topological charge effects in the QGP as derived from the "strong $\cal{CP}$
problem".
