We formulate the theory of electron transport through coupled-quantum dots by
extending the auxiliary operator representation. By using the generating
functional technique, we derive the exact expressions for currents,
dot-occupation numbers and spin correlations, and examine them based on the
non-equilibrium Green's function method under the non-crossing approximation
(NCA). Our formulation generalizes the previous NCA approaches by allowing full
occupation numbers with a finite Coulomb repulsion.
