The generalized second-order partial derivatives of 1/r, where r is the
radial distance in 3D, are obtained using a result of the potential theory of
classical analysis. Some non-spherical regularization alternatives to the
standard spherical-regularization expression for the derivatives are derived.
The utility of a spheroidal-regularization expression is illustrated on an
example from classical electrodynamics.
