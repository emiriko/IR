A Fermiophobic Higgs boson can arise in models with an extended Higgs sector,
such as models with scalars in an isospin triplet representation. In a specific
model with a scalar triplet and spontaneous violation of lepton number induced
by a scalar singlet field, we show that fermiophobia is not a fine-tuned
situation, unlike in Two Higgs Doublet Models. We study distinctive signals of
fermiophobia which can be probed at the LHC. For the case of a small Higgs mass
a characteristic signal would be a moderate B(H ->\gamma\gamma) accompanied by
a large B(H -> JJ) (where J is a Majoron), the latter being an invisible decay.
For the case of a large Higgs mass there is the possibility of dominant H ->
ZZ, WW and suppressed H -> JJ decay modes. In this situation, B(H -> ZZ) is
larger than B(H -> WW), which differs from the SM prediction.
