Virtualization has rapidly become a go-to technology for increasing
efficiency in the data center. With virtualization technologies providing
tremendous flexibility, even disparate architectures may be deployed on a
single machine without interference. Awareness of limitations and requirements
of physical hosts to be used for virtualization is important. This paper
reviews the present virtualization methods, virtual computing software, and
provides a brief analysis of the performance issues inherent to each. In the
end we present testing results of KVM-QEMU on two current Multi-Core CPU
Architectures and System Configurations.
