Reduction-oxidation (redox) reactions of the redox couples An(VI)/An(V),
An(V)/An(IV), and An(IV)/An(III), where An is an element in the family of early
actinides (U, Np, and Pu), as well as Am(VI)/Am(V) and Am(V)/Am(III), are
modeled by combining density functional theory with a generalized Anderson
impurity model that accounts for the strong correlations between the 5f
electrons. Diagonalization of the Anderson impurity model yields improved
estimates for the redox potentials and the propensity of the actinide complexes
to disproportionate.
