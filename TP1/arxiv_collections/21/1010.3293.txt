We present a hybrid microtextured surface with heterogeneous
hydrophilic-hydrophobic regions for condensing water vapor while maintaining
anti-wetting behavior. Fluid dynamics videos are shown demonstrating the
difference between condensation on a homogeneous hydrophobic structure and the
same structure with hybrid wetting regions.
