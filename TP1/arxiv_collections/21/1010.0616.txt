This online supplement mainly presents the details of empirical
investigations of so-called "cooperation sharing" distributions in 12 real
world cooperation-competition systems, which will be used for building an
evolution model that will be reported elsewhere. All the distributions obey a
function form P(\omega)(\omega+\alpha)^(gamma). The heterogeneities of the
cooperation sharing distributions in different systems can be described by two
distribution parameters,\alpha and \gamma. The empirically determined system
evolution durations are also presented.
