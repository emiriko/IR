Spectroscopy results for Belle and BaBar are reported. A particular focus is
put on new results of the X(3872) state with its radiative decays to
$J$/$\psi$$\gamma$ and $\psi'$$\gamma$, its decay into $J$/$\psi$3$\pi$ and the
search for production in radiative Upsilon decays. Another focus is $L$=2
mesons, in particlar a possible $D$-wave assignment to the X(3872) and the
confirmation of an Upsilon $D$-wave state.
