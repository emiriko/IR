We introduce a new cascaded four-wave mixing technique which scales up the
bandwidth of frequency combs generated by phase modulation of a continuous wave
laser while simultaneously enhancing the spectral flatness. As a result we
demonstrate a 10 GHz frequency comb with over 100 lines in a 10-dB bandwidth in
which a record 75 lines are within a flatness of 1-dB. The cascaded four-wave
mixing process increases the bandwidth of the initial comb generated by
modulation of a CW laser by a factor of five. The broadband comb has
approximately quadratic spectral phase, which is compensated upon propagation
in single mode fiber, resulting in a 10 GHz train of 940 fs pulses
