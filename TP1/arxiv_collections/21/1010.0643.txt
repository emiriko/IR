Solar coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are the most significant drivers of
adverse space weather at Earth, but the physics governing their propagation
through the heliosphere is not well understood. While stereoscopic imaging of
CMEs with the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) has provided
some insight into their three-dimensional (3D) propagation, the mechanisms
governing their evolution remain unclear due to difficulties in reconstructing
their true 3D structure. Here we use a new elliptical tie-pointing technique to
reconstruct a full CME front in 3D, enabling us to quantify its deflected
trajectory from high latitudes along the ecliptic, and measure its increasing
angular width and propagation from 2-46 solar radii (approximately 0.2 AU).
Beyond 7 solar radii, we show that its motion is determined by an aerodynamic
drag in the solar wind and, using our reconstruction as input for a 3D
magnetohydrodynamic simulation, we determine an accurate arrival time at the
Lagrangian L1 point near Earth.
