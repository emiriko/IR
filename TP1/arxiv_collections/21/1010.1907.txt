We find a transformation which relates a new third-order integrable nonlinear
evolution equation, introduced recently by Qiao, with the well-known modified
Korteweg - de Vries equation. Then we use this transformation to derive smooth
soliton solutions of the new equation from the known rational and soliton
solutions of the old one.
