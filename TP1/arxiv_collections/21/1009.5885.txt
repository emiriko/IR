We present an analysis of small-scale, periodic, solar-wind density
enhancements (length-scales as small as \approx 1000 Mm) observed in images
from the Heliospheric Imager (HI) aboard STEREO A. We discuss their possible
relationship to periodic fluctuations of the proton density that have been
identified at 1 AU using in-situ plasma measurements. Specifically, Viall,
Kepko, and Spence (2008) examined 11 years of in-situ solar-wind density
measurements at 1 AU and demonstrated that not only turbulent structures, but
also non-turbulent periodic density structures exist in the solar wind with
scale sizes of hundreds to one thousand Mm. In a subsequent paper, Viall,
Spence, and Kasper (2009) analyzed the {\alpha} to proton solar-wind abundance
ratio measured during one such event of periodic density structures,
demonstrating that the plasma behavior was highly suggestive that either
temporally or spatially varying coronal source plasma created those density
structures. Large periodic density structures observed at 1 AU, which were
generated in the corona, can be observable in coronal and heliospheric
white-light images if they possess sufficiently high density contrast. Indeed,
we identify such periodic density structures as they enter the HI field of view
and follow them as they advect with the solar wind through the images. The
smaller periodic density structures that we identify in the images are
comparable in size to the larger structures analyzed in-situ at 1 AU, yielding
further evidence that periodic density enhancements are a consequence of
coronal activity as the solar wind is formed.
