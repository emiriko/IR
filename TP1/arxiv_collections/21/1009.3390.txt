Monte-Carlo generator with photon jets radiation in collinear regions for the
process \eegg is described in detail. Radiative corrections in the first order
of $\alpha$ are treated exactly. Large leading logarithmic corrections coming
from collinear regions are taken into account in all orders of $\alpha$ by
applying the Structure Function approach. Theoretical precision of the cross
section with radiative corrections is estimated to be 0.2%. This process is
considered as an additional tool to measure luminosity in forthcoming
experiments with the CMD-3 detector at the $e^+e^-$ collider VEPP-2000.
