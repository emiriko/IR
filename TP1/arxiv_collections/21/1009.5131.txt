Space-based projects are providing a wealth of high-quality asteroseismic
data, including frequencies for a large number of stars showing solar-like
oscillations. These data open the prospect for precise determinations of key
stellar parameters, of particular value to the study of extra-solar planetary
systems. Given the quantity of the available and expected data it is important
to develop efficient and reliable techniques for analyzing them, including the
determination of stellar parameters from the observed frequencies. Here we
present the SEEK package developed for the analysis of asteroseismic data from
the Kepler mission. A central goal of the package is to obtain a fast and
automatic determination of the stellar radius and other parameters, in a form
that is statistically well-defined. The algorithms are tested by comparing the
results of the analysis with independent measurements of stellar radius and
mass, for a sample of well-observed stars. We conclude that the SEEK package
fixes stellar parameters with accuracy and precision.
