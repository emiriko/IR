We present a reduction method for Wilson Dirac fermions with non-zero
chemical potential which generates a dimensionally reduced fermion matrix. The
size of the reduced fermion matrix is independent of the temporal lattice
extent and the dependence on the chemical potential is factored out. As a
consequence the reduced matrix allows a simple evaluation of the Wilson fermion
determinant for any value of the chemical potential and hence the exact
projection to the canonical partition functions.
