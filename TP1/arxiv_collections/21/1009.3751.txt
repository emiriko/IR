Many communication channels with discrete input have non-uniform capacity
achieving probability mass functions (PMF). By parsing a stream of independent
and equiprobable bits according to a full prefix-free code, a modu-lator can
generate dyadic PMFs at the channel input. In this work, we show that for
discrete memoryless channels and for memoryless discrete noiseless channels,
searching for good dyadic input PMFs is equivalent to minimizing the
Kullback-Leibler distance between a dyadic PMF and a weighted version of the
capacity achieving PMF. We define a new algorithm called Geometric Huffman
Coding (GHC) and prove that GHC finds the optimal dyadic PMF in O(m \log m)
steps where m is the number of input symbols of the considered channel.
Furthermore, we prove that by generating dyadic PMFs of blocks of consecutive
input symbols, GHC achieves capacity when the block length goes to infinity.
