We investigate theoretically the adhesion and electronic properties of
graphene on a muscovite mica surface using the density functional theory (DFT)
with van der Waals (vdW) interactions taken into account (the vdW-DF approach).
We found that irregularities in the local structure of cleaved mica surface
provide different mechanisms for the mica-graphene binding. By assuming
electroneutrality for both surfaces, the binding is mainly of vdW nature,
barely exceeding thermal energy per carbon atom at room temperature. In
contrast, if potassium atoms are non uniformly distributed on mica, the
different regions of the surface give rise to $n$- or $p$-type doping of
graphene. In turn, an additional interaction arises between the surfaces,
significantly increasing the adhesion. For each case the electronic states of
graphene remain unaltered by the adhesion. It is expected, however, that the
Fermi level of graphene supported on realistic mica could be shifted relative
to the Dirac point due to asymmetry in the charge doping. Obtained variations
of the distance between graphene and mica for different regions of the surface
are found to be consistent with recent atomic force microscopy experiments. A
relative flatness of mica and the absence of interlayer covalent bonding in the
mica-graphene system make this pair a promising candidate for practical use.
