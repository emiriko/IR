We predict spontaneous nematic order in an ensemble of active force
generators with elastic interactions as a minimal model for early nematic
alignment of short stress fibers in non-motile, adhered cells. Mean-field
theory is formally equivalent to Maier-Saupe theory for a nematic liquid.
However, the elastic interactions are long-ranged (and thus depend on cell
shape and matrix elasticity) and originate in cell activity. Depending on the
density of force generators, we find two regimes of cellular rigidity sensing
for which orientational, nematic order of stress fibers depends on matrix
rigidity either in a step-like manner or with a maximum at an optimal rigidity.
