Type-I matrices were introduced recently as finite dimensional prototypes of
quantum integrable systems. These matrices are linearly dependent on an
"interaction" type parameter, and possess interesting properties such as
commuting partner matrices and generically violate the von Neumann Wigner non
crossing rule. The important role of Pl\"ucker relations in this construction
is noted.
  Type-I matrices are given a transparent formulation in terms of Fermi or Bose
type particle operators- they represent a Quantum glass model with either Fermi
or Bose statistics, with several free parameters that may be chosen at will.
