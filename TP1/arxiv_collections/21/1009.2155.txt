We report on the detection with the MAGIC telescopes of very high energy
gamma-rays from IC 310, a head-tail radio galaxy in the Perseus galaxy cluster,
observed during the interval November 2008 to February 2010. The Fermi
satellite has also detected this galaxy. The source is detected by MAGIC at a
high statistical significance of 7.6sigma in 20.6 hr of stereo data. The
observed spectral energy distribution is flat with a differential spectral
index of -2.00 \pm 0.14. The mean flux above 300 GeV, between October 2009 and
February 2010, (3.1 \pm 0.5)x10^{-12} cm^{-2} s^{-1}, corresponds to (2.5 \pm
0.4)% of Crab Nebula units. Only an upper limit, of 1.9% of Crab Nebula units
above 300 GeV, was obtained with the 2008 data. This, together with strong
hints (>3sigma) of flares in the middle of October and November 2009, implies
that the emission is variable. The MAGIC results favour a scenario with the
very high energy emission originating from the inner jet close to the central
engine. More complicated models than a simple one-zone SSC scenario, e.g.
multi-zone SSC, external Compton or hadronic, may be required to explain the
very flat spectrum and its extension over more than three orders of magnitude
in energy.
