Generally there are two strategies in fitting the measured structural
relaxation time of glass-forming liquids: the single-formula approach e.g. the
Vogel-Tammann-Fulcher equation,and the multi-branch approach. In this note, a
two-branch method was presented. By analyzing existing single- and multi-branch
approaches, I am trying to recall the attention of researchers in this field to
the possibilities of the multi-branch approach.
