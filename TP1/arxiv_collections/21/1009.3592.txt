The type III observations trace the propagation of energetic electron
populations through the Solar Corona which, more often than not, precede or are
associated with energy release on the Sun. A sample of Type III bursts in the
range 20-650 MHz during the period of extraordinary solar activity (20 October
to 4 November 2003) recorded by the ARTEMIS-IV1 radio spectrograph is analysed;
its parameters are compared with characteristics of associated flares (Ha and
GOES SXR) and CMEs, observed in the same period and reported in the SGR and the
LASCO archives respectively. In this report we attempt to establish a
correlation between energetic particles and major manifestations of solar
activity such as flares and CMEs.
