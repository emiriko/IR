The line driven- and rotation modulated-wind theory predicts an alternative
slow solution, besides from the standard m-CAK solution, when the rotational
velocity is close to the critical velocity. We study the behaviour of the winds
of A-type supergiants (Asg) and show that under particular conditions, e.g.,
when the \delta line-force parameter is about 0.25, the slow solution could
exist over the whole star, even for the cases when the rotational speed is slow
or zero. We discuss density and velocity profiles as well as possible
observational counterparts.
