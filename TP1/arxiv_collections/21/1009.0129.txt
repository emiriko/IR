A detailed derivation of the Lattice Boltzmann (LB) scheme for relativistic
fluids recently proposed in Ref. [1], is presented. The method is numerically
validated and applied to the case of two quite different relativistic fluid
dynamic problems, namely shock-wave propagation in quark-gluon plasmas and the
impact of a supernova blast-wave on massive interstellar clouds. Close to
second order convergence with the grid resolution, as well as linear dependence
of computational time on the number of grid points and time-steps, are
reported.
