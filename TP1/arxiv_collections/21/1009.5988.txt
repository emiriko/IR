We analyze the impact of Fermi gamma-ray observations (primarily
non-detections) of selected nearby galaxies, including dwarf spheroidals, and
of clusters of galaxies on decaying dark matter models. We show that the fact
that galaxy clusters do not shine in gamma rays puts the most stringent limits
available to-date on the lifetime of dark matter particles for a wide range of
particle masses and decay final states. In particular, our results put strong
constraints on the possibility of ascribing to decaying dark matter both the
increasing positron fraction reported by PAMELA and the high-energy feature in
the electron-positron spectrum measured by Fermi. Observations of nearby dwarf
galaxies and of the Andromeda Galaxy (M31) do not provide as strong limits as
those from galaxy clusters, while still improving on previous constraints in
some cases.
