In this article we present a general security strategy for quantum secret
sharing (QSS) protocols based on the HBB scheme presented by Hillery, Bu\v{z}ek
and Berthiaume [Phys. Rev A \textbf{59}, 1829 (1999)]. We focus on a
generalization of the HBB protocol to $n$ communication parties thus including
$n$-partite GHZ states. We show that the multipartite version of the HBB scheme
is insecure in certain settings and impractical when going to large $n$. To
provide security for such QSS schemes in general we use the framework presented
by some of the authors [M. Huber, F. Minert, A. Gabriel, B. C. Hiesmayr, Phys.
Rev. Lett. \textbf{104}, 210501 (2010)] to detect certain genuine $n$ partite
entanglement between the communication parties. In particular, we present a
simple inequality which tests the security.
