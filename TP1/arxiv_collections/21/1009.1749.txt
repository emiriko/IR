The usual formulation of Macrorealism is recast to make this notion fully
concurrent with the basic ideas behind classical physics. The assumption of
non-invasiveness of measurements is dropped. Instead, it is assumed that the
current state of the system defines full initial conditions for its subsequent
evolution. An example of a new family of temporal Bell inequalities is derived
which can be applied to processes in which the state of the system undergoes
arbitrarily many transformations (which was not the case in the original
approach). An exponential (in terms of number of operations) violation of this
inequality is demonstrated theoretically. Finally it is shown that such
inequalities were indirectly tested in a 2005 experiment by the Weinfurter
group.
