We present cluster decay studies of $^{56}$Ni$^*$ formed in heavy-ion
collisions using different Skyrme forces. Our study reveals that different
Skyrme forces do not alter the transfer structure of fractional yields
significantly. The cluster decay half-lives of different clusters lies within
\pm 10% for PCM and \pm 15% for UFM.
