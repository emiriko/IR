Wiesner's quantum money [5] is a simple, information-theoretically secure
quantum cryptographic protocol. In his protocol, a mint issues quantum bills
and anyone can query the mint to authenticate a bill. If the mint returns bogus
bills when it is asked to authenticate them, then the protocol can be broken in
linear time.
