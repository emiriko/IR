Electrocouplings of excited proton states with masses less than 1.8 GeV were
determined for the first time from the CLAS data on $\pi^+\pi^-p$
electroproduction at photon virtualities $Q^2$ $<$ 1.5 GeV$^2$.
Electrocouplings were obtained from a combined fit of all available observables
within the framework of a phenomenological reaction model.
