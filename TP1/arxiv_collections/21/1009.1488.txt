Based on ab-initio molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate the low
temperature crystal structure of Li2NH which in spite of its great interest as
H-storage material is still matter of debate. The dynamical simulations reveal
a precise correlation in the fractional occupation of Li sites which leads
average atomic positions in excellent agreement with diffraction data and
solves inconsistencies of previous proposals.
