The radioactive contamination of ZnWO4 crystal scintillators has been
measured deep underground at the Gran Sasso National Laboratory (LNGS) of the
INFN in Italy with a total exposure 3197 kg x h. Monte Carlo simulation,
time-amplitude and pulse-shape analyses of the data have been applied to
estimate the radioactive contamination of the ZnWO4 samples. One of the ZnWO4
crystals has also been tested by ultra-low background gamma spectrometry. The
radioactive contaminations of the ZnWO4 samples do not exceed 0.002 -- 0.8
mBq/kg (depending on the radionuclide), the total alpha activity is in the
range: 0.2 - 2 mBq/kg. Particular radioactivity, beta active 65Zn and alpha
active 180W, has been detected. The effect of the re-crystallization on the
radiopurity of the ZnWO4 crystal has been studied. The radioactive
contamination of samples of the ceramic details of the set-ups used in the
crystals growth has been checked by low background gamma spectrometry. A
project scheme on further improvement of the radiopurity level of the ZnWO4
crystal scintillators is briefly addressed.
