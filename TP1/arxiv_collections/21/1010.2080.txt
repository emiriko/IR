We methodically model the broad-band Suzaku spectra of a small sample of six
'bare' Seyfert galaxies: Ark 120, Fairall 9, MCG-02-14-009, Mrk 335, NGC 7469
and SWIFT J2127.4+5654. The analysis of bare Seyferts allows a consistent and
physical modelling of AGN due to a weak amount of any intrinsic warm
absorption, removing the degeneracy between the spectral curvature due to warm
absorption and the red-wing of the Fe K region. Through effective modelling of
the broad-band spectrum and investigating the presence of narrow neutral or
ionized emission lines and reflection from distant material, we obtain an
accurate and detailed description of the Fe K line region using models such as
laor, kerrdisk and kerrconv.
  Results suggest that ionized emission lines at 6.7 keV and 6.97 keV
(particularly Fe XXVI) are relatively common and the inclusion of these lines
can greatly affect the parameters obtained with relativistic models i.e. spin,
emissivity, inner radius of emission and inclination. Moderately broad
components are found in all objects, but typically the emission originates from
tens of Rg, rather than within <6Rg of the black hole. Results obtained with
kerrdisk line profiles suggest an average emissivity of q~2.3 at intermediate
spin values with all objects ruling out the presence of a maximally spinning
black hole at the 90% confidence level. We also present new spin constraints
for Mrk 335 and NGC 7469 with intermediate values of a=0.70(+0.12,-0.01) and
a=0.69(+0.09,-0.09) respectively.
