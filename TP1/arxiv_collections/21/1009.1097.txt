In certain scenarios of deformed relativistic symmetries relevant for
non-commutative field theories particles exhibit a momentum space described by
a non-abelian group manifold. Starting with a formulation of phase space for
such particles which allows for a generalization to include group valued
momenta we discuss quantization of the corresponding field theory. Focusing on
the particular case of kappa-deformed phase space we construct the one-particle
Hilbert space and show how curvature in momentum space leads to an ambiguity in
the quantization procedure reminiscent of the ambiguities one finds when
quantizing fields in curved space-times. The tools gathered in the discussion
on quantization allow for a clear definition of the basic deformed field mode
operators and two-point function for kappa-quantum fields.
