A (q,k,t)-design matrix is an m x n matrix whose pattern of zeros/non-zeros
satisfies the following design-like condition: each row has at most q
non-zeros, each column has at least k non-zeros and the supports of every two
columns intersect in at most t rows. We prove that the rank of any
(q,k,t)-design matrix over a field of characteristic zero (or sufficiently
large finite characteristic) is at least n - (qtn/2k)^2 . Using this result we
derive the following applications:
  (1) Impossibility results for 2-query LCCs over the complex numbers: A
2-query locally correctable code (LCC) is an error correcting code in which
every codeword coordinate can be recovered, probabilistically, by reading at
most two other code positions. Such codes have numerous applications and
constructions (with exponential encoding length) are known over finite fields
of small characteristic. We show that infinite families of such linear 2-query
LCCs do not exist over the complex numbers.
  (2) Generalization of results in combinatorial geometry: We prove a
quantitative analog of the Sylvester-Gallai theorem: Let $v_1,...,v_m$ be a set
of points in $\C^d$ such that for every $i \in [m]$ there exists at least
$\delta m$ values of $j \in [m]$ such that the line through $v_i,v_j$ contains
a third point in the set. We show that the dimension of $\{v_1,...,v_m \}$ is
at most $O(1/\delta^2)$. Our results generalize to the high dimensional case
(replacing lines with planes, etc.) and to the case where the points are
colored (as in the Motzkin-Rabin Theorem).
