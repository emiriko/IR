In the upcoming month the KLOE-2 data taking campaign will start at the
upgraded DAFNE phi-factory of INFN Laboratori Nazionali di Frascati. The main
goal is to collect an integrated luminosity of about 20 fb^(-1) in 3-4 years in
order to refine and extend the KLOE program on both kaon physics and hadron
spectroscopy. Here the expected improvements on the results of hadron
spectroscopy are presented and briefly discussed.
