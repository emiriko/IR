The destruction of planets by migration into the star will release
significant amounts of energy and material, which will present opportunities to
observational study planets in new ways. To observe planet destruction, it is
important to understand the processes of how this energy and material is
released as planets are destroyed. It is not known how fast the large amounts
of energy and material are released, making it difficult to predict how
observable planet destruction will be. There is a huge amount of energy made
available by falling deep into the star's potential well: Simple calculations
show that many of the currently known "hot Jupiters" can potentially produce
events as luminous as a small nova if the energy is released fast enough. To
observe these events, the important questions are how will this energy be
released, and whether the energy will be released rapidly enough to create an
event luminous enough to be found by transient surveys.
  Alternatively, if planet destruction is slowed by the inward migration
alternating with periods of outward migration caused by Roche lobe overflow
(RLOF), then the primary signature may be the effects of the release of large
amounts of gas. The infall of this gas also may significantly contribute to the
system's luminosity. The release of planetary gas may be a searchable signature
of planet destruction. Signs of runaway RLOF and outward or alternating RLOF
should be searched for.
  Observing planet destruction will provide a new window for study of
exoplanets.
