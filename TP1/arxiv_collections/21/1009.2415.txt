We report on the controlled creation of a valence bond state of delocalized
effective-spin singlet and triplet dimers by means of a bichromatic optical
superlattice. We demonstrate a coherent coupling between the singlet and
triplet states and show how the superlattice can be employed to measure the
singlet-fraction employing a spin blockade effect. Our method provides a
reliable way to detect and control nearest-neighbor spin correlations in
many-body systems of ultracold atoms. Being able to measure these correlations
is an important ingredient to study quantum magnetism in optical lattices. We
furthermore employ a SWAP operation between atoms being part of different
triplets, thus effectively increasing their bond-length. Such SWAP operation
provides an important step towards the massively parallel creation of a
multi-particle entangled state in the lattice.
