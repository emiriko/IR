The recent global analyses of the nuclear parton distribution functions
(nPDFs) lend support to the validity of the factorization theorem of QCD in
high-energy processes involving bound nucleons. With a special attention on our
latest global analysis EPS09, we review the recent developements in the domain
of nuclear PDFs.
