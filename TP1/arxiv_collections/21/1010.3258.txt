In this fluid dynamics video, the vapour cloud generated near evaporating
free liquid surfaces is visualised by Mach-Zehnder interferometry (MZI). More
precisely, for evaporating HFE-7100 (from 3M) and ambient conditions, the
vapour concentration field and its dynamical behaviour are observed in three
simple experiments. Through these experiments, it is evidenced that the high
density of the vapour cloud (compared to air) induces convective motions in the
gas mixture, resulting in deviations of the concentration field from a purely
diffusional behaviour.
