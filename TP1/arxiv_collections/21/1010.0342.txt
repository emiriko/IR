We first analyze why the iron pnictides with high $T_c$ superconductivity so
far are As-based, by the Hund's rule correlation picture, then examine the
P-based and Sb-based cases, respectively. Consequently, we propose that CaClFeP
with ZrCuSiAs-type structure is an As-free high $T_c$ iron-pnictide. The
subsequent density functional theory calculations show that the ground state of
CaClFeP is of a collinearly antiferromagnetic order on Fe moments with
structural distortion, resulting from the interplay between the strong nearest
and next-nearest neighbor antiferromagnetic superexchange interactions bridged
by P atoms, similar as the As-based pnictides. The other P-based pnictides are
either nonmagnetic or magnetic but with weak exchange interactions. The
Sb-based pnictides unlikely show high $T_c$ superconductivity because of the
existence of robust ferromagnetic order.
