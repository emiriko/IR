We address the low-energy effective Hamiltonian of electron doped d0
perovskite semiconductors in cubic and tetragonal phases using the k*p method.
The Hamiltonian depends on the spin-orbit interaction strength, on the
temperature-dependent tetragonal distortion, and on a set of effective-mass
parameters whose number is determined by the symmetry of the crystal. We
explain how these parameters can be extracted from angle resolved
photo-emission, Raman spectroscopy, and magneto-transport measurements and
estimate their values in SrTiO3.
