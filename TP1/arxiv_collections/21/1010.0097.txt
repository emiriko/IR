The contribution in the R-parity violating (RPV) Minimal Supersymmetric
Standard Model (MSSM) to the electric dipole moment (EDM) of $^{199}$Hg at the
one-loop level is evaluated. At the one-loop level, the $^{199}$Hg EDM receives
RPV contribution whose couplings are of a different type from the tree level
analysis. This contribution is shown to be constrained by using the limit to
the CP-odd electron-nucleon (e-N) interaction given by the recent result of
$^{199}$Hg EDM experiment.
