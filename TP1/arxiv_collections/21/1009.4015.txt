We present DisPerSE, a novel approach to the coherent multi-scale
identification of all types of astrophysical structures, and in particular the
filaments, in the large scale distribution of matter in the Universe. This
method and corresponding piece of software allows a genuinely scale free and
parameter free identification of the voids, walls, filaments, clusters and
their configuration within the cosmic web, directly from the discrete
distribution of particles in N-body simulations or galaxies in sparse
observational catalogues. To achieve that goal, the method works directly over
the Delaunay tessellation of the discrete sample and uses the DTFE density
computed at each tracer particle; no further sampling, smoothing or processing
of the density field is required.
  The idea is based on recent advances in distinct sub-domains of computational
topology, which allows a rigorous application of topological principles to
astrophysical data sets, taking into account uncertainties and Poisson noise.
Practically, the user can define a given persistence level in terms of
robustness with respect to noise (defined as a "number of sigmas") and the
algorithm returns the structures with the corresponding significance as sets of
critical points, lines, surfaces and volumes corresponding to the clusters,
filaments, walls and voids; filaments, connected at cluster nodes, crawling
along the edges of walls bounding the voids. The method is also interesting as
it allows for a robust quantification of the topological properties of a
discrete distribution in terms of Betti numbers or Euler characteristics,
without having to resort to smoothing or having to define a particular scale.
  In this paper, we introduce the necessary mathematical background and
describe the method and implementation, while we address the application to 3D
simulated and observed data sets to the companion paper.
