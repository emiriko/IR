We present analytical results both in momentum and position space for the
massless correlators of the vector and scalar currents to order alpha_s^4 as
well as for the tensor currents to order alpha_s^3. The evolution equations for
the correlators together with all relevant anomalous dimensions are discussed
in detail. As an application we present explicit conversion formulas relating
the MSbar-renormalized vector, scalar and tensor currents to their counterparts
renormalized in the X-space renormalization scheme more appropriate for lattice
calculations.
