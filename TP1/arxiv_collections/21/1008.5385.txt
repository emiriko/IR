Acoustic waves propagation of in composite of water with embedded
double-layered silicone resin/silver rods is considered. Approximate values of
effective dynamical constitutive parameters are obtained. Frequency ranges of
simultaneous negative constitutive parameters are found. Localized surface
states on the interface between metamaterial and "normal" material are found.
Doppler effect in metamaterial is considered. Presence of anomalous modes are
shown.
