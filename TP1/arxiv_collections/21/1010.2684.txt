A particle driven by an external force in a molecular crowding environment -
a quiescent bath of other particles, makes their spatial distribution
inhomogeneous: the bath particles accumulate in front of the biased particle
(BP) and are depleted behind. In fact, a BP travels together with the
inhomogeneity it creates. A natural question is what will happen with two BPs
when they appear sufficiently close to each other such that the inhomogeneities
around each of them start to interfere? In quest for the answer we examine
here, via Monte Carlo simulations, the dynamics of two BPs in a lattice gas of
bath particles. We observe that for a sufficiently dense medium, surprisingly,
both BPs spend most of the time together which signifies that the interference
of the microstructural inhomogeneities results in effectively attractive
interactions between them. Such statistical pairing of BPs minimizes the size
of the inhomogeneity and hence reduces the frictional drag force exerted on the
BPs by the medium. As a result, in some configurations the center-of-mass of a
pair of BPs propagates faster than a single isolated BP. These jamming-induced
forces are very different from fundamental physical interactions, exist only in
presence of an external force, and require the presence of a quiescent bath to
mediate the interactions between the driven particles.
