We present the results of a recent survey of cool, late-type supergiants -
the descendants of massive O- and B-type stars - that has systematically
detected magnetic fields in these stars using spectropolarimetric observations
obtained with ESPaDOnS at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. Our observations
reveal detectable, often complex, Stokes V Zeeman signatures in Least-Squares
Deconvolved mean line profiles in a significant fraction of the observed sample
of ~30 stars.
