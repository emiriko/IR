This is a written version of a series of lectures aimed at graduate students
in particle theory/string theory/particle experiment familiar with the basics
of the Standard Model. We explain the many reasons for the interest in flavour
physics. We describe flavour physics and the related CP violation within the
Standard Model, and explain how the B-factories proved that the
Kobayashi-Maskawa mechanism dominates the CP violation that is observed in
meson decays. We explain the implications of flavour physics for new physics.
We emphasize the "new physics flavour puzzle". As an explicit example, we
explain how the recent measurements of D0-D0 mixing constrain the
supersymmetric flavour structure. We explain how the ATLAS and CMS experiments
can solve the new physics flavour puzzle and perhaps shed light on the standard
model flavour puzzle. Finally, we describe various interpretations of the
neutrino flavour data and their impact on flavour models.
