The dynamical mean-field concept of approximating an unsolvable many-body
problem in terms of the solution of an auxiliary quantum impurity problem,
introduced to study bulk materials with a continuous energy spectrum, is here
extended to molecules, i.e., finite systems with a discrete energy spectrum.
The application to small clusters of hydrogen atoms yields ground state
energies which are competitive with leading quantum chemical approaches at
intermediate and large interatomic distances as well as good approximations to
the excitation spectrum.
