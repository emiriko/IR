In a recent paper Lima, Panario and Wang have provided a new method to
multiply polynomials in Chebyshev basis which aims at reducing the total number
of multiplication when polynomials have small degree. Their idea is to use
Karatsuba's multiplication scheme to improve upon the naive method but without
being able to get rid of its quadratic complexity. In this paper, we extend
their result by providing a reduction scheme which allows to multiply
polynomial in Chebyshev basis by using algorithms from the monomial basis case
and therefore get the same asymptotic complexity estimate. Our reduction allows
to use any of these algorithms without converting polynomials input to monomial
basis which therefore provide a more direct reduction scheme then the one using
conversions. We also demonstrate that our reduction is efficient in practice,
and even outperform the performance of the best known algorithm for Chebyshev
basis when polynomials have large degree. Finally, we demonstrate a linear time
equivalence between the polynomial multiplication problem under monomial basis
and under Chebyshev basis.
