We have studied a hybrid system of a one-dimensional coupled-cavity waveguide
with a two-level system inside, which subject to a external periodical field.
Using the extended Hilbert space formalism, the time-dependent Hamiltonian is
reduced into an equivalent time-independent one. Via computing the
Floquet-Green's function, the Zeno-anti-Zeno crossover is controlled by the
driven intensity and frequency, and the detuning between the cavity and the
two-level system.
