The level of control that one has over neutral molecules in beams dictates
their possible applications. Here we experimentally demonstrate that
state-selected, neutral molecules can be kept together in a few mm long packet
for a distance of over one mile. This is accomplished in a circular arrangement
of 40 straight electrostatic hexapoles through which the molecules propagate
over 1000 times. Up to 19 packets of molecules have simultaneously been stored
in this ring structure. This brings the realization of a molecular low-energy
collider within reach.
