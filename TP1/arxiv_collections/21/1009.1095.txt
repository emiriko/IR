The Imaging Magnetograph eXperiment (IMaX) is a spectropolarimeter built by
four institutions in Spain that flew on board the Sunrise balloon-borne
telesocope in June 2009 for almost six days over the Arctic Circle. As a
polarimeter IMaX uses fast polarization modulation (based on the use of two
liquid crystal retarders), real-time image accumulation, and dual beam
polarimetry to reach polarization sensitivities of 0.1%. As a spectrograph, the
instrument uses a LiNbO3 etalon in double pass and a narrow band pre-filter to
achieve a spectral resolution of 85 mAA. IMaX uses the high Zeeman sensitive
line of Fe I at 5250.2 AA and observes all four Stokes parameters at various
points inside the spectral line. This allows vector magnetograms, Dopplergrams,
and intensity frames to be produced that, after reconstruction, reach spatial
resolutions in the 0.15-0.18 arcsec range over a 50x50 arcsec FOV. Time
cadences vary between ten and 33 seconds, although the shortest one only
includes longitudinal polarimetry. The spectral line is sampled in various ways
depending on the applied observing mode, from just two points inside the line
to 11 of them. All observing modes include one extra wavelength point in the
nearby continuum. Gauss equivalent sensitivities are four Gauss for
longitudinal fields and 80 Gauss for transverse fields per wavelength sample.
The LOS velocities are estimated with statistical errors of the order of 5-40
m/s. The design, calibration and integration phases of the instrument, together
with the implemented data reduction scheme are described in some detail.
