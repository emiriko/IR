When x-rays penetrate soft matter, their phase changes more rapidly than
their amplitude. In- terference effects visible with high brightness sources
creates higher contrast, edge enhanced images. When the object is piecewise
smooth (made of big blocks of a few components), such higher con- trast
datasets have a sparse solution. We apply basis pursuit solvers to improve SNR,
remove ring artifacts, reduce the number of views and radiation dose from phase
contrast datasets collected at the Hard X-Ray Micro Tomography Beamline at the
Advanced Light Source. We report a GPU code for the most computationally
intensive task, the gridding and inverse gridding algorithm (non uniform
sampled Fourier transform).
