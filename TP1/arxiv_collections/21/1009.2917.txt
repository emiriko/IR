We use the Kadanoff-Baym equations within the framework of many-body
perturbation theory to study the double occupancies in a Hubbard dimer. The
double occupancies are obtained from the equations of motion of the
single-particle Green's function. Our calculations show that the approximate
double occupancies can become negative. This is a shortcoming of approximate,
and yet conserving, many-body self-energies. Among the tested perturbation
schemes, the T-matrix approximation is the only one providing double
occupancies which are always positive.
