We propose an explicit construction of a stationary solution for a stochastic
recursion of the form $X\circ\theta=\phi(X)$ on a partially-ordered Polish
space, when the monotonicity of $\phi$ is not assumed. Under certain
conditions, we show that an extension of the original probability space exists,
on which a solution is well-defined, and construct explicitly this extension.
We then provide conditions for the solution to be defined as well on the
original space. We finally apply these results to the stability study of two
non-monotonic queueing systems.
