We consider an agent on a fixed but arbitrary node of a known threshold
network, with the task of detecting an unknown missing link/node. We obtain
analytic formulas for the probability of success, when the agent's tool is the
free evolution of a single excitation on an XX spin system paired with the
network. We completely characterize the parameters allowing for an advantageous
solution. From the results emerges an optimal (deterministic) algorithm for
quantum search, therefore gaining a quadratic speed-up with respect to the
optimal classical analogue, and in line with well-known results in quantum
computation. When attempting to detect a faulty node, the chosen setting
appears to be very fragile and the probability of success too small to be of
any direct use.
