We propose a new mechanism to alter the nature of the potential barriers when
a biased Brownian particle under goes a constrained motion in narrow, periodic
channel. By changing the angle of the external bias, the nature of the
potential barriers changes from purely entropic to energetic which in turn
effects the diffusion process in the system. At an optimum angle of the bias,
the nonlinear mobility exhibits a striking bell-shaped behavior. Moreover, the
enhancement of the scaled effective diffusion coefficient can be efficiently
controlled by the angle of the bias. This mechanism enables the proper design
of channel structures for transport of molecules and small particles. The
approximative analytical predictions have been verified by precise Brownian
dynamic simulations.
