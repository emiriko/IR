In this paper the background detection in images in poor lighting can be done
by the use of morphological filters. Lately contrast image enhancement
technique is used to detect the background in image which uses Weber's Law. The
proposed technique is more effective one in which the background detection in
image can be done in color images. The given image obtained in this method is
very effective one. More enhancement can be obtained while comparing the
results. In this technique compressed domain enhancement has been used for
better result.
