An application design is offered, which students of physics can use when
authoring a solver for mechanical systems with constraints. A 'chainlist'
concept is introduced to capture a constrained mechanical system configuration
and to pass the simulation scenario to the solver application. Code samples are
given to start off the solver application (simulator) project. A short review
of linear algebra for constrained motion computations (pseudoinverse) is given.
