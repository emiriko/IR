We present results of a 1.1 mm deep survey of the AKARI Deep Field South
(ADF-S) with AzTEC mounted on the Atacama Submillimetre Telescope Experiment
(ASTE). We obtained a map of 0.25 sq. deg area with an rms noise level of
0.32-0.71 mJy. This is one of the deepest and widest maps thus far at
millimetre and submillimetre wavelengths. We uncovered 198 sources with a
significance of 3.5-15.6 sigma, providing the largest catalog of 1.1 mm sources
in a contiguous region. Most of the sources are not detected in the
far-infrared bands of the AKARI satellite, suggesting that they are mostly at z
~ 1.5 given the detection limits. We constructed differential and cumulative
number counts in the ADF-S, the Subaru/XMM Newton Deep Field (SXDF), and the
SSA 22 field surveyed by AzTEC/ASTE, which provide currently the tightest
constraints on the faint end. The integration of the best-fit number counts in
the ADF-S find that the contribution of 1.1 mm sources with fluxes >=1 mJy to
the cosmic infrared background (CIB) at 1.1 mm is 12-16%, suggesting that the
large fraction of the CIB originates from faint sources of which the number
counts are not yet constrained. We estimate the cosmic star-formation rate
density contributed by 1.1 mm sources with >=1 mJy using the best-fit number
counts in the ADF-S and find that it is lower by about a factor of 5-10
compared to those derived from UV/optically-selected galaxies at z ~ 2-3. The
fraction of stellar mass of the present-day universe produced by 1.1 mm sources
with >=1 mJy at z >= 1 is ~20%, calculated by the time integration of the
star-formation rate density. If we consider the recycled fraction of >0.4,
which is the fraction of materials forming stars returned to the interstellar
medium, the fraction of stellar mass produced by 1.1 mm sources decrease to
<~10%.
