The original sunspot observations by Heinrich Samuel Schwabe of 1825-1867
were digitized and a first subset of spots was measured. In this initial
project, we determined more than 14 000 sunspot positions and areas comprising
about 11% of the total amount of spots available from that period. The
resulting butterfly diagram has a typical appearance, but with evident
north-south asymmetries.
