The OPTIMOS-EVE concept provides optical to near-infrared (370-1700 nm)
spectroscopy, with three spectral resolution (5000, 15000 and 30000), with high
simultaneous multiplex (at least 200). The optical fibre links are distributed
in five kinds of bundles: several hundreds of mono-object systems with three
types of bundles, fibre size being used to adapt slit with, and thus spectral
resolution, 30 deployable medium IFUs (about 2"x3") and one large IFU (about
6"x12"). This paper gives an overview of the design of each mode and describes
the specific developments required to optimise the performances of the fibre
system.
