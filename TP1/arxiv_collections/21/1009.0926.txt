Efimov physics in two nuclear-spin sublevels of bosonic lithium is studied
and it is shown that the positions and widths of recombination minima and
Efimov resonances are identical for both states within the experimental errors
which indicates that the short-range physics is nuclear-spin independent. We
also find that the Efimov features are universally related across Feshbach
resonances. These results crucially depend on careful mapping between the
scattering length and the applied magnetic field which we achieve by
characterization of the two broad Feshbach resonances in the different states
by means of rf-spectroscopy of weakly bound molecules. By fitting the binding
energies numerically with a coupled channels calculation we precisely determine
the absolute positions of the Feshbach resonances and the values of the singlet
and triplet scattering lengths.
