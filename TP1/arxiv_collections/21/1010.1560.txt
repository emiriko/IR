Strain modulated electronic properties of Si/Ge core-shell nanowires along
[110] direction were reported based on first principles density-functional
theory calculations. Particularly, the energy dispersion relationship of the
conduction/valence band was explored in detail. At the {\Gamma} point, the
energy levels of both bands are significantly altered by applied uniaxial
strain, which results in an evident change of band gap. In contrast, for the K
vectors far away from {\Gamma}, the variation of the conduction/valence band
with strain is much reduced. In addition, with a sufficient tensile strain
(~1%), the valence band edge (VBE) shifts away from {\Gamma}, which indicates
that the band gap of the Si/Ge core-shell nanowires experiences a transition
from direct to indirect. Our studies further showed that effective masses of
charge carriers can be also tuned by the external uniaxial strain. The
effective mass of the hole increases dramatically with a tensile strain, while
strain shows a minimal effect on tuning the effective mass of the electron.
Finally, the relation between strain and the conduction/valence band edge is
discussed thoroughly in terms of site-projected wave-function characters.
