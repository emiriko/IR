This paper is concerned with constructing an optimal controller in the
coherent quantum Linear Quadratic Gaussian problem. A coherent quantum
controller is itself a quantum system and is required to be physically
realizable. The use of coherent control avoids the need for classical
measurements, which inherently entail the loss of quantum information. Physical
realizability corresponds to the equivalence of the controller to an open
quantum harmonic oscillator and relates its state-space matrices to the
Hamiltonian, coupling and scattering operators of the oscillator. The
Hamiltonian parameterization of the controller is combined with Frechet
differentiation of the LQG cost with respect to the state-space matrices to
obtain equations for the optimal controller. A quasi-separation principle for
the gain matrices of the quantum controller is established, and a Newton-like
iterative scheme for numerical solution of the equations is outlined.
