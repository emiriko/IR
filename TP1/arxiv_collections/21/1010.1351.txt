Over the past few decades, superhydrophobic materials have attaracted a lot
of interests, due to their numerous practical applications. Among various
superhydrophobic materials, carbon nanotube arrays have gained enormous
attentions simply because of their outstanding properties. The impact dynamic
of water droplet on a superhydrophobic carbon nanotube array is shown in this
fluid dynamics video.
