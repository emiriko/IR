We obtain the nuclear proximity potential by using semiclassical extended
Thomas Fermi (ETF) approach in Skyrme energy density formalism (SEDF), and use
it in the extended $\ell$-summed Wong formula under frozen density
approximation. This method has the advantage of allowing the use of different
Skyrme forces, giving different barriers. Thus, for a given reaction, we could
choose a Skyrme force with proper barrier characteristics, not-requiring extra
``barrier lowering" or ``barrier narrowing" for a best fit to data. For the
$^{64}$Ni+$^{100}$Mo reaction, the $\ell$-summed Wong formula, with effects of
deformations and orientations of nuclei included, fits the fusion-evaporation
cross section data exactly for the force GSkI, requiring additional barrier
modifications for forces SIII and SV. However, the same for other similar
reactions, like $^{58,64}$Ni+$^{58,64}$Ni, fits the data best for SIII force.
Hence, the barrier modification effects in $\ell$-summed Wong expression
depends on the choice of Skyrme force in extended ETF method.
