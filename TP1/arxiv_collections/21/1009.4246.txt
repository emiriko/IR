Density functional theory (DFT) modeling of the physisorption of four
different types of molecules (toluene, bromine dimmer, water and nitrogen
dioxide) over and above graphene ripples has been performed. For all types of
molecules changes of charge transfer and binding energies in respect to flat
graphene is found. The changes in electronic structure of corrugated graphene
and turn of {\pi}-orbitals of carbon atoms in combination with chemical
structure of adsorbed molecules are proposed as the causes of difference with
the perfect graphene case and variety of adsorption properties of different
types of the molecules. Results of calculation suggest that the tops of the
ripples are more attractive for large molecules and valley between ripples for
small molecules. Stability of molecules on the ripples and energy barriers for
migration over flat and corrugated graphene is also discussed.
