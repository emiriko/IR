Monte Carlo simulations and finite-size scaling analysis have been carried
out to study the critical behavior in a two-dimensional system of particles
with two bonding sites that, by decreasing temperature or increasing density,
polymerize reversibly into chains with discrete orientational degrees of
freedom and, at the same time, undergo a continuous isotropic-nematic (IN)
transition. A complete phase diagram was obtained as a function of temperature
and density. The numerical results were compared with mean field (MF) and real
space renormalization group (RSRG) analytical predictions about the IN
transformation. While the RSRG approach supports the continuous nature of the
transition, the MF solution predicts a first-order transition line and a
tricritical point, at variance with the simulation results.
