Sub milli-arcsecond imaging in the visible band will provide a new
perspective in stellar astrophysics. Even though stellar intensity
interferometry was abandoned more than 40 years ago, it is capable of imaging
and thus accomplishing more than the measurement of stellar diameters as was
previously thought. Various phase retrieval techniques can be used to
reconstruct actual images provided a sufficient coverage of the interferometric
plane is available. Planned large arrays of Air Cherenkov telescopes will
provide thousands of simultaneously available baselines ranging from a few tens
of meters to over a kilometer, thus making imaging possible with unprecedented
angular resolution. Here we investigate the imaging capabilities of arrays such
as CTA or AGIS used as Stellar Intensity Interferometry receivers. The study
makes use of simulated data as could realistically be obtained from these
arrays. A Cauchy-Riemann based phase recovery allows the reconstruction of
images which can be compared to the pristine image for which the data were
simulated. This is first done for uniform disk stars with different radii and
corresponding to various exposure times, and we find that the uncertainty in
reconstructing radii is a few percent after a few hours of exposure time.
Finally, more complex images are considered, showing that imaging at the
sub-milli-arc-second scale is possible.
