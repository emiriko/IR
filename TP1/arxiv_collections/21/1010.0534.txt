We study the distribution of magnetic shear in an emerging flux region using
the high-resolution Hinode/SOT SP observations. The distribution of mean
magnetic shear angle across the active region shows large values near region of
flux emergence i.e., in the middle of existing bipolar region and decreases
while approaching the periphery of the active region.
