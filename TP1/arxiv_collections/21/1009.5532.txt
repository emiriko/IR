The baryonic acoustic oscillations are features in the spatial distribution
of the galaxies which, if observed at different epochs, probe the nature of the
dark energy. In order to be able to measure the parameters of the dark energy
equation of state to high precision, a huge sample of galaxies has to be used.
The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope will survey the optical sky with 6 filters
from 300nm and 1100nm, such that a catalog of galaxies with photometric
redshifts will be available for dark energy studies. In this article, we will
give a rough estimate of the impact of the photometric redshift uncertainties
on the computation of the dark energy parameter through the reconstruction of
the BAO scale from a simulated photometric catalog.
