We examine the feasibility of generating continuous-variable multipartite
entanglement in an intra-cavity quadruply concurrent downconversion scheme that
has been proposed for the generation of cluster states by Menicucci \textit{et
al.} [Physical Review Letters \textbf{101}, 130501 (2008)]. By calculating
optimized versions of the van Loock-Furusawa correlations we demonstrate
genuine quadripartite entanglement and investigate the degree of entanglement
present. Above the oscillation threshold the basic cluster state geometry under
consideration suffers from phase diffusion. We alleviate this problem by
incorporating a small injected signal into our analysis. Finally, we
investigate squeezed joint operators. While the squeezed joint operators
approach zero in the undepleted regime, we find that this is not the case when
we consider the full interaction Hamiltonian and the presence of a cavity. In
fact, we find that the decay of these operators is minimal in a cavity, and
even depletion alone inhibits cluster state formation.
