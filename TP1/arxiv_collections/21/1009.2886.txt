The characteristics of fragment emission in peripheral $^{197}$Au+$^{197}$Au
collisions 35 MeV/A are studied using the two clusterization approaches within
framework of \emph{quantum molecular dynamics} model. Our model calculations
using \emph{minimum spanning tree} (MST) algorithm and advanced clusterization
method namely \emph{simulated annealing clusterization algorithm} (SACA) showed
that fragment structure can be realized at an earlier time when spectators
contribute significantly toward the fragment production even at such a low
incident energy. Comparison of model predictions with experimental data reveals
that SACA method can nicely reproduce the fragment charge yields and mean
charge of the heaviest fragment. This reflects suitability of SACA method over
conventional clusterization techniques to investigate spectator matter
fragmentation in low energy domain.
