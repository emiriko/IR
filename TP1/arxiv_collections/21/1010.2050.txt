We compare two influential ways of defining a generalized notion of space.
The first, inspired by Gelfand duality, states that the category of
'noncommutative spaces' is the opposite of the category of C*-algebras. The
second, loosely generalizing Stone duality, maintains that the category of
'pointfree spaces' is the opposite of the category of frames (i.e., complete
lattices in which the meet distributes over arbitrary joins). One possible
relationship between these two notions of space was unearthed by Banaschewski
and Mulvey, who proved a constructive version of Gelfand duality in which the
Gelfand spectrum of a commutative C*-algebra comes out as a pointfree space.
Being constructive, this result applies in arbitrary toposes (with natural
numbers objects, so that internal C*-algebras can be defined). Earlier work by
the first three authors, shows how a noncommutative C*-algebra gives rise to a
commutative one internal to a certain sheaf topos. The latter, then, has a
constructive Gelfand spectrum, also internal to the topos in question. After a
brief review of this work, we compute the so-called external description of
this internal spectrum, which in principle is a fibered pointfree space in the
familiar topos Sets of sets and functions. However, we obtain the external
spectrum as a fibered topological space in the usual sense. This leads to an
explicit Gelfand transform, as well as to a topological reinterpretation of the
Kochen-Specker Theorem of quantum mechanics, which supplements the remarkable
topos-theoretic version of this theorem due to Butterfield and Isham.
