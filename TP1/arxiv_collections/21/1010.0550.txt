We report new observations of the intermediate-frequency peaked BL Lacertae
object 3C 66A with the MAGIC telescopes. The data sample we use were taken in
2009 December and 2010 January, and comprises 2.3 hr of good quality data in
stereoscopic mode. In this period, we find a significant signal from the
direction of the blazar 3C 66A. The new MAGIC stereoscopic system is shown to
play an essential role for the separation between 3C 66A and the nearby radio
galaxy 3C 66B, which is at a distance of only $6^\prime$. The derived integral
flux above $100\eh{GeV}$ is 8.3% of Crab Nebula flux and the energy spectrum is
reproduced by a power law of photon index $3.64 \pm 0.39_{\rm stat} \pm
0.25_{\rm sys}$. Within errors, this is compatible with the one derived by
VERITAS in 2009. From the spectra corrected for absorption by the extragalactic
background light, we only find small differences between the four models that
we applied, and constrain the redshift of the blazar to $z < 0.68$.
