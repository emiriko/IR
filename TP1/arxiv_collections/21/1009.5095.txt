The catastrophic senescence of the Pacific salmon is among the initial tests
used to validate the Penna aging model. Based on the mutation accumulation
theory, the sudden decrease in fitness following reproduction may be solely
attributed to the semelparity of the species. In this work, we report other
consequences of mutation accumulation. Contrary to earlier findings, such
dramatic manifestation of aging depends not only on the choice of breeding
strategy but also on the value of the reproduction age, R, and the mutation
threshold, T. Senescence is catastrophic when $T \leq R$. As the organism's
tolerance for harmful genetic mutations increases, the aging process becomes
more gradual. We observe senescence that is threshold dependent whenever T>R.
That is, the sudden drop in survival rate occurs at age equal to the mutation
threshold value.
