Reply to A Comment on The Far Future of Exoplanet Direct Characterization -
the Case for Interstellar Space Probess by Ian Crawford. The paper The Far
Future of Exoplanet Direct Characterization resulted from the collective work
of TE-SAT, a team appointed by ESA in 2003 to assess a strategy to find and
characterize Terrestrial Exoplanets. The interstellar flight aspect was not
part of the TE-SAT work and was added afterward as side remarks in the chapter
on {\guillemotleft} The Far Future of Exoplanet Direct Characterization
{\guillemotright}. As an introductory general remark, the intention of the
paper was not to discourage work on interstellar flight prospective. On the
contrary, any advance in this field that makes interstellar travel closer to us
is welcome. In the framework of this short reply, the discussion can only be
qualitative; it would deserve a full future paper.
