We investigate gravitational lensing effects of an extrasolar planet
transiting its host star. We focus on the `rising spikes' of the light curve
just before and after the transit, which is a peculiar feature of the
gravitational lensing, and find that it could be a novel observable for
determining physical parameters. Detectability of such an effect is also
discussed.
