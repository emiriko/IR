This paper creates and analyses a new quantum algorithm called the Amplified
Quantum Fourier Transform (Amplified-QFT) for solving the following problem:
The Local Period Problem: Let L = {0,1...N-1} be a set of N labels and let A be
a subset of M labels of period P, i.e. a subset of the form A = {j : j = s +
rP; r = 0,1...M-1} where P < sqrt(N) and M << N, and where M is assumed known.
Given an oracle f : L->{0,1} which is 1 on A and 0 elsewhere, find the local
period P. A separate algorithm finds the offset s. The first part of the paper
defines the Amplified-QFT algorithm. The second part of the paper summarizes
the main results and compares the Amplified-QFT algorithm against the Quantum
Fourier Transform (QFT) and Quantum Hidden Subgroup (QHS) algorithms when
solving the local period problem. It is shown that the Amplified-QFT is, on
average, quadratically faster than both the QFT and QHS algorithms. The third
part of the paper provides the detailed proofs of the main results, describes
the method of recovering P from an observation y and describes the method for
recovering the offset s.
