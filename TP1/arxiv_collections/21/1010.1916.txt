We present a new construction related to systems of polynomials which are
consistent on a cube. The consistent polynomials underlie the integrability of
discrete counterparts of integrable partial differential equations of Korteweg-
de Vries-type (KdV-type). The construction reported here associates a
Schwarzian variable to such systems. In the generic case, including the primary
model Q4, the new variable satisfies the lattice Schwarzian
Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) equat ion in three dimensions. For the degenerate
sub-cases of Q4 the same construction reveals an invertible transformation to
the lattice Schwarzian KdV equation.
