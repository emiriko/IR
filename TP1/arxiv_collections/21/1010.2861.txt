We propose to reduce the thermal conductivity of silicon nanowires (SiNWs) by
introducing small hole at the centre, i.e. construct silicon nanotube (SiNT)
structures. Our numerical results demonstrate that a very small hole (only 1%
reduction in cross section area) can induce a 35% reduction in room temperature
thermal conductivity. Moreover, with the same cross section area, thermal
conductivity of SiNT is only about 33% of that of SiNW at room temperature. The
spatial distribution of vibrational energy reveals that localization modes are
concentrated on the inner and outer surfaces of SiNTs. The enhanced
surface-to-volume ratio in SiNTs reduces the percentage of delocalized modes,
which is believed to be responsible for the reduction of thermal conductivity.
Our study suggests SiNT is a promising thermoelectric material with low thermal
conductivity.
