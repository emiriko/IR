I outline a new model of particle acceleration in the current sheet
separating the closed from the open field lines in the force-free model of
pulsar magnetospheres, based on reconnection at the light cylinder and
"auroral" acceleration occurring in the return current channel that connects
the light cylinder to the neutron star surface. I discuss recent studies of
Pulsar Wind Nebulae, which find that pair outflow rates in excess of those
predicted by existing theories of pair creation occur, and use those results to
point out that dissipation of the magnetic field in a pulsar's wind upstream of
the termination shock is restored to life as a viable model for the solution of
the "$\sigma$" problem as a consequence of the lower wind 4-velocity implied by
the larger mass loading.
