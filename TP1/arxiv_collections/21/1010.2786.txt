Preliminary results are presented for the spectrum of D_s mesons using the
2+1 flavor Clover-Wilson configurations made available by the PACS-CS
collaboration. For the heavy quark, the Fermilab method is employed and we
report on the tuning of the charm-quark hopping parameter. As our main focus,
we present initial results for the spectrum of P-wave states, where previous
results have been mostly from quenched calculations. As a cross-check, some
calculations of the charmonium spectrum are also carried out.
