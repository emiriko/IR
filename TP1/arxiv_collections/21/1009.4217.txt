This paper considers convolution equations that arise from problems such as
measurement error and non-parametric regression with errors in variables with
independence conditions. The equations are examined in spaces of generalized
functions to account for possible singularities; this makes it possible to
consider densities for arbitrary and not only absolutely continuous
distributions, and to operate with Fourier transforms for polynomially growing
regression functions. Results are derived for identification and well-posedness
in the topology of generalized functions for the deconvolution problem and for
some regression models. Conditions for consistency of plug-in estimation for
these models are derived.
