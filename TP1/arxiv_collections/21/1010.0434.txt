Recently, Gomes et al. [1] have visualized the gap formation in nanoscale
regions (NRs) above the critical temperature T_c in the high-T_c superconductor
Bi_2Sr_2CaCu_2O_{8+\delta}. It has been found that, as the temperature lowers,
the NRs expand in the bulk superconducting state consisted of inhomogeneities.
The fact that the size of the inhomogeneity [2] is close to the minimal size of
the NR [1] leads to a conclusion that the superconducting phase is a result of
these overlapped NRs. In the present paper we perform the charge and
percolation regime analysis of NRs and show that at the first critical doping
x_{c1}, when the superconductivity starts on, each NR carries the positive
electric charge one in units of electron charge, thus we attribute the NR to a
single hole boson, and the percolation lines connecting these bosons emerge. At
the second critical doping x_{c2}, when the superconductivity disappears, our
analysis demonstrates that the charge of each NR equals two. The origin of
x_{c2} can be understood by introducing additional normal phase hole fermions
in NRs, whose concentration appearing above x_{c1} increases smoothly with the
doping and breaks the percolation lines of bosons at x_{c2}. The last one
results in disappearing the bulk bosonic property of the pseudogap (PG) region,
which explains the upper bound for existence of vortices in Nernst effect [3].
Since [1] has demonstrated the absence of NRs at the PG boundary one can
conclude that along this boundary, as well as in x_{c2}, all bosons disappear.
As justification of appearance of single bosons, the bosonization of 2D
fermions is rigorously proven using the concept of anyons. The linear density
dependence of the energy gap between excited fermionic and bosonic ground
states describes the Uemura relation for 2D superconductors.
