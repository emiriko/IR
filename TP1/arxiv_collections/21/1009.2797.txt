In previous work we have studied how an explicit representation of background
knowledge associated with a specific spreadsheet can be exploited to alleviate
usability problems with spreadsheet-based applications. We have implemented
this approach in the SACHS system to provide a semantic help system for
spreadsheets applications. In this paper, we evaluate the (comprehension)
coverage of SACHS on an Excel-based financial controlling system via a
"Wizard-of-Oz" experiment. This shows that SACHS adds significant value, but
systematically misses important classes of explanations. For judgements about
the information contained in spreadsheets, we provide a first approach for an
"assessment module" in SACHS.
