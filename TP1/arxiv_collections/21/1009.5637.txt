We study avoided crossings opened by spin-orbit interaction in the energy
spectra of one- and two-electron anisotropic quantum dots in perpendicular
magnetic field. We find that for simultaneously present Rashba and Dresselhaus
interactions the width of avoided crossings and the effective $g$ factor depend
on the dot orientation within (001) crystal plane. The extreme values of these
quantities are obtained for [110] and [1$\bar{1}$0] orientations of the dot.
The width of singlet-triplet avoided crossing changes between these two
orientations by as much as two orders of magnitude. The discussed modulation
results from orientation-dependent strength of the Zeeman interaction which
tends to polarize the spins in the direction of the external magnetic field and
thus remove the spin-orbit coupling effects.
