We propose a phase-space Wigner harmonics entropy measure for many-body
quantum dynamical complexity. This measure, which reduces to the well known
measure of complexity in classical systems and which is valid for both pure and
mixed states in single-particle and many-body systems, takes into account the
combined role of chaos and entanglement in the realm of quantum mechanics. The
effectiveness of the measure is illustrated in the example of the Ising chain
in a homogeneous tilted magnetic field. We provide numerical evidence that the
multipartite entanglement generation leads to a linear increase of entropy
until saturation in both integrable and chaotic regimes, so that in both cases
the number of harmonics of the Wigner function grows exponentially with time.
The entropy growth rate can be used to detect quantum phase transitions. The
proposed entropy measure can also distinguish between integrable and chaotic
many-body dynamics by means of the size of long term fluctuations which become
smaller when quantum chaos sets in.
