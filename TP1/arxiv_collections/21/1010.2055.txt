By resorting to basic features of topological knot theory we propose a
(classical) cryptographic protocol based on the `difficulty' of decomposing
complex knots generated as connected sums of prime knots and their mutants. The
scheme combines an asymmetric public key protocol with symmetric private ones
and is intrinsecally secure against quantum eavesdropper attacks.
