In this paper we suggest a method to observe remote interactions of spatially
separated dipolar quantum fluids, and in particular of dipolar excitons in GaAs
bilayer based devices. The method utilizes the static electric dipole moment of
trapped dipolar fluids to induce a local potential change on spatially
separated test dipoles. We show that such an interaction can be used for a
model- independent, objective fluid density measurements, an outstanding
problem in this field of research, as well as for inter-fluid exciton flow
control and trapping. For a demonstration of the effects on realistic devices,
we use a full two-dimensional hydrodynamical model.
