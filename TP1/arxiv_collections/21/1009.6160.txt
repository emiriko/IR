The properties of surfaces with charge-regulated patches are studied using
non-linear Poisson-Boltzmann theory. Using a mode expansion to solve the
non-linear problem efficiently, we reveal the charging behaviour of
Debye-length sized patches. We find that patches charge up to higher charge
densities if their size is relatively small and if the patches are well
separated. The numerical results are used to construct a basic analytical model
which predicts the average surface charge density on surfaces with patchy
chargeable groups.
