The LHCb experiment is running at the Large Hadron Collider to study CP
violation and rare decays in the beauty and charm sectors. The physics
potential is given for five key observables sensitive to new physics in nominal
conditions. The motivation and the strategy of the upgrade envisaged for 2016
is presented with the expected performance for an integrated luminosity of 50
1/fb.
