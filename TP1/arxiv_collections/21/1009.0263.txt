We examine the question of thermal melting of the triangular Abrikosov vortex
solid in two-dimensional superconductors or neutral superfluids. We introduce a
model, which combines lowest Landau level (LLL) projection with the magnetic
Wannier basis to represent degenerate eigenstates in the LLL. Solving the model
numerically via large-scale Monte Carlo simulations, we find clear evidence for
a continuous melting transition, in perfect agreement with the
Kosterlitz-Thouless-Halperin-Nelson-Young theory and with recent experiments.
