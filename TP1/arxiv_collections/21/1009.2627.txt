Charmonium spectroscopy gained renewed interest after the discovery in 2003
of the unpredicted X(3872) charmonium-like state, above the $D\overline{D}$
threshold. To date many charmonium-like states above the $D\overline{D}$
threshold have been claimed. Some of these states do not easily fit the
conventional charmonium picture. In this article we review recent experimental
results in this field, reported by the BaBar and Belle Collaborations.
