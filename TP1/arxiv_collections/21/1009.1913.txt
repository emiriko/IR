We provide torque formulae for low mass planets undergoing type I migration
in gaseous disks. These torque formulae put special emphasis on the horseshoe
drag, which is prone to saturation: the asymptotic value reached by the
horseshoe drag depends on a balance between coorbital dynamics (which tends to
cancel out or saturate the torque) and diffusive processes (which tend to
restore the unperturbed disk profiles, thereby desaturating the torque). We
entertain here the question of this asymptotic value, and we derive torque
formulae which give the total torque as a function of the disk's viscosity and
thermal diffusivity. The horseshoe drag features two components: one which
scales with the vortensity gradient, and one which scales with the entropy
gradient, and which constitutes the most promising candidate for halting inward
type I migration. Our analysis, which is complemented by numerical simulations,
recovers characteristics already noted by numericists, namely that the viscous
timescale across the horseshoe region must be shorter than the libration time
in order to avoid saturation, and that, provided this condition is satisfied,
the entropy related part of the horseshoe drag remains large if the thermal
timescale is shorter than the libration time. Side results include a study of
the Lindblad torque as a function of thermal diffusivity, and a contribution to
the corotation torque arising from vortensity viscously created at the contact
discontinuities that appear at the horseshoe separatrices. For the convenience
of the reader mostly interested in the torque formulae, section 8 is
self-contained.
