The search for lightweight authentication protocols suitable for low-cost
RFID tags constitutes an active and challenging research area. In this context,
a family of protocols based on the LPN problem has been proposed: the so-called
HB-family. Despite the rich literature regarding the cryptanalysis of these
protocols, there are no published results about the impact of fault analysis
over them. The purpose of this paper is to fill this gap by presenting a fault
analytic method against a prominent member of the HB-family: HB+ protocol. We
demonstrate that the fault analysis model can lead to a flexible and effective
attack against HB-like protocols, posing a serious threat over them.
