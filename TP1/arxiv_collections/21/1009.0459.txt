Particles moving in oscillating potential with broken mirror symmetry are
considered. We calculate their energetic efficiency, when acting as molecular
motors carrying a load against external force. It is shown that interaction
between particles enhances the efficiency in wide range of parameters. Possible
consequences for artificial molecular motors are discussed.
