4x4x3 absolutely nonsingular tensors are characterized by their determinant
polynomial. Non-quivalence among absolutely nonsingular tensors with respect to
a class of linear transformations, which do not chage the tensor rank,is
studied. It is shown theoretically that affine geometric invariants of the
constant surface of a determinant polynomial is useful to discriminate
non-equivalence among absolutely nonsingular tensors. Also numerical
caluculations are presented and these invariants are shown to be useful indeed.
For the caluculation of invarinats by 20-spherical design is also commented. We
showed that an algebraic problem in tensor data analysis can be attacked by an
affine geometric method.
