Universality of quantum mechanics -- its applicability to physical systems of
quite different nature and scales -- indicates that quantum behavior can be a
manifestation of general mathematical properties of systems containing
indistinguishable, i.e. lying on the same orbit of some symmetry group,
elements. In this paper we demonstrate, that quantum behavior arises naturally
in systems with finite number of elements connected by non-trivial symmetry
groups. The "finite" approach allows to see the peculiarities of quantum
description more distinctly without need for concepts like "wave function
collapse", "Everett's multiverses" etc. In particular, under the finiteness
assumption any quantum dynanics is reduced to the simple permutation dynamics.
The advantage of the finite quantum models is that they can be studied
constructively by means of computer algebra and computational group theory
methods.
