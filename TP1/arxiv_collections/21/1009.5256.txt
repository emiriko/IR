Using 535 x 10^6 B-meson pairs collected by the Belle detector at the KEKB e+
e- collider, we measure branching fractions of (7.16 +/- 0.10(stat) +/-
0.60(syst)) x 10^-4 for B+ -> J/psi K+ pi+ pi- and (4.31 +/- 0.20(stat) +/-
0.50(syst)) x 10^-4 for B+ -> psi-prime K+ pi+ pi-. We perform amplitude
analyses to determine the resonant structure of the K+ pi+ pi- final state in
B+ -> J/psi K+ pi+ pi- and B+ -> psi-prime K+ pi+ pi- and find that the
K_1(1270) is a prominent component of both decay modes. There is significant
interference among the different intermediate states, which leads, in
particular, to a striking distortion of the rho line shape due to the omega.
Based on the results of the fit to the B+ -> J/psi K+ pi+ pi- data, the
relative decay fractions of the K_1(1270) to K rho, K omega, and K^*(892) pi
are consistent with previous measurements, but the decay fraction to
K_0^*(1430) is significantly smaller. Finally, by floating the mass and width
of the K_1(1270) in an additional fit of the B+ -> J/psi K+ pi+ pi- data, we
measure a mass of (1248.1 +/- 3.3(stat) +/- 1.4(syst)) MeV/c^2 and a width of
(119.5 +/- 5.2(stat) +/- 6.7(syst)) MeV/c^2 for the K_1(1270).
