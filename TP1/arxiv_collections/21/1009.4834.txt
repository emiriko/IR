In the thesis, results presented in various papers involving the author are
reviewed. First, general results about consistent deformations at first order
(i.e. cubic) using the antifield formalism in Minkowski spacetime are gathered.
Secondly, a correspondance between the consistent nonabelian cubic vertices in
(Anti)de Sitter and those in Minkowski spacetime is establish. The Minkowski
nonabelian cubic solutions for the triplets of spin 2-2-3, 3-3-3 (in particular
the parity-breaking ones), 1-s-s and 2-s-s are then studied, the last of which
providing the uniqueness of the 2-s-s Fradkin-Vasiliev deformation procedure in
(A)dS spacetime. Finally, we carry out second order computations in Minkowski
spacetime that show the inconsistency of several cubic solutions, including the
spin-3 Berends-Burgers-van Dam vertex.
