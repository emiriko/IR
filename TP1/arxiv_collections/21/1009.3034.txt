We study the existence of metastable vacua in cascades based on fractional
brane configurations at non-isolated singularities preserving N = 1
supersymmetry. We find that in a large class of models the extra moduli
typically generated along such cascades may be stabilized by utilizing special
monopole points found recently. We illustrate this in detail for cascades based
on the SPP singularity. The supergravity interpretation of these constructions
in terms of warped throats with supersymmetry breaking localized near their
tips as well as applications to string compactification is discussed. Our
constructions are designed to realize a large class of warped throats with
supersymmetry breaking localized inside of a highly curved tip region.
