Approximate algebraic structures play a defining role in arithmetic
combinatorics and have found remarkable applications to basic questions in
number theory and pseudorandomness. Here we study approximate representations
of finite groups: functions f:G -> U_d such that Pr[f(xy) = f(x) f(y)] is
large, or more generally Exp_{x,y} ||f(xy) - f(x)f(y)||^2$ is small, where x
and y are uniformly random elements of the group G and U_d denotes the unitary
group of degree d. We bound these quantities in terms of the ratio d / d_min
where d_min is the dimension of the smallest nontrivial representation of G. As
an application, we bound the extent to which a function f : G -> H can be an
approximate homomorphism where H is another finite group. We show that if H's
representations are significantly smaller than G's, no such f can be much more
homomorphic than a random function.
  We interpret these results as showing that if G is quasirandom, that is, if
d_min is large, then G cannot be embedded in a small number of dimensions, or
in a less-quasirandom group, without significant distortion of G's
multiplicative structure. We also prove that our bounds are tight by showing
that minors of genuine representations and their polar decompositions are
essentially optimal approximate representations.
