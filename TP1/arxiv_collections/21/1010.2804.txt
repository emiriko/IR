We theoretically study the macroscopic quantum tunneling (MQT) in a hetero
Josephson junction formed by a conventional single-gap superconductor and a
multi-gap one such as ${MgB}_{2}$ and iron-based superconductors. In such a
Josephson junction more than one phase differences are defined. We clarify the
quantum dynamics of the phase differences and construct a theory for the MQT in
the multi-gap Josephson junctions. The dynamics of the phase differences are
strongly affected by the Josephson-Leggett mode, which is the out-of-phase
oscillation mode of the phase differences. The escape rate is calculated in
terms of the effective action renormalized by the Josephson-Leggett mode. It is
shown that the escape rate is drastically enhanced when the frequency of the
Josephson-Leggett mode is less than the Josephson-plasma frequency.
