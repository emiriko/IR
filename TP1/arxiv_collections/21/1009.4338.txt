Soft x-ray absorption experiments on the transition metal L2,3 edge of
multiferroic MnWO4 and antiferromagnetic CoWO4 are presented. The observed
linear polarization dependence, analyzed by full-multiplet calculations, is
used to determine the ground state wave function of the magnetic Mn2+ and Co2+
ions. The impact of the local structure and the spin-orbit coupling on the
orbital moment is discussed in terms of the single-ion anisotropy. It is shown
that the orbital moment in CoWO4 is responsible for the collinear
antiferromagnetism, while the small size of spin-orbit coupling effects make
spiral magnetic order in MnWO4 possible, enabling the material to be
multiferroic.
