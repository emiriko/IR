Single-electron transistors embedded in a suspended nanobeam or carbon
nanotube may exhibit effects originating from the coupling of the electronic
degrees of freedom to the mechanical oscillations of the suspended structure.
Here, we investigate theoretically the consequences of a capacitive
electromechanical interaction when the supporting beam is brought close to the
Euler buckling instability by a lateral compressive strain. Our central result
is that the low-bias current blockade, originating from the electromechanical
coupling for the classical resonator, is strongly enhanced near the Euler
instability. We predict that the bias voltage below which transport is blocked
increases by orders of magnitude for typical parameters. This mechanism may
make the otherwise elusive classical current blockade experimentally
observable.
