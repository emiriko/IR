Incorporating a variable capacitance diode into a radio-frequency matching
circuit allows us to in-situ tune the resonance frequency of an RF quantum
point contact, increasing the versatility of the latter as a fast charge sensor
of a proximal quantum circuit. The performance of this method is compared in
detail to conventional low-frequency charge detection. The approach is also
applicable to other RF-detection schemes, such as RF-SET circuits.
