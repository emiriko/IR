In this paper, we introduce the notion of "extension" of a toric variety and
study its fundamental properties. This gives rise to infinitely many toric
varieties with a special property, such as being set theoretic complete
intersection or arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay (Gorenstein) and having a
Cohen-Macaulay tangent cone or a local ring with non-decreasing Hilbert
function, from just one single example with the same property, verifying
Rossi's conjecture for larger classes and extending some results appeared in
literature.
