In the first part of thesis, we shall deal with fragment emission in central
collisions studied as a function of beam energy and system mass. Central
collisions are also important candidate in view of exploring collective
expansion and squeeze out phenomena \cite{dan93}. We have simulated the central
collisions of $^{20}Ne+^{20}Ne$, $^{40}Ar+^{45}Sc$, $^{58}Ni+^{58}Ni$,
$^{86}Kr+^{93}Nb$, $^{129}Xe+^{124}Sn$, and $^{197}Au+^{197}Au$. Peak IMF
multiplicity is observed to follow power law of form: $c A^{\tau}_{tot}$, with
exponent $\tau$ close to unity. Next we try to understand the clusterization
mechanism in spectator matter fragmentation using \emph{simulated annealing
clusterization algorithm} (SACA) advanced by Puri \emph{et al}. Earlier
recognition of fragments structure (around 60 fm/c) also points towards
dynamical origin of fragments.
  We shall also highlight the importance of momentum dependent interactions in
probing nuclear EoS via intermediate energy heavy-ion collisions. Estimation of
baryonic entropy would also be discussed.
