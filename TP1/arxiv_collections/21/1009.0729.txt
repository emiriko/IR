It is difficult for the common sense to admit that an object dropped from the
top of the mast of a ship moving at a constant velocity falls down at the
bottom of the mast because it keeps inside the horizontal movement of the ship.
This difficulty is similar to the one faced by early scientists from the
pre-classical science and staged by Galileo in his Dialogue concerning the two
chief world systems. This proximity leads us to elaborate a learning pathway in
which some elements of Galileo's dialogue are selected and reorganized
according to specific educational constraints. The relevance of the
teaching-learning sequence is asserted by the `didactical engineering'
framework and leans on the identification of students with the characters
staged by Galileo.
