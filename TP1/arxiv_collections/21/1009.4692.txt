We theoretically examine the use of a statistical distance measure, the
indistinguishability, as a generic tool for the identification of topological
order. We apply this measure to the toric code and two fractional quantum Hall
models. We find that topologically ordered states can be identified with the
indistinguishability for both models. Calculations with the
indistinguishability also underscore a key distinction between symmetries that
underlie topological order in the toric code and quantum Hall models.
