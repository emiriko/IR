In this letter we report on an experimental study of high harmonic radiation
generated in nanometer-scale foil targets irradiated under normal incidence.
The experiments constitute the first unambiguous observation of odd-numbered
relativistic harmonics generated by the $\vec{v}\times\vec{B}$ component of the
Lorentz force verifying a long predicted property of solid target harmonics.
Simultaneously the observed harmonic spectra allow in-situ extraction of the
target density in an experimental scenario which is of utmost interest for
applications such as ion acceleration by the radiation pressure of an
ultraintense laser.
