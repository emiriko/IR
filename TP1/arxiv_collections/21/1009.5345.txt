Hornberger and Vacchini [Phys. Rev. A82, 036101 (2010); arxiv:0907.3018]
claim that the specific collisional momentum decoherence, pointed out in my
recent work [Phys. Rev. A80, 064104 (2009); arXiv:0905.3908], is already
described by their theory. However, I have performed a calculation whereby I
disprove the authors' claim and refute their conclusion that my recent work had
no advantage over theirs.
