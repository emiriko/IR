We show that, by taking a bare mass spectrum with constant spacings for the
quark-antiquark propagators, which is subject to considerable mass shifts from
meson loops, one adequately describes a large variety of mesonic resonances,
from the light scalars to the b-bbar states. All our results indicate that a
harmonic-oscilator spectrum with universal frequency, in combination with
coupled-channel effects, does a much better job than the q-barq spectrum of the
funnel potential.
