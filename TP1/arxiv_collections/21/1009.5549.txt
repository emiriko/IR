We report on the design and performance of a near infra-red Mueller matrix
imaging ellipsometer, and apply the instrument to strain imag- ing in near
infra-red transparent solids. Particularly, we show that the instrument can be
used to investigate complex strain domains in multi-crystalline silicon wafers.
