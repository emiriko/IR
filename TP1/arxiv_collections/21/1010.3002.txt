In his pioneering work of 1831, Faraday demonstrated that a vertically
vibrated gas-liquid interface exhibits a period-doubling bifurcation from a
flat state to a wavy configuration at certain frequencies or amplitudes.
Typical experiments performed using thin layers of water produce "Faraday
ripples", modest-amplitude nonlinear standing waves. Later experiments by
Hashimoto and Sudo (1980) and Jameson (1966) as well as those performed in the
present study show that much more dramatic disturbances can be generated at the
gas-liquid free surface under certain ranges of vibration conditions. This
breakup mechanism was examined experimentally using deep layers of
polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) silicone oils over a range of viscosity and
sinusoidal, primarily axial vibration conditions that can produce dramatic
disturbances at the gas-liquid free surface. Large-amplitude vibrations produce
liquid jets into the gas, droplets pinching off from the jets, gas cavities in
the liquid from droplet impact, and bubble transport below the interface, all
of which can be seen in the videos. Experiments were performed using several
different PDMS silicone oils covering a range of viscosity (1-50 cSt, i.e.,
1-50 times nominal water) and relatively low surface tension (e.g., 0.25 times
nominal water) over a range of vibration conditions (100-150 Hz, less than 300
micron displacement, yielding accelerations ranging from 4 to 7 times
gravitational acceleration). The cylinder containing the silicone oil was 25.4
mm inner diameter and approximately 100 mm long. It was typically filled
halfway with the PDMS liquid, with ambient air above. High-speed videos were
recorded at 600 to 1000 frames per second. Applications include liquid fuel
rockets, inertial sensing devices, moving vehicles, mixing processes, and
acoustic excitation.
