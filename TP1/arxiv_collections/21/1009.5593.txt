Integrals of motion and statistical properties of quantized electromagnetic
field (e.-m. field) in time-dependent linear dielectric and conductive media
are considered, using Choi-Yeon quantization, based on Caldirola-Kanai type
Hamiltonian. Eigenstates of quadratic and linear invariants are constructed,
the solutions being expressed in terms of a complex parametric function that
obeys classical oscillator equation with time-varying frequency. The time
evolutions of initial Glauber coherent states and Fock states are considered.
The medium conductivity and the time-dependent electric permeability are shown
to generate squeezing and non-vanishing covariances. In the time-evolved
coherent and squeezed states all the second statistical moments of the electric
and magnetic field components are calculated and shown to mminimize the
Robertson-Schr\"odinger uncertainty relation.
