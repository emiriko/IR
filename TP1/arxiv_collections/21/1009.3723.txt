We examine the number of cycles of length k in a permutation, as a function
on the symmetric group. We write it explicitly as a combination of characters
of irreducible representations. This allows to study formation of long cycles
in the interchange process, including a precise formula for the probability
that the permutation is one long cycle at a given time t, and estimates for the
cases of shorter cycles.
