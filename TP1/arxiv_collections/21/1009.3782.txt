We introduce an entanglement criterion to exclude full separability of
quantum states. We present numerical evidence that the criterion is necessary
and sufficient for the class of GHZ diagonal three-qubit states and estimate
the volume of bound entangled states within this class. Finally, we extend our
approach to bound entangled states which are not GHZ diagonal.
