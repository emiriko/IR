This work deals with function theory on quantum complex hyperbolic spaces.
The principal notions are expounded. We obtain explicit formulas for invariant
integrals on `finite' functions on a quantum hyperbolic space and on the
associated quantum isotropic cone. Also we establish principal series of $U_q
\mathfrak{su}_{n,m}$-modules related to this cone, and obtain the necessary
conditions for those modules to be equivalent.
