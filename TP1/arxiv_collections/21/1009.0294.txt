We study the potential to observe CP-violating effects in SUSY cascade decay
chains at the LHC. Asymmetries composed by triple products of momenta of the
final state particles are sensitive to CP-violating effects. Due to large
boosts that dilute the asymmetries, these can be difficult to observe.
Extending the methods of momentum reconstruction we show that the original size
of these asymmetries may be measurable. A study is done at the hadronic level
with backgrounds to estimate the expected sensitivity at the LHC.
