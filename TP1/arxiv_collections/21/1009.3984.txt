An exact-match overlap graph of $n$ given strings of length $\ell$ is an
edge-weighted graph in which each vertex is associated with a string and there
is an edge $(x,y)$ of weight $\omega = \ell - |ov_{max}(x,y)|$ if and only if
$\omega \leq \lambda$, where $|ov_{max}(x,y)|$ is the length of $ov_{max}(x,y)$
and $\lambda$ is a given threshold. In this paper, we show that the exact-match
overlap graphs can be represented by a compact data structure that can be
stored using at most $(2\lambda -1 )(2\lceil\log n\rceil +
\lceil\log\lambda\rceil)n$ bits with a guarantee that the basic operation of
accessing an edge takes $O(\log \lambda)$ time.
  Exact-match overlap graphs have been broadly used in the context of DNA
assembly and the \emph{shortest super string problem} where the number of
strings $n$ ranges from a couple of thousands to a couple of billions, the
length $\ell$ of the strings is from 25 to 1000, depending on DNA sequencing
technologies. However, many DNA assemblers using overlap graphs are facing a
major problem of constructing and storing them. Especially, it is impossible
for these DNA assemblers to handle the huge amount of data produced by the next
generation sequencing technologies where the number of strings $n$ is usually
very large ranging from hundred million to a couple of billions. In fact, to
our best knowledge there is no DNA assemblers that can handle such a large
number of strings. Fortunately, with our compact data structure, the major
problem of constructing and storing overlap graphs is practically solved since
it only requires linear time and and linear memory. As a result, it opens the
door of possibilities to build a DNA assembler that can handle large-scale
datasets efficiently.
