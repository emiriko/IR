In this paper, we first discuss the concept of an emission wave. In the
history of science, this is the first time we have discovered a new way in
which (transverse) waves are realized in nature. It can therefore be expected
to lead to important changes in the perspective about the nature of light or
radiation. Then, we point out that the null result of the Michelson-Morley
experiment is a natural and straightforward consequence of light being an
emission wave. Concepts of special relativity, of length contraction and of
time dilation, are not required for this explanation, however.
