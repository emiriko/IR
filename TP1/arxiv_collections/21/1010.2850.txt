A steering fragment of an instruction sequence consists of a sequence of
steering instructions. These are decision points involving the check of a
propositional statement in sequential logic. The question is addressed why
composed propositional statements occur in steering fragments given the fact
that a straightforward transformation allows their elimination. A survey is
provided of constraints that may be implicitly assumed when composed
propositional statements occur in a meaningful instruction sequence.
