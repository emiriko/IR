The colour fields, created by a static gluon-quark-antiquark system, are
computed in quenched SU(3) lattice QCD, in a $24^3\times 48$ lattice at
$\beta=6.2$ and $a=0.07261(85)\,fm$. We study two geometries, one with a U
shape and another with an L shape. The particular cases of the two gluon
glueball and quark-antiquark are also studied, and the Casimir scaling is
investigated in a microscopic perspective. This also contributes to understand
confinement with flux tubes and to discriminate between the models of
fundamental versus adjoint confining strings, analogous to type-II and type-I
superconductivity.
