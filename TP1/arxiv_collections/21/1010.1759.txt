We examine the problem of jet reconstruction at heavy-ion colliders using
jet-area-based background subtraction tools as provided by FastJet. We use
Monte Carlo simulations with and without quenching to study the performance of
several jet algorithms, including the option of filtering, under conditions
corresponding to RHIC and LHC collisions. We find that most standard algorithms
perform well, though the anti-kt and filtered Cambridge/Aachen algorithms have
clear advantages in terms of the reconstructed transverse-momentum offset and
dispersion.
