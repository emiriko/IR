We examine the problem of stability of persistent currents in a mixture of
two Bose gases trapped in an annular potential. We evaluate the critical
coupling for metastability in the transition from quasi-one to two-dimensional
motion. We also evaluate the critical coupling for metastability in a mixture
of two species as function of the population imbalance. The stability of the
currents is shown to be sensitive to the deviation from one-dimensional motion.
