We review work on construction of Monopoles in higher dimensions. These are
solutions to a particular class of models descending from Yang--Mills systems
on even dimensional bulk, with Spheres as codimensions. The topological lower
bounds on the Yang-Mills action translate to Bogomol'nyi lower bounds on the
residual Yang-Mills-Higgs systems. Mostly, consideration is restricted to 8
dimensional bulk systems, but extension to the arbitrary case follows
systematically. After presenting the monopoles, the corresponding dyons are
also constructed. Finally, new Chern-Simons densities expressed in terms of
Yang-Mills and Higgs fields are presented. These are defined in all dimensions,
including in even dimensional spacetimes. They are constructed by subjecting
the dimensionally reduced Chern-Pontryagin densites to further descent by two
steps.
