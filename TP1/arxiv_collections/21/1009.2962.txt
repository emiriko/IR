The laser cooling and trapping of ultracold neutral dysprosium has been
recently demonstrated using the broad, open 421-nm cycling transition.
Narrow-line magneto-optical trapping of Dy on longer wavelength transitions
would enable the preparation of ultracold Dy samples suitable for loading
optical dipole traps and subsequent evaporative cooling. We have identified the
closed 741-nm cycling transition as a candidate for the narrow-line cooling of
Dy. We present experimental data on the isotope shifts, the hyperfine constants
A and B, and the decay rate of the 741-nm transition. In addition, we report a
measurement of the 421-nm transition's linewidth, which agrees with previous
measurements. We summarize the laser cooling characteristics of these
transitions as well as other narrow cycling transitions that may prove useful
for cooling Dy.
