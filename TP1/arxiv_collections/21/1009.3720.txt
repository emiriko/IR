We analyze the randomness of the sky distribution of cosmic gamma-ray bursts.
These events are associated with massive galaxies, spiral or elliptical, and
therefore their positions should trace the large-scale structure, which, in
turn, could show up in the sky distribution of fluctuations of the cosmic
microwave background (CMB). We test this hypothesis by mosaic correlation
mapping of the distributions of CMB peaks and burst positions, find the
distribution of these two signals to be correlated, and interpret this
correlation as a possible systematic effect.
