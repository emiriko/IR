The transverse spatial effects observed in photon pairs produced by
parametric down-conversion provide a robust and fertile testing ground for
studies of quantum mechanics, non-classical states of light, correlated imaging
and quantum information. Over the last 20 years there has been much progress in
this area, ranging from technical advances and applications such as quantum
imaging to investigations of fundamental aspects of quantum physics such as
complementarity relations, Bell's inequality violation and entanglement. The
field has grown immensely: a quick search shows that there are hundreds of
papers published in this field. The objective of this article is to review the
building blocks and major theoretical and experimental advances in the field,
along with some possible technical applications and connections to other
research areas.
