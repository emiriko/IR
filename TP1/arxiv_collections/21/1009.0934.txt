Isolated and Dynamical horizons are used to generate boundary conditions upon
the lapse and shift vectors. Numerous results involving the Hamiltonian of
General relativity are derived, including a self-contained derivation of the
Hamiltonian equations of general relativity using both a direct 'brute force'
method of directly computing Lie derivatives, as well as the standard Hamil-
tonian approach. Conclusions are compared to numerous examples, including the
Kerr, Schwarzschild-De Sitter, McVittie, and Vaiyda spacetimes.
