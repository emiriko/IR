We report detailed very low temperature resistivity measurements on the heavy
fermion compounds Ce_{1-x}La_{x}CoIn5 (x=0 and x=0.01), with current applied in
two crystallographic directions [100] (basal plane) and [001] (perpendicular to
the basal plane) under magnetic field applied in the [001] or [011] direction.
We found a Fermi liquid (\rho \propto T^{2}) ground state, in all cases, for
fields above the superconducting upper critical field. We discuss the possible
location of a field induced quantum critical point with respect to Hc2(0), and
compare our measurements with the previous reports in order to give a clear
picture of the experimental status on this long debated issue.
