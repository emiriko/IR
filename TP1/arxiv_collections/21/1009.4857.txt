We use VLT/FLAMES intermediate resolution (R~6500) spectra of individual red
giant branch stars in the near-infrared CaII triplet (CaT) region to
investigate the wide-area metallicity properties and internal kinematics of the
Sextans dwarf spheroidal galaxy (dSph). Our final sample consists of 174
probable members of Sextans with accurate line-of-sight velocities (+- 2 km/s)
and CaT [Fe/H] measurements (+- 0.2 dex). We use the MgI line at 8806.8 \AA\,
as an empirical discriminator for distinguishing between probable members of
the dSph (giant stars) and probable Galactic contaminants (dwarf stars).
Sextans shows a similar chemo-dynamical behaviour to other Milky Way dSphs,
with its central regions being more metal rich than the outer parts and with
the more metal-rich stars displaying colder kinematics than the more metal-poor
stars. Hints of a velocity gradient are found along the projected major axis
and along an axis at P.A.=191 deg, however a larger and more spatially extended
sample may be necessary to pin down the amplitude and direction of this
gradient. We detect a cold kinematic substructure at the centre of Sextans,
consistent with being the remnant of a disrupted very metal poor stellar
cluster. We derive the most extended line-of-sight velocity dispersion profile
for Sextans, out to a projected radius of 1.6 deg. From Jeans modelling of the
observed line-of-sight velocity dispersion profile we find that this is
consistent with both a cored dark matter halo with large core radius and cuspy
halo with low concentration. The mass within the last measured point is in the
range 2-4 x 10^8 M_sun, giving very large mass-to-light ratios, from 460 to 920
(M/L)_(V,sun).
