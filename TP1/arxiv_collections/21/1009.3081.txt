We report an experimental demonstration of quantum Deutsch's algorithm by
using linear-optical system. By employing photon's polarization and spatial
modes, we implement all balanced and constant functions for quantum computer.
The experimental system is very stable and the experimental data are excellent
in accordance with the theoretical results.
