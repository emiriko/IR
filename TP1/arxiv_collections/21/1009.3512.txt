FN CMa is visually double with a separation of about 0.6arcsec. Sixty
high-cadence VLT/UVES spectra permit the A and B components to be disentangled,
as the relative contribution of each star to the total light entering the
spectrograph fluctuates between exposures due to changes in seeing. Component A
exhibits rapid line-profile variations, leading us to attribute the photometric
variability seen by HIPPARCOS (with a derived P=0.08866d) to this component.
From a total of 122 archival and new echelle spectra it is shown that component
A is an SB1 binary with an orbital period of 117.55 days. The eccentricity of
0.6 may result in tidal modulation of the pulsation(s) of component Aa.
