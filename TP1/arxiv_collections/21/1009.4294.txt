A number of metric (100-650 MHz) typeII bursts was recorded by the ARTEMIS-IV
radiospectrograph in the 1998-2000 period; the sample includes both CME driven
shocks and shocks originating from flare blasts. We study their characteristics
in comparison with characteristics of associated CMEs and flares.
