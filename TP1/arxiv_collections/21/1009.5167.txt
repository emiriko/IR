A combinatorial substitution is a map over tilings which allows to define
sets of tilings with a strong hierarchical structure. In this paper, we show
that such sets of tilings are sofic, that is, can be enforced by finitely many
local constraints. This extends some similar previous results (Mozes'90,
Goodman-Strauss'98) in a much shorter presentation.
