We perform separation of variables for the symplectic Weyl character using
Sklyanin's scheme. Viewing the characters as eigenfunctions of a quantum
integrable system, we explicitly construct the separating operator using the
Q-operator method. We also construct the inverse of the separating operator, as
well as the factorised Hamiltonian.
