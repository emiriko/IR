A Hom-type generalization of non-commutative Poisson algebras, called
non-commutative Hom-Poisson algebras, are studied. They are closed under
twisting by suitable self-maps. Hom-Poisson algebras, in which the
Hom-associative product is commutative, are closed under tensor products.
Through (de)polarization Hom-Poisson algebras are equivalent to admissible
Hom-Poisson algebras, each of which has only one binary operation.
Multiplicative admissible Hom-Poisson algebras are Hom-power associative.
