We use algebraic topology to investigate local curvature properties of the
moduli spaces of gauged vortices on a closed Riemann surface. After computing
the homotopy type of the universal cover of the moduli spaces (which are
symmetric powers of the surface), we prove that, for genus g>1, the holomorphic
bisectional curvature of the vortex metrics cannot always be nonnegative in the
multivortex case, and this property extends to all Kaehler metrics on certain
symmetric powers. Our result rules out an established and natural conjecture on
the geometry of the moduli spaces.
