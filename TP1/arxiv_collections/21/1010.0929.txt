The phenomenon of magnetic quantum oscillations in the superconducting state
poses several questions that still defy satisfactory answers. A key
controversial issue concerns the additional damping observed in the vortex
state. Here, we show results of \mu SR, dHvA, and SQUID magnetization
measurements on borocarbide superconductors, indicating that a sharp drop
observed in the dHvA amplitude just below H_{c2} is correlated with enhanced
disorder of the vortex lattice in the peak-effect region, which significantly
enhances quasiparticle scattering by the pair potential.
