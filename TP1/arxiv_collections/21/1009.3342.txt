We establish a correspondence between the invariant subsets of a
non-degenerate symmetric set-theoretical solution of the quantum Yang-Baxter
equation and the parabolic subgroups of its structure group, equipped with its
canonical Garside structure. Moreover, we introduce the notion of a foldable
solution, which extends the one of a decomposable solution.
