Neutrinos are fundamental particles ubiquitous in the Universe. Their
properties remain elusive despite more than 50 years of intense research
activity. In this review we remind the reader of the noticeable properties of
these particles and of the stakes of the solar neutrino puzzle. The Standard
Solar Model triggered persistent efforts in fundamental Physics to predict the
solar neutrino fluxes, and its constantly evolving predictions have been
regularly compared to the detected neutrino signals. Anticipating that this
standard model could not reproduce the internal solar dynamics, a SEismic Solar
Model was developed which enriched theoretical neutrino flux predictions with
in situ observation of acoustic waves propagating in the Sun. This review
reminds the historical steps, from the pioneering Homestake detection, the
GALLEX- SAGE captures of the first pp neutrinos and emphasizes the importance
of the Superkamiokande and SNO detectors to demonstrate that the solar-emitted
electronic neutrinos are partially transformed into other neutrino flavors
before reaching the Earth. The success of BOREXINO in detecting the 7 Be
neutrino signal justifies the building of a new generation of detectors to
measure the entire solar neutrino spectrum. A coherent picture emerged from
neutrino physics and helioseismology. Today, new paradigms take shape:
determining the masses of neutrinos and the research on the Sun is focusing on
the dynamical aspects and on signature of dark matter. The third part of the
review is dedicated to this prospect. The understanding of the crucial role of
both rotation and magnetism in solar physics benefit from SoHO, SDO, and PICARD
space observations. For now, the particle and stellar challenges seem
decoupled, but this is only a superficial appearance. The development of
asteroseismology shows the far-reaching impact of Neutrino and Stellar
Astronomy.
