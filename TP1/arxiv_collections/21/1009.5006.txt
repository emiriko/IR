Spatial interference of quantum mechanical particles exhibits a fundamental
feature of quantum mechanics. A two-mode entangled state of N particles known
as N00N state can give rise to non-classical interference. We report the first
experimental observation of a three-photon N00N state exhibiting Young's
double-slit type spatial quantum interference. Compared to a single-photon
state, the three-photon entangled state generates interference fringes that are
three times denser. Moreover, its interference visibility of $0.49 \pm 0.09$ is
well above the limit of 0.1 for spatial super-resolution of classical origin.
The demonstration of spatial quantum interference by a N00N state composed of
more than two photons represents an important step towards applying quantum
entanglement to technologies such as lithography and imaging.
