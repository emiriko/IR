In this article, a study of the scalar field shells in relativistic
spherically symmetric configurations has been performed. We construct the
composite solution of Jordan-Brans-Dicke field equation by matching the
conformal Brans solutions at each junction surfaces. This approach allows us to
associate rigorously with all solutions as a single glued "space", which is a
unique differentiable manifold M^4.
