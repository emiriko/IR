In this paper we propose a new nonparametric approach to interacting failing
systems (FS), that is systems whose probability of failure is not negligible in
a fixed time horizon, a typical example being firms and financial bonds. The
main purpose when studying a FS is to calculate the probability of default and
the distribution of the number of failures that may occur during the
observation period. A model used to study a failing system is defined default
model. In particular, we present a general recursive model constructed by the
means of inter- acting urns. After introducing the theoretical model and its
properties we show a first application to credit risk modeling, showing how to
assess the idiosyncratic probability of default of an obligor and the joint
probability of failure of a set of obligors in a portfolio of risks, that are
divided into reliability classes.
