We build on a recent paper by Grinstein, Redi and Villadoro, where a see-saw
like mechanism for quark masses was derived in the context of spontaneously
broken gauged flavour symmetries. The see-saw mechanism is induced by heavy
Dirac fermions which are added to the Standard Model spectrum in order to
render the flavour symmetries anomaly-free. In this letter we report on the
embedding of these fermions into multiplets of an SU(5) grand unified theory
and discuss a number of interesting consequences.
