A modification of the cavity technique for axion dark matter detection is
described in which the cavity is driven with input power instead of being
permeated by a static magnetic field. A small fraction of the input power is
pumped by the axion field to a receiving mode of frequency $\omega_1$ when the
resonance condition $\omega_1 = \omega_0 \pm m_a$ is satisfied, where
$\omega_0$ is the frequency of the input mode and $m_a$ the axion mass. The
relevant form factor is calculated for any pair of input and output modes in a
cylindrical cavity. The overall search strategy is discussed and the technical
challenges to be overcome by an actual experiment are listed.
