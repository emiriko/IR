Although object-orientation has been around for several decades, its key
concept abstraction has not been exploited for proper application of
object-orientation in other phases of software development than the
implementation phase. We mention some issues that lead to a lot of confusion
and obscurity with object-orientation and its application in software
development. We describe object-orientation as abstract as possible such that
it can be applied to all phases of software development.
