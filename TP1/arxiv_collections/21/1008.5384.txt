Using convex optimization, we propose entanglement-assisted quantum error
correction procedures that are optimized for given noise channels. We
demonstrate through numerical examples that such an optimized error correction
method achieves higher channel fidelities than existing methods. This improved
performance, which leads to perfect error correction for a larger class of
error channels, is interpreted in at least some cases by quantum teleportation,
but for general channels this interpretation does not hold.
