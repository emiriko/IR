We report on a bistable light transmission through a planar metamaterial
composed of a metal pattern of weakly asymmetric elements placed on a nonlinear
substrate. Such structure bears the Fano-like sharp resonance response of a
trapped-mode excitation. The feedback required for bistability is provided by
the coupling between the strong antiphased trapped-mode-resonance currents
excited on the metal elements and the intensity of inner field in the nonlinear
substrate.
