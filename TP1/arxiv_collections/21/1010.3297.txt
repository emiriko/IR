This is a fluid dynamics video illustrating the impact of ferrofluidic
droplets on surfaces of variable wettability. Surfaces studied include mica,
teflon, and superhydrophobic. A magnet is placed beneath each surface, which
modifies the behavior of the ferrofluid by applying additional downward force
apart from gravity resulting in reduced droplet size and increased droplet
velocity. For the superhydrophobic droplet a jetting phenomena is shown which
only occurs in a limited range of impact speeds, higher than observed before,
followed by amplified oscillation due to magnetic field as the drop stabilizes
on the surface.
