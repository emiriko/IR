This paper presents and implements an iterative feedback design algorithm for
stabilisation of discrete-time switched systems under arbitrary switching
regimes. The algorithm seeks state feedback gains so that the closed-loop
switching system admits a common quadratic Lyapunov function (CQLF) and hence
is uniformly globally exponentially stable. Although the feedback design
problem considered can be solved directly via linear matrix inequalities
(LMIs), direct application of LMIs for feedback design does not provide
information on closed-loop system structure. In contrast, the feedback matrices
computed by the proposed algorithm assign closed-loop structure approximating
that required to satisfy Lie-algebraic conditions that guarantee existence of a
CQLF. The main contribution of the paper is to provide, for single-input
systems, a numerical implementation of the algorithm based on iterative
approximate common eigenvector assignment, and to establish cases where such
algorithm is guaranteed to succeed. We include pseudocode and a few numerical
examples to illustrate advantages and limitations of the proposed technique.
