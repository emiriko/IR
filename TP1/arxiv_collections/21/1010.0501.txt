We investigate quantum transport properties of triangular graphene flakes
with zigzag edges by using first principles calculations. Triangular graphene
flakes have large magnetic moments which vary with the number of hydrogen atoms
terminating its edge atoms and scale with its size. Electronic transmission and
current-voltage characteristics of these flakes, when contacted with metallic
electrodes, reveal spin valve and remarkable rectification features. The
transition from ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic state under bias voltage
can, however, terminate the spin polarizing effects for specific flakes.
Geometry and size dependent transport properties of graphene flakes may be
crucial for spintronic nanodevice applications.
