We study the dependence on the strength and orientation of applied uniaxial
strain of the Drude weight in the conductivity of graphene. We find a
nonmonotonic dependence on strain, which may be related to the proximity to
several strain-induced electronic topological transitions. Given the relation
between the Drude weight and the long-wavelength plasmon frequency, such a
strain dependence can be evidenced by infrared spectroscopy measurements.
