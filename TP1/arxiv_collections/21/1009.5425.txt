We present interferometric observations of the Be star Zeta Tau obtained
using the MIRC beam combiner at the CHARA Array. We resolved the disk during
four epochs in 2007-2009. We fit the data with a geometric model to
characterize the circumstellar disk as a skewed elliptical Gaussian and the
central Be star as a uniform disk. The visibilities reveal a nearly edge-on
disk with a FWHM major axis of ~ 1.8 mas in the H-band. The non-zero closure
phases indicate an asymmetry within the disk. Interestingly, when combining our
results with previously published interferometric observations of Zeta Tau, we
find a correlation between the position angle of the disk and the spectroscopic
V/R ratio, suggesting that the tilt of the disk is precessing. This work is
part of a multi-year monitoring campaign to investigate the development and
outward motion of asymmetric structures in the disks of Be stars.
