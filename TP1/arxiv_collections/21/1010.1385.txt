We present results from a comprehensive imaging survey of 70 radio galaxies
at redshifts 1<z<5.2 using all three cameras onboard the Spitzer Space
Telescope. The resulting spectral energy distributions unambiguously show a
stellar population in 46 sources and hot dust emission associated with the
active nucleus in 59. Using a new restframe S_3um/S_1.6um versus S_um/S_3um
criterion, we identify 42 sources where the restframe 1.6um emission from the
stellar population can be measured. For these radio galaxies, the median
stellar mass is high, 2x10^11 M_sun, and remarkably constant within the range
1<z<3. At z>3, there is tentative evidence for a factor of two decrease in
stellar mass. This suggests that radio galaxies have assembled the bulk of
their stellar mass by z~3, but confirmation by more detailed decomposition of
stellar and AGN emission is needed.
  The restframe 500 MHz radio luminosities are only marginally correlated with
stellar mass but are strongly correlated with the restframe 5um hot dust
luminosity. This suggests that the radio galaxies have a large range of
Eddington ratios. We also present new Very Large Array 4.86 and 8.46 GHz
imaging of 14 radio galaxies and find that radio core dominance --- an
indicator of jet orientation --- is strongly correlated with hot dust
luminosity. While all of our targets were selected as narrow-lined, type 2
AGNs, this result can be understood in the context of orientation-dependent
models if there is a continuous distribution of orientations from obscured type
2 to unobscured type 1 AGNs rather than a clear dichotomy. Finally, four radio
galaxies have nearby (<6") companions whose mid-IR colors are suggestive of
their being AGNs. This may indicate an association between radio galaxy
activity and major mergers.
