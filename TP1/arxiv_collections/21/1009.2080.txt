The semiclassical formula for the coherent-state propagator is written in
terms of complex classical trajectories of an equivalent classical system.
Depending on the parameters involved, more than one trajectory may contribute
to the calculation. Eventually, however, two contributing trajectories
coalesce, characterizing what is called phase space caustic. In this case, the
usual semiclassical formula for the propagator diverges, so that a uniform
approximation is required to avoid this singularity. In this paper, we present
a non-trivial application illustrating this scenario, and showing the accuracy
of the uniform formula that we have previously derived.
