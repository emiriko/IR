Electron transport in bilayer graphene placed under a perpendicular electric
field is revealed experimentally. Steep increase of the resistance is observed
under high electric field; however, the resistance does not diverge even at low
temperatures. The observed temperature dependence of the conductance consists
of two contributions: the thermally activated (TA) conduction and the variable
range hopping (VRH) conduction. We find that for the measured electric field
range (0 - 1.3 V/nm) the mobility gap extracted from the TA behavior agrees
well with the theoretical prediction for the band gap opening in bilayer
graphene, although the VRH conduction deteriorates the insulating state more
seriously in bilayer graphene with smaller mobility. These results show that
the improvement of the mobility is crucial for the successful operation of the
bilayer graphene field effect transistor.
