We show that the optical absorbance detection of nuclear spin echo gives
direct access to the spin concentration, unlike most coherent signal detection
techniques where the signal intensity/amplitude is difficult to connect
experimentally with the spin concentration. This way we measure the spin
refocusing efficiency in a crystal of Tm$^{3+}$:YAG. Given the large
inhomogeneous broadening of the spin transition in this material, rephasing the
spins with the usual hard pulse procedure would require excessively high
radiofrequency power. Instead we resort to an adiabatic pulse sequence that
perfectly returns the spins to their initial common orientation, at low power
cost.
