We present measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) power
spectrum made by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope at 148 GHz and 218 GHz, as
well as the cross-frequency spectrum between the two channels. Our results
clearly show the second through the seventh acoustic peaks in the CMB power
spectrum. The measurements of these higher-order peaks provide an additional
test of the {\Lambda}CDM cosmological model. At l > 3000, we detect power in
excess of the primary anisotropy spectrum of the CMB. At lower multipoles 500 <
l < 3000, we find evidence for gravitational lensing of the CMB in the power
spectrum at the 2.8{\sigma} level. We also detect a low level of Galactic dust
in our maps, which demonstrates that we can recover known faint, diffuse
signals.
