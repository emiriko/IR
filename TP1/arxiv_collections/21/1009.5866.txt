We use the Herschel-ATLAS science demonstration data to investigate the
star-formation properties of radio-selected galaxies in the GAMA-9h field as a
function of radio luminosity and redshift. Radio selection at the lowest radio
luminosities, as expected, selects mostly starburst galaxies. At higher radio
luminosities, where the population is dominated by AGN, we find that some
individual objects are associated with high far-infrared luminosities. However,
the far-infrared properties of the radio-loud population are statistically
indistinguishable from those of a comparison population of radio-quiet galaxies
matched in redshift and K-band absolute magnitude. There is thus no evidence
that the host galaxies of these largely low-luminosity (Fanaroff-Riley class
I), and presumably low-excitation, AGN, as a population, have particularly
unusual star-formation histories. Models in which the AGN activity in
higher-luminosity, high-excitation radio galaxies is triggered by major mergers
would predict a luminosity-dependent effect that is not seen in our data (which
only span a limited range in radio luminosity) but which may well be detectable
with the full Herschel-ATLAS dataset.
