I will review the main observational properties of the new Galactic High Mass
X-ray Binaries discovered by the INTEGRAL satellite in the hard energy range
17-100 keV. About 70% of the newly discovered HMXBs host OB supergiant
companions and show peculiar properties with respect to classical HMXBs
detected with previous missions: some of them display huge local absorptions,
in excess of 1E23 cm^-2 (the so-called obscured sources), while others show
fast transient X-ray emission, leading to the definition of a new sub-class of
HMXBs, the so-called Supergiant Fast X-ray Transients. Their peculiar behavior
is still poorly understood and represents a challenge to theory.
