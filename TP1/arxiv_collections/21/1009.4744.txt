We propose local strategies to protect global quantum information. The
protocols, which are quantum error correcting codes for dissipative systems,
are based on environment measurements, direct feedback control and simple
encoding of the logical qubits into physical qutrits whose decaying transitions
are indistinguishable and equally probable. The simple addition of one extra
level in the description of the subsystems allows for local actions to fully
and deterministically protect global resources, such as entanglement. We
present codes for both quantum jump and quantum state diffusion measurement
strategies and test them against several sources of inefficiency. The use of
qutrits in information protocols suggests further characterization of
qutrit-qutrit disentanglement dynamics, which we also give together with simple
local environment measurement schemes able to prevent distillability sudden
death and even enhance entanglement in situations in which our feedback error
correction is not possible.
