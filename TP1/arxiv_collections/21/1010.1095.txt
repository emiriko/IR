We study finite dimensional algebras that appear as fibers of quantum orders
over a given point of variety of center. We present the formula for the number
of irreducible representations and check it for it for the algebra of twisted
polynomials, the quantum Weyl algebra and the algebra of regular functions on
quantum group.
