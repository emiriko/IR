We review in details some recently proposed kinetic models of opinion
dynamics. We discuss the several variants including a generalised model. We
provide mean field estimates for the critical points, which are numerically
supported with reasonable accuracy. Using non-equilibrium relaxation
techniques, we also investigate the nature of phase transitions observed in
these models. We study the nature of correlations as the critical points are
approached, and comment on the universality of the phase transitions observed.
