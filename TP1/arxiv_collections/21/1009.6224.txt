Measurements of double-helicity asymmetries for inclusive hadron production
in polarized p+p collisions are sensitive to helicity--dependent parton
distribution functions, in particular to the gluon helicity distribution,
Delta(g). This study focuses on the extraction of the double-helicity asymmetry
in eta production: polarized p+p --> eta + X, the eta cross section, and the
eta/pi^0 cross section ratio. The cross section and ratio measurements provide
essential input for the extraction of fragmentation functions that are needed
to access the helicity-dependent parton distribution functions.
