We present a global study of low mass, young stellar object (YSO) surface
densities in nearby (< 500 pc) star forming regions based on a comprehensive
collection of Spitzer Space Telescope surveys. We show that the distribution of
YSO surface densities in the solar neighbourhood is a smooth distribution,
being adequately described by a lognormal function from a few to 10^3 YSOs per
pc^2, with a peak at 22 stars/pc^2 and a dispersion of 0.85. We do not find
evidence for multiple discrete modes of star-formation (e.g. clustered and
distributed). Comparing the observed surface density distribution to previously
reported surface density threshold definitions of clusters, we find that the
fraction of stars in clusters is crucially dependent on the adopted
definitions, ranging from 40 to 90%. However, we find that only a low fraction
(< 26%) of stars are formed in dense environments where their
formation/evolution (along with their circumstellar disks and/or planets) may
be affected by the close proximity of their low-mass neighbours.
