We present a project on study of groups composed of dwarf galaxies only. We
selected such structures using HyperLEDA and NED databases with visual
inspection on SDSS images and on digital copy of POSS. The groups are
characterized by size of few tens of kpc and line-of-sight velocity dispersion
about 18 km/s. Our groups similar to associations of nearby dwarfs from Tully
et al. (2006). This specific population of multiple dwarf galaxies such as
IZw18 may contain significant amount of dark matter. It is very likely that we
see them at the stage just before merging of its components.
