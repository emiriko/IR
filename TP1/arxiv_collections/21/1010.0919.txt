Essential oils have antifungal and antipathogenic effects and therefore are
targets in plant pathology research for their potential uses as natural
substitutes for inorganic plant pesticides. Beauveria bassiana, an
entomopathogenic fungus, can endophytically colonize a vast number of plant
species and trigger induced systemic resistance against plant pathogens. Spore
germination is the most vulnerable in the fungal life cycle and is therefore a
good candidate for monitoring the effect of essential oils on the growth of B.
bassiana. Percentage germination of fungal spores and length of germination
tubes were recorded from experiments. A mathematical model that was able to
capture the effects of cymene, an essential oil produced by Monarda, on the
germination and growth was developed. This is the first report of a model for
the impact of essential oils on B. bassiana spore germination.
