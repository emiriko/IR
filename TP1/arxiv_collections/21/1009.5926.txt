We study the diamagnetism of the 6-vertex model with the arrows as directed
bond currents. To our knowledge, this is the first study of the diamagnetism of
this model. A special version of this model, called F model, describes the
thermal disordering transition of an orbital antiferromagnet, known as
d-density wave (DDW), a proposed state for the pseudogap phase of the high-Tc
cuprates. We find that the F model is strongly diamagnetic and the
susceptibility may diverge in the high temperature critical phase with power
law arrow correlations. These results may explain the surprising recent
observation of a diverging low-field diamagnetic susceptibility seen in some
optimally doped cuprates within the DDW model of the pseudogap phase.
