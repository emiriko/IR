We extend our result of [1] and show that one can associate with the
stochastically perturbed non-viscid Burgers equation a system of viscous
balance laws. The Cauchy data for the Burgers equation generates the data for
this system. Till the moment of the shock formation in the solution to the
Burgers equation the above system of viscous balance laws can be reduced to the
pressureless gas dynamics system (in a limit as the parameters of perturbation
tend to zero). If the solution to the Burgers equation contains shocks, the
limit system is equivalent to the system with a specific pressure, in some
sense analogous to the pressure of barotropic monoatomic gas.
