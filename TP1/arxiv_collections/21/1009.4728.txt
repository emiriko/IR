The paper estimates the rate of convergence of the weak Euler approximation
for the solutions of SDEs with Hoelder continuous coefficients driven by point
and martingale measures. The equation considered has a non-degenerate main part
whose jump intensity measure is absolutely continuous with respect to the Levy
measure of a spherically-symmetric stable process. It includes the
nondegenerate diffusions and SDEs driven by Levy processes.
