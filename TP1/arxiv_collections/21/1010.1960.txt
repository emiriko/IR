Several recent experiments in biology study systems composed of several
interacting elements, for example neuron networks. Normally, measurements
describe only the collective behavior of the system, even if in most cases we
would like to characterize how its different parts interact. The goal of this
thesis is to extract information about the microscopic interactions as a
function of their collective behavior for two different cases. First, we will
study a system described by a generalized Ising model. We find explicit
formulas for the couplings as a function of the correlations and
magnetizations. In the following, we will study a system described by a
Hopfield model. In this case, we find not only explicit formula for inferring
the patterns, but also an analytical result that allows one to estimate how
much data is necessary for a good inference.
