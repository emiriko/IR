The Hilbert series is computed for the lepton flavor invariants of the
Standard Model with three generations including the right-handed neutrino
sector needed to generate light neutrino masses via the see-saw mechanism. We
also compute the Hilbert series of the quark flavor invariants for the case of
four generations.
