We compute the Parisi overlap distribution for paperfolding sequences. It
turns out to be discrete, and to live on the dyadic rationals. Hence it is a
pure point measure whose support is the full interval [-1; +1]. The space of
paperfolding sequences has an ultrametric structure. Our example provides an
illustration of some properties which were suggested to occur for pure states
in spin glass models.
