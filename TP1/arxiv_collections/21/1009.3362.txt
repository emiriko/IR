We introduce from an experimental point of view the main concepts of
fluctuation theorems for work, heat and entropy production in out of
equilibrium systems. We will discuss the important difference between the
applications of these concepts to stochastic systems and to a second class of
systems (chaotic systems) where the fluctuations are induced either by chaotic
flows or by fluctuating driving forces. We will mainly analyze the stochastic
systems using the measurements performed in two experiments : a) a harmonic
oscillator driven out of equilibrium by an external force b) a colloidal
particle trapped in a time dependent double well potential. We will rapidly
describe some consequences of fluctuation theorems and some useful applications
to the analysis of experimental data. As an example the case of a molecular
motor will be analyzed in some details. Finally we will discuss the problems
related to the applications of fluctuation theorems to chaotic systems.
