We report the observation of the Inverse Cotton-Mouton Effect (ICME) i.e. a
magnetization induced in a medium by non resonant linearly polarized light
propagating in the presence of a transverse magnetic field. We present a
detailed study of the ICME in a TGG crystal showing the dependence of the
measured effect on the light intensity, the optical polarization, and on the
external magnetic field. We derive a relation between the Cotton-Mouton and
Inverse Cotton-Mouton effects that is roughly in agreement with existing
experimental data. Our results open the way to applications of the ICME in
optical devices.
