Quantum teleportation faces increasingly demanding requirements for
transmitting large or even entangled systems. However, knowledge of the state
to be transmitted eases its reconstruction, resulting in a protocol known as
remote state preparation. A number of experimental demonstrations to date have
been restricted to single-qubit systems. We report the remote preparation of
two-qubit "hybrid" entangled states, including a family of vector-polarization
beams. Our single-photon states are encoded in the photon spin and orbital
angular momentum. We reconstruct the states by spin-orbit state tomography and
transverse polarization tomography. The high fidelities achieved for the
vector-polarization states opens the door to optimal coupling of down-converted
photons to other physical systems, such as an atom, as required for scalable
quantum networks, or plasmons in photonic nanostructures.
