The large scale pattern in the arrival directions of extragalactic cosmic
rays that reach the Earth is different from that of the flux arriving to the
halo of the Galaxy as a result of the propagation through the galactic magnetic
field. Two different effects are relevant in this process: deflections of
trajectories and (de)acceleration by the electric field component due to the
galactic rotation. The deflection of the cosmic ray trajectories makes the flux
intensity arriving to the halo from some direction to appear reaching the Earth
from another direction. This applies to any intrinsic anisotropy in the
extragalactic distribution or, even in the absence of intrinsic anisotropies,
to the dipolar Compton-Getting anisotropy induced when the observer is moving
with respect to the cosmic rays rest frame. For an observer moving with the
solar system, cosmic rays traveling through far away regions of the Galaxy also
experience an electric force coming from the relative motion (due to the
rotation of the Galaxy) of the local system in which the field can be
considered as being purely magnetic. This produces small changes in the
particles momentum that can originate large scale anisotropies even for an
isotropic extragalactic flux.
