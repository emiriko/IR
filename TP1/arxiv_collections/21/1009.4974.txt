This paper introduces a novel method for human face detection with its
orientation by using wavelet, principle component analysis (PCA) and redial
basis networks. The input image is analyzed by two-dimensional wavelet and a
two-dimensional stationary wavelet. The common goals concern are the image
clearance and simplification, which are parts of de-noising or compression. We
applied an effective procedure to reduce the dimension of the input vectors
using PCA. Radial Basis Function (RBF) neural network is then used as a
function approximation network to detect where either the input image is
contained a face or not and if there is a face exists then tell about its
orientation. We will show how RBF can perform well then back-propagation
algorithm and give some solution for better regularization of the RBF (GRNN)
network. Compared with traditional RBF networks, the proposed network
demonstrates better capability of approximation to underlying functions, faster
learning speed, better size of network, and high robustness to outliers.
