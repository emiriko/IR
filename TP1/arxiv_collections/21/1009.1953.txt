In this paper, we report the first experimental demonstration of a Temporal
HyperTelescope (THT). Our breadboard including 8 telescopes is firstly tested
in a manual cophasing configuration on a 1D object. The Point Spread Function
(PSF) is measured and exhibits a dynamics in the range of 300. A quantitative
analysis of the potential biases demonstrates that this limitation is related
to the residual phase fluctuation on each interferometric arm. Secondly, an
unbalanced binary star is imaged demonstrating the imaging capability of THT.
In addition, 2D PSF is recorded even if the telescope array is not optimized
for this purpose.
