In this poster we present the results of our analyses of three early massive
stars in IC 1613, whose spectra have been observed with VIMOS and analyzed with
CMFGEN and FASTWIND. One of the targets resulted a possible LBV and the other
two are Of stars with unexpectedly strong winds. The Of stars seem to be
strongly contaminated by CNO products. Our preliminary results may represent a
challenge for the theory of stellar atmospheres, but they still have to be
confirmed by the analysis of more objects and a more complete coverage of the
parameter space.
