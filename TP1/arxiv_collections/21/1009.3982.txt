This volume contains the proceedings of the First International Workshop on
Rewriting Techniques for Real-Time Systems (RTRTS 2010), held in Longyearbyen,
Spitsbergen, on April 6-9, 2010.
  The aim of the workshop is to bring together researchers with an interest in
the use of rewriting-based techniques (including rewriting logic) and tools for
the modeling, analysis, and/or implementation of real-time and hybrid systems,
and to give them the opportunity to present their recent works, discuss future
research directions, and exchange ideas. The topics of the workshop comprise,
but are not limited to: methods and tools supporting rewriting-based modeling
and analysis of real-time and hybrid systems, and extensions of such systems;
use of rewriting techniques to provide rigorous support for model-based
software engineering of timed systems; applications and case studies; and
comparison with other formalisms and tools.
