Accurate knowledge of the thermodynamic properties of nucleic acids is
crucial to predicting their structure and stability. To date most measurements
of base-pair free energies in DNA are obtained in thermal denaturation
experiments, which depend on several assumptions. Here we report measurements
of the DNA base-pair free energies based on a simplified system, the mechanical
unzipping of single DNA molecules. By combining experimental data with a
physical model and an optimization algorithm for analysis, we measure the 10
unique nearest-neighbor base-pair free energies with 0.1 kcal mol-1 precision
over two orders of magnitude of monovalent salt concentration. We find an
improved set of standard energy values compared with Unified Oligonucleotide
energies and a unique set of 10 base-pair-specific salt-correction values. The
latter are found to be strongest for AA/TT and weakest for CC/GG. Our new
energy values and salt corrections improve predictions of DNA unzipping forces
and are fully compatible with melting temperatures for oligos. The method
should make it possible to obtain free energies, enthalpies and entropies in
conditions not accessible by bulk methodologies.
