Fullerene peapods, that is carbon nanotubes encapsulating fullerene
molecules, can offer enhanced functionality with respect to empty nanotubes.
However, the present incomplete understanding of how a nanotube is affected by
entrapped fullerenes is an obstacle for peapods to reach their full potential
in nanoscale electronic applications. Here, we investigate the effect of C60
fullerenes on electron transport via peapod quantum dots. Compared to empty
nanotubes, we find an abnormal temperature dependence of Coulomb blockade
oscillations, indicating the presence of a nanoelectromechanical coupling
between electronic states of the nanotube and mechanical vibrations of the
fullerenes. This provides a method to detect the C60 presence and to probe the
interplay between electrical and mechanical excitations in peapods, which thus
emerge as a new class of nanoelectromechanical systems.
