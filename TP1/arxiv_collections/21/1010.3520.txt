The Inner Tracker of the LHCb experiment is a silicon microstrip detector
consisting of 336 detector modules with either one or two sensors. The module
production is now underway and we present here the setup employed for module
testing during the production. The setup is based on the same electronics that
will be used in the final experiment. We perform burn-in and ageing tests with
the help of a custom made Temperature Cycling Box controlled with LabVIEW under
Windows. The DAQ is done in another PC running Linux. Here we integrate the
different C/C++ libraries used to communicate to the LHCb Time and Fast Control
system,Experiment Control System and Data Acquisition.
