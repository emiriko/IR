Large Liquid Argon TPC detectors in the range of multikton mass for neutrino
and astroparticle physics require the extraction and treatment of signals from
some 105 wires. In order to enlarge the throughtput of the DAQ system an
on-line lossless data compression has been realized reducing almost a factor 4
the data flow. Moreover a trigger system based on a new efficient on-line
identification algorithm of wire hits was studied, implemented on the actual
ICARUS digital read- out boards and fully tested on the ICARINO LAr-TPC
facility operated at LNL INFN Laboratory with cosmic-rays. Capability to
trigger isolated low energy events down to 1 MeV visible energy was also
demonstrated.
