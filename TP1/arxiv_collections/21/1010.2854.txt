A method is proposed to implement a fast frictionless dynamics in a
low-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate by engineering the time-dependence of
the transverse confining potential in a highly anisotropic trap. The method
exploits the inversion of the dynamical self-similar scaling law in the radial
degrees of freedom. We discuss the application of the method to preserve
short-range correlations in time of flight experiments, the implementation of
nearly-sudden quenches of non-linear interactions, and its power to assist
self-similar dynamics in quasi-one dimensional condensates.
