We study the coherent dynamics of excitations on vibrating chains. By
applying an external field and matching the field strength with the oscillation
frequency of the chain it is possible to obtain an (average) transport of an
initial Gaussian wave packet. We distinguish between a uniform oscillation of
all nodes of the chain and the chain being in its lowest eigenmode. Both cases
can lead to directed transport.
