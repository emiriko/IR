This paper deals with the semantic interpretation of information resources
(e.g., images, videos, 3D models). We present a case study of an approach based
on semantic and context dependent similarity applied to the industrial design.
Different application contexts are considered and modelled to browse a
repository of 3D digital objects according to different perspectives. The paper
briefly summarises the basic concepts behind the semantic similarity approach
and illustrates its application and results.
