We study the entanglement dynamics for a two-spin system coupled to a spin
environment of different configurations by z-x type interaction. The models
considered in this paper are solved both analytically and numerically giving
rise to some concise analytical expressions when certain approximations are
properly made. Our purpose is to find how the initial states of the environment
with different numbers of spins affect the decay or revival of the entanglement
between central qubits. In Particular, it is found that the block-entangled
environment could speed up the decay and revival of the qubit entanglement. Our
results exhibit some interesting features that have not been found for a boson
bath.
