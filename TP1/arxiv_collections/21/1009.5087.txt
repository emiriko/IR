Message Sequence Charts (MSCs) are an appealing visual formalism mainly used
in the early stages of system design to capture the system requirements.
However, if we move towards an implementation, an executable specifications
related in some fashion to the MSC-based requirements must be obtained. The
MSCs can be used effectively to specify the bus protocol in the way where
high-level transition systems is used to capture the control flow of the system
components of the protocol and MSCs to describe the non-atomic component
interactions. This system of specification is amenable to formal verification.
In this paper, we present the way how we can specify the bus protocols using
MSCs and how these specifications can be translated into program of
verification tool (we have used Symbolic Model Verifier (SMV)) for the use of
formal verification. We have contributed to the following tasks in this
respect. Firstly, the way to specify the protocol using MSC has been presented.
Secondly, a translator that translates the specifications (described in a
textual input file) into SMV programs has been constructed. Finally, we have
presented the verification result of the AMBA bus protocol using the SMV
program found through the translation process. The SMV program found through
the translation process can be used in order to automatically verify various
properties of any bus protocol specified.
