We present the theory of the electronic transfer and the optical properties
of the quasi-zero dimensional quantum nanostructures, like quantum dots or the
DNA molecule. The theory is based on the multiple scattering of the charge
carriers in the quasi-zero dimensional nanostructures leading to the
manifestation of the nonadiabatic influence of the atomic lattice on the charge
carriers. The theory is based on the nonequilibrium Green's functions and the
quantum kinetic equations. Three examples of the electronic motion in the small
systems are presented, together with a comparison of the theoretical results
with their experimental counterparts. The comparison with the experiments
underlines importance of the electron-phonon interaction in nanostructures.
