This paper presents a detailed comparison between high-redshift observations
from the VIMOS-VLT Deep Survey (VVDS) and predictions from the Munich
semi-analytical model of galaxy formation. In particular, we focus this
analysis on the magnitude, redshift, and colour distributions of galaxies, as
well as their clustering properties. We constructed 100 quasi-independent mock
catalogues, using the output of the semi-analytical model presented in De Lucia
& Blaizot (2007).We then applied the same observational selection function of
the VVDS-Deep survey, so as to carry out a fair comparison between models and
observations. We find that the semi-analytical model reproduces well the
magnitude counts in the optical bands. It tends, however, to overpredict the
abundance of faint red galaxies, in particular in the i' and z' bands. Model
galaxies exhibit a colour bimodality that is only in qualitative agreement with
the data. In particular, we find that the model tends to overpredict the number
of red galaxies at low redshift and of blue galaxies at all redshifts probed by
VVDS-Deep observations, although a large fraction of the bluest observed
galaxies is absent from the model. In addition, the model overpredicts by about
14 per cent the number of galaxies observed at 0.2<z<1 with I_AB<24. When
comparing the galaxy clustering properties, we find that model galaxies are
more strongly clustered than observed ones at all redshift from z=0.2 to z=2,
with the difference being less significant above z~1. When splitting the
samples into red and blue galaxies, we find that the observed clustering of
blue galaxies is well reproduced by the model, while red model galaxies are
much more clustered than observed ones, being principally responsible for the
strong global clustering found in the model. [abridged]
