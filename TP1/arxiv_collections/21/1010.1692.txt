We propose a simple classical concept of nanodevices working in an absolute
negative mobility (ANM) regime: The minimal spatial asymmetry required for ANM
to occur is embedded in the geometry of the transported particle, rather than
in the channel design. This allows for a tremendous simplification of device
engineering, thus paving the way towards practical implementations of ANM.
Operating conditions and performance of our model device are investigated, both
numerically and analytically.
