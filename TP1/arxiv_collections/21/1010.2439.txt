This short note demonstrates how one can define a transformation of a
non-zero sum game into a zero sum, so that the optimal mixed strategy achieving
equilibrium always exists. The transformation is equivalent to introduction of
a passive player into a game (a player with a singleton set of pure
strategies), whose payoff depends on the actions of the active players, and it
is justified by the law of conservation of utility in a game. In a transformed
game, each participant plays against all other players, including the passive
player. The advantage of this approach is that the transformed game is zero-sum
and has an equilibrium solution. The optimal strategy and the value of the new
game, however, can be different from strategies that are rational in the
original game. We demonstrate the principle using the Prisoner's Dilemma
example.
