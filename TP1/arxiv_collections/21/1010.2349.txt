We study a one-dimensional atomic lattice gas in which Rydberg atoms are
excited by a laser and whose external dynamics is frozen. We identify a
parameter regime in which the Hamiltonian is well-approximated by a spin
Hamiltonian with quasi-local many-body interactions which possesses an exact
analytic ground state solution. This state is a superposition of all states of
the system that are compatible with an interaction induced constraint weighted
by a fugacity. We perform a detailed analysis of this state which exhibits a
cross-over between a paramagnetic phase with short-ranged correlations and a
crystal. This study also leads us to a class of spin models with many-body
interactions that permit an analytic ground state solution.
