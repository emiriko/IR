MiBoard (Multiplayer Interactive Board Game) is an online, turnbased board
game that was developed to assess the integration of game characteristics
(point rewards, game-like interaction, and peer feedback) and how that might
affect student engagement and learning efficacy. This online board game was
designed to fit within the Extended Practice module of iSTART (Interactive
Strategy Training for Active Reading and Thinking). Unfortunately, preliminary
research shows that MiBoard actually reduces engagement and does not benefit
the quality of student self-explanations when compared to the original Extended
Practice module. Consequently the MiBoard framework has been revamped to create
Self-Explanation Showdown, a faster-paced, less analytically oriented game that
adds competition to the creation of self-explanations. Students are evaluated
on the quality of their self-explanations using the same assessment algorithms
from iSTART Extended Practice module (this includes both word-based and
LSA-based assessments). The technical issues involved in development of MiBoard
and Self- Explanation Showdown are described. The lessons learned from the
MiBoard experience are also discussed in this paper.
