In some massive stars, magnetic fields are thought to confine the outflowing
radiatively-driven wind. Although theoretical models and MHD simulations are
able to illustrate the dynamics of such a magnetized wind, the impact of this
wind-field interaction on the observable properties of a magnetic star - X-ray
emission, photometric and spectral variability - is still unclear. The aim of
this study is to examine the relationship between magnetism, stellar winds and
X-ray emission of OB stars, by providing empirical observations and confronting
theory. In conjunction with the COUP survey of the Orion Nebula Cluster, we
carried out spectropolarimatric ESPaDOnS observations to determine the magnetic
properties of massive OB stars of this cluster.
