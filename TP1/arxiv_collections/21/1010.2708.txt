Characteristics of the high energy families (bundle of high energy e, gamma)
and hadrons in the air-showers detected in the hybrid experiment together with
emulsion chamber and AS-array at Mt.Chacaltaya are studied in detail by
comparing with those of CORSIKA simulations using interaction models of QGSJET
and EPOS. Because the atmospheric families and hadron component have more
direct information of the nuclear interaction, correlations between atmospheric
families and burst (hadron component of air-showers) accompanied to air-showers
are more sensitive to the mechanism of the the cosmic-ray interactions. The
burst size dependence of the family energy is compared with those of
simulations. It is found that the family energy accompanied by the air-showers
with the larger burst-size is systematically smaller than that expected in the
simulated events. The experimental results can not be described simply by
changing the chemical composition of primary cosmic-rays and this indicates
that the x-distribution of secondary particles in cosmic-ray interactions
becomes much steeper than that assumed in the simulation models.
