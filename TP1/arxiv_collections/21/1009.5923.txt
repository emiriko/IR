The evolution of the entangled muon-neutrino system emerging from charged
pion decay is explored both in vacuum and in matter. The study is based on a
Weisskopf-Wigner type wave-packet description. Explicit formulae are derived
displaying modulation and attenuation of the oscillations due to additional
time scales characterising the production process. The case of neutrinos
disentangled due to the detection of the muon is also considered.
