Dirac fermions have been studied intensively in condensed matter physics in
recent years. Many theoretical predictions critically depend on the number of
valleys where the Dirac fermions are realized. In this work, we report the
discovery of a two dimensional system with a single valley Dirac cone. We study
the transport properties of HgTe quantum wells grown at the critical thickness
separating between the topologically trivial and the quantum spin Hall phases.
At high magnetic fields, the quantized Hall plateaus demonstrate the presence
of a single valley Dirac point in this system. In addition, we clearly observe
the linear dispersion of the zero mode spin levels. Also the conductivity at
the Dirac point and its temperature dependence can be understood from single
valley Dirac fermion physics.
