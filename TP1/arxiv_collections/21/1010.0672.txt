The paper deals with a spatially homogeneous and isotropic FRW space-time
filled with perfect fluid and dark energy components. The two sources are
assumed to interact minimally, and therefore their energy momentum tensors are
conserved separately. A special law of variation for the Hubble parameter
proposed by Berman (1983) has been utilized to solve the field equations. The
Berman's law yields two explicit forms of the scale factor governing the FRW
space-time and constant values of deceleration parameter. The role of dark
energy with variable equation of state parameter has been studied in detail in
the evolution of FRW universe. It has been found that dark energy dominates the
universe at the present epoch, which is consistent with the observations. The
physical behavior of the universe is discussed in detail.
