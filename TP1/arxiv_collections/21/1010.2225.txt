Evidence for an anomalous annual periodicity in certain nuclear decay data
has led to speculation concerning a possible solar influence on nuclear
processes. We have recently analyzed data concerning the decay rates of Cl-36
and Si-32, acquired at the Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), to search for
evidence that might be indicative of a process involving solar rotation.
Smoothing of the power spectrum by weighted-running-mean analysis leads to a
significant peak at frequency 11.18/yr, which is lower than the equatorial
synodic rotation rates of the convection and radiative zones. This article
concerns measurements of the decay rates of Ra-226 acquired at the
Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) in Germany. We find that a similar
(but not identical) analysis yields a significant peak in the PTB dataset at
frequency 11.21/yr, and a peak in the BNL dataset at 11.25/yr. The change in
the BNL result is not significant since the uncertainties in the BNL and PTB
analyses are estimated to be 0.13/yr and 0.07/yr, respectively. Combining the
two running means by forming the joint power statistic leads to a highly
significant peak at frequency 11.23/yr. We comment briefly on the possible
implications of these results for solar physics and for particle physics.
