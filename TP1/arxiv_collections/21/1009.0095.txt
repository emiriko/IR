Results of numerical Monte Carlo simulations for the Stark-tuned F\"orster
resonance and dipole blockade between two to five cold rubidium Rydberg atoms
in various spatial configurations are presented. The effects of the atoms'
spatial uncertainties on the resonance amplitude and spectra are investigated.
The feasibility of observing coherent Rabi-like population oscillations at a
F\"orster resonance between two cold Rydberg atoms is analyzed. Spectra and the
fidelity of the Rydberg dipole blockade are calculated for various experimental
conditions, including nonzero detuning from the F\"orster resonance and finite
laser linewidth. The results are discussed in the context of
quantum-information processing with Rydberg atoms.
