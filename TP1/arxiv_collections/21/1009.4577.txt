In this work, the electroweak phase transition (EWPT) strength has been
investigated within the $U(1)$ extended Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model
(UMSSM) without introducing any exotic fields. We found that the EWPT could be
strongly first order for reasonable values of the lightest Higgs and neutralino
masses.
