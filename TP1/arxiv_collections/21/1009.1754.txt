The clear detection with CoRoT and KEPLER of radial and non-radial solar-like
oscillations in many red giants paves the way to seismic inferences on the
structure of such stars. We present an overview of the properties of the
adiabatic frequencies and frequency separations of radial and non-radial
oscillation modes for an extended grid of models. We highlight how their
detection allows a deeper insight into the internal structure and evolutionary
state of red giants. In particular, we find that the properties of dipole modes
constitute a promising seismic diagnostic tool of the evolutionary state of
red-giant stars. We compare our theoretical predictions with the first 34 days
of KEPLER data and predict the frequency diagram expected for red giants in the
COROT exofield in the galactic center direction.
