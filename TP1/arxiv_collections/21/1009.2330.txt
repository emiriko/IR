It has been argued that any test of quantum contextuality is nullified by the
fact that perfect orthogonality and perfect compatibility cannot be achieved in
finite precision experiments. We introduce experimentally testable two-qutrit
violations of inequalities for noncontextual theories in which compatibility is
guaranteed by the fact that measurements are performed on separated qutrits.
The inequalities are inspired by the basic building block of the Kochen-Specker
proof of quantum contextuality for a qutrit, despite the fact that their proof
is completely independent of it.
