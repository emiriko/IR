We study connectivity relations among points, where the precise location of
each input point lies in a region of uncertainty. We distinguish two
fundamental scenarios under which uncertainty arises. In the favorable
Best-Case Uncertainty (BU), each input point can be chosen from a given set to
yield the best possible objective value. In the unfavorable Worst-Case
Uncertainty (WU), the input set has worst possible objective value among all
possible point locations, which are uncertain due, for example, to imprecise
data. We consider these notions of uncertainty for the bottleneck spanning tree
problem, giving rise to the following Best-Case Connectivity with Uncertainty
(BCU) problem: Given a family of geometric regions, choose one point per
region, such that the longest edge length of an associated geometric spanning
tree is minimized. We show that this problem is NP-hard even for very simple
scenarios in which the regions are line segments or squares. On the other hand,
we give an exact solution for the case in which there are n+k regions, where k
of the regions are line segments and n of the regions are fixed points. We then
give approximation algorithms for cases where the regions are either all line
segments or all unit discs. We also provide approximation methods for the
corresponding Worst-Case Connectivity with Uncertainty (WCU) problem: Given a
set of uncertainty regions, find the minimal distance r such that for any
choice of points, one per region, there is a spanning tree among the points
with edge length at most r.
