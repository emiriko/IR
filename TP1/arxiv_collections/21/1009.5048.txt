Bangla alphabet has a large number of letters, for this it is complicated to
type faster using Bangla keyboard. The proposed keyboard will maximize the
speed of operator as they can type with both hands parallel. Association rule
of data mining to distribute the Bangla characters in the keyboard is used
here. The frequencies of data consisting of monograph, digraph and trigraph are
analyzed, which are derived from data wire-house, and then used association
rule of data mining to distribute the Bangla characters in the layout.
Experimental results on several data show the effectiveness of the proposed
approach with better performance. This paper presents an optimal Bangla
Keyboard Layout, which distributes the load equally on both hands so that
maximizing the ease and minimizing the effort.
