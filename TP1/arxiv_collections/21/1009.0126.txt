The bottleneck phenomenon in three-dimensional turbulence is generally
associated with the dissipation range of the energy spectrum. In the present
work, it is shown by using a two-point closure theory, that in two-dimensional
turbulence it is possible to observe a bottleneck at the large scales, due to
the effect of friction on the inverse energy cascade. This large-scale
bottleneck is directly related to the process of energy condensation, the
pile-up of energy at wavenumbers corresponding to the domain size. The link
between the use of friction and the creation of space-filling structures is
discussed and it is concluded that the careless use of hypofriction might
reduce the inertial range of the energy spectrum.
