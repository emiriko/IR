The one-matrix model is considered. The generating function of the
correlation numbers is defined in such a way that this function coincide with
the generating function of the Liouville gravity. Using the Kontsevich theorem
we explain that this generating function is an analytic continuation of the
generating function of the Topological gravity. We check the topological
recursion relations for the correlation functions in the $p$-critical Matrix
model.
