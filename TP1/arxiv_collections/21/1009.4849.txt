Axisymmetric magnetic strings with a fixed sense of rotation and nanometer
sizes (chiral magnetic vortices or Skyrmions) have been predicted to exist in a
large group of non-centrosymmetric crystals more than two decades ago. Recently
these extraordinary magnetic states have been directly observed in thin layers
of cubic helimagnet (Fe,Co)Si. In this report we apply our earlier theoretical
findings to review main properties of chiral Skyrmions, to elucidate their
physical nature, and to analyse these recent experimental results on
magnetic-field-driven evolution of Skyrmions and helicoids in chiral
helimagnets.
