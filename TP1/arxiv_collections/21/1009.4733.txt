The demand for Internet services that require frequent updates through small
messages, such as microblogging, has tremendously grown in the past few years.
Although the use of such applications by domestic users is usually free, their
access from mobile devices is subject to fees and consumes energy from limited
batteries. If a user activates his mobile device and is in range of a service
provider, a content update is received at the expense of monetary and energy
costs. Thus, users face a tradeoff between such costs and their messages aging.
The goal of this paper is to show how to cope with such a tradeoff, by devising
\emph{aging control policies}. An aging control policy consists of deciding,
based on the current utility of the last message received, whether to activate
the mobile device, and if so, which technology to use (WiFi or 3G). We present
a model that yields the optimal aging control policy. Our model is based on a
Markov Decision Process in which states correspond to message ages. Using our
model, we show the existence of an optimal strategy in the class of threshold
strategies, wherein users activate their mobile devices if the age of their
messages surpasses a given threshold and remain inactive otherwise. We then
consider strategic content providers (publishers) that offer \emph{bonus
packages} to users, so as to incent them to download updates of advertisement
campaigns. We provide simple algorithms for publishers to determine optimal
bonus levels, leveraging the fact that users adopt their optimal aging control
strategies. The accuracy of our model is validated against traces from the
UMass DieselNet bus network.
