The test statistics of two powerful tests for normality \citep{lm1,mud2} are
estimators of the correlation coefficient between certain sample moments. We
derive new versions of the test statistics that are functions of the sample
skewness and sample kurtosis. This sheds some light on the nature of these
tests and leads to easier computations.
