Generalized Hidden Local Symmetry (GHLS) model as the chiral model of
pseudoscalar, vector, and axial vector mesons and their interactions containing
also the couplings of strongly interacting particles with electroweak gauge
bosons, is confronted with the ALEPH data on the decay
$\tau^-\to\pi^-\pi^-\pi^+\nu_\tau$ and BABAR and CMD data on the reaction
$e^+e^-\to\pi^+\pi^-\pi^+\pi^-$. It is shown that both the invariant mass
spectrum of final pions in $\tau$ decay calculated in the GHLS framework with
the single $a_1(1260)$ resonance and the cross section
$e^+e^-\to\pi^+\pi^-\pi^+\pi^-$ calculated in the above framework with the
single $\rho(770)$ resonance, disagree with the experimental data. The
modifications of GHLS model based on inclusion of two additional heavier axial
vector mesons $a_1^\prime$, $a_1^{\prime\prime}$ in the $\tau$ decay and the
vector mesons $\rho^\prime$, $\rho^{\prime\prime}$ in
$e^+e^-\to\pi^+\pi^-\pi^+\pi^-$ are shown to be necessary for the good
description of the above data.
