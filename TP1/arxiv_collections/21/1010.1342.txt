Our series of recent work on the transmission coefficient of open quantum
systems in one dimension will be reviewed. The transmission coefficient is
equivalent to the conductance of a quantum dot connected to leads of quantum
wires. We will show that the transmission coefficient is given by a sum over
all discrete eigenstates without a background integral. An apparent
"background" is in fact not a background but generated by tails of various
resonance peaks. By using the expression, we will show that the Fano asymmetry
of a resonance peak is caused by the interference between various discrete
eigenstates. In particular, an unstable resonance can strongly skew the peak of
a nearby resonance.
