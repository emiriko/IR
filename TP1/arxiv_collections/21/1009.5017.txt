High-resolution spectrometer measurements of the reaction H(e,e' K+)X at
small Q2 are used to extract the mass and width of the Lambda(1520). We
investigate dependence of the resonance parameters on different
parametrizations of the background and the resonance peak itself. Our final
values for the Breit-Wigner parameters are M=1520.4+-0.6(stat)+-1.5(syst) MeV
and Gamma=18.6+-1.9(stat)+-1(syst) MeV. The width appears to be more sensitive
to the assumptions than the mass. We also estimate, for the first time, the
pole position for this resonance and find that both the pole mass and width
seem to be smaller than their Breit-Wigner values.
