Gripping and holding of objects are key tasks for robotic manipulators. The
development of universal grippers able to pick up unfamiliar objects of widely
varying shape and surface properties remains, however, challenging. Most
current designs are based on the multi-fingered hand, but this approach
introduces hardware and software complexities. These include large numbers of
controllable joints, the need for force sensing if objects are to be handled
securely without crushing them, and the computational overhead to decide how
much stress each finger should apply and where. Here we demonstrate a
completely different approach to a universal gripper. Individual fingers are
replaced by a single mass of granular material that, when pressed onto a target
object, flows around it and conforms to its shape. Upon application of a vacuum
the granular material contracts and hardens quickly to pinch and hold the
object without requiring sensory feedback. We find that volume changes of less
than 0.5% suffice to grip objects reliably and hold them with forces exceeding
many times their weight. We show that the operating principle is the ability of
granular materials to transition between an unjammed, deformable state and a
jammed state with solid-like rigidity. We delineate three separate mechanisms,
friction, suction and interlocking, that contribute to the gripping force.
Using a simple model we relate each of them to the mechanical strength of the
jammed state. This opens up new possibilities for the design of simple, yet
highly adaptive systems that excel at fast gripping of complex objects.
