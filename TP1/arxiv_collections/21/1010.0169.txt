Differential Power Analysis (DPA) represents a unique and powerful
cryptanalysis technique. Insight into the encryption and decryption behavior of
a cryptographic device can be determined by examining its electrical power
signature. This paper describes a novel approach for implementation of the AES
algorithm which provides a significantly improved strength against differential
power analysis with a minimal additional hardware overhead. Our method is based
on randomization in composite field arithmetic which entails an area penalty of
only 7% while does not decrease the working frequency, does not alter the
algorithm and keeps perfect compatibility with the published standard. The
efficiency of the proposed technique was verified by practical results obtained
from real implementation on a Xilinx Spartan-II FPGA.
