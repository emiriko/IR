Baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAOs) modulate the density ratio of baryons
to dark matter across large regions of the Universe. We show that the
associated variation in the mass-to-light ratio of galaxies should generate an
oscillatory, scale-dependent bias of galaxies relative to the underlying
distribution of dark matter. A measurement of this effect would calibrate the
dependence of the characteristic mass-to-light ratio of galaxies on the baryon
mass fraction in their large scale environment. This bias, though, is unlikely
to significantly affect measurements of BAO peak positions.
