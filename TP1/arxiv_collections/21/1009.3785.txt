In this paper a novel hybrid approach for compensating the distortion of any
interpolation has been proposed. In this hybrid method, a modular approach was
incorporated in an iterative fashion. By using this approach we can get drastic
improvement with less computational complexity. The extension of the proposed
approach to two dimensions was also studied. Both the simulation results and
mathematical analyses confirmed the superiority of the hybrid method. The
proposed method was also shown to be robust against additive noise.
