We use the tools of the J-matrix method to evaluate the S-matrix and then
deduce the bound and resonance states energies for singular screened Coulomb
potentials, both analytic and piecewise differentiable. The J-matrix approach
allows us to absorb the 1/r singularity of the potential in the reference
Hamiltonian, which is then handled analytically. The calculation is performed
using an infinite square integrable basis that supports a tridiagonal matrix
representation for the reference Hamiltonian. The remaining part of the
potential, which is bound and regular everywhere, is treated by an efficient
numerical scheme in a suitable basis using Gauss quadrature approximation. To
exhibit the power of our approach we have considered the most delicate region
close to the bound-unbound transition and compared our results favorably with
available numerical data.
