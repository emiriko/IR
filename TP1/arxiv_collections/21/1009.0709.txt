We report on a metal-insulator transition in the LaAlO3-SrTiO3 interface
electron system, of which the carrier density is tuned by an electric gate
field. Below a critical carrier density n_c ranging from 0.5-1.5 * 10^13/cm^2,
LaAlO3-SrTiO3 interfaces, forming drain-source channels in field-effect devices
are non-ohmic. The differential resistance at zero channel bias diverges within
a 2% variation of the carrier density. Above n_c, the conductivity of the ohmic
channels has a metal-like temperature dependence, while below n_c conductivity
sets in only above a threshold electric field. For a given thickness of the
LaAlO3 layer, the conductivity follows a sigma_0 ~(n - n_c)/n_c characteristic.
The metal-insulator transition is found to be distinct from that of the
semiconductor 2D systems.
