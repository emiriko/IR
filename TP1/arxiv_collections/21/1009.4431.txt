In contrast to classical physics, the language of quantum mechanics involves
operators and wave functions (or, more generally, density operators). However,
in 1932, Wigner formulated quantum mechanics in terms of a distribution
function $W(q,p)$, the marginals of which yield the correct quantum
probabilities for $q$ and $p$ separately \cite{wigner}. Its usefulness stems
from the fact that it provides a re-expression of quantum mechanics in terms of
classical concepts so that quantum mechanical expectation values are now
expressed as averages over phase-space distribution functions. In other words,
statistical information is transferred from the density operator to a
quasi-classical (distribution) function.
