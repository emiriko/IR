Bosonic atom-trimer scattering is studied in the unitary limit using
momentum-space equations for four-particle transition operators. The impact of
the Efimov effect on the atom-trimer scattering observables is explored and a
number of universal relations is established. Positions and widths of tetramer
resonances are determined. Trimer relaxation rate constant is calculated.
