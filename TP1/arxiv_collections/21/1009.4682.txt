We investigated the nature of the spin glass-like phase transition in the
geometrically frustrated pyrochlore lattices Y$_{2}$Mo$_{2}$O$_{7}$ using the
local probes nuclear and muon magnetic resonances, and the field-dependent long
range probes x-ray and neutron scattering. The long range probes indicated that
Y$_{2}$Mo$_{2}$O$_{7}$ does not undergo any global symmetry changes, even in a
field of $6$~T. In contrast, the local signal indicates a lattice distortion
close to the critical temperature. The nuclei show at least two inequivalent Y
sites, and the muons show sub-linear line broadening as a function of moment
size, over a wide temperature range. The conclusion from all the measurements
is that even in high field, the distortion of Y$_{2}$Mo$_{2}$O$%_{7}$ takes
place within the unit-cell, while its global cubic symmetry is preserved.
Moreover, the muon result clearly indicates the presence of magneto-elastic
coupling.
