We report effects of local magnetic moment, Gd3+, doping (x =< 0.3) on
superconducting and magnetic properties of the closely related Lu(1-x)GdxNi2B2C
and Y(1-x)GdxNi2B2C series. The superconducting transition temperature
decreases and the heat capacity jump associated with it drops rapidly with
Gd-doping; qualitative changes with doping are also observed in the
temperature-dependent upper critical field behavior, and a region of
coexistence of superconductivity and spin-glass state is delineated on the x -
T phase diagram. The evolution of superconducting properties can be understood
within Abrikosov-Gor'kov theory of magnetic impurities in superconductors
taking into account the paramagnetic effect on upper critical field with
additional contributions particular for the family under study.
