The optical light-curves of GRB afterglows display either peaks or plateaus.
  We identify 16 afterglows of the former type, 17 of the latter, and 4 with
broad peaks, that could be of either type. The optical energy release of these
two classes is similar and is correlated with the GRB output, the correlation
being stronger for peaky afterglows, which suggests that the burst and
afterglow emissions of peaky afterglows are from the same relativistic ejecta
and that the optical emission of afterglows with plateaus arises more often
from ejecta that did not produce the burst emission.
  Consequently, we propose that peaky optical afterglows are from impulsive
ejecta releases and that plateau optical afterglows originate from long-lived
engines, the break in the optical light-curve (peak or plateau end) marking the
onset of the entire outflow deceleration.
  In the peak luminosity--peak time plane, the distribution of peaky afterglows
displays an edge with L_p \propto t_p^{-3}, which we attribute to variations
(among afterglows) in the ambient medium density. The fluxes and epochs of
optical plateau breaks follow a L_b \propto t_b^{-1} anticorrelation.
  Sixty percent of 25 afterglows that were well-monitored in the optical and
X-rays show light-curves with comparable power-law decays indices and
achromatic breaks. The other 40 percent display three types of decoupled
behaviours: i) chromatic optical light-curve breaks (perhaps due to the peak of
the synchrotron spectrum crossing the optical), ii) X-ray flux decays faster
than in the optical (suggesting that the X-ray emission is from local
inverse-Compton scattering), and iii) chromatic X-ray light-curve breaks
(indicating that the X-ray emission is from external up-scattering).
