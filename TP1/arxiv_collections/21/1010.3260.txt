We examine the incidence of cold fronts in a large sample of galaxy clusters
extracted from a (512h^-1 Mpc) hydrodynamic/N-body cosmological simulation with
adiabatic gas physics computed with the Enzo adaptive mesh refinement code.
This simulation contains a sample of roughly 4000 galaxy clusters with M >
10^14 M_sun at z=0. For each simulated galaxy cluster, we have created mock
0.3-8.0 keV X-ray observations and spectroscopic-like temperature maps. We have
searched these maps with a new automated algorithm to identify the presence of
cold fronts in projection. Using a threshold of a minimum of 10 cold front
pixels in our images, corresponding to a total comoving length L_cf > 156h^-1
kpc, we find that roughly 10-12% of all projections in a mass-limited sample
would be classified as cold front clusters. Interestingly, the fraction of
clusters with extended cold front features in our synthetic maps of a
mass-limited sample trends only weakly with redshift out to z=1.0. However,
when using different selection functions, including a simulated flux limit, the
trending with redshift changes significantly. The likelihood of finding cold
fronts in the simulated clusters in our sample is a strong function of cluster
mass. In clusters with M>7.5x10^14 M_sun the cold front fraction is 40-50%. We
also show that the presence of cold fronts is strongly correlated with
disturbed morphology as measured by quantitative structure measures. Finally,
we find that the incidence of cold fronts in the simulated cluster images is
strongly dependent on baryonic physics.
