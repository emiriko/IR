Our recent studies of late B-type stars with HgMn peculiarity revealed for
the first time the presence of fast dynamical evolution of chemical spots on
their surfaces. These observations suggest a hitherto unknown physical process
operating in the stars with radiative outer envelopes. Furthermore, we have
also discovered existence of magnetic fields on these stars that have up to now
been thought to be non-magnetic. Here we will discuss the dynamical spot
evolution on HD 11753 and our new results on magnetic fields on AR Aur.
