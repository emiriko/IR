In the present paper, we propose a new axiomatic approach to nonstandard
analysis and its application to the general theory of spatial structures in
terms of category theory. Our framework is based on the idea of internal set
theory, while we make use of an endofunctor $\mathcal{U}$ on a topos of sets
$S$ together with a natural transformation $\upsilon$, instead of the terms as
"standard", "internal" or "external". Moreover, we propose a general notion of
a space called $\mathcal{U}$-space, and the category $\mathcal{U}space$ whose
objects are $\mathcal{U}$-spaces and morphisms are functions called
$\mathcal{U}$-spatial morphisms. The category $\mathcal{U}Space$, which is
shown to be cartesian closed, will give a unified viewpoint toward topological
and coarse geometric structure. It will also useful to study
symmetries/asymmetries of the systems with infinite degrees of freedom such as
quantum fields.
