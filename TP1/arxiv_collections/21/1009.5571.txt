We consider phase-coherent transport through ballistic and diffusive
two-dimensional hole systems based on the Kohn-Luttinger Hamiltonian. We show
that intrinsic heavy-hole light-hole coupling gives rise to clear-cut
signatures of an associated Berry phase in the weak localization which renders
the magneto-conductance profile distinctly different from electron transport.
Non-universal classical correlations determine the strength of these Berry
phase effects and the effective symmetry class, leading even to
antilocalization-type features for circular quantum dots and Aharonov-Bohm
rings in the absence of additional spin-orbit interaction. Our semiclassical
predictions are quantitatively confirmed by numerical transport calculations.
