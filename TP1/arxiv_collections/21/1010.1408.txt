It is shown that for thin metal films, thickness of which does not exceed a
thickness of a skin-layer, the problem allows analytical solution for any
boundary conditions. The analysis of transmission, reflection and absorption of
an electromagnetic wave coefficients depending on a angle of incidence,
thickness of a layer, coefficient of specular reflection and frequency of
oscillations of electromagnetic field is carried out.
