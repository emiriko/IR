Parametric two-electron reduced-density-matrix (p-2RDM) methods have enjoyed
much success in recent years; the methods have been shown to exhibit accuracies
greater than coupled cluster with single and double substitutions (CCSD) for
both closed- and open-shell ground-state energies, properties, geometric
parameters, and harmonic frequencies. The class of methods is herein discussed
within the context of the coupled electron pair approximation (CEPA), and
several CEPA-like topological factors are presented for use within the p-2RDM
framework. The resulting p-2RDM/n methods can be viewed as a density-based
generalization of CEPA/n family that are numerically very similar to
traditional CEPA methodologies. We cite the important distinction that the
obtained energies represent stationary points, facilitating the efficient
evaluation of properties and geometric derivatives. The p-2RDM/n formalism is
generalized for an equal treatment of exclusion-principle-violating (EPV)
diagrams that occur in the occupied and virtual spaces. One of these general
topological factors is shown to be identical to that proposed by Kollmar [C.
Kollmar, J. Chem. Phys. 125, 084108 (2006)], derived in an effort to
approximately enforce the D, Q, and G conditions for N-representability in his
size-extensive density matrix functional.
