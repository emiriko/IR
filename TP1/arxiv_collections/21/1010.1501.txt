Radiation by the atoms of a resonant medium is a cooperative process in which
the medium participates as a whole. In two previous papers \cite{PG00,GP00}, we
treated this problem for the case of a medium having slab geometry, which,
under plane wave excitation, supports coherent waves that propagate in one
dimension. We extend the treatment here to the three-dimensional problem,
focusing principally on the case of spherical geometry. By regarding the
radiation field as a superposition of electric and magnetic multipole fields of
different orders, we express it in terms of suitably defined scalar fields. The
latter fields possess a sequence of exponentially decaying eigenmodes
corresponding to each multipole order. We consider several examples of
spherically symmetric initial excitations of a sphere. Small uniformly excited
spheres, we find, tend to radiate superradiantly, while the radiation from a
large sphere with an initially excited inner core exhibits temporal
oscillations that result from the participation of a large number of coherently
excited amplitudes in different modes. The frequency spectrum of the emitted
radiation possesses a rich structure, including a frequency gap for large
spheres and sharply defined and closely spaced peaks caused by the small
frequency shifts and even smaller decay rates characteristic of the majority of
eigenmodes.
