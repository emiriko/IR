A scenario is presented for the formation of first life in the universe based
on hydro-gravitational-dynamics (HGD) cosmology. From HGD, the dark matter of
galaxies is H-He gas dominated planets (primordial-fog-particle PFPs) in
million solar mass clumps (protoglobularstarcluster PGCs), which formed at the
plasma to gas transition temperature 3000 K. Stars result from mergers of the
hot-gas-planets. Over-accretion causes stars to explode as supernovae that
scatter life-chemicals (C, N, O, P, S, Ca, Fe etc.) to other planets in PGC
clumps and beyond. These chemicals were first collected gravitationally by
merging PFPs to form H-saturated, high-pressure, dense oceans of
critical-temperature 647 K water over iron-nickel cores at ~ 2 Myr. Stardust
fertilizes the formation of first life in a cosmic hot-ocean soup kitchen
comprised of all planets and their moons in meteoric communication, > 10^100 kg
in total. Ocean freezing slows this biological big bang at ~ 8 Myr. HGD
cosmology confirms that the evolving seeds of life are scattered on
intergalactic scales by Hoyle-Wickramasinghe cometary panspermia. Thus, life
flourishes on planets like Earth that would otherwise be sterile.
