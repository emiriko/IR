Photoexcited quasiparticle relaxation dynamics in overdoped
Bi$_{2}$Sr$_{2}$CaCu$_{2}$O$_{8+\delta}$ ($T_{c}$=65~K, hole doping $p$=0.22)
single crystal is investigated as a function of temperature. We provide
evidence of a $\sim$22~meV pseudogap ($T^{\ast}$$\approx$100~K) at this doping
level. Our data support the scenario where both the superconducting gap and
pseudogap coexist in the superconducting state. Our results also suggest an
increased scattering rate between electrons and spin fluctuations as the sample
enters the pseudogap phase.
