In this paper we analyze the existence of joint probabilities for the
Bell-type and GHZ entangled states. We then propose the usage of nonmonotonic
upper probabilities as a tool to derive consistent joint upper probabilities
for the contextual hidden variables. Finally, we show that for the extreme
example of no error, the GHZ state allows for the definition of a joint upper
probability that is consistent with the strong correlations.
