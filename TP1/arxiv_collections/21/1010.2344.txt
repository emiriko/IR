Using a very efficient numerical algorithm of the strong disorder
renormalization group method we have extended the investigations about the
critical behavior of the random transverse-field Ising model in three and four
dimensions, as well as for Erd\H os-R\'enyi random graphs, which represent
infinite dimensional lattices. In all studied cases an infinite disorder
quantum critical point is identified, which ensures that the applied method is
asymptotically correct and the calculated critical exponents tend to the exact
values for large scales. We have found that the critical exponents are
independent of the form of (ferromagnetic) disorder and they vary smoothly with
the dimensionality.
