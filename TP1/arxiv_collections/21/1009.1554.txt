The double perovskite compound, Sr$_{2}$YbRuO$_{6}$, displays reversal in the
orientation of magnetic moments along with negative magnetization due to an
underlying magnetic compensation phenomenon. The exchange bias (EB) field below
the compensation temperature could be the usual negative or the positive
depending on the initial cooling field. This EB attribute has the potential of
getting tuned in a preselected manner, as the positive EB field is seen to
crossover from positive to negative value above $T_{\mathrm{comp}}$.
