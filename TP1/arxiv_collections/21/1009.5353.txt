We evaluate the radion and Higgs masses in the gauge-Higgs unification models
on the warped geometry, in which the modulus is stabilized by the Casimir
energy. We analyze the one-loop effective potential and clarify the dependences
of those masses on the Wilson line phase $\theta_H$. The radion mass varies
1-30GeV for $0.06\leq\sin\theta_H\leq 0.3$, while the Higgs mass is 150-200 GeV
and depends on $\theta_H$ only logarithmically. The radion couplings to the
standard model particles are sensitive to the warp factor, and are too small to
detect at colliders in the region where the five-dimensional description is
valid.
