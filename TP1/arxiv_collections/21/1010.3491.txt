We report a mathematically rigorous technique which facilitates the
optimization of various optical properties of electromagnetic fields in free
space and including scattering interactions. The technique exploits the
linearity of electromagnetic fields along with the quadratic nature of the
intensity to define specific Optical Eigenmodes (OEi) that are pertinent to the
interaction considered. Key applications include the optimization of the size
of a focused spot, the transmission through sub-wavelength apertures, and of
the optical force acting on microparticles. We verify experimentally the OEi
approach by minimising the size of a focused optical field using a
superposition of Bessel beams.
