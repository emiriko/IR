We consider the transition from quark to hadronic matter which may result
during the cooling/expansion of the quark-gluon plasma formed in energetic
collisions of weakly isospin-asymmetric ions. This transition involves the
energy density of u and d quark matter and the one of nearly isospin-symmetric
nuclear matter. Within bag models, the former entails knowledge of the bag
pressure, a poorly constrained quantity. The bag pressure at high density can
be fixed imposing equality of quark and nucleonic energy densities at the
(assumed known) transition point. We find this value to be very model
dependent.
