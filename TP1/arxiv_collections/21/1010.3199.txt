Extensive optical and near-infrared (NIR) observations of the type Ib
supernova 1999dn are presented, covering the first year after explosion. These
new data turn this object, already considered a prototypical SNIb, into one of
the best observed objects of its class. The light curve of SN 1999dn is mostly
similar in shape to that of other SNeIb but with a moderately faint peak
M_V=-17.2 mag). From the bolometric light curve and ejecta expansion
velocities, we estimate that about 0.11 Msun of 56Ni were produced during the
explosion and that the total ejecta mass was 4-6 Msun with a kinetic energy of
at least 5x10^{51} erg. The spectra of SN 1999dn at various epochs are similar
to those of other Stripped Envelope (SE) SNe showing clear presence of H at
early epochs. The high explosion energy and ejected mass, along with the small
flux ratio [CaII]/[OI] measured in the nebular spectrum, together with the lack
of signatures of dust formation and the relatively high-metallicity environment
point toward a single massive progenitor (M_ZAMS>=23-25 Msun) for SN 1999dn.
