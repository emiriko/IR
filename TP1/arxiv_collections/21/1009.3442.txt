We report on the exclusive production of omega and eta mesons in p+p
reactions at 3.5 GeV beam kinetic energy. Production cross sections, angular
distributions and Dalitz plots of both mesons were determined. Moreover, the
relative contribution of the N(1535) resonance in eta production at this energy
was evaluated. We conclude that eta mesons produced via N(1535) exihibit an
isotropic angular distribution, whereas those produced directly show a strong
anisotropic distribition. omega mesons show a slightly anisotropic angular
distribition.
