Zn(CN)2 and Ni(CN)2 are known for exhibiting anomalous thermal expansion over
a wide temperature range. The volume thermal expansion coefficient for the
cubic, three dimensionally connected material, Zn(CN)2, is negative ({\alpha}V
= -51 x 10-6 K-1) while for Ni(CN)2, a tetragonal material, the thermal
expansion coefficient is negative in the two dimensionally connected sheets
({\alpha}a=-7 x 10-6 K-1), but the overall thermal expansion coefficient is
positive ({\alpha}V=48 x 10-6 K-1). We have measured the temperature dependence
of phonon spectra in these compounds and analyzed them using ab-initio
calculations. The spectra of the two compounds show large differences that
cannot be explained by simple mass renormalization of the modes involving Zn
(65.38 amu) and Ni (58.69 amu) atoms. This reflects the fact that the structure
and bonding are quite different in the two compounds. The calculated pressure
dependence of the phonon modes and of the thermal expansion coefficient,
{\alpha}V, are used to understand the anomalous behavior in these compounds.
Our ab-initio calculations indicate that it is the low-energy rotational modes
in Zn(CN)2, which are shifted to higher energies in Ni(CN)2, that are
responsible for the large negative thermal expansion. The measured temperature
dependence of the phonon spectra has been used to estimate the total
anharmonicity of both compounds. For Zn(CN)2, the temperature- dependent
measurements (total anharmonicity), along with our previously reported pressure
dependence of the phonon spectra (quasiharmonic), is used to separate the
explicit temperature effect at constant volume (intrinsic anharmonicity).
