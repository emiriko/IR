We investigate the stability of Quantum Critical Points (QCPs) in the
presence of two competing phases. These phases near QCPs are assumed to be
either classical or quantum and assumed to repulsively interact via
square-square interactions. We find that for any dynamical exponents and for
any dimensionality strong enough interaction renders QCPs unstable, and drives
transitions to become first order. We propose that this instability and the
onset of first-order transitions lead to spatially inhomogeneous states in
practical materials near putative QCPs. Our analysis also leads us to suggest
that there is a breakdown of Conformal Field Theory (CFT) scaling in the Anti
de Sitter models, and in fact these models contain first-order transitions in
the strong coupling limit.
