The superconducting transition temperature, $T_c$, of a ferromagnet (F) -
superconductor (S) - ferromagnet trilayer depends on the mutual orientation of
the magnetic moments of the F layers. This effect has been previously observed
in F/S/F systems as a $T_c$ difference between parallel and antiparallel
configurations of the F layers. Here we report measurements of $T_c$ in
CuNi/Nb/CuNi trilayers as a function of the angle between the magnetic moments
of the CuNi ferromagnets. The observed angular dependence of $T_c$ is in
qualitative agreement with a F/S proximity theory that accounts for the odd
triplet component of the condensate predicted to arise for non-collinear
orientation of the magnetic moments of the F layers.
