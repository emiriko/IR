As illustrated by Schrodingers cat, there are often several macroscopically
different versions of reality simultaneously existing in the wave function. On
the face of it, this would seem to imply that an observer could perceive a
superposition of versions and thereby put quantum mechanics at odds with our
perceptions. However one can show, without invoking decoherence or the
environment, that the linearity of quantum mechanics implies we will perceive
only a single, classical version of reality. Linearity also implies our
perceptions will have a particle-like consistency.
