The superconducting and magnetic properties of Fe$_{y}$Se$_{0.25}$Te$_{0.75}$
single crystals ($0.9\leq y \leq1.1$) were studied by means of x-ray
diffraction, SQUID magnetometry, muon spin rotation, and elastic neutron
diffraction. The samples with $y<1$ exhibit coexistence of bulk
superconductivity and incommensurate magnetism. The magnetic order remains
incommensurate for $y\geq 1$, but with increasing Fe content superconductivity
is suppressed and the magnetic correlation length increases. The results show
that the superconducting and the magnetic properties of the
Fe$_{y}$Se$_{1-x}$Te$_{x}$ can be tuned not only by varying the Se/Te ratio but
also by changing the Fe content.
