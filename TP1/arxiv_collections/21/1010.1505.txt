Measured and calculated cross sections for spin-exchange between alkali atoms
and noble gases (specifically sodium and helium) are used to constrain
anomalous spin-dependent forces between nuclei at the atomic scale ($\sim
10^{-8}~{\rm cm}$). Combined with existing stringent limits on anomalous
short-range, spin-dependent couplings of the proton, the dimensionless coupling
constant for a heretofore undiscovered axial vector interaction of the neutron
arising from exchange of a boson of mass $\lesssim 100~{\rm eV}$ is constrained
to be $g_A^n/\sqrt{4 \pi \hbar c} < 2 \times 10^{-3}$. Constraints are
established for a velocity- and spin-dependent interaction $\propto
\prn{\mathbf{I} \cdot \mathbf{v}} \prn{\mathbf{K} \cdot \mathbf{v}}$, where
$\mathbf{I}$ and $\mathbf{K}$ are the nuclear spins of He and Na, respectively,
and $\mathbf{v}$ is the relative velocity of the atoms. Constraints on torsion
gravity are also considered.
