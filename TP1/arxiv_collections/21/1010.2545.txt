We report the fabrication and characterization of superconducting quantum
interference devices (SQUIDs) based on InAs nanowires and vanadium
superconducting electrodes. These mesoscopic devices are found to be extremely
robust against thermal cycling and to operate up to temperatures of $\sim2.5$~K
with reduced power dissipation. We show that our geometry allows to obtain
nearly-symmetric devices with very large magnetic-field modulation of the
critical current. All these properties make these devices attractive for
on-chip quantum-circuit implementation.
