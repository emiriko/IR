For early type magnetic stars slow, at most moderate rotational velocities
have been considered an observational fact. The detection of a multi-kilogauss
magnetic field in the B2Vpn star with P approx. 0.52d and v sin approx. 300km/s
has brought down this narrative. We have obtained more than 100
high-resolution, high-S/N echelle spectra in 2009. These spectra provide the
most detailed description of the variability of any He-strong star to date. The
circumstellar environment is dominated by a rotationally locked magnetosphere
out to several stellar radii, causing hydrogen emission. The photosphere is
characterized by surface chemical abundance inhomogeneities, with much stronger
amplitudes, at least for helium, than slower rotating stars like \sigma Ori E.
The highly complex rotational line profile modulations of metal lines are
probably a consequence the equatorial gravity darkening of HR 7355, and thus
may offer an independent measurement of the von Zeipel parameter \beta .
