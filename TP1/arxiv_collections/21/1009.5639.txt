A detailed account of a recently developed method [Marom et al., Phys. Rev.
Lett. 105, 046801 (2010)] to quantify the registry mismatch in layered
materials is presented. The registry index, which was originally defined for
planar hexagonal boron-nitride, is extended to treat graphitic systems and
generalized to describe multi-layered nanotubes. It is shown that using simple
geometric considerations it is possible to capture the complex physical
features of interlayer sliding in layered materials. The intuitive nature of
the presented model and the efficiency of the related computations suggest that
the method can be used as a powerful characterization tool for interlayer
interactions in complex layered systems.
