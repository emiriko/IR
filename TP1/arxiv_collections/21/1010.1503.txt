I review a number of topics where conventional wisdom in hadron physics has
been challenged. For example, hadrons can be produced at large transverse
momentum directly within a hard higher-twist QCD subprocess, rather than from
jet fragmentation. Such "direct" processes can explain the deviations from
perturbative QCD predictions in measurements of inclusive hadron cross sections
at fixed x_T= 2p_T/\sqrt s, as well as the "baryon anomaly", the anomalously
large proton-to-pion ratio seen in high centrality heavy ion collisions.
Initial-state and final-state interactions of the struck quark lead to
Bjorken-scaling single-spin asymmetries, diffractive deep inelastic scattering,
the breakdown of the Lam-Tung relation in Drell-Yan reactions, as well as
nuclear shadowing and antishadowing. The Gribov-Glauber theory predicts that
antishadowing of nuclear structure functions is not universal, but instead
depends on the flavor quantum numbers of each quark and antiquark, thus
explaining the anomalous nuclear dependence measured in deep-inelastic neutrino
scattering. One cannot attribute such phenomena to the structure of the hadron
or nucleus itself. It is thus important to distinguish "static" structure
functions computed from the square of the target light-front wavefunctions,
versus "dynamical" structure functions which include the effects of the
final-state rescattering of the struck quark. The importance of the J=0
photon-quark QCD contact interaction in deeply virtual Compton scattering is
emphasized. The scheme-independent BLM method for setting the renormalization
scale is discussed. Eliminating the renormalization scale ambiguity greatly
improves the precision of QCD predictions and increases the sensitivity of
searches for new physics at the LHC. Other novel features of QCD are discussed,
including the consequences of confinement for quark and gluon condensates.
