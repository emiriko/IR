We present a generic framework, "baryomorphosis", which modifies the baryon
asymmetry to be naturally of the order of a typical thermal relic WIMP density.
We consider a simple scalar-based model to show how this is possible. This
model introduces a sector in which a large initial baryon asymmetry is injected
into particles ("annihilons") phi_B, \bar{phi}_B of mass ~ 100 GeV - 1 TeV.
phi_B-\bar{phi}_B annihilations convert the initial phi_B, \bar{phi}_B
asymmetry to a final asymmetry with a thermal relic WIMP-like density. This
subsequently decays to a conventional baryon asymmetry whose magnitude is
naturally related to the density of thermal relic WIMP dark matter. In this way
the two coincidences of baryons and dark matter i.e. why their densities are
similar to each other and why they are both similar to a WIMP thermal relic
density (the "WIMP miracle"), may be understood. The model may be tested by the
production of annihilons at colliders.
