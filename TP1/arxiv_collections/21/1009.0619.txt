Environmental monitoring is often performed through a wireless sensor
network, whose nodes are randomly deployed over the geographical region of
interest. Sensors sample a physical phenomenon (the so-called field) and send
their measurements to a {\em sink} node, which is in charge of reconstructing
the field from such irregular samples. In this work, we focus on scenarios of
practical interest where the sensor deployment is unfeasible in certain areas
of the geographical region, e.g., due to terrain asperities, and the delivery
of sensor measurements to the sink may fail due to fading or to transmission
collisions among sensors simultaneously accessing the wireless medium. Under
these conditions, we carry out an asymptotic analysis and evaluate the quality
of the estimation of a d-dimensional field when the sink uses linear filtering
as a reconstruction technique. Specifically, given the matrix representing the
sampling system, V, we derive both the moments and an expression of the
limiting spectral distribution of VV*, as the size of V goes to infinity and
its aspect ratio has a finite limit bounded away from zero. By using such
asymptotic results, we approximate the mean square error on the estimated field
through the eta-transform of VV*, and derive the sensor network performance
under the conditions described above.
