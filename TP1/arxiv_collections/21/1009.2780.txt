The production of doubly charged Higgs bosons (H^{\pm\pm}) at the CERN LHC
can give rise to distinctive multi-lepton signatures. The discovery potential
of H^{\pm\pm} can be optimized by considering a search strategy which is
sensitive to both of the dominant production mechanisms, q\bar q\to
H^{++}H^{--} and q\bar {q'}\to H^{\pm\pm}H^{\mp}. We compare the discovery
potential for the signatures of exactly four leptons and at least three leptons
in the final state, using the same set of cuts. We have carried out fast
detector simulations at the LHC for both signal and backgrounds for a wide
range of values of the charged Higgs mass. We find that the use of the latter
channel can substantially improve the detection prospects of the doubly charged
Higgs boson at the LHC.
