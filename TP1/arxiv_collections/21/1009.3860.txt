The contribution to the biexciton binding energy in quantum dots resulting
from the interaction with longitudinal optical phonons is estimated by
performing the configuration--interaction calculation of the few-particle
states in a simple model of the confining potential and including the phonon
corrections by means of a perturbation theory. It is found that the polaron
contribution tends to compensate the Coulomb-related biexciton shift (binding
energy) and reduces its value by several to even 30%, depending on the material
parameters of the system.
