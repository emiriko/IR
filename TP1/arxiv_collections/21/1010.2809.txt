What input signals will lead to synchrony vs. desynchrony in a group of
biological oscillators? This question connects with both classical dynamical
systems analyses of entrainment and phase locking and with emerging studies of
stimulation patterns for controlling neural network activity. Here, we focus on
the response of a population of uncoupled, elliptically bursting neurons to a
common pulsatile input. We extend a phase reduction from the literature to
capture inputs of varied strength, leading to a circle map with discontinuities
of various orders. In a combined analytical and numerical approach, we apply
our results to both a normal form model for elliptic bursting and to a
biophysically-based neuron model from the basal ganglia. We find that,
depending on the period and amplitude of inputs, the response can either appear
chaotic (with provably positive Lyaponov exponent for the associated circle
maps), or periodic with a broad range of phase-locked periods. Throughout, we
discuss the critical underlying mechanisms, including slow-passage effects
through Hopf bifurcation, the role and origin of discontinuities, and the
impact of noise
