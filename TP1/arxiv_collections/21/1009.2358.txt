Using large scale real-time lattice simulations, we calculate the baryon
asymmetry generated at a fast, cold electroweak symmetry breaking transition.
CP-violation is provided by the leading effective bosonic term resulting from
integrating out the fermions in the Minimal Standard Model at zero temperature,
and performing a covariant gradient expansion [1]. This is an extension of the
work presented in [2]. The numerical implementation is described in detail, and
we address issues specifically related to using this CP-violating term in the
context of Cold Electroweak Baryogenesis. The results support the conclusion of
[2], that Standard Model CP-violation may be able to reproduce the observed
baryon asymmetry in the Universe in the context of Cold Electroweak
Baryogenesis.
