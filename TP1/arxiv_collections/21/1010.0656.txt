The examination of roots of constrained polynomials dates back at least to
Waring and to Littlewood. However, such delicate structures as fractals and
holes have only recently been found. We study the space of roots to certain
integer polynomials arising naturally in the context of Calabi-Yau spaces,
notably Poincare and Newton polynomials, and observe various salient features
and geometrical patterns.
