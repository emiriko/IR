The extreme Kerr throat solution is believed to be non-supersymmetric.
However, its isometry group SO(2,1) x U(1) matches precisely the bosonic
subgroup of N=2 superconformal group in one dimension. In this paper we
construct N=2 supersymmetric extension of a massive particle moving near the
horizon of the extreme Kerr black hole. Bosonic conserved charges are related
to Killing vectors in a conventional way. Geometric interpretation of
supersymmetry charges remains a challenge.
