The recently invented cylindrical geometric space defect is applied to the
electron behaviour in the system which can be regarded as a simplified model of
a double-wall nanotube. By solving the Schrodinger equation in the region of
space with cylindrical geometric defect we explore the influence of such
geometric defect on the energy gap and charge distribution. The effect is
qualitatively similar to the one obtained earlier by means of traditional
simulation methods. In general, the geometric approach can not compete with the
known methods of theoretical study of the nanostructures, such as molecular
dynamics. However it may be useful for better qualitative understanding of the
electronic properties of the nanosystems.
