The stellar system omega Centauri is well known for the large range in
abundance among its member stars. Recent work has indicated that the globular
cluster M22 (NGC 6656) also possesses an internal abundance range, albeit
substantially smaller than that in omega Cen. Here we compare, as a function of
[Fe/H], element-to-iron ratios in the two systems for a number of different
elements using data from abundance analyses of red giant branch stars. It
appears that the nucleosynthetic enrichment processes were very similar in
these two systems despite the substantial difference in total mass.
