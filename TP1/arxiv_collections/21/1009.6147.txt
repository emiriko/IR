X-ray bursting neutron stars in low mass X-ray binaries constitute an
appropriate source class to constrain masses and radii of neutron stars, but a
sufficiently extended set of corresponding model atmospheres is necessary for
these investigations. We computed such a set of model atmospheres and emergent
spectra in a plane-parallel, hydrostatic, and LTE approximation with Compton
scattering taken into account. The models were calculated for six different
chemical compositions: pure hydrogen and pure helium atmospheres, and
atmospheres with solar mix of hydrogen and helium, and various heavy element
abundances Z = 1, 0.3, 0.1, and 0.01 Z_sun. For each chemical composition the
models are computed for three values of surface gravity, log g =14.0, 14.3, and
14.6, and for 20 values of the luminosity in units of the Eddington luminosity,
L/L_Edd, in the range 0.001--0.98. The emergent spectra of all models are
redshifted and fitted by a diluted blackbody in the RXTE/PCA 3--20 keV energy
band, and corresponding values of the color correction (hardness factors) f_c
are presented. Theoretical dependences f_c - L/L_Edd can fitted to the observed
dependence K^{-1/4} - F of the blackbody normalization K on flux during cooling
stages of X-ray bursts to determine the Eddington flux and the ratio of the
apparent neutron star radius to the source distance. If the distance is known,
these parameters can be transformed to the constraints on neutron star mass and
radius. The theoretical atmosphere spectra can also be used for direct
comparison with the observed X-ray burst spectra.
