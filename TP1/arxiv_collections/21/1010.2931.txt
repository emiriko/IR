Nonlinear time series analysis is an active field of research that studies
the structure of complex signals in order to derive information of the process
that generated those series, for understanding, modeling and forecasting
purposes. In the last years, some methods mapping time series to network
representations have been proposed. The purpose is to investigate on the
properties of the series through graph theoretical tools recently developed in
the core of the celebrated complex network theory. Among some other methods,
the so-called visibility algorithm has received much attention, since it has
been shown that series correlations are captured by the algorithm and
translated in the associated graph, opening the possibility of building
fruitful connections between time series analysis, nonlinear dynamics, and
graph theory. Here we use the horizontal visibility algorithm to characterize
and distinguish between correlated stochastic, uncorrelated and chaotic
processes. We show that in every case the series maps into a graph with
exponential degree distribution P (k) ~ exp(-{\lambda}k), where the value of
{\lambda} characterizes the specific process. The frontier between chaotic and
correlated stochastic processes, {\lambda} = ln(3/2), can be calculated
exactly, and some other analytical developments confirm the results provided by
extensive numerical simulations and (short) experimental time series.
