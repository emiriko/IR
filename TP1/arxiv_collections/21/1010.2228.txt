We consider time-dependence of dynamical transport, following a recent study
of the stadium billiard in which classical transmission and reflection
probabilities were shown to exhibit exponential or algebraic decay depending on
the choice of the lead or "hole". The system considered here is much more
general, having a generic mixed phase space structure, time-dependence of the
dynamics, and Fermi acceleration (trajectories with unbounded velocity). We
propose an efficient numerical scheme for this model, observe the asymmetric
transport effect, and discuss observed stretched exponential decays.
