Only 5 Of?p stars have been identified in the Galaxy. Of these, 3 have been
studied in detail, and within the past 5 years magnetic fields have been
detected in each of them. The observed magnetic and spectral characteristics
are indicative of organised magnetic fields, likely of fossil origin, confining
their supersonic stellar winds into dense, structured magnetospheres. The
systematic detection of magnetic fields in these stars strongly suggests that
the Of?p stars represent a general class of magnetic O-type stars.
