In this paper we study how perturbing a matrix changes its non-negative rank.
We prove that the non-negative rank is upper-semicontinuos and we describe some
special families of perturbations. We show how our results relate to Statistics
in terms of the study of Maximum Likelihood Estimation for mixture models.
