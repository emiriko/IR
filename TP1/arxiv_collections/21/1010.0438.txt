The main accelerating structures for the CLIC are designed to operate at an
average accelerating gradient of 100 MV/m. The accelerating frequency has been
optimised to 11.994 GHz with a phase advance of 2{\pi}/3 of the main
accelerating mode. The moderately damped and detuned structure (DDS) design is
being studied as an alternative to the strongly damped WDS design. Both these
designs are based on the nominal accelerating phase advance. Here we explore
high phase advance (HPA) structures in which the group velocity of the rf
fields is reduced compared to that of standard (2{\pi}/3) structures. The
electrical breakdown strongly depends on the fundamental mode group velocity.
Hence it is expected that electrical breakdown is less likely to occur in the
HPA structures. We report on a study of both the fundamental and dipole modes
in a CLIC_DDS_HPA structure, designed to operate at 5{\pi}/6 phase advance per
cell. Higher order dipole modes in both the standard and HPA structures are
also studied.
