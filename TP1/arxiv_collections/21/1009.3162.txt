Exchange bias properties are observed in a double perovskite compound,
Sr2LuRuO6. The observed exchange bias properties have been analyzed on the
basis of some of the available theoretical models. Detailed magnetization
measurements show that the exchange bias properties are associated with the
Dzyaloshinsky-Moria (D-M) interaction among the antiferromagnetically ordered
Ru moments (TN~32K). In addition to the usual canting of the antiferromagnetic
moments, D-M interaction in this compound also causes a magnetization reversal
at T~26K, which seems to trigger the exchange bias properties. Heat capacity
measurements confirm the two magnetic anomalies.
