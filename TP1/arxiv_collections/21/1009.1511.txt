We present a new model of quasi-one-dimensional trap with some unknown
physical predictions about a second transition, including about a change in
fractions of condensed coherence lengths due to the existence of a second
critical temperature Tm < Tc. If this physical model is acceptable, we want to
challenge experimental physicists in this regard.
