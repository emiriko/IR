We describe situations in which chains of N degenerate quantum energy levels,
coupled by time-dependent external fields, can be replaced by independent sets
of chains of length N, N-1,...,2 and sets of uncoupled single states. The
transformation is a generalization of the two-level Morris-Shore transformation
[J.R. Morris and B.W. Shore, Phys. Rev. A 27, 906 (1983)]. We illustrate the
procedure with examples of three-level chains.
