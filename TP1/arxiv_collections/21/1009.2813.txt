The DO collaboration has measured a deviation from the standard model (SM)
prediction in the like sign dimuon asymmetry in semileptonic b decay with a
significance of 3.2 sigma. We discuss how minimal flavour violating (MFV)
models with multiple scalar representations can lead to this deviation through
tree level exchanges of new MFV scalars. We review how the two scalar doublet
model can accommodate this result and discuss some of its phenomenology. Limits
on electric dipole moments suggest that in this model the coupling of the
charged scalar to the right handed u-type quarks is suppressed while its
coupling to the d-type right handed quarks must be enhanced. We construct an
extension of the MFV two scalar doublet model where this occurs naturally.
