We present an efficient arbitrary polarization qubit transmission scheme
against channel noise by utilizing frequency degree of freedom, which is more
stable in transmission surroundings. The information of quantum state is
encoded in frequency state during the transmission and transferred to
polarization state later. Both the fidelity of quantum state transmitted and
the success probability of this scheme are 1 in principle.
