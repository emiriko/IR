A general treatment of the quantal time-dependent coupled oscillators in
presence of the variable magnetic field is presented. The treatment is based on
the use of an alternative canonical transformations, time-dependent unitary
transformations and the invariant methods. Exact wave functions for
Schr\"{o}dinger equations of this system are constructed.We applied our theory
to a particular case and, co,sequently, showed that our results recovers to the
perviously known one.
