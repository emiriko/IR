We report on the archival optical and near-infrared observations of 6 low
mass X-ray binaries situated in the Galactic bulge. We processed several recent
Chandra and XMM-Newton as well as Einstein datasets of a binary systems
suspected to be ultracompact, which gave us arcsec-scale positional uncertainty
estimates. We then undertook comprehensive search in existing archives and
other Virtual Observatory resources in order to discover unpublished
optical/NIR data on these objects. We found and analysed data from ESO Archive
and UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey (UKIDSS) on SLX 1735-269, 3A 1742-294, SLX
1744-299, SLX 1744-300, GX 3+1, IGR J17505-2644 systems and publish their
finding charts and optical flux constraints in this paper, as well as simple
estimates of the physical parameters of these objects.
