Financial contracts with options that allow the holder to extend the contract
maturity by paying an additional fixed amount found many applications in
finance. Closed-form solutions for the price of these options have appeared in
the literature for the case when the contract underlying asset follows a
geometric Brownian motion with the constant interest rate, volatility, and
non-negative "dividend" yield. In this paper, the option price is derived for
the case of the underlying asset that follows a geometric Brownian motion with
the time-dependent drift and volatility which is important to use the solutions
in real life applications. The formulas are derived for the drift that may
include non-negative or negative "dividend" yield. The latter case results in a
new solution type that has not been studied in the literature. Several
typographical errors in the formula for the holder-extendible put, typically
repeated in textbooks and software, are corrected.
