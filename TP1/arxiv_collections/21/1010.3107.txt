Massive stars are among the most important objects in the Universe and many
(most?) of them are formed in binaries. A selection of observational and
theoretical facts that illustrate the importance of binaries and the evolution
of massive and very massive stars in clusters with special emphasis on massive
binaries have been summarized in two recent review papers (Vanbeveren, 2009,
2010). The present paper can be considered as an addendum of both reviews.
