There is substantial interest in the effect of human mobility patterns on
opportunistic communications. Inspired by recent work revisiting some of the
early evidence for a L\'evy flight foraging strategy in animals, we analyse
datasets on human contact from real world traces. By analysing the distribution
of inter-contact times on different time scales and using different graphical
forms, we find not only the highly skewed distributions of waiting times
highlighted in previous studies but also clear circadian rhythm. The relative
visibility of these two components depends strongly on which graphical form is
adopted and the range of time scales. We use a simple model to reconstruct the
observed behaviour and discuss the implications of this for forwarding
efficiency.
