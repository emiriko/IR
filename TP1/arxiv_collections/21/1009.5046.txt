The channeling of the ion recoiling after a collision with a WIMP changes the
ionization signal in direct detection experiments, producing a larger signal
than otherwise expected. We give estimates of the fraction of channeled
recoiling ions in NaI (Tl), Si and Ge crystals using analytic models produced
since the 1960's and 70's to describe channeling and blocking effects. We find
that the channeling fraction of recoiling lattice nuclei is smaller than that
of ions that are injected into the crystal and that it is strongly temperature
dependent.
