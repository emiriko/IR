Uniaxial hot pressing has been used to obtain ceramics based on zinc oxide,
and their optical, x-ray-structure, luminescence, and scintillation
characteristics have been studied. It is shown that, by changing the
concentration of the dopant (Ga) and the codopant (N), it is possible to change
the intensities of the edge band (397.5 nm) and the intraband luminescence (510
nm) of the ZnO luminescence, as well as their ratio. Undoped ZnO ceramic has
good transparency in the visible region and fairly high luminous yield: 9050
photons per MeV. Ceramic ZnO:Ga possesses intense edge luminescence with a
falloff time of about 1 ns.
