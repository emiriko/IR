We report pressure-dependent transient picosecond and continuous-wave
photomodulation studies of disordered and ordered films of
2-methoxy-5-(2-ethylhexyloxy) poly(para-phenylenevinylene). Photoinduced
absorption (PA) bands in the disordered film exhibit very weak pressure
dependence and are assigned to intrachain excitons and polarons. In contrast,
the ordered film exhibits two additional transient PA bands in the midinfrared
that blueshift dramatically with pressure. Based on high-order configuration
interaction calculations we ascribe the PA bands in the ordered film to
excimers. Our work brings insight to the exciton binding energy in ordered
films versus disordered films and solutions. The reduced exciton binding energy
in ordered films is due to new energy states appearing below the continuum band
threshold of the single strand.
