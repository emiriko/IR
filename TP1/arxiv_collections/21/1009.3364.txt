We study the effects of the tensor term of the effective nucleon-nucleon
interaction on nuclear excited states. Our investigation has been conducted by
using a self-consistent Random Phase Approximation approach. We investigate
various nuclei in different regions of the isotopes chart. Results for a set of
calcium isotopes are shown.
