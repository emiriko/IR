We give a new proof of sequential weak* lower semicontinuity in
$\BV(\Omega;\R^m)$ for integral functionals with a quasiconvex Carath\'{e}odory
integrand with linear growth at infinity and such that the recession function
$f^\infty$ exists in a strong sense and is (jointly) continuous. In contrast to
the classical proofs by Ambrosio & Dal Maso [J. Funct. Anal. 109 (1992), 76-97]
and Fonseca & M\"{u}ller [Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal. 123 (1993), 1-49], we do
not use Alberti's Rank-One Theorem [Proc. Roy. Soc. Edinburgh Sect. A} 123
(1993), 239-274], but a rigidity result for gradients. The proof is set in the
framework of generalized Young measures and proceeds via establishing
Jensen-type inequalities for regular and singular points of $Du$.
