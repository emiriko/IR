The radial velocity signature of stellar noise is small, around the
meter-per-second, but already too much for the detection of Earth mass planets
in habitable zones. In this paper, we address the important role played by
observational strategies in averaging out the radial velocity signature of
stellar noise. We also derive the planetary mass detection limits expected in
presence of stellar noise. We start with HARPS asteroseismology measurements
for 4 stars (beta Hyi, alpha Cen A, mu Ara and tau Ceti) available in the ESO
archive plus very precise measurements of alpha Cen B. This sample covers
different spectral types, from G2 to K1 and different evolutionary stage, from
subgiant to dwarf stars. Since the span of our data ranges between 5 to 8 days,
we will have access to oscillation modes and granulation phenomena, without
important contribution of activity noise which is present at larger time
scales. For those 5 stars, we generate synthetic radial velocity measurements
after fitting corresponding models of stellar noise in Fourier space. These
measurements allows us to study the radial velocity variation due to stellar
noise for different observational strategies as well as the corresponding
planetary mass detection limits. Applying 3 measurements per night of 10
minutes exposure each, 2 hours apart, seems to average out most efficiently the
stellar noise considered. For quiet K1V stars as alpha Cen B, such a strategy
allows us to detect planets of ~3 times the mass of Earth with an orbital
period of 200 days, corresponding to the habitable zone of the star. Since
activity is not yet included in our simulation, these detection limits
correspond to a case, which exist, where the host star has few magnetic
features. In this case stellar noise is dominated by oscillation modes and
granulation phenomena.
