While the rising flux tube paradigm is an elegant theory, its basic
assumptions, thin flux tubes at the bottom of the convection zone with field
strengths two orders of magnitude above equipartition, remain numerically
unverified at best. As such, in recent years the idea of a formation of
sunspots near the top of the convection zone has generated some interest. The
presence of turbulence can strongly enhance diffusive transport mechanisms,
leading to an effective transport coefficient formalism in the mean-field
formulation. The question is what happens to these coefficients when the
turbulence becomes anisotropic due to a strong large-scale mean magnetic field.
It has been noted in the past that this anisotropy can also lead to highly
non-diffusive behaviour. In the present work we investigate the formation of
large-scale magnetic structures as a result of a negative contribution of
turbulence to the large-scale effective magnetic pressure in the presence of
stratification. In direct numerical simulations of forced turbulence in a
stratified box, we verify the existence of this effect. This phenomenon can
cause formation of large-scale magnetic structures even from initially uniform
large-scale magnetic field.
