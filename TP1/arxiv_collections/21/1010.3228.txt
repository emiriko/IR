For the full galaxy mass range, we find that previously observed trends of
globular cluster (GC) system scaling parameters (number, luminosity or mass of
all GCs in a galaxy normalized to the host galaxy luminosity or mass, e.g. S_L)
as a function of galaxy mass, holds irrespective of galaxy type or environment.
The S_L-value of early-type galaxies is, on average, twice that of late-types.
We derive theoretical predictions which describe remarkably well the observed
GC system scaling parameter distributions given an assumed GC formation
efficiency ({\eta}), i.e. the ratio of total mass in GCs to galaxy halo mass.
It has a mean value of {\eta}=5.5e-5 , and an increasing scatter toward low
galaxy mass. The excess {\eta}-values of some massive galaxies compared to
expectations from the mean model prediction, may be attributed to an efficient
GC formation, inefficient production of field stars, accretion of low-mass
high-{\eta} galaxies or likely a mixture of all these effects.
