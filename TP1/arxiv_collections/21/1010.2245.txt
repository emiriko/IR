The B0.2 V magnetic star tau Sco stands out from the larger population of
massive magnetic OB stars due to its remarkable, superionized wind, apparently
related to its peculiar magnetic field - a field which is far more complex than
the mostly-dipolar fields usually observed in magnetic OB stars. tau Sco is
therefore a puzzling outlier in the larger picture of stellar magnetism - a
star that still defies interpretation in terms of a physically coherent model.
  Recently, two early B-type stars were discovered as tau Sco analogues,
identified by the striking similarity of their UV spectra to that of tau Sco,
which was - until now - unique among OB stars. We present the recent detection
of their magnetic fields by the MiMeS collaboration, reinforcing the connection
between the presence of a magnetic field and a superionized wind. We will also
present ongoing observational efforts undertaken to establish the precise
magnetic topology, in order to provide additional constrains for existing
models attempting to reproduce the unique wind structure of tau Sco-like stars.
