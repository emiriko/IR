We consider a zero-sum stochastic differential controller-and-stopper game in
which the state process is a controlled diffusion evolving in a
multi-dimensional Euclidean space. In this game, the controller affects both
the drift and the volatility terms of the state process. Under appropriate
conditions, we show that the game has a value and the value function is the
unique viscosity solution to an obstacle problem for a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman
equation.
