For open quantum systems coupled to a thermal bath at inverse temperature
$\beta$, it is well known that under the Born-, Markov-, and secular
approximations the system density matrix will approach the thermal Gibbs state
with the bath inverse temperature $\beta$. We generalize this to systems where
there exists a conserved quantity (e.g., the total particle number), where for
a bath characterized by inverse temperature $\beta$ and chemical potential
$\mu$ we find equilibration of both temperature and chemical potential. For
couplings to multiple baths held at different temperatures and different
chemical potentials, we identify a class of systems that equilibrates according
to a single hypothetical average but in general non-thermal bath, which may be
exploited to generate desired non-thermal states. Under special circumstances
the stationary state may be again be described by a unique Boltzmann factor.
These results are illustrated by several examples.
