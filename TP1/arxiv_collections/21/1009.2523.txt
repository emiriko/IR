We construct an edge-weight distribution for i.i.d. first-passage percolation
on $\mathbb{Z}^2$ whose limit shape is not a polygon and whose extreme points
are arbitrarily dense in the boundary. Consequently, the associated
Richardson-type growth model can support coexistence of a countably infinite
number of distinct species, and the graph of infection has infinitely many
ends.
