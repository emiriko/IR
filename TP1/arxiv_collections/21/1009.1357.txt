In this paper we consider the quantum phase transition in the Ising model in
the presence of a transverse field in one, two and three dimensions from a
multi-partite entanglement point of view. Using \emph{exact} numerical
solutions, we are able to study such systems up to 25 qubits. The Meyer-Wallach
measure of global entanglement is used to study the critical behavior of this
model. The transition we consider is between a symmetric GHZ-like state to a
paramagnetic product-state. We find that global entanglement serves as a good
indicator of quantum phase transition with interesting scaling behavior. We use
finite-size scaling to extract the critical point as well as some critical
exponents for the one and two dimensional models. Our results indicate that
such multi-partite measure of global entanglement shows universal features
regardless of dimension $d$. Our results also provides evidence that
multi-partite entanglement is better suited for the study of quantum phase
transitions than the much studied bi-partite measures.
