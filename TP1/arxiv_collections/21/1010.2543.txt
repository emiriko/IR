We present a novel theoretical tool to analyze the dynamical behaviour of a
Be disk fed by non-constant decretion rates. It is mainly based on the computer
code HDUST, a fully three-dimensional radiative transfer code that has been
successfully applied to study several Be systems so far, and the SINGLEBE code
that solves the 1D viscous diffusion problem. We have computed models of the
temporal evolution of different types of Be star disks for different dynamical
scenarios. By showing the behaviour of a large number of observables
(interferometry, polarization, photometry and spectral line profiles), we show
how it is possible to infer from observations some key dynamical parameters of
the disk.
