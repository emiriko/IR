We studied a steadily accreting, geometrically thick disk model that
selfconsistently takes into account selfgravitation of the polytropic gas, its
interaction with the radiation and the mass accretion rate. The accreting mass
is injected inward in the vicinity of the central $z=0$ plane, where also
radiation is assumed to be created. The rest of the disk remains approximately
stationary. Only conservation laws are employed and the gas-radiation
interaction in the bulk of the disk is described in the thin-gas approximation.
We demonstrate that this scheme is numerically viable and yields a structure of
the bulk that is influenced by the radiation and (indirectly) by the prescribed
mass accretion rate. The obtained disk configurations are typical for
environments in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), with the central mass of the
order of $10^7 M_{\astrosun}$ to $10^8 M_{\astrosun}$, quasi-Keplerian rotation
curves, disk masses ranging from about $10^6 M_{\astrosun}$ to $10^7
M_{\astrosun}$, and the luminosity ranging from $10^6 L_{\astrosun}$ to $10^9
L_{\astrosun}$. These luminosities are much lower than the corresponding
Eddington limit.
