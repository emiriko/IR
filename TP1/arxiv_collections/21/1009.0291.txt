We present density-functional theory calculations of the optical absorption
spectra of silica glass for temperatures up to 2400 K. The calculated spectra
exhibit exponential tails near the fundamental absorption edge that follow the
Urbach rule, in good agreement with experiments. We also discuss the accuracy
of our results by comparing to hybrid exchange correlation functionals. By
deriving a simple relationship between the exponential tails of the absorption
coefficient and the electronic density-of-states, we establish a direct link
between the photoemission and the absorption spectra near the absorption edge.
This relationship is subsequently employed to determine the lower bound to the
Urbach frequency regime. Most interestingly, in this frequency interval, the
optical absorption is Poisson distributed with very large statistical
fluctuations. Finally, We determine the upper bound to the Urbach frequency
regime by identifying the frequency at which transition to Poisson distribution
takes place.
