Inspired by extremely simplified view of the earthquakes we propose the
stochastic domino cellular automaton model exhibiting avalanches. From
elementary combinatorial arguments we derive a set of nonlinear equations
describing the automaton. Exact relations between the average parameters of the
model are presented. Depending on imposed triggering, the model reproduces both
exponential and inverse power statistics of clusters.
