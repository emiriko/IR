Motivated by recent experimental advances in creating polar molecular gases
in the laboratory, we theoretically investigate the many body effects of
two-dimensional dipolar systems with the anisotropic and $1/r^3$ dipole-dipole
interactions. We calculate collective modes of 2D dipolar systems, and also
consider spatially separated bilayer and multilayer superlattice dipolar
systems. We obtain the characteristic features of collective modes in quantum
dipolar gases. We quantitatively compare the modes of these dipolar systems
with the modes of the extensively studied usual two-dimensional electron
systems, where the inter-particle interaction is Coulombic.
