First results of near-IR adaptive optics (AO)-assisted imaging,
interferometry, and spectroscopy of this Luminous Blue Variable (LBV) are
presented. They suggest that the Pistol Star is at least double. If the
association is physical, it would reinforce questions concerning the importance
of multiplicity for the formation and evolution of extremely massive stars.
