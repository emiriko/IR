Temperature-dependent resistivity of graphene grown by chemical vapor
deposition (CVD) is investigated. We observe in low mobility CVD graphene
device a strong insulating behavior at low temperatures and a metallic behavior
at high temperatures manifesting a non-monotonic in the temperature dependent
resistivity.This feature is strongly affected by carrier density modulation. To
understand this anomalous temperature dependence, we introduce thermal
activation of charge carriers in electron-hole puddles induced by randomly
distributed charged impurities. Observed temperature evolution of resistivity
is then understood from the competition among thermal activation of charge
carriers, temperature-dependent screening and phonon scattering effects. Our
results imply that the transport property of transferred CVD-grown graphene is
strongly influenced by the details of the environment
