We investigate two destabilization mechanisms for elastic polymer films and
put them into a general framework: first, instabilities due to in-plane stress
and second due to an externally applied electric field normal to the film's
free surface. As shown recently, polymer films are often stressed due to
out-of-equilibrium fabrication processes as e.g. spin coating. Via an
Asaro-Tiller-Grinfeld mechanism as known from solids, the system can decrease
its energy by undulating its surface by surface diffusion of polymers and
thereby relaxing stresses. On the other hand, application of an electric field
is widely used experimentally to structure thin films: when the electric
Maxwell surface stress overcomes surface tension and elastic restoring forces,
the system undulates with a wavelength determined by the film thickness. We
develop a theory taking into account both mechanisms simultaneously and discuss
their interplay and the effects of the boundary conditions both at the
substrate and the free surface.
