We show that a partial gauge fixing of the NS sector of the
democratic-picture superstring field theory leads to the non-polynomial theory.
Moreover, by partially gauge fixing the Ramond sector we obtain a
non-polynomial fully RNS theory at pictures 0 and 1/2. Within the democratic
theory and in the partially gauge fixed theory the equations of motion of both
sectors are derived from an action. We also discuss a representation of the
non-polynomial theory analogous to a manifestly two-dimensional representation
of WZW theory and the action of bosonic pure-gauge solutions.
  We further demonstrate that one can consistently gauge fix the NS sector of
the democratic theory at picture number -1. The resulting theory is new. It is
a Z_2 dual of the modified cubic theory. We construct analytical solutions of
this theory and show that they possess the desired properties.
