We present constraints on cosmological parameters based on a sample of
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich-selected galaxy clusters detected in a millimeter-wave
survey by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope. The cluster sample used in this
analysis consists of 9 optically-confirmed high-mass clusters comprising the
high-significance end of the total cluster sample identified in 455 square
degrees of sky surveyed during 2008 at 148 GHz. We focus on the most massive
systems to reduce the degeneracy between unknown cluster astrophysics and
cosmology derived from SZ surveys. We describe the scaling relation between
cluster mass and SZ signal with a 4-parameter fit. Marginalizing over the
values of the parameters in this fit with conservative priors gives sigma_8 =
0.851 +/- 0.115 and w = -1.14 +/- 0.35 for a spatially-flat wCDM cosmological
model with WMAP 7-year priors on cosmological parameters. This gives a modest
improvement in statistical uncertainty over WMAP 7-year constraints alone.
Fixing the scaling relation between cluster mass and SZ signal to a fiducial
relation obtained from numerical simulations and calibrated by X-ray
observations, we find sigma_8 = 0.821 +/- 0.044 and w = -1.05 +/- 0.20. These
results are consistent with constraints from WMAP 7 plus baryon acoustic
oscillations plus type Ia supernoava which give sigma_8 = 0.802 +/- 0.038 and w
= -0.98 +/- 0.053. A stacking analysis of the clusters in this sample compared
to clusters simulated assuming the fiducial model also shows good agreement.
These results suggest that, given the sample of clusters used here, both the
astrophysics of massive clusters and the cosmological parameters derived from
them are broadly consistent with current models.
