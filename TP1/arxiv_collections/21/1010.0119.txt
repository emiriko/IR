Fragmentation branching ratios of electronically excited molecular species
are of first importance for the modeling of gas phase interstellar chemistry.
Despite experimental and theoretical efforts that have been done during the
last two decades there is still a strong lack of detailed information on those
quantities for many molecules such as Cn, CnH or C3H2. Our aim is to provide
astrochemical databases with more realistic branching ratios for Cn (n=2 to
10), CnH (n=2 to 4), and C3H2 molecules that are electronically excited either
by dissociative recombination, photodissociation, or cosmic ray processes, when
no detailed calculations or measurements exist in literature. High velocity
collision in an inverse kinematics scheme was used to measure the complete
fragmentation pattern of electronically excited Cn (n=2 to 10), CnH (n=2 to 4),
and C3H2 molecules. Branching ratios of dissociation where deduced from those
experiments. The full set of branching ratios was used as a new input in
chemical models and branching ratio modification effects observed in
astrochemical networks that describe the dense cold Taurus Molecular Cloud-1
and the photon dominated Horse Head region. The comparison between the
branching ratios obtained in this work and other types of experiments showed a
good agreement. It was interpreted as the signature of a statistical behavior
of the fragmentation. The branching ratios we obtained lead to an increase of
the C3 production together with a larger dispersion of the daughter fragments.
The introduction of these new values in the photon dominated region model of
the Horse Head nebula increases the abundance of C3 and C3H, but reduces the
abundances of the larger Cn and hydrocarbons at a visual extinction Av smaller
than 4.
