We investigate the anisotropy of Alfv\'enic turbulence in the inertial range
of slow solar wind and in both driven and decaying reduced magnetohydrodynamic
simulations. A direct comparison is made by measuring the anisotropic
second-order structure functions in both data sets. In the solar wind, the
perpendicular spectral index of the magnetic field is close to -5/3. In the
forced simulation, it is close to -5/3 for the velocity and -3/2 for the
magnetic field. In the decaying simulation, it is -5/3 for both fields. The
spectral index becomes steeper at small angles to the local magnetic field
direction in all cases. We also show that when using the global rather than
local mean field, the anisotropic scaling of the simulations cannot always be
properly measured.
