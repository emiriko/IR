Using three-dimensional (3D) simulations of neutrino-powered supernova
explosions we show that the hydrodynamical kick scenario proposed by Scheck et
al. on the basis of two-dimensional (2D) models can yield large neutron star
(NS) recoil velocities also in 3D. Although the shock stays relatively
spherical, standing accretion-shock and convective instabilities lead to a
globally asymmetric mass and energy distribution in the postshock layer. An
anisotropic momentum distribution of the ejecta is built up only after the
explosion sets in. Total momentum conservation implies the acceleration of the
NS on a timescale of 1-3 seconds, mediated mainly by long-lasting, asymmetric
accretion downdrafts and the anisotropic gravitational pull of large
inhomogeneities in the ejecta. In a limited set of 15 solar-mass models with an
explosion energy of about 10^51 erg this stochastic mechanism is found to
produce kicks from <100 km/s to >500 km/s, and >1000 km/s seem possible. Strong
rotational flows around the accreting NS do not develop in our collapsing,
non-rotating progenitors. The NS spins therefore remain low with estimated
periods of about 500-1000 ms and no alignment with the kicks.
