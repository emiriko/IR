Application of the standard canonical quantization rules of quantum field
theory to macroscopic electromagnetism has encountered obstacles due to
material dispersion and absorption. This has led to a phenomenological approach
to macroscopic quantum electrodynamics where no canonical formulation is
attempted. In this paper macroscopic electromagnetism is canonically quantized.
The results apply to any linear, inhomogeneous, magnetodielectric medium with
dielectric functions that obey the Kramers-Kronig relations. The prescriptions
of the phenomenological approach are derived from the canonical theory.
