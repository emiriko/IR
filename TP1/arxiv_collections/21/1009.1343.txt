Through a redefinition of patterns in an Hopfield-like model, we introduce
and develop an approach to model discrete systems made up of many, interacting
components with inner degrees of freedom. Our approach clarifies the intrinsic
connection between the kind of interactions among components and the emergent
topology describing the system itself; also, it allows to effectively address
the statistical mechanics on the resulting networks. Indeed, a wide class of
analytically treatable, weighted random graphs with a tunable level of
correlation can be recovered and controlled. We especially focus on the case of
imitative couplings among components endowed with similar patterns (i.e.
attributes), which, as we show, naturally and without any a-priori assumption,
gives rise to small-world effects. We also solve the thermodynamics (at a
replica symmetric level) by extending the double stochastic stability
technique: free energy, self consistency relations and fluctuation analysis for
a picture of criticality are obtained.
