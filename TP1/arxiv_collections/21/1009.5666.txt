This paper shows quantitatively that the magnitude of the EMC effect measured
in electron deep inelastic scattering (DIS) at intermediate $x_B$, $0.35\le
x_B\le 0.7$, is linearly related to the Short Range Correlation (SRC) scaling
factor obtained from electron inclusive scattering at $x_B\ge 1.$. The observed
phenomenological relationship is used to extract the ratio of the deuteron to
the free $pn$ pair cross sections, the DIS cross section for a free neutron,
and $F_2^n/F_2^p$, the ratio of the free neutron to free proton structure
functions. We speculate that the observed correlation is because both the EMC
effect and SRC are dominated by the high virtuality (high momentum) nucleons in
the nucleus.
