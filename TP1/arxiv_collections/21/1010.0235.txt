Despite their discovery potential touching a wide range of science,
construction of TeV gamma-ray telescopes, Auger, IceCube and a suite of other
particle astrophysics experiments has been largely motivated by the hunt for
the sources of cosmic rays. I will assess the status of our search for the
still-enigmatic sources of cosmic rays. Although a resolution is decidedly
anticipated, the mystery of their origin remains unresolved.
