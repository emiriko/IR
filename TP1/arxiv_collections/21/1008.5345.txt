Generalizing a theorem of Macdonald, we show a formula for the mixed Hodge
structure on the cohomology of the symmetric products of bounded complexes of
mixed Hodge modules by showing the existence of the canonical action of the
symmetric group on the multiple external self-products of complexes of mixed
Hodge modules. We also generalize a theorem of Hirzebruch and Zagier on the
signature of the symmetric products of manifolds to the case of the symmetric
products of symmetric parings on bounded complexes with constructible
cohomology sheaves where the pairing is not assumed to be non-degenerate.
