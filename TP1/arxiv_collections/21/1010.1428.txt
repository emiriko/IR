The weak bosons, leptons and quarks are considered as composite particles.
The interaction of the constituents is a confining gauge interaction. The
standard electroweak model is a low energy approximation. The mixing of the
neutral weak boson with the photon is a dynamical mechanism, similar to the
mixing between the photon and the rho-meson in QCD. This mixing provides
information about the energy scale of the confining gauge force. It must be
less than 1 TeV. At and above this energy many narrow resonances should exist,
which decay into weak bosons and into lepton and quark pairs. Above 1 TeV
excited leptons should exist, which decay into leptons under emission of a weak
boson or a photon. These new states can be observed with the detectors at the
Large Hadron Collider in CERN.
