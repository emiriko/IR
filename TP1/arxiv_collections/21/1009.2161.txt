I investigate useful shape quantities for the classical and quantum mechanics
of the relational quadrilateral in 2-d. This is relational in the sense that
only relative times, relative ratios of separations and relative angles are
significant. Relational particle mechanics models such as this paper's have
many analogies with the geometrodynamical formulation of general relativity.
This renders them suitable as toy models for 1) studying Problem of Time in
Quantum Gravity strategies, in particular timeless, semiclassical and histories
theory approaches and combinations of these. 2) For consideration of various
other quantum-cosmological issues, such as structure formation/inhomogeneity
and notions of uniform states and their significance. The relational
quadrilateral is more useful in these respects than previously investigated
simpler RPM's due to simultaneously possessing linear constraints, nontrivial
subsystems and nontrivial complex-projective mathematics. Such shape have been
found to be useful in simpler relational models such as the relational triangle
and in 1-d.
