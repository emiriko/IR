Due to the commonly known impossibility results, information theoretic
security is considered impossible for oblivious transfer (OT) in both the
classical and the quantum world. In this paper, we proposed a weak version of
the all-or-nothing OT. In our protocol the honest parties do not need long term
quantum memory, entanglements, or sophisticated quantum computations. We
observe some difference between the classical and quantum OT impossibilities.
