By performing new, long and numerically accurate general-relativistic
simulations of magnetized, equal-mass neutron-star binaries, we investigate the
role that realistic magnetic fields may have in the evolution of these systems.
In particular, we study the evolution of the magnetic fields and show that they
can influence the survival of the hypermassive-neutron star produced at the
merger by accelerating its collapse to a black hole. We also provide evidence
that even if purely poloidal initially, the magnetic fields produced in the
tori surrounding the black hole have toroidal and poloidal components of
equivalent strength. When estimating the possibility that magnetic fields could
have an impact on the gravitational-wave signals emitted by these systems
either during the inspiral or after the merger we conclude that for realistic
magnetic-field strengths B<~1e12 G such effects could be detected, but only
marginally, by detectors such as advanced LIGO or advanced Virgo. However,
magnetically induced modifications could become detectable in the case of
small-mass binaries and with the development of gravitational-wave detectors,
such as the Einstein Telescope, with much higher sensitivities at frequencies
larger than ~2 kHz.
