We report a high through-put combinatorial approach to photonic metamaterial
optimization. The new approach is based on parallel synthesis and consecutive
optical characterization of large numbers of spatially addressable
nano-fabricated metamaterial samples (libraries) with quasi-continuous
variation of design parameters under real manufacturing conditions. We
illustrate this method for Fano-resonance plasmonic nanostructures arriving at
explicit recipes for high quality factors needed for switching and sensing
applications.
