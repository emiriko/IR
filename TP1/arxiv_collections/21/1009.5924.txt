A new dynamical model is developed to describe the whole process of surrogate
reactions; transfer of several nucleons at an initial stage, thermal
equilibration of residues leading to washing out of shell effects and decay of
populated compound nuclei are treated in a unified framework. Multi-dimensional
Langevin equations are employed to describe time-evolution of collective
coordinates with a time-dependent potential energy surface corresponding to
different stages of surrogate reactions. The new model is capable of
calculating spin distributions of the compound nuclei, one of the most
important quantity in the surrogate technique. Furthermore, various observables
of surrogate reactions can be calculated, e.g., energy and angular distribution
of ejectile, and mass distributions of fission fragments. These features are
important to assess validity of the proposed model itself, to understand
mechanisms of the surrogate reactions and to determine unknown parameters of
the model. It is found that spin distributions of compound nuclei produced in
$^{18}$O+$^{238}$U $\rightarrow ^{16}$O+$^{240*}$U and $^{18}$O+$^{236}$U
$\rightarrow ^{16}$O+$^{238*}$U reactions are equivalent and much less than
10$\hbar$, therefore satisfy conditions proposed by Chiba and Iwamoto (PRC 81,
044604(2010)) if they are used as a pair in the surrogate ratio method.
