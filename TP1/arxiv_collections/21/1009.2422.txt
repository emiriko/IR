Three-quark nucleon interpolating fields in QCD have well-defined
SU_L(3)*SU_R(3) and U_A(1) chiral transformation properties, viz.
[(6,3)+(3,6)], [(3,3_bar)+(3_bar,3)], [(8,1)+(1,8)] and their "mirror" images,
Ref.[9]. It has been shown (phenomenologically) in Ref.[3] that mixing of the
[(6,3)+(3,6)] chiral multiplet with one ordinary ("naive") and one "mirror"
field belonging to the [(3,3_bar)+(3_bar,3)], [(8,1)+(1,8)] multiplets can be
used to fit the values of the isovector (g_A^3) and the flavor-singlet
(isoscalar) axial coupling (g_A^0) of the nucleon and then predict the axial F
and D coefficients, or vice versa, in reasonable agreement with experiment. In
an attempt to derive such mixing from an effective Lagrangian, we construct all
SU_L(3)*SU_R(3) chirally invariant non-derivative one-meson-baryon interactions
and then calculate the mixing angles in terms of baryons' masses. It turns out
that there are (strong) selection rules: for example, there is only one
non-derivative chirally symmetric interaction between J=1/2 fields belonging to
the [(6,3)+(3,6)] and the [(3,3_bar)+(3_bar,3)] chiral multiplets, that is also
U_A(1) symmetric. We also study the chiral interactions of the
[(3,3_bar)+(3_bar,3)] and [(8,1)+(1,8)] nucleon fields. Again, there are
selection rules that allow only one off-diagonal non-derivative chiral
SU_L(3)*SU_R(3) interaction of this type, that also explicitly breaks the
U_A(1) symmetry. We use this interaction to calculate the corresponding mixing
angles in terms of baryon masses and fit two lowest lying observed nucleon
(resonance) masses, thus predicting the third (J=1/2, I=3/2) Delta resonance,
as well as one or two flavor-singlet Lambda hyperon(s), depending on the type
of mixing. The effective chiral Lagrangians derived here may be applied to high
density matter calculations.
