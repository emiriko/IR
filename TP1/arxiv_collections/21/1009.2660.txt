Low-resolution, mid-infrared Spitzer/IRS spectral maps are presented for
three nearby, low-metallicity dwarf galaxies (NGC 55, NGC 3109 and IC 5152) for
the purpose of examining the spatial distribution and variation of polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission. The sample straddles a metallicity of
12+log(O/H)~8.0, a transition point below which PAH intensity empirically drops
and the character of the interstellar medium changes. We derive quantitative
radiances of PAH features and atomic lines on both global and
spatially-resolved scales. The Spitzer spectra, combined with extensive
ancillary data from the UV through the mid-infrared, allow us to examine
changes in the physical environments and in PAH feature radiances down to a
physical scale of 50 pc. We discuss correlations between various PAH emission
feature and atomic line radiances. The (6.2 micron)/(11.3 micron), (7.7
micron)/(11.3 micron), (8.6 micron)/(11.3 micron), (7.7 micron)/(6.2 micron),
and (8.6 micron)/(6.2 micron) PAH radiance ratios are found to be independent
of position across all three galaxies, although the ratios do vary from galaxy
to galaxy. As seen in other galaxies, we find no variation in the grain size
distribution as a function of local radiation field strength. Absolute PAH
feature intensities as measured by a ratio of PAH/(24 micron) radiances are
seen to vary both positionally within a given galaxy, and from one galaxy to
another when integrated over the full observed extent of each system. We
examine direct comparisons of CC mode PAH ratios (7.7 micron)/(6.2 micron) and
(8.6 micron)/(6.2 micron) to the mixed (CC/CH) mode PAH ratio (7.7
micron)/(11.3 micron). We find little variation in either mode, and no
difference in trends between modes. While the local conditions change markedly
over the observed regions of these galaxies, the properties of PAH emission
show a remarkable degree of uniformity.
