We consider a generalization of the 2-dimensional (2D) quantum-Hall insulator
to a non-compact, non-Abelian gauge group, the Heisenberg-Weyl group. We show
that this kind of insulator is actually a layered 3D insulator with nontrivial
topology. We further show that nontrivial combinations of quantized transverse
conductivities can be engineered with the help of a staggered potential. We
investigate the robustness and topological nature of this conductivity and
connect it to the surface modes of the system. We also propose a simple
experimental realization with ultracold atoms in 3D confined to a 2D square
lattice with the third dimension being mapped to a gauge coordinate.
