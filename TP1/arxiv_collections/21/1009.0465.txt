Calculations within density functional theory on the basis of the local
density approximation are carried out to study the properties of intrinsic
point defects in aluminum antimonide. Special care is taken to address
finite-size effects, band gap error, and symmetry reduction in the defect
structures. The correction of the band gap is based on a set of GW
calculations. The most important defects are identified to be the aluminum
interstitial $Al_{i,Al}^{1+}$, the antimony antisites $Sb_{Al}^0$ and
$Sb_{Al}^{1+}$, and the aluminum vacancy $V_{Al}^{3-}$. The intrinsic defect
and charge carrier concentrations in the impurity-free material are calculated
by self-consistently solving the charge neutrality equation. The impurity-free
material is found to be n-type conducting at finite temperatures.
