Three-body continuum problems are investigated for light nuclei of
astrophysical relevance. We focus on three-body decays of resonances or
recombination via resonances or the continuum background. The concepts of
widths, decay mechanisms and dynamic evolution are discussed. We also discuss
results for the triple $\alpha$ decay in connection with $2^+$ resonances and
density and temperature dependence rates of recombination into light nuclei
from $\alpha$-particles and neutrons.
