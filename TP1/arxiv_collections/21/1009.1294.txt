The studies based on $A+A \rightarrow \emptyset$ and $A+B\rightarrow
\emptyset$ diffusion-annihilation processes have so far been studied on
weighted uncorrelated scale-free networks and fractal scale-free networks. In
the previous reports, it is widely accepted that the segregation of particles
in the processes is introduced by the fractal structure. In this paper, we
study these processes on a family of weighted scale-free networks with
identical degree sequence. We find that the depletion zone and segregation are
essentially caused by the disassortative mixing, namely, high-degree nodes tend
to connect with low-degree nodes. Their influence on the processes is governed
by the correlation between the weight and degree. Our finding suggests both the
weight and degree distribution don't suffice to characterize the
diffusion-annihilation processes on weighted scale-free networks.
