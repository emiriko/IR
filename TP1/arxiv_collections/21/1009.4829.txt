We study the phenomenology of the recently proposed modified version of the
Soft-Wall model of holographic QCD with a negative dilaton profile. We
investigate vector and scalar mesons, evaluating mass spectra, decay constants
and two-point correlation functions. We then study chiral symmetry breaking and
compute the coupling of a scalar meson with two pseudoscalars. Finally, we
compare the results with the ones found in the literature in the
positive-dilaton case.
