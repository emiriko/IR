The Ramsey number $R(P_1,P_2,...,P_t;r)$ is a valve value such that as long
as the cardinality $n$ of the $n$-set $V_n={1,...,n}$ is no less than
$R$,however all the $\binom{n}{r}$ $r$-subsets of $V_n$ are distributed into
$t$ boxes, $V_n$ will always have a property $W$ expressed as eq.(1).Thus, by
calculating the number of ways of distribution of $r$-subsets that makes $W$
true,one can get an equation for $R(P_1,P_2,...,P_t;r)$.The evaluation of the
general term in this eq. and the counting of the frequencies of occurrence of
the various values the general term takes can be reduced to the problem of
elementary counting.
