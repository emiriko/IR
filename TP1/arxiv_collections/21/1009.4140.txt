We study the accuracy of the pion form factor, obtained with a local-duality
version of dispersive sum rules. To probe this accuracy, we make use of a
potential model, where the exact form factor may be calculated from the
solution of the Schroedinger equation and confronted with the local-duality
form factor. The deviation between these quantities is found to be below 20% in
the region of momentum transfers Q > 2 - 3 GeV, independently of the specific
form of the confining potential. We argue that the local-duality model for
elastic form factors in QCD has at least this level of accuracy.
