We investigate the arguably simplest $SU(2)$-invariant wave functions capable
of accounting for spin-liquid behavior, expressed in terms of nearest-neighbor
valence-bond states on the square lattice and characterized by different
topological invariants. While such wave-functions are known to exhibit
short-range spin correlations, we perform Monte Carlo simulations and show that
four-point correlations decay algebraically with an exponent $1.16(4)$. This is
reminiscent of the {\it classical} dimer problem, albeit with a slower decay.
Furthermore, these correlators are found to be spatially modulated according to
a wave-vector related to the topological invariants. We conclude that a
recently proposed spin Hamiltonian that stabilizes the here considered
wave-function(s) as its (degenerate) ground-state(s) should exhibit gapped spin
and gapless non-magnetic excitations.
