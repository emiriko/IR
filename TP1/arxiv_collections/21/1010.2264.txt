The angular dependence of the remanence and coercivity of Ni nanowire arrays
produced inside the pores of anodic alumina membranes has been studied. By
comparing our analytical calculations with our measurements, we conclude that
the magnetization reversal in this array is driven by means of the nucleation
and propagation of a transverse wall. A simple model based on an adapted
Stoner-Wohlfarth model is used to explain the angular dependence of the
coercivity.
