Phase separation of binary fluids quenched by contact with cold external
walls is considered. Navier-Stokes, convection-diffusion, and energy equations
are solved by lattice Boltzmann method coupled with finite-difference schemes.
At high viscosity, different morphologies are observed by varying the thermal
diffusivity. In the range of thermal diffusivities with domains growing
parallel to the walls, temperature and phase separation fronts propagate
towards the inner of the system with power-law behavior. At low viscosity
hydrodynamics favors rounded shapes, and complex patterns with different
lengthscales appear. Off-symmetrical systems behave similarly but with more
ordered configurations.
