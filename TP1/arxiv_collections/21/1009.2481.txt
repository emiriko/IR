We determine the valence parton distribution function of the pion by
performing a new analysis of data for the Drell-Yan process $\pi^- N\to
\mu^+\mu^-X$. Compared to previous analyses, we include
next-to-leading-logarithmic threshold resummation effects in the calculation of
the Drell-Yan cross section. As a result of these, we find a considerably
softer valence distribution at high momentum fractions $x$ than obtained in
previous next-to-leading order analyses, in line with expectations based on
perturbative-QCD counting rules or Dyson-Schwinger equations.
