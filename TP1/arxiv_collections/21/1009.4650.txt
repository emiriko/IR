In the course of an imaging survey we have detected a visual companion to the
intermediate-mass star HR 6037. In this letter, we present two epoch
observations of the binary with NACO/VLT, and near-IR spectroscopy of the
secondary with ISAAC/VLT. The NACO observations allow us to confirm HR 6037B as
a co-moving companion. Its J and H band ISAAC spectra suggest the object has an
spectral type of M9+-1, with a surface gravity intermediate between that of 10
Myr dwarfs and field dwarfs with identical spectral type. The comparison of its
Ks-band photometry with evolutionary tracks allows us to derive a mass,
effective temperature, and surface gravity of 62+-20 MJup, Teff = 2330+-200 K,
and log g = 5.1+-0.2, respectively. The small mass ratio of the binary, -0.03,
and its long orbital period, -5000 yr, makes HR 6037 a rare and uncommon binary
system.
