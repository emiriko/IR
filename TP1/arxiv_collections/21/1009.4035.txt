High-dose irradiation of nanostructures consisting of multiple graphene
shells, such as spherical 'carbon onions' (CO) or cylindrical multi-walled
carbon nanotubes (MWNT), induces shell shrinkage by bond reconstruction around
irradiation-induced defects. This leads to build-up of internal stresses and to
extreme pressures acting on encapsulated materials or on the carbon cores of
the nanostructures. We formulate a model which relates the build-up of internal
stresses to the point defect dynamics in graphene shells. Calculations are
performed for the special case of irradiated CO. The results are in good
agreement with experimental findings.
