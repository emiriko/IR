A microscopic understanding of magnetoelectricity, i.e. the coupling between
magnetic (electric) properties and external electric (magnetic) fields, is a
crucial milestone for future generations of electrically-controlled spintronic
devices. Here, we focus on the first magnetoelectric known to mankind:
magnetite. By means of a joint approach based on phenomenological Landau theory
and density-functional simulations, we show that magnetoelectricity in
charge-/orbital-ordered Fe3O4 in the non-centrosymmetric Cc structure is driven
by the interplay between a peculiar orbital-order and on-site spin-orbit
coupling. The excellent agreement with available experiments confirms our
theoretical picture, pointing to magnetite as a prototype of a novel category
of magnetoelectrics where ferroelectric polarization can be induced, tuned or
switched via a magnetic field.
