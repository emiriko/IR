A calculation for the one-loop pion vector form-factor in Resonance Chiral
Theory is provided in this talk. The amplitude is computed up to
next-to-leading order in 1/Nc and, by means of high-energy constraints, we are
able to produce a prediction for the corresponding O(p4) Chiral Perturbation
Theory low energy constant L9(mu)=(7.6+- 0.6) 10^{-3} at the scale mu=770 MeV.
