This work extends the Ibragimov's conservation theorem for partial
differential equations [{\it J. Math. Anal. Appl. 333 (2007 311-328}] to under
determined systems of differential equations. The concepts of adjoint equation
and formal Lagrangian for a system of differential equations whose the number
of equations is equal to or lower than the number of dependent variables are
defined. It is proved that the system given by an equation and its adjoint is
associated with a variational problem (with or without classical Lagrangian)
and inherits all Lie-point and generalized symmetries from the original
equation. Accordingly, a Noether theorem for conservation laws can be
formulated.
