An algorithm which either finds an nonzero integer vector ${\mathbf m}$ for
given $t$ real $n$-dimensional vectors ${\mathbf x}_1,...,{\mathbf x}_t$ such
that ${\mathbf x}_i^T{\mathbf m}=0$ or proves that no such integer vector with
norm less than a given bound exists is presented in this paper. The cost of the
algorithm is at most ${\mathcal O}(n^4 + n^3 \log \lambda(X))$ exact arithmetic
operations in dimension $n$ and the least Euclidean norm $\lambda(X)$ of such
integer vectors. It matches the best complexity upper bound known for this
problem. Experimental data show that the algorithm is better than an already
existing algorithm in the literature. In application, the algorithm is used to
get a complete method for finding the minimal polynomial of an unknown complex
algebraic number from its approximation, which runs even faster than the
corresponding \emph{Maple} built-in function.
