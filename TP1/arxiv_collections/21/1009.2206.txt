Serious games have recently emerged as an avenue for curriculum delivery.
Serious games incorporate motivation and entertainment while providing pointed
curriculum for the user. This paper presents a serious game, called MiBoard,
currently being developed from the iSTART Intelligent Tutoring System. MiBoard
incorporates a multiplayer interaction that iSTART was previously unable to
provide. This multiplayer interaction produces a wide variation across game
trials, while also increasing the repeat playability for users. This paper
presents a demonstration of the MiBoard system and the expectations for its
application.
