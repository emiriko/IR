The large data sample recorded with the Belle detector at the Y(5S) energy
provides a unique opportunity to study the poorly-known Bs0 meson. Several
analyses, made with a data sample representing an integrated luminosity of 23.6
/fb, are presented. We report the study of the large-signal Bs0 -> Ds(*)- h+
(h+ = pi+ or rho+) decays including the first observations of Bs0 -> Ds*- pi+
and Bs0 -> Ds(*)- rho+. In addition, several results on CP-eigenstate Bs0
decays are described. These include the study of the Bs0 -> J/psi eta(') and
Bs0 -> J/psi f0(980) decays, the charmless Bs0 -> K+ K-, Bs0 -> pi+ pi pi- and
Bs0 -> Kshort Kshort decays and the simultaneous fit of the three Bs0 ->
Ds(*)Ds(*) modes from which Delta(Gamma_s)/Gamma_s is extracted. The
preliminary measurement of B(Bs0 -> J/psi f0(980))<1.63x10^-4 (at 90% C.L.) is
presented for the first time.
