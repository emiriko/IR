The energy of arbitrary graphene edge is derived in analytical form. It
contains a "chemical phase shift", determined by the chemical conditions at the
edge. Direct atomistic computations support the universal nature of the
relationship. Definitive for graphene formation, shapes of the voids or
ribbons, this has further important implications for nanotube chirality
selection and control by chemical means, at the nucleation stage.
