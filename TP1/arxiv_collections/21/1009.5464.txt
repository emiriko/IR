The detailed analysis of excitation function of elliptical flow by taking
into account the nature of equation of state, nucleon-nucleon cross sections as
well as momentum dependent interactions is performed within Quantum Molecular
Dynamics (QMD)model. All the observables are found to sensitive towards the
elliptical flow. The transition energy is found to be decrease with increase in
the size of the fragment in the presence of static equation of state as well as
with large cross sections, while, trend gets opposite when momentum dependent
interactions are included. At last, the experimental data is verified with
static hard equation of state in the presence of large cross sections.
