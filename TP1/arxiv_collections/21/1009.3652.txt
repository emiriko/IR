The dynamical Maxwell-cut, a degeneracy is shown to be a precursor of
condensate in the phi4 and the sine-Gordon models. The difference of the way
the Maxwell-cut is obtained is pointed out and quantum censorship, the
generation of semiclassically looking phenomenon by loop-corrections is
conjectured in the sine-Gordon model. It is argued that quantum censorship and
gluon confinement exclude each other.
