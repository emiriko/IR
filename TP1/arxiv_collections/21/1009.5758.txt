There is an abundant literature on face detection due to its important role
in many vision applications. Since Viola and Jones proposed the first real-time
AdaBoost based face detector, Haar-like features have been adopted as the
method of choice for frontal face detection. In this work, we show that simple
features other than Haar-like features can also be applied for training an
effective face detector. Since, single feature is not discriminative enough to
separate faces from difficult non-faces, we further improve the generalization
performance of our simple features by introducing feature co-occurrences. We
demonstrate that our proposed features yield a performance improvement compared
to Haar-like features. In addition, our findings indicate that features play a
crucial role in the ability of the system to generalize.
