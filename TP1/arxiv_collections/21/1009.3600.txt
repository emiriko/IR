We present a well-controlled perturbative renormalization group (RG)
treatment of superconductivity from short-ranged repulsive interactions in a
variety of model two dimensional electronic systems. Our analysis applies in
the limit where the repulsive interactions between the electrons are small
compared to their kinetic energy.
