Using the corrected entropy-area relation motivated by the loop quantum
gravity, we investigate the validity of the generalized second law of
thermodynamics in the framework of modified FRW cosmology. We consider a
non-flat universe filled with an interacting viscous dark energy with dark
matter and radiation. The boundary of the universe is assumed to be the
dynamical apparent horizon. We find out that the generalized second law is
always satisfied throughout the history of the universe for any spatial
curvature regardless of the dark energy model.
