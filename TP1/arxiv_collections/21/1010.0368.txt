We report on recent B-Physics results from the Tevatron. The topics covered
include measurement of the polarization amplitudes in $B_s^0 \to \phi \phi$,
the search for rare flavor-changing neutral-current decays, CP violation in
$B_s^0 \to J/\psi \phi$ and semileptonic $B_s^0$ decays, and a new measurement
of the like-sign asymmetry in dimuon events.
