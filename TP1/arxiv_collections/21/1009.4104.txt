We investigate the effect of the cluster environment on the star formation
properties of galaxies in 8 nearby Abell clusters. Star formation properties
are determined for individual galaxies using the equivalent width of H alpha
plus [NII] line emission from narrow-band imaging. Equivalent width
distributions are derived for each galaxy type in each of 3 environments -
cluster, supercluster (outside the cluster virial radius) and field. The
effects of morphological disturbance on star formation are also investigated.
We identify a population of early-type disk galaxies in the cluster population
with enhanced star formation compared to their field counterparts. The enhanced
cluster galaxies frequently show evidence of disturbance, and the disturbed
galaxies show marginal evidence for a higher velocity dispersion, possibly
indicative of an infalling population.
