The process of protein folding from an unfolded state to a biologically
active, folded conformation is governed by many parameters e.g the sequence of
amino acids, intermolecular interactions, the solvent, temperature and chaperon
molecules. Our study, based on random matrix modeling of the interactions,
shows however that the evolution of the statistical measures e.g Gibbs free
energy, heat capacity, entropy is single parametric. The information can
explain the selection of specific folding pathways from an infinite number of
possible ways as well as other folding characteristics observed in computer
simulation studies.
