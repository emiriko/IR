A Multi Megawatt Cyclotron complex able to accelerate H2+ to 800 MeV/amu is
under study. It consists of an injector cyclotron able to accelerate the
injected beam up to 50 MeV/n and of a booster ring made of 8 magnetic sectors
and 8 RF cavities. The magnetic field and the forces on the superconducting
coils are evaluated using the 3-D code OPERA. The injection and extraction
trajectories are evaluated using the well tested codes developed by the MSU
group in the '80s. The advantages to accelerate H2+ are described and
preliminary evaluations on the feasibility and expected problems to build the
injector cyclotron and the ring booster are here presented.
