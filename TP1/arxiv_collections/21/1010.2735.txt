Genomic complexity can be used as a clock with which the moment in which life
originated can be measured. Some authors who have studied this problem have
come to the conclusion that it is not possible that terrestrial life originated
here and that, in reality, life originated giga-years ago, before the solar
system existed. If we accept this conclusion there is no other option than to
admit that panspermia is something viable.The goal of this study is to propose
a viable hypothesis for the transport of SLF from one planetary system to
another. During the formation period of a planetary system giant planets can
eject planets the size of the Earth, or larger, turning them into free-floating
planets in interstellar space. These free-floating planets have also been
called free floaters. If a free floater, which has developed life, enters a
lifeless planetary system, it can seed the worlds of this system with SLF
dragged by the stellar wind from one planet to another or by great impacts on
the free planet. To support this hypothesis, I calculate the probability that
one free floater reaches the planets zone of a planetary system, and also it
was calculated the time it remains within the planetary zone in order to see if
there is enough time to seed the host system.The probability of a free floater
in the galaxy, within the region of the Sun, entering the planet zone of a
system is 2.8x10-4, i.e., that {\sim}3 of 10,000 free planets manage to enter
some planetary system. At the galactocentric distance from the Sun I calculated
that there are 21,495 free floaters floating around the galactic center. Hence,
6 free-floating planets manage to enter in planetary systems every galaxy
rotation. Since the galaxy has rotated 54 times since its formation, then,
{\sim} 324 free floaters have entered some planetary system at the
galactocentric distance of the Sun.
