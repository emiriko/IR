We point out that the analysis in arXiv:1003.0482 actually verifies the
universality of transverse momentum dependent quark distributions at small $x$,
which supports the observation in our earlier work arXiv:0904.4150. Once the
gluon exchanges responsible for the additional infrared divergences are
factorized and summed into an exponential factor, it can be expressed as a
matrix element of Wilson line operators, and treated as a nonperturbative input
to the $k_T$ factorization of $pA$ collisions. The same exponential factor has
been extracted from $pp$ collisions in arXiv:0904.4150, rendering possible
experimental constraints on its behavior from $pp$ processes, and predictions
for $pA$ processes.
