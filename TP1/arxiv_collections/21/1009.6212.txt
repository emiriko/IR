We construct a sequence of primitive-stable representations of free groups
into PSL(2,C) whose ranks go to infinity, but whose images are discrete with
quotient manifolds that converge geometrically to a knot complement. In
particular this implies that the rank and geometry of the image of a
primitive-stable representation imposes no constraint on the rank of the
domain.
