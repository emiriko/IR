We introduce a ray model for coupled optical microdisks, in which we select
coupling-efficient rays among the splitting rays. We investigate the resulting
phase-space structure and report island structures arising from the
ray-coupling between the two microdisks. We find the microdisks's refractive
index to influence the phase-space structure and calculate the stability and
decay rates of the islands. Turning to ray-wave correspondence, we find many
resonances to be directly related to the presence of these islands. We study
the relation between the (ray-picture originating) island structures and the
(wave-picture originating) spectral properties of resonances, especially the
leakiness of the resonances which is represented as the imaginary part of the
complex wave vector.
