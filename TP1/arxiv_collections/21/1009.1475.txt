We propose an idea to investigate persistent current in individual arms of a
multi-arm mesoscopic ring. Following a brief description of persistent current
in a traditional Aharonov-Bohm (AB) ring, we examine the behavior of persistent
currents in separate arms of a three-arm mesoscopic ring. Our analysis may be
helpful in studying magnetic response of any complicated quantum network.
