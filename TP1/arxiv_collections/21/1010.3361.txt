The two-species population dynamics model is the simplest paradigm of
interspecies interaction. Here, we include intraspecific competition to the
Lotka-Volterra model and solve it analytically. Despite being simple and
thoroughly studied, this model presents a very rich behavior and some
characteristics not so well explored, which are unveiled. The forbidden region
in the mutualism regime and the dependence on initial conditions in the
competition regime are some examples of these characteristics. From the
stability of the steady state solutions, three phases are obtained: (i)
extinction of one species (Gause transition), (ii) their coexistence and (iii)
a forbidden region. Full analytical solutions have been obtained for the
considered ecological regimes. The time transient allows one to defined time
scales for the system evolution, which can be relevant for the study of tumor
growth by theoretical or computer simulation models.
