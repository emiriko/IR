We carried out first-principles calculations within Density Functional Theory
to investigate the structural, electronic and magnetic properties of
boron-nitride (BN) honeycomb structure functionalized by adatom adsorption, as
well as by the substitution of foreign atoms for B and N atoms. For periodic
high density coverage, most of $3d$ transition metal atoms and some of group
3A, 4A, and 6A elements are adsorbed with significant binding energy and modify
the electronic structure of bare BN monolayer. While bare BN monolayer is
nonmagnetic, wide band gap semiconductor, at high coverage of specific adatoms
it can achieve magnetic metallic, even half-metallic ground states. At low
coverage, the bands associated with adsorbed atoms are flat and the band
structure of parent BN is not affected significantly. Therefore, adatoms and
substitution of foreign atoms at low coverage are taken to be the
representative of impurity atoms yielding localized states in the band gap and
resonance states in the band continua. Notably, the substitution of C for B and
N yield donor and acceptor like magnetic states in the band gap. Localized
impurity states occurring in the gap give rise to interesting properties for
electronic and optical application of the single layer BN honeycomb structure.
