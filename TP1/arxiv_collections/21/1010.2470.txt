Multi-dimensional quantum walks usually require large coin spaces. Here we
show that the non-localized case of the spatial density probability of the
two-dimensional Grover walk can be obtained using only a two-dimensional coin
space and a quantum walk in alternate directions. We present a formal proof of
this correspondence and analyze the behavior of the coin-position entanglement
as well as the x-y spatial entanglement in our scheme with respect to the
Grover one. We show that our experimentally simpler scheme allows to entangle
the two orthogonal directions of the walk more efficiently.
