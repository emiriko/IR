Spectral and transport properties of doped (or gated) graphene with long
range charged impurities are discussed within the self-consistent Born
approximation. It is shown how, for impurity concentrations $n_{imp}\gtrsim n$
a finite DOS appears at the Dirac point, the one-particle lifetime no longer
scales linearly with the Fermi momentum, and the lineshapes in the spectral
function become non-lorentzian. These behaviors are different from the results
calculated within the Born approximation. We also calculate the optical
conductivity from the Kubo formula by using the self-consistently calculated
spectral function in the presence of charged impurities.
