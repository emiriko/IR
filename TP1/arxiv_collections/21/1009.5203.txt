In this note we prove that the spec(C)-points of the representation
Artin-stack [rep_n R/PGL_n] of n-dimensional representations of an affine
algebra R correspond to algebra morphisms R-->A where A is an Azumaya algebra
of degree n over C. We connect this to the study of D-branes and Azumaya
noncommutative geometry, developed by Chien-Hao Liu and Shing-Tung Yau in a
series of papers from arXiv:0709.1515 to arXiv:1003.1178
