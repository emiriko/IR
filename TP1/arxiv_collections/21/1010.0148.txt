A search is performed for top quark pairs with early data of ATLAS pp
collision taken at {\surd}s = 7 TeV. Several candidate events are observed, in
both lepton plus jets and dilepton channels. The properties of these events are
described, and compared to the expectations from Monte Carlo simulation. A
first study of the backgrounds in the lepton plus jets channel is presented
including a data-driven determination of the contribution of QCD multi-jet
events.
