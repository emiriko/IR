We report on modelling in stellar astrophysics with the ANTARES code. First,
we describe properties of turbulence in solar granulation as seen in
high-resolution calculations. Then, we turn to the first 2D model of
pulsation-convection interaction in a cepheid. We discuss properties of the
outer and the HEII ionization zone. Thirdly, we report on our work regarding
models of semiconvection in the context of stellar physics.
