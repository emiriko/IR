Reconstituted filamentous actin networks with myosin motor proteins form
active gels, in which motor proteins generate forces that drive the network far
from equilibrium. This motor activity can also strongly affect the network
elasticity; experiments have shown a dramatic stiffening in in vitro networks
with molecular motors. Here we study the effects of motor generated forces on
the mechanics of simulated 2D networks of athermal stiff filaments. We show how
heterogeneous internal motor stresses can lead to stiffening in networks that
are governed by filament bending modes. The motors are modeled as force dipoles
that cause muscle like contractions. These contractions "pull out" the floppy
bending modes in the system, which induces a cross-over to a stiffer stretching
dominated regime. Through this mechanism, motors can lead to a nonlinear
network response, even when the constituent filaments are themselves purely
linear. These results have implications for the mechanics of living cells and
suggest new design principles for active biomemetic materials with tunable
mechanical properties.
