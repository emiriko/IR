The dark energy issue is focusing the attention of an incresing number of
physicists all over the world. Among the possible alternatives in order to
explain what as been named the "Mystery of the Millennium" are the so-called
Modified Theories of Gravity. A crucial test for such models is represented by
the existence and (if this is the case) the properties of their black hole
solutions. Nowadays, to our knowledge, only two non-trivial, spherically
symmetric, solutions with vanishing cosmological constant are known by Barrow &
Clifton (2005) and Deser, Sarioglu & Tekin (2008). Aim of the paper is to
discuss some features of such solutions, with emphasis on their thermodynamic
properties such as entropy and temperature, little progress being possible
along the way which leads to a consistent definition of mass.
