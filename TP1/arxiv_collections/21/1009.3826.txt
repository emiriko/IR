The appearance of quark matter in the centers of compact stars has a number
of astrophysical implications. In this contribution I discuss the structure and
stability of compact stars, gravitational radiation from non-axisymmetric
deformations, and nucleation and dynamics of vortices (flux tubes) in the color
superconducting phases.
