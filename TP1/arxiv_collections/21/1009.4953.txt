The NaI and BGO detectors on the Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) on Fermi are
now being used for long-term monitoring of the hard X-ray/low energy gamma-ray
sky. Using the Earth occultation technique as demonstrated previously by the
BATSE instrument on the Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory, GBM can be used to
produce multiband light curves and spectra for known sources and transient
outbursts in the 8 keV to 1 MeV energy range with its NaI detectors and up to
40 MeV with its BGO detectors. Over 85% of the sky is viewed every orbit, and
the precession of the Fermi orbit allows the entire sky to be viewed every ~26
days with sensitivity exceeding that of BATSE at energies below ~25 keV and
above ~1.5 MeV. We briefly describe the technique and present preliminary
results using the NaI detectors after the first two years of observations at
energies above 100 keV. Eight sources are detected with a significance greater
than 7 sigma: the Crab, Cyg X-1, SWIFT J1753.5-0127, 1E 1740-29, Cen A, GRS
1915+105, and the transient sources XTE J1752-223 and GX 339-4. Two of the
sources, the Crab and Cyg X-1, have also been detected above 300 keV.
