The statistical equilibria of the dynamics of the Gross-Pitaevskii Equation
(GPE) with a finite range of spatial Fourier modes are characterized using a
new algorithm, based on a stochastically forced Ginzburg-Landau equation
(SGLE), that directly generates grand canonical distributions.. The
SGLE-generated distributions are validated against finite-temperature
GPE-thermalized states and exact low-temperature results. A standard
second-order $\lambda$-transition is exhibited. A new mechanism of GPE
thermalization through a direct cascade of energy is found using initial
conditions with mass and energy distributed at large scales. A long transient
with partial thermalization at small-scales is observed. Vortices are shown to
disappear as a prelude to final thermalization and their annihilation is
related to the contraction of vortex rings due to mutual friction. Increasing
the amount of dispersion at truncation wavenumber is shown to slowdown
thermalization and vortex annihilation. A bottleneck that produces spontaneous
effective self truncation with partial thermalization is characterized in the
limit of large dispersive effects. Metastable counter-flow states are generated
using the SGLE algorithm. Spontaneous nucleation of vortex ring is observed and
the corresponding Arrhenius law is characterized. Dynamical counter-flow
effects on vortex evolution are investigated. Longitudinal effects are produced
and measured. A dilatation of vortex rings is obtained for larger counterflows.
The vortex ring longitudinal velocity has a strong dependence on temperature,
an effect that is related to the presence of finite-amplitude Kelvin waves.
This anomalous vortex ring velocity is quantitatively reproduced by assuming
equipartition of energy of the Kelvin waves. Orders of magnitude are given for
the predicted effects in weakly interacting Bose-Einstein condensates and
superfluid $^4{\rm He}$.
