A three-dimensional model of a low-Reynold's swimmer is introduced and
analyzed in this paper. This model consists of two large and small spheres
connected by two perpendicular thin rods. The geometry of this system is
motivated by the microorganisms that use a single tail to swim, the large
sphere represents the head of microorganism and the small sphere resembles its
tail. Each rod changes its length and orientation in a non-reciprocal manner
that effectively propel the system. Translational and rotational velocities of
the swimmer are studied for different values of parameters. Our findings show
that by changing the parameters we can adjust both the velocity and the
direction of motion of the swimmer.
