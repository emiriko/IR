Quasiparticle approach to dynamics of dark solitons is applied to the case of
ring solitons. It is shown that the energy conservation law provides the
effective equations of motion of ring dark solitons for general form of the
nonlinear term in the generalized nonlinear Schroedinger or Gross-Pitaevskii
equation. Analytical theory is illustrated by examples of dynamics of ring
solitons in light beams propagating through a photorefractive medium and in
non-uniform condensates confined in axially symmetric traps. Analytical results
agree very well with the results of our numerical simulations.
