The Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey (NGVS) is a CFHT Large Program that
is using the wide field of view capabilities of the MegaCam camera to map the
entire Virgo Cluster from its core to virial radius. The observing strategy has
been optimized to detect very low surface brightness structures in the cluster,
including intracluster stellar streams and faint dwarf spheroidal galaxies. We
present here the current status of this ongoing survey, with an emphasis on the
detection and analysis of the very low-mass galaxies in the cluster that have
been revealed by the NGVS.
