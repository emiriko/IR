We investigate the 16-band d-p model for iron pnictide superconductors in the
presence of the electron-phonon coupling g with the orthorhombic mode which is
crucial for reproducing the recently observed ultrasonic softening. Within the
RPA, we obtain the ferro-orbital order below TQ which induces the
tetragonal-orthorhombic structural transition at Ts = TQ, together with the
stripe-type antiferromagnetic order below TN. Near the phase transitions, the
system shows the s++ wave superconductivity due to the orbital fluctuation for
a large g case with TQ > TN, while the s+- wave due to the magnetic fluctuation
for a small g case with TQ < TN. The former case is consistent with the phase
diagram of doped iron pnictides with Ts > TN.
