We have measured Raman scattering spectra of single-crystalline FeTe0.6Se0.4
(T_c ~ 14.5 K) and its parent compound Fe1.074Te at various temperatures. In
the parent compound Fe1.074Te, A1g and B1g modes have been observed at 157.5
and 202.3 cm-1, respectively, at 5 K. These frequencies qualitatively agree
with the calculated results. Two-magnon excitation has been observed around
2300 cm-1 for both compounds. Temperature dependence between the electronic
Raman spectra below and above T_c has been observed and 2\Delta and
2\Delta/k_BT_C have been estimated as 5.0 meV and 4.0, respectively.
