The huge information flow currently available to young generation makes it
difficult for educational centers to train them as needed. Most of these
information flows occur in transportation time or while on public areas.
Competing with commercial information streams is far out of educational centers
time and budget. For creating enough mobile applications for vast educational
mobile content broadcasting that can match young spirits as well, we designed
and developed the ARMrayan Multimedia Mobile CMS as the software that helps
communities, educational, cultural or marketing centers in a way that ordinary
operators be able to create a variety of fully functional multimedia mobile
applications such as tutorials, catalogues, books, and guides in minutes
without writing even a line of code. In this paper, we present the role of our
developed software in our proposed vast educational content broadcasting system
using kiosks and Bluetooth advertising, which will lead to a great leap in
M-commerce marketing and public education solutions. Related experiences are
described and diagrams are used to illustrate the solution. Upon release of the
software, it achieved two titles and prizes in different festivals and various
cultural and commercial centers became its customers.
