In a recent work, Y.D. Chong et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 105}, 053901
(2010)] proposed the idea of a coherent perfect absorber (CPA) as the
time-reversed counterpart of a laser, in which a purely incoming radiation
pattern is completely absorbed by a lossy medium. The optical medium that
realizes CPA is obtained by reversing the gain with absorption, and thus it
generally differs from the lasing medium. Here it is shown that a laser with an
optical medium that satisfies the parity-time $(\mathcal{PT})$ symmetry
condition $\epsilon(-\mathbf{r})=\epsilon^*(\mathbf{r})$ for the dielectric
constant behaves simultaneously as a laser oscillator (i.e. it can emit
outgoing coherent waves) and as a CPA (i.e. it can fully absorb incoming
coherent waves with appropriate amplitudes and phases). Such a device can be
thus referred to as a $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric CPA-laser. The general
amplification/absorption features of the $\mathcal{PT}$ CPA-laser below lasing
threshold driven by two fields are determined.
