Distorted-wave methods are used to remove the effects of one- and two-pion
exchange up to order Q^3 from the empirical 1P1 phase shift. The one divergence
that arises can be renormalised using an order-Q^2 counterterm which is
provided by the (Weinberg) power counting appropriate to the effective field
theory for this channel. The residual interaction is used to estimate the scale
of the underlying physics.
