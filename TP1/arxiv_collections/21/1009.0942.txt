Concerning systematic effects, the recommendation given in the GUM is to
correct for them, but unfortunately no detailed information is available, how
to do this. This publication will show, how systematic measurement deviations
can be handled correctly based on the Bayesian probability theory. After a
short overview about useful methods and tools, like the product rule of
probability theory, Bayes' theorem, the principle of maximum entropy, and the
marginalisation equation, an outline of a method to handle systematic
measurement deviations is introduced. Finally some simple examples of practical
interest are given, in order to demonstrate the applicability of the suggested
method.
