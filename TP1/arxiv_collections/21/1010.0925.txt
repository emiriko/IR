The decomposition of malic acid in the presence of Mg and B was studied using
Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA)
which revealed that malic acid reacted with Mg but not B. Also, the addition of
toluene to dissolve malic acid followed by subsequent drying resulted in no
reaction with Mg, indicating that the malic acid had decomposed during the
dissolution/drying stage. The total carbon contributed by toluene versus a
toluene/5 wt% malic acid mixture was measured using a LECO CS600 carbon
analyzer. The toluene sample contained ~0.4 wt% C while the toluene/malic acid
mixture had ~1.5 wt% C, demonstrating that the toluene contributed a
significant amount of carbon to the final product. Resistivity measurements on
powder-in-tube MgB2 monofilamentary wires established that the toluene/malic
acid doped sample had the highest Bc2. However, the toluene-only sample had the
highest transport Jc over most of the magnetic field range (0-9 T), equaled
only by that of toluene/malic acid sample in fields above 9 T.
