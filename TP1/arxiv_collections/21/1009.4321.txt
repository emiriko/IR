We want to understand the geometry of all irreducible components of the toric
Hilbert scheme. Until now it is known that the coherent component is (up to
normalisation) the toric variety associated to the state polytope of the toric
ideal. For the non-coherent components it was only known that there exists such
a polytope describing the normalisation. Using the local equations and various
facts about toric Hilbert schemes, we will derive an explicit construction of
the polytope corresponding to the normalisation of the underlying reduced
structure of a given non-coherent component of the toric Hilbert scheme.
