Interactions between a quantum system and its environment at low temperatures
can lead to violations of thermal laws for the system. The source of these
violations is the entanglement between system and environment, which prevents
the system from entering into a thermal state. On the other hand, for two-state
systems, we show that one can define an effective temperature, placing the
system into a `pseudo-thermal' state where effective thermal laws are upheld.
We then numerically explore these assertions for an n-state system inspired by
the spin-boson environment.
