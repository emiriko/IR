New dark energy models in anisotropic Bianchi type-I (B-I) space-time with
variable EoS parameter and constant deceleration parameter have been
investigated in the present paper. The Einstein's field equations have been
solved by applying a variation law for generalized Hubble's parameter in B-I
space-time. The variation law for Hubble's parameter generates two types of
solutions for the average scale factor, one is of power-law type and other is
of the exponential form. Using these two forms, Einstein's field equations are
solved separately that correspond to expanding singular and non-singular models
of the universe respectively. The equation of state (EoS) parameter $\omega$ is
found to be time dependent and its existing range for this model is in good
agreement with the recent observations of SNe Ia data, SNe Ia data (with CMBR
anisotropy) and galaxy clustering statistics. The cosmological constant
$\Lambda$ is found to be a decreasing function of time and it approaches a
small positive value at late time (i.e. the present epoch) which is
corroborated by results from recent supernovae Ia observations.
