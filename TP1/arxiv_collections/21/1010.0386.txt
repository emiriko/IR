We prove a variant of the Lavrentiev's approximation theorem that allows us
to approximate a continuous function on a compact set K in C without interior
points and with connected complement, with polynomial functions that are
nonvanishing on K. We use this result to obtain a version of the Voronin
universality theorem for compact sets K, without interior points and with
connected complement where it is sufficient that the function is continuous on
K and the condition that it is nonvanishing can be removed. This implies a
special case of a criterion of Bagchi, which in the general case has been
proven to be equivalent to the Riemann hypothesis.
