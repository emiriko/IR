We present fluid dynamics videos illustrating wetting splashing-produced by
water drop impact onto hydrophobic microstructures at high impact velocity
($\sim 3$ ms$^{-1}$). The substrate consists of regular and transparent
microtextures in square or hexagonal lattice, yielding a high contact angle of
$\sim 150 ^\circ$. Our high speed top-or-bottom view recordings through the
transparent surface shed light on the solid-liquid-air interfaces at impact.
Despite the superhydrophobicity of the latticed micropillars (of a periodicity
of $10 {\mu}m), water droplet wets a certain central area and moreover entraps
an air bubble beneath the droplet. Besides the central wet area, lamella surf
on air splashing outward at high impinging velocity. The effects of
micropatterns and air pressure on the impact outcome are also examined. We show
that microscopic boundary condition, imposed by the solid texture, profoundly
influences the macroscopic flow dynamics upon superhydrophobic surfaces at high
impinging velocity. In addition, the intervening air between the liquid and the
solid plays a crucial role in directional splash, which can be eliminated by a
reduced air pressure.
