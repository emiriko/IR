The quantum mechanical many-body problem is rarely analytically solvable. One
notable exception is the case of two electrons interacting via a Coulomb
potential in a uniform magnetic field. The motion is confined to a
two-dimensional plane, which is commonly the case in nanodevices. We compare
the exact solution with the semiclassical energy spectrum and study the
time-dependent dynamics of the system using the time-dependent variational
principle.
