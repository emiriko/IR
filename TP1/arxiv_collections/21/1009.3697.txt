In recent years, single molecule force techniques have opened a new avenue to
decipher the folding landscapes of biopolymers by allowing us to watch and
manipulate the dynamics of individual proteins and nucleic acids. In single
molecule force experiments, quantitative analyses of measurements employing
sound theoretical models and molecular simulations play central role more than
any other field. With a brief description of basic theories for force mechanics
and molecular simulation technique using self-organized polymer (SOP) model,
this chapter will discuss various issues in single molecule force spectroscopy
(SMFS) experiments, which include pulling speed dependent unfolding pathway,
measurement of energy landscape roughness, the in uence of molecular handles in
optical tweezers on measurement and molecular motion, and folding dynamics of
biopolymers under force quench condition.
