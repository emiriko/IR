We present the results of a systematic search in approximately 14 years of
Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer All-Sky Monitor data for evidence of periodicities
not reported by Wen et al. (2006). Two variations of the commonly used Fourier
analysis search method have been employed to achieve significant improvements
in sensitivity. The use of these methods and the accumulation of additional
data have resulted in the detection of the signatures of the orbital periods of
eight low-mass X-ray binary systems and of ten high-mass X-ray binaries not
listed in the tables of Wen et al.
