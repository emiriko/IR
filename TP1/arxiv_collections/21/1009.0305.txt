There are many programming languages in the world today.Each language has
their advantage and disavantage. In this paper, we will discuss ten programming
languages: C++, C#, Java, Groovy, JavaScript, PHP, Schalar, Scheme, Haskell and
AspectJ. We summarize and compare these ten languages on ten different
criterion. For example, Default more secure programming practices, Web
applications development, OO-based abstraction and etc. At the end, we will
give our conclusion that which languages are suitable and which are not for
using in some cases. We will also provide evidence and our analysis on why some
language are better than other or have advantages over the other on some
criterion.
