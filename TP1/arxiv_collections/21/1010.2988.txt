We show how a precise knowledge of parton distribution functions, in
particular those of the u and d quarks, can be used to constrain a certain
class of New Physics models in which new heavy charged resonances couple to
quarks and leptons. We illustrate the method by considering a left-right
symmetric model with a W' from a SU(2)_R gauge sector produced in
quark-antiquark annihilation and decaying into a charged lepton and a heavy
Majorana neutrino. We discuss a number of quark and lepton mixing scenarios,
and simulate both signals and backgrounds in order to determine the size of the
expected charge asymmetry. We show that various quark-W' mixing scenarios can
indeed be constrained by charge asymmetry measurements at the LHC, particularly
at 14 TeV centre of mass energy.
