We discuss the realization of evaluation strategies for the concurrent
constraint-based functional language CCFL within the translation schemata when
compiling CCFL programs into the hierarchical graph rewriting language LMNtal.
  The support of LMNtal to express local computations and to describe the
migration of processes and rules between local computation spaces allows a
clear and simple encoding of typical evaluation strategies.
