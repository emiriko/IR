We report the gravitational microlensing discovery of a sub-Saturn mass
planet, MOA-2009-BLG-319Lb, orbiting a K or M-dwarf star in the inner Galactic
disk or Galactic bulge. The high cadence observations of the MOA-II survey
discovered this microlensing event and enabled its identification as a high
magnification event approximately 24 hours prior to peak magnification. As a
result, the planetary signal at the peak of this light curve was observed by 20
different telescopes, which is the largest number of telescopes to contribute
to a planetary discovery to date. The microlensing model for this event
indicates a planet-star mass ratio of q = (3.95 +/- 0.02) x 10^{-4} and a
separation of d = 0.97537 +/- 0.00007 in units of the Einstein radius. A
Bayesian analysis based on the measured Einstein radius crossing time, t_E, and
angular Einstein radius, \theta_E, along with a standard Galactic model
indicates a host star mass of M_L = 0.38^{+0.34}_{-0.18} M_{Sun} and a planet
mass of M_p = 50^{+44}_{-24} M_{Earth}, which is half the mass of Saturn. This
analysis also yields a planet-star three-dimensional separation of a =
2.4^{+1.2}_{-0.6} AU and a distance to the planetary system of D_L =
6.1^{+1.1}_{-1.2} kpc. This separation is ~ 2 times the distance of the snow
line, a separation similar to most of the other planets discovered by
microlensing.
