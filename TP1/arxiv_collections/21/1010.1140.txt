We consider a scenario (supported by some lattice results) in which a
U(1)-breaking condensate survives across the chiral transition in QCD. This
scenario has important consequences for the pseudoscalar-meson sector, which
can be studied using an effective Lagrangian model. In particular, generalizing
the results obtained in two previous papers, where the effects on the radiative
decays eta,eta' --> gamma gamma were studied, in this paper we study the
effects of the U(1) chiral condensate on the strong decays of the "light"
pseudoscalar mesons, i.e., eta,eta' --> 3pi^0; eta,eta' --> pi^+ pi^- pi^0;
eta' --> eta pi^0 pi^0; eta' --> eta pi^+ pi^-; and also on the strong decays
of an exotic ("heavy") SU(3)-singlet pseudoscalar state eta_X, predicted by the
model.
