We give a characterization of Drinfeld centers of fusion categories as
non-degenerate braided fusion categories containing a Lagrangian algebra.
Further we study the quotient of the monoid of non-degenerate braided fusion
categories modulo the submonoid of the Drinfeld centers and show that its
formal properties are similar to those of the classical Witt group.
