The experimental investigation of spontaneously created vortices is of utmost
importance for the understanding of quantum phase transitions towards a
superfluid phase, especially for two dimensional systems that are expected to
be governed by the Berezinski-Kosterlitz-Thouless physics. By means of time
resolved near-field interferometry we track the path of such vortices, created
at random locations in an exciton-polariton condensate under pulsed
non-resonant excitation, to their final pinning positions imposed by the
stationary disorder. We formulate a theoretical model that successfully
reproduces the experimental observations.
