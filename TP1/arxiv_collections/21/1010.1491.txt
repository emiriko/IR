The CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) started operation a few months ago. The
machine will deliver proton-proton and nucleus-nucleus collisions at energies
as high as sqrt(s)=14 TeV and luminosities up to L~10^{34} cm^{-2}s^{-1}, never
reached before. The main open scientific questions that the seven LHC
experiments -- ATLAS, CMS, ALICE, LHCb, TOTEM, LHCf and MOEDAL -- aim to solve
in the coming years are succinctly reviewed.
