We discuss the studies of light nuclei in ab initio No-core Full
Configuration approach based on extrapolations to the infinite model space of
large-scale No-core Shell Model calculations on supercomputers. The convergence
at the end of p shell and beginning of the sd shell can be achieved if only
reasonable soft enough NN interactions are used. In particular, good
predictions are obtained with a realistic JISP16 NN interaction obtained in
J-matrix inverse scattering approach and fitted to reproduce light nuclei
observables without three-nucleon forces. We discuss the current status of this
NN interaction and its recent development.
