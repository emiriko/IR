A novel procedure for extracting hadron characteristics from QCD sum rules,
based on effective continuum thresholds (necessary for the implementation of
quark-hadron duality) which may depend on the involved momenta and on the Borel
parameter(s), enables us to quantify the uncertainties induced by the
quark-hadron duality approximation and to achieve a significantly higher
accuracy of our predictions for the properties of hadronic bound states.
