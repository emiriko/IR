We prove uniqueness of ground state solutions $Q = Q(|x|) \geq 0$ for the
nonlinear equation $(-\Delta)^s Q + Q - Q^{\alpha+1}= 0$ in $\mathbb{R}$, where
$0 < s < 1$ and $0 < \alpha < \frac{4s}{1-2s}$ for $s < 1/2$ and $0 < \alpha <
\infty$ for $s \geq 1/2$. Here $(-\Delta)^s$ denotes the fractional Laplacian
in one dimension. In particular, we generalize (by completely different
techniques) the specific uniqueness result obtained by Amick and Toland for
$s=1/2$ and $\alpha=1$ in [Acta Math., \textbf{167} (1991), 107--126]. As a
technical key result in this paper, we show that the associated linearized
operator $L_+ = (-\Delta)^s + 1 - (\alpha+1) Q^\alpha$ is nondegenerate;
i.\,e., its kernel satisfies $\mathrm{ker}\, L_+ = \mathrm{span}\, \{Q'\}$.
This result about $L_+$ proves a spectral assumption, which plays a central
role for the stability of solitary waves and blowup analysis for nonlinear
dispersive PDEs with fractional Laplacians, such as the generalized
Benjamin-Ono (BO) and Benjamin-Bona-Mahony (BBM) water wave equations.
