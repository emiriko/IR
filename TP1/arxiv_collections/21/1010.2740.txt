A general expression for the four-point function with vanishing total
R-charge of anti-chiral and chiral superfields in N=1 superconformal theories
is given. It is obtained by applying the exponential of a simple universal
nilpotent differential operator to an arbitrary function of two cross ratios.
To achieve this the nilpotent superconformal invariants according to Park are
focused. Several dependencies between these invariants are presented, so that
eight nilpotent invariants and 27 monomials of these invariants of degree d>1
are left being linearly independent. It is analyzed, how terms within the
four-point function of general scalar superfields cancel in order to fulfill
the chiral restrictions.
