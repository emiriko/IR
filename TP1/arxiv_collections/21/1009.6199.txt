In this talk three 2-sigma deviations from the Standard Model predictions in
the top quark sector are briefly discussed. These are the excess of events in
the tail of the H_T distribution in ttbar events, the top-quark charge
asymmetry and the discrimination of s- and t-channel events in single top. The
latter has only been observed by CDF, while the other two are found by both CDF
and D0.
