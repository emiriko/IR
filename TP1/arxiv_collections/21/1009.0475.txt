Effect of a planar texture quality and its thickness on lasing spectrums and
thresholds in dye-doped cholesteric liquid crystal (CLC) of steroid type is
explored. Transition from the qualitative planar texture to the poor texture
quality is accompanied by change of characteristic mode structures and by shift
of barycentre in the long-wave side and the considerable growth of the lasing
threshold. It is found that in the CLC texture created by substrates with
perpendicular directions of orientation the stable single-mode lasing takes
place. The nature of oscillated modes in such texture is caused by phase jump.
The gained results show that in steroid CLC, unlike induced one, lasing
spectrums is possible to feature with the coupled wave model. Key words:
steroidal cholesteric liquid crystal, distributed feedback lasing, oscillation
thresholds, phase defect of periodical structure, transmission and lasing
spectra
