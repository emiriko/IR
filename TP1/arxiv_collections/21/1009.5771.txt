The first realization of solid state quantum computer was demonstrated
recently by using artificial atoms -- transmons in superconducting resonator.
Here, we propose a novel architecture of flexible and scalable quantum computer
based on a waveguide circuit coupling many quantum nodes of controlled atomic
ensembles. For the first time, we found the optimal practically attainable
parameters of the atoms and circuit for 100{%} efficiency of quantum memory for
multi qubit photon fields and confirmed experimentally the predicted perfect
storage. Then we revealed self modes for reversible transfer of qubits between
the quantum memory node and arbitrary other nodes. We found a realization of
iSWAP gate via direct coupling of two arbitrary nodes with a processing rate
accelerated proportionally to number of atoms in the node. A large number of
the two-qubit gates can be simultaneously realized in the circuit for
implementation of parallel quantum processing. Dynamic coherent elimination
procedure of excess quantum state and collective blockade mechanism are
proposed for realization of $iSWAP$ and $\sqrt {iSWAP} $ quantum gates.
