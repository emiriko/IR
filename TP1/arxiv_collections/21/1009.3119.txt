We study the few-body physics of trapped atoms or molecules with electric or
magnetic dipole moments aligned by an external field. Using exact numerical
diagonalization appropriate for the strongly correlated regime, as well as a
classical analysis, we show how Wigner localization emerges with increasing
coupling strength. The Wigner states exhibit non-trivial geometries due to the
anisotropy of the interaction. This leads to transitions between different
Wigner states as the tilt angle of the dipoles with the confining plane is
changed. Intriguingly, while the individual Wigner states are well described by
a classical analysis, the transitions between different Wigner states are
strongly affected by quantum statistics. This can be understood by considering
the interplay between quantum-mechanical and spatial symmetry properties.
Finally, we demonstrate that our results are relevant to experimentally
realistic systems.
