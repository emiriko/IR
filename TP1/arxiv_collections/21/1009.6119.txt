This survey paper categorises, compares, and summarises from almost all
published technical and review articles in automated fraud detection within the
last 10 years. It defines the professional fraudster, formalises the main types
and subtypes of known fraud, and presents the nature of data evidence collected
within affected industries. Within the business context of mining the data to
achieve higher cost savings, this research presents methods and techniques
together with their problems. Compared to all related reviews on fraud
detection, this survey covers much more technical articles and is the only one,
to the best of our knowledge, which proposes alternative data and solutions
from related domains.
