We study the storage and retrieval of phase-coded patterns as stable
dynamical attractors in recurrent neural networks, for both an analog and a
integrate-and-fire spiking model. The synaptic strength is determined by a
learning rule based on spike-time-dependent plasticity, with an asymmetric time
window depending on the relative timing between pre- and post-synaptic
activity. We store multiple patterns and study the network capacity.
  For the analog model, we find that the network capacity scales linearly with
the network size, and that both capacity and the oscillation frequency of the
retrieval state depend on the asymmetry of the learning time window. In
addition to fully-connected networks, we study sparse networks, where each
neuron is connected only to a small number z << N of other neurons. Connections
can be short range, between neighboring neurons placed on a regular lattice, or
long range, between randomly chosen pairs of neurons. We find that a small
fraction of long range connections is able to amplify the capacity of the
network. This imply that a small-world-network topology is optimal, as a
compromise between the cost of long range connections and the capacity
increase.
  Also in the spiking integrate and fire model the crucial result of storing
and retrieval of multiple phase-coded patterns is observed. The capacity of the
fully-connected spiking network is investigated, together with the relation
between oscillation frequency of retrieval state and window asymmetry.
