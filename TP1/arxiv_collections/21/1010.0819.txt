This is the user's manual of MC@NLO 4.0. This package is a practical
implementation, based upon the Fortran HERWIG and Herwig++ event generators, of
the MC@NLO formalism, which allows one to incorporate NLO QCD matrix elements
consistently into a parton shower framework. Processes available in this
version include the hadroproduction of single vector and Higgs bosons, vector
boson pairs, heavy quark pairs, single top, single top in association with a W,
single top in association with a charged Higgs in type I or II 2HDM models,
lepton pairs, and Higgs bosons in association with a W or Z. Spin correlations
are included for all processes except ZZ production. This document is
self-contained, but we emphasise the main differences with respect to previous
versions.
