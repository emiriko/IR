The complex-rotated hyperspherical adiabatic method is used to study the
decay of low-lying $^9$Be and $^9$B resonances into $\alpha$, $\alpha$ and $n$
or $p$. We consider six low-lying resonances of $^9$Be ($1/2^\pm$, $3/2^\pm$
and $5/2^\pm$) and one resonance of $^9$B ($5/2^-$) to compare with. The
properties of the resonances at large distances are decisive for the momentum
distributions of the three decaying fragments. Systematic detailed energy
correlations of Dalitz plots are presented.
