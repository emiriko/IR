We study the rate of convergence to a normal random variable of the real and
imaginary parts of Tr(AU), where U is an N x N random unitary matrix and A is a
deterministic complex matrix. We show that the rate of convergence is O(N^{-2 +
b}), with 0 <= b < 1, depending only on the asymptotic behaviour of the
singular values of A; for example, if the singular values are non-degenerate,
different from zero and O(1) as N -> infinity, then b=0. The proof uses a
Berry-Esse'en inequality for linear combinations of eigenvalues of random
unitary, matrices, and so appropriate for strongly dependent random variables.
