In this paper we take an idea presented in recent paper by Carlen, Carvalho,
Le Roux, Loss, and Villani and push it one step forward to find an exact
estimation on the entropy production. The new estimation essentially proves
that Villani's conjecture is correct, or more precisely that a much worse bound
to the entropy production is impossible in the general case.
