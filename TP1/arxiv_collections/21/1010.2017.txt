We investigate the metamagnetism in the periodic Anderson model with the
$\bm{k}$-dependent $c-f$ mixing by using the dynamical mean-field theory
combined with the exact diagonalization method. It is found that both effects
of the $\bm{k}$-dependent $c-f$ mixing and strong correlation due to the
Coulomb interaction between $f$ electrons are significant for determining both
the magnetization and the mass enhancement factor. For the case away from the
half-filling, the results is consistent with the metamagnetic behavior observed
in CeRu$_2$Si$_2$.
