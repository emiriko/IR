Glass-forming liquids have been extensively studied in recent decades, but
there is still no theory that fully describes these systems, and the diversity
of treatments is in itself a barrier to understanding. Here we introduce a new
simple model that (possessing both liquid-crystal and glass transition) unifies
different approaches, producing most of the phenomena associated with real
glasses, without loss of the simplicity that theorists require. Within the
model we calculate energy relaxation, non-exponential slowing phenomena, the
Kauzmann temperature and other classical signatures. Moreover, the model
reproduces a sub-diffusive exponent observed in experiments of dense systems.
The simplicity of the model allows us to identify the microscopic origin of
glassification, leaving open the possibility for theorists to make further
progress.
