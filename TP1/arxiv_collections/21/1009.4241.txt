A single-index model (SIM) provides for parsimonious multi-dimensional
nonlinear regression by combining parametric (linear) projection with
univariate nonparametric (non-linear) regression models. We show that a
particular Gaussian process (GP) formulation is simple to work with and ideal
as an emulator for some types of computer experiment as it can outperform the
canonical separable GP regression model commonly used in this setting. Our
contribution focuses on drastically simplifying, re-interpreting, and then
generalizing a recently proposed fully Bayesian GP-SIM combination, and then
illustrating its favorable performance on synthetic data and a real-data
computer experiment. Two R packages, both released on CRAN, have been augmented
to facilitate inference under our proposed model(s).
