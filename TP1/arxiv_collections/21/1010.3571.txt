By invoking quantum estimation theory we formulate bounds of errors in
quantum measurement for arbitrary quantum states and observables in a
finite-dimensional Hilbert space. We prove that the measurement errors of two
observables satisfy Heisenberg's uncertainty relation, find the attainable
bound, and provide a strategy to achieve it.
