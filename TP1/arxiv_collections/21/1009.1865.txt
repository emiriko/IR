We present a class of analytic solutions of cubic superstring field theory in
the universal sector on a non-BPS D-brane. Computation of the action and gauge
invariant overlap reveal that the solutions carry half the tension of a non-BPS
D-brane. However, the solutions do not satisfy the reality condition. In fact,
they display an intriguing topological structure: We find evidence that
conjugation of the solutions is equivalent to a gauge transformation that
cannot be continuously deformed to the identity.
