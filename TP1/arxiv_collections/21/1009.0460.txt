Next generation radio telescopes will be much larger, more sensitive, have
much larger observation bandwidth and will be capable of pointing multiple
beams simultaneously. Obtaining the sensitivity, resolution and dynamic range
supported by the receivers requires the development of new signal processing
techniques for array and atmospheric calibration as well as new imaging
techniques that are both more accurate and computationally efficient since data
volumes will be much larger. This paper provides a tutorial overview of
existing image formation techniques and outlines some of the future directions
needed for information extraction from future radio telescopes. We describe the
imaging process from measurement equation until deconvolution, both as a
Fourier inversion problem and as an array processing estimation problem. The
latter formulation enables the development of more advanced techniques based on
state of the art array processing. We demonstrate the techniques on simulated
and measured radio telescope data.
