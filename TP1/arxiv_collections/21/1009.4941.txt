We propose a mechanism to rectify charge transport in the semiclassical
Holstein model. It is shown that localised initial conditions, associated with
a polaron solution, in conjunction with a nonreversion symmetric static
electron on-site potential constitute minimal prerequisites for the emergence
of a directed current in the underlying periodic lattice system. In particular,
we demonstrate that for unbiased spatially localised initial conditions,
violation of parity prevents the existence of pairs of counter-propagating
trajectories, thus allowing for a directed current despite the
time-reversibility of the equations of motion. Occurrence of long-range
coherent charge transport is demonstrated.
