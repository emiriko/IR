The value of the important triple-Pomeron coupling is estimated by an
unorthodox procedure using the known diffractive parton distribution functions.
The result is g_{3P}\simeq 0.2g_N, where g_N is the Pomeron-nucleon coupling.
This is in excellent agreement with an independent determination, g_{3P}\simeq
0.2g_N, previously obtained by analysing the available data in the triple-Regge
region with absorptive effects taken into account.
