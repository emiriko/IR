Entanglement charge is an operational measure to quantify nonlocalities in
ensembles consisting of bipartite quantum states. Here we generalize this
nonlocality measure to single bipartite quantum states. As an example, we
analyze the entanglement charges of some thermal states of two-qubit systems
and show how they depend on the temperature and the system parameters in an
analytical way.
