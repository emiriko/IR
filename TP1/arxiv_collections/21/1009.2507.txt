We present a comprehensive study of white dwarf collisions as an avenue for
creating type Ia supernovae. Using a smooth particle hydrodynamics code with a
13-isotope, {\alpha}-chain nuclear network, we examine the resulting 56Ni yield
as a function of total mass, mass ratio, and impact parameter. We show that
several combinations of white dwarf masses and impact parameters are able to
produce sufficient quantities of 56Ni to be observable at cosmological
distances. We find the 56Ni production in double-degenerate white dwarf
collisions ranges from sub-luminous to the super-luminous, depending on the
parameters of the collision. For all mass pairs, collisions with small impact
parameters have the highest likelihood of detonating, but 56Ni production is
insensitive to this parameter in high-mass combinations, which significantly
increases their likelihood of detection. We also find that the 56Ni dependence
on total mass and mass ratio is not linear, with larger mass primaries
producing disproportionately more 56Ni than their lower mass secondary
counterparts, and symmetric pairs of masses producing more 56Ni than asymmetric
pairs.
