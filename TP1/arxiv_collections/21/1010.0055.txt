Large-scale clustering of highly biased tracers of large-scale structure has
emerged as one of the best observational probes of primordial non-Gaussianity
of the local type (i.e. f_{NL}^{local}). This type of non-Gaussianity can be
generated in multifield models of inflation such as the curvaton model.
Recently, Tseliakhovich, Hirata, and Slosar showed that the clustering
statistics depend qualitatively on the ratio of inflaton to curvaton power \xi
after reheating, a free parameter of the model. If \xi is significantly
different from zero, so that the inflaton makes a non-negligible contribution
to the primordial adiabatic curvature, then the peak-background split ansatz
predicts that the halo bias will be stochastic on large scales. In this paper,
we test this prediction in N-body simulations. We find that large-scale
stochasticity is generated, in qualitative agreement with the prediction, but
that the level of stochasticity is overpredicted by ~30%. Other predictions,
such as \xi independence of the halo bias, are confirmed by the simulations.
Surprisingly, even in the Gaussian case we do not find that halo model
predictions for stochasticity agree consistently with simulations, suggesting
that semi-analytic modeling of stochasticity is generally more difficult than
modeling halo bias.
