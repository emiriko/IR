The force-free (or low inertia) limit of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) can be
applied to many astrophysical objects, including black holes, neutron stars,
and accretion disks, where the electromagnetic field is so strong that the
inertia and pressure of the plasma can be ignored. This is difficult to achieve
with the standard MHD numerical methods because they still have to deal with
plasma inertial terms even when these terms are much smaller than the
electromagnetic terms. Under the force free approximation, the plasma dynamics
is entirely determined by the magnetic field. The plasma provides the currents
and charge densities required by the dynamics of electromagnetic fields, but
these currents carry no inertia. We present a high order Godunov scheme to
study such force-free electrodynamics. We have implemented weighted essentially
non-oscillatory (WENO) spatial interpolations in our scheme. An exact Riemann
solver is implemented, which requires spectral decomposition into
characteristic waves. We advance the magnetic field with the constrained
transport (CT) scheme to preserve the divergence free condition to machine
round-off error. We apply the third order total variation diminishing (TVD)
Runge-Kutta scheme for the temporal integration. The mapping from face-centered
variables to volume-centered variables is carefully considered. Extensive
testing are performed to demonstrate the ability of our scheme to address
force-free electrodynamics correctly. We finally apply the scheme to study
relativistic magnetically dominated tearing instabilities and neutron star
magnetospheres.
