Here we report an experimental realization of optimal phase-covariant quantum
cloning machine with a single electron spin in solid state system at room
temperature. The involved three states of two logic qubits are encoded
physically in three levels of a single electron spin with two Zeeman sub-levels
at a nitrogen-vacancy defect center in diamond. The preparation of input state
and the phase-covariant quantum cloning transformation are controlled by two
independent microwave fields. The average experimental fidelity reaches 85.2%
which is very close to theoretical optimal fidelity 85.4% and is beyond the
bound 83.3% of universal cloning.
