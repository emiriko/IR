A Metal-Disordered Mott insulator-Metal heterostructure is studied at
half-fiiling using unrestricted Hartree Fock method. The corresponding clean
system has been shown to be an insulator for any finite on site correlation.
Interestingly we find that introduction of explicit disorder induces a
metal-insulator transition at a critical value of disorder. The critical value
corresponds to the point at which disorder nullifies the effect of onsite
correlation. The wavefunctions are found to delocalize by increasing disorder,
rendering the system metallic.
