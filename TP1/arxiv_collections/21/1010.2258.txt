The magnetic configurations of barcode-type magnetic nanostructures
consisting of alternate ferromagnetic and nonmagnetic layers arranged within a
multilayer nanotube structure are investigated as a function of their geometry.
Based on a continuum approach we have obtained analytical expressions for the
energy which lead us to obtain phase diagrams giving the relative stability of
characteristic internal magnetic configurations of the barcode-type
nanostructures.
