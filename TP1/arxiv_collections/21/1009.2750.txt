Using Spitzer-MIPS 24um imaging and Keck spectroscopy we examine the nature
of the obscured star forming population in three clusters and three groups at
z~0.9. These six systems are components of the Cl1604 supercluster, the largest
structure imaged by Spitzer at redshifts near unity. We find that the average
density of 24um-detected galaxies within the Cl1604 clusters is nearly twice
that of the surrounding field and that this overdensity scales with the
cluster's dynamical state. The 24um-bright members often appear optically
unremarkable and exhibit only moderate [OII] line emission due to severe
obscuration. Their spatial distribution suggests they are an infalling
population, but an examination of their spectral properties, morphologies and
optical colors indicate they are not simply analogs of the field population
that have yet to be quenched. Using stacked composite spectra, we find the
24um-detected cluster and group galaxies exhibit elevated levels of Balmer
absorption compared to galaxies undergoing normal, continuous star formation. A
similar excess is not observed in field galaxies with equivalent infrared
luminosities, indicating a greater fraction of the detected cluster and group
members have experienced a burst of star formation in the recent past compared
to their counterparts in the field. Our results suggest that gas-rich galaxies
at high redshift experience a temporary increase in their star formation
activity as they assemble into denser environments. Using HST-ACS imaging we
find that disturbed morphologies are common among the 24um-detected cluster and
group members and become more prevalent in regions of higher galaxy density. We
conclude that mergers are the dominant triggering mechanism responsible for the
enhanced star formation found in the Cl1604 groups, while a mix of harassment
and mergers are likely driving the activity of the cluster galaxies.
