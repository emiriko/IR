In black hole physics, the second law of thermodynamics is generally valid
whether the black hole is a static or a non-static one. Considering the
universe as a thermodynamical system the second law of black hole dynamics
extends to the non-negativity of the sum of the entropy of the matter and the
horizon, known as generalized second law of thermodynamics(GSLT). Here, we have
assumed the universe to be bounded by the event-horizon where Bekenstein
entropy-area relation and Hawking-temperature are not applicable. Thus
considering entropy to be an arbitrary function of the area of the
event-horizon, we have tried to find the nature of the entropy-function for the
validity of the GSLT both in quintessence-era and in phantom-era. Finally, some
graphical representation of the entropy-function has been presented.
