We present and experimentally demonstrate a communication protocol that
employs shared entanglement to reduce errors when sending a bit over a
particular noisy classical channel. Specifically, it is shown that, given a
single use of this channel, one can transmit a bit with higher success
probability when sender and receiver share entanglement compared to the best
possible strategy when they do not. The experiment is realized using
polarization-entangled photon pairs, whose quantum correlations play a critical
role in both the encoding and decoding of the classical message.
Experimentally, we find that a bit can be successfully transmitted with
probability 0.891 \pm 0.002, which is close to the theoretical maximum of (2 +
2^-1/2)/3 \simeq 0.902 and is significantly above the optimal classical
strategy, which yields 5/6 \simeq 0.833.
