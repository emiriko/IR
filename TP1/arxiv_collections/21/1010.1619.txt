Final-state-exclusive momentum distributions of fast, forward travelling
residual nuclei, following two nucleon removal from fast secondary radioactive
beams of projectile nuclei, can and have now been measured. Assuming that the
most important reaction mechanism is the sudden direct removal of a pair of
nucleons from a set of relatively simple, active shell-model orbital
configurations, such distributions were predicted to depend strongly on the
total angular momentum I carried by the two nucleons - the final state spin for
spin 0+ projectiles. The sensitivity of these now-accessible observables to
specific details of the (correlated) two-nucleon wave functions is of
importance. We clarify that it is the total orbital angular momentum L of the
two nucleons that is the primary factor in determining the shapes and widths of
the calculated momentum distributions. It follows that, with accurate
measurements, this dependence upon the L make-up of the two-nucleon wave
functions could be used to assess the accuracy of (shell- or many-body) model
predictions of these two-nucleon configurations. By use of several tailored
examples, with specific combinations of active two-nucleon orbitals, we
demonstrate that more subtle structure aspects may be observed, allowing such
reactions to probe and/or confirm the details of theoretical model wave
functions.
