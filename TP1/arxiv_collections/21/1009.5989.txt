Small amplitude oscillations are observed in red giant branch (RGB) stars.
Data on such oscillations are a source of information about the objects,
notably about properties of convection in their envelopes and about the systems
these objects inhabit. The OGLE-III catalog contains data for about 80 thousand
small amplitude variable red giants (OSARGs) in the Large Magellanic Cloud.
  We want to explain variability in OSARGs as the solar-like oscillation and to
associate the peaks in power spectra with frequencies of acoustic modes. We use
data on reddening-free magnitudes of the objects and interpret them in terms of
stellar physical parameters using tabulated isochrones calculated for ages and
composition parameters corresponding to the upper RGB of the LMC. Massive data
on the peak frequencies and amplitudes are compared with expectations for
stochastically excited oscillations. The frequencies are also compared with
those calculated for radial modes in envelope models with parameters taken from
the isochrones.
  In stars close to the tip of the RGB, the peaks in power spectra are found in
the 0.1-1.0 $\mu$Hz range, which is consistent with extrapolation of the
frequency-luminosity relation for the solar-like oscillation. The dominant
peaks occur close to the first two radial overtones. The increase in amplitude
with luminosity is slower than linear. The exponent s=0.9 is similar to what is
found from recent analysis of CoRoT data on less luminous red giants. Frequency
separations between dominant peaks are found to be smaller by about 20% than
calculated separations between these modes. After examining various
possibilities, we left this discrepancy unexplained.
  The small amplitude variability of stars at the RGB tip is likely to be
caused by a stochastic excitation of acoustic oscillations, but interpreting of
individual peaks in power spectra presents a problem.
