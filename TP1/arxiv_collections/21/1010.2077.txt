An attempt to explain with the classical stands a number of statements of the
quantum mechanics has been done. At this the Plank constant appears as
consequence of demand of nucleon stability. Proton can be imagined as a
rotating disk which mass density is smoothly decreasing from centre to edge
where its charge is concentrated. In this case the calculated magnetic moment
of proton is equal to its experimental value. The Balmer formula has been
derived with classical approach. It turns out that radii of electron orbit and
proton in hydrogen atom are interconnected.
