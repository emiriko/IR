The influence of the quadrupole shape fluctuations on the dipole vibrations
in transitional nuclei is investigated in the framework of the Instantaneous
Shape Sampling Model, which combines the Interacting Boson Model for the slow
collective quadrupole motion with the Random Phase Approximation for the rapid
dipole vibrations. Coupling to the complex background configurations is taken
into account by folding the results with a Lorentzian with an energy dependent
width. The low-energy energy portion of the $\gamma$- absorption cross section,
which is important for photo-nuclear processes, is studied for the isotopic
series of Kr, Xe, Ba, and Sm. The experimental cross sections are well
reproduced. The low-energy cross section is determined by the Landau
fragmentation of the dipole strength and its redistribution caused by the shape
fluctuations. Collisional damping only wipes out fluctuations of the absorption
cross section, generating the smooth energy dependence observed in experiment.
In the case of semi-magic nuclei, shallow pygmy resonances are found in
agreement with experiment.
