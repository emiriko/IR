How often will elections end in landslides? What is the probability for a
head-to-head race? Analyzing ballot results from several large countries rather
anomalous and yet unexplained distributions have been observed. We identify
tactical voting as the driving ingredient for the anomalies and introduce a
model to study its effect on plurality elections, characterized by the relative
strength of the feedback from polls and the pairwise interaction between
individuals in the society. With this model it becomes possible to explain the
polarization of votes between two candidates, understand the small margin of
victories frequently observed for different elections, and analyze the polls'
impact in American, Canadian, and Brazilian ballots. Moreover, the model
reproduces, quantitatively, the distribution of votes obtained in the Brazilian
mayor elections with two, three, and four candidates.
