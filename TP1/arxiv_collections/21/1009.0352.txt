Sliding parts in nanosystems such as Nano ElectroMechanical Systems (NEMS)
and nanomotors, increasingly involve large speeds, and rotations as well as
translations of the moving surfaces; yet, the physics of high speed nanoscale
friction is so far unexplored. Here, by simulating the motion of drifting and
of kicked Au clusters on graphite - a workhorse system of experimental
relevance -- we demonstrate and characterize a novel "ballistic" friction
regime at high speed, separate from drift at low speed. The temperature
dependence of the cluster slip distance and time, measuring friction, is
opposite in these two regimes, consistent with theory. Crucial to both regimes
is the interplay of rotations and translations, shown to be correlated in slow
drift but anticorrelated in fast sliding. Despite these differences, we find
the velocity dependence of ballistic friction to be, like drift, viscous.
