We investigate the binding energy per nucleon and hadron properties in
infinite and homogeneous nuclear matter within the framework of the in-medium
modified Skyrme model. We first consider the medium modifications of the single
hadron properties by introducing the optical potential for pion fields into the
original Lagrangian of the Skyrme model. The parameters of the optical
potential are well fitted to the low-energy phenomenology of pion-nucleus
scattering. Furthermore, the Skyrme term is also modified in such a way that
the model reproduces bulk properties of nuclear matter, in particular, the
binding energy per nucleon. The present approach is self-consistent: the single
hadron properties in a nuclear medium, their effective in-medium interactions,
and the bulk matter properties are treated on the same footing.
