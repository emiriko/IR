We demonstrate the first guiding of cold atoms through a 88 mm long piece of
photonic band gap fiber. The guiding potential is created by a far-off
resonance dipole trap propagating inside the fiber with a hollow core of 12 mu
m. We load the fiber from a dark spot 85-Rb magneto optical trap and observe a
peak flux of more than 10^5 atoms/s at a velocity of 1.5 m/s. With an
additional reservoir optical dipole trap, a constant atomic flux of 1.5 10^4
atoms/s is sustained for more than 150\,ms. These results open up interesting
possibilities to study nonlinear light-matter interaction in a nearly
one-dimensional geometry and pave the way for guided matter wave
interferometry.
