Several pathogens use evolvability as a survival strategy against acquired
immunity of the host. Despite their high variability in time, some of them
exhibit quite low variability within the population at any given time, a
somehow paradoxical behavior often called the evolving quasispecies. In this
paper we introduce a simplified model of an evolving viral population in which
the effects of the acquired immunity of the host are represented by the
decrease of the fitness of the corresponding viral strains, depending on the
frequency of the strain in the viral population. The model exhibits evolving
quasispecies behavior in a certain range of its parameters, ans suggests how
punctuated evolution can be induced by a simple feedback mechanism.
