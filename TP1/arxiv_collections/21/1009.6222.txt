Since the start-up of the LHC end of 2009, the trigger commissioning is in
full swing. The ATLAS trigger system is divided into three levels: the
hardware-based first level trigger, and the software-based second level trigger
and Event Filter, collectively referred to as the High Level Trigger (HLT).
Initially, events have been selected online based on the Level-1 selections
with the HLT algorithms run but not rejecting any events. This has been an
important step in the commissioning of these triggers to ensure their correct
functioning and subsequently to enable the HLT selections. Due to increasing
LHC luminosity and the large QCD cross section, this has been a vital step to
select leptons from J/$\Psi$, bottom, charm, W and Z decays.
  This presentation gives an overview of the trigger performance of the
electron and photon selection. Comparisons of the online selection variables
with the offline reconstruction are shown as well as comparisons of data with
MC simulations on which the current selection tuning is performed.
