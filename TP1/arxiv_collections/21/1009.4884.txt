Motivated by the pricing of lookback options in exponential L\'evy models, we
study the difference between the continuous and discrete supremum of L\'evy
processes. In particular, we extend the results of Broadie et al. (1999) to
jump-diffusion models. We also derive bounds for general exponential L\'evy
models.
