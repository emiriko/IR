Magnetic hysteresis loops (MHLs) have been comparatively measured on both
textured and single crystalline Sc5Ir4Si10 superconductors. Critical current
densities and flux pinning forces are calculated from MHLs by Bean model. Three
kinds of peaks of the flux pinning force are found at low fields near zero,
intermediated fields, and high fields near the upper critical field,
respectively. The characters and origins of these peaks are studied in detail.
