We present a simple and efficient variational finite difference method for
simulating time-dependent Stokes flow in the presence of irregular free
surfaces and moving solid boundaries. The method uses an embedded boundary
approach on staggered Cartesian grids, avoiding the need for expensive
remeshing operations, and can be applied to flows in both two and three
dimensions. It uses fully implicit backwards Euler integration to provide
stability and supports spatially varying density and viscosity, while requiring
the solution of just a single sparse, symmetric positive-definite linear system
per time step. By expressing the problem in a variational form, challenging
irregular domains are supported implicitly through the use of natural boundary
conditions. In practice, the discretization requires only centred finite
difference stencils and per-cell volume fractions, and is straightforward to
implement. The variational form further permits generalizations to coupling
other mechanics, all the while reducing to a sparse symmetric positive definite
matrix. We demonstrate consistent first order convergence of velocity in L1 and
Linf norms on a range of analytical test cases in two dimensions. Furthermore,
we apply our method as part of a simple Navier-Stokes solver to illustrate that
it can reproduce the characteristic jet buckling phenomenon of Newtonian
liquids at moderate viscosities, in both two and three dimensions.
