The performance analysis of long file TCP controlled transfers in a WLAN in
infrastructure mode is available in the present literature with one of the main
assumptions being equal window size for all TCP connections. In this paper, we
extend the analysis to TCP-controlled long file uploads and downloads with
different TCP windows. Our approach is based on simple Markov chain given in
the paper [1], [2] with arbitrary window sizes. We presented simulation results
to show the accuracy of the analytical model.
