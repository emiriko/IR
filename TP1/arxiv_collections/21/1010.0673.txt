We have analysed the rest-frame far infrared (FIR) properties of a sample of
massive (Mstar > 10^11Msun) galaxies at 2<z<3 in the GOODS (Great Observatories
Origins Deep Survey) North field using the Spectral and Photometric Imaging
Receiver (SPIRE) instrument aboard the Herschel Space Observatory. To conduct
this analysis we take advantage of the data from the HerMES key program. The
sample comprises 45 massive galaxies with structural parameters characterised
with HST NICMOS-3. We study detections at submm Herschel bands, together with
Spitzer 24{\mu}m data, as a function of the morphological type, mass and size.
We find that 26/45 sources are detected at MIPS-24{\mu}m and 15/45 (all
MIPS-24{\mu}m detections) are detected at SPIRE-250{\mu}m, with disk-like
galaxies more easily detected. We derive star formation rates (SFR) and
specific star formation rates (sSFR) by fitting the spectral energy
distribution (SED) of our sources, taking into account non-detections for SPIRE
and systematic effects for MIPS derived quantities. We find that the mean SFR
for the spheroidal galaxies (50-100 Msun*yr^-1) is substantially (a factor ~ 3)
lower than the mean value presented by disk-like galaxies (250-300 Msun*yr^-1).
