In this work, the effects of quantum interference and spontaneously generated
coherence (SGC) are theoretically analyzed in a four level system of a
$^{87}\mathrm{Rb}$ atom. For the effects of SGC, we find that a new kind of EIT
channel can be induced due to destructive interference, and the nonlinear Kerr
absorption can be coherently narrowed or eliminated under different strengths
of the coupling and switching fields.
