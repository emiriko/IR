The recurrence properties of random walks can be characterized by P\'{o}lya
number, i.e., the probability that the walker has returned to the origin at
least once. In this paper, we consider recurrence properties for a general 1D
random walk on a line, in which at each time step the walker can move to the
left or right with probabilities $l$ and $r$, or remain at the same position
with probability $o$ ($l+r+o=1$). We calculate P\'{o}lya number $P$ of this
model and find a simple expression for $P$ as, $P=1-\Delta$, where $\Delta$ is
the absolute difference of $l$ and $r$ ($\Delta=|l-r|$). We prove this rigorous
expression by the method of creative telescoping, and our result suggests that
the walk is recurrent if and only if the left-moving probability $l$ equals to
the right-moving probability $r$.
