In this report we present two complex eruptive solar events and the
associated Cosmic Ray effects (Forbush decrease). We use combined recordings
from a number of Earthbound Receivers, Space Experiments and data archives
(such as the ARTEMIS-IV Radio spectrograph, the Athens NEUTRON MONITOR, the
LASCO CME Lists, the SONG of the {CORONAS-F} satellite, etc.). The influence of
solar transients on the interplanetary medium conditions and the cosmic ray
flux is analysed and discussed. The observed time sequence of events of this
time period indicates that the initiation of CMEs is closely related to the
appearance of type II and IV radio bursts and strong solar flares. Their
effects extend from the lower corona to the near Earth vicinity affecting
Cosmic Ray measurements and space weather. As regards the Forbush decrease our
data indicate significant amplification at the presence of a MHD shock.
