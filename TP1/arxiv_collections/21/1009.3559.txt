It has long been considered that conformal superspace is the natural
configuration space for canonical general relativity. However, this was never
definitively demonstrated. We have found that the standard conformal method of
solving the Einstein constraints has an unexpected extra symmetry. This allows
us to complete the project. We show that given a point and a velocity in
conformal superspace, the Einstein equations generate a unique curve in
conformal superspace.
