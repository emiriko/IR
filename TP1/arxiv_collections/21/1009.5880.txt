The anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) are computed for
the half-turn space E_2 which represents a compact flat model of the Universe,
i.e. one with finite volume. This model is inhomogeneous in the sense that the
statistical properties of the CMB depend on the position of the observer within
the fundamental cell. It is shown that the half-turn space describes the
observed CMB anisotropies on large scales better than the concordance model
with infinite volume. For most observer positions it matches the temperature
correlation function even slightly better than the well studied 3-torus
topology.
