We present a catalogue of structural parameters for 8814 galaxies in the 25
fields of the HST/ACS Coma Treasury Survey. Parameters from S\'ersic fits to
the two-dimensional surface brightness distributions are given for all galaxies
from our published Coma photometric catalogue with mean effective surface
brightness brighter than 26.0 mag/sq. arcsec and brighter than 24.5 mag
(equivalent to absolute magnitude - 10.5), as given by the fits, all in
F814W(AB).
  The sample comprises a mixture of Coma members and background objects; 424
galaxies have redshifts and of these 163 are confirmed members. The fits were
carried out using both the Gim2D and Galfit codes. We provide the following
parameters: Galaxy ID, RA, DEC, the total corrected automatic magnitude from
the photometric catalogue, the total magnitude of the model (F814W_AB), the
geometric mean effective radius Re, the mean surface brightness within the
effective radius <{\mu}>_e, the S\'ersic index n, the ellipticity and the
source position angle. The selection limits of the catalogue and the errors
listed for the S\'ersic parameters come from extensive simulations of the
fitting process using synthetic galaxy models. The agreement between Gim2D and
Galfit parameters is sensitive to details of the fitting procedure; for the
settings employed here the agreement is excellent over the range of parameters
covered in the catalogue. We define and present two goodness-of-fit indices
which quantify the degree to which the image can be approximated by a S\'ersic
model with concentric, coaxial elliptical isophotes; such indices may be used
to objectively select galaxies with more complex structures such as bulge-disk,
bars or nuclear components.
  We make the catalog available in electronic format at Astro-WISE and MAST.
