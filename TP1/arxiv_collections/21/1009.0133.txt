In this paper, we study optimal transportation problems for multifractal
random measures. Since these measures are much less regular than optimal
transportation theory requires, we introduce a new notion of transportation
which is intuitively some kind of multistep transportation. Applications are
given for construction of multifractal random changes of times and to the
existence of random metrics, the volume forms of which coincide with the
multifractal random measures. This study is motivated by recent problems in the
KPZ context.
