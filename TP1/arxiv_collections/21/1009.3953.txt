We study low temperature thermodynamic properties of a polarized Fermi gas
trapped in a quartic anharmonic potential. We use a semi classical
approximation and a low temperature series expansion method to derive
analytical expressions for various thermodynamic quantities. These quantities
include the total energy, particle number, and heat capacity for both positive
and negative anharmonic confinements.
