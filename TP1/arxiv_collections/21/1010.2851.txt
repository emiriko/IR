We continue to investigate properties of the strongly coupled inflaton in a
setup introduced in arXiv:0807.3191 through the AdS/CFT correspondence. These
properties are qualitatively different from those in conventional inflationary
models. For example, in slow-roll inflation, the inflaton velocity is not
determined by the shape of potential; the fine-tuning problem concerns the dual
infrared geometry instead of the potential; the non-Gaussianities such as the
local form can naturally become large.
