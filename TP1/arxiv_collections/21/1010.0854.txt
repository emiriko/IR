We analyze the impact of the sampling interval on the estimation of
Kramers-Moyal coefficients. We obtain the finite-time expressions of these
coefficients for several standard processes. We also analyze extreme situations
such as the independence and no-fluctuation limits that constitute useful
references. Our results aim at aiding the proper extraction of information in
data-driven analysis.
