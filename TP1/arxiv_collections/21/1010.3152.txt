In this paper we present a new method of restoration of the true
thee-dimensional trajectories of the prominence knots based on ground-based
observations taken with a single telescope, which is equipped with a
Multi-Channel Subtractive Double Pass imaging spectrograph. Our method allows
to evaluate true three-dimensional trajectories of the prominence knots without
any assumptions concerning the shape of the trajectories or dynamics of the
motion. The reconstructed trajectories of several knots observed in three
prominences are presented.
