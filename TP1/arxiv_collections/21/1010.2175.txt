We present a general formalism for the evaluation of time-reversal odd parton
distributions. This formalism is applied to the evaluation of the two T-odd
TMDs allowed at the twist-2 level, i.e., the Sivers and the Boer-Mulders
functions. We have performed the calculation for two different models of proton
structure: a non relativistic constituent quark model and the MIT bag model.
The results obtained in both models are compared. So are the two T-odd
functions. We comment on the fulfilment of the Burkardt sum rule as well as on
the current status of T-odd TMDs in phenomenology.
