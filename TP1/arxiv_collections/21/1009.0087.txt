Let $\Delta\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ be an $n$-dimensional integral Delzant
polytope. It is well-known that there exist the $n$-dimensional compact toric
manifold $X_\Delta$ and the very ample $(\mathbb{C}^\times)^n$-equivariant line
bundle $L_\Delta$ on $X_\Delta$ associated with $\Delta$. In the present paper,
we give a necessary and sufficient condition for Chow semistability of
$(X_\Delta,L_\Delta^i)$ for a maximal torus action. We then see that asymptotic
(relative) Chow semistability implies (relative) K-semistability for toric
degenerations, which is proved by Ross and Thomas, without any knowledge of
Riemann-Roch theorem and test configurations.
