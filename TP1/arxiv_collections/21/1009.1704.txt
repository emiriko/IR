We derive strangeness -2 baryon-baryon interactions from a chiral constituent
quark model including the full set of scalar mesons. The model has been tuned
in the strangeness 0 and -1 two-baryon systems, providing parameter free
predictions for the strangeness -2 case. We calculate elastic and inelastic
$N\Xi$ and $\Lambda\Lambda$ cross sections which are consistent with the
existing experimental data. We also calculate the two-body scattering lengths
for the different spin-isospin channels.
