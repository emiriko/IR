The interpretation of the Landau gauge lattice gluon propagator as a massive
type bosonic propagator is investigated for i) an infrared constant gluon mass;
ii) an ultraviolet constant gluon mass; iii) a momentum dependent mass. We find
that the infrared data can be associated with a massive propagator with a
constant gluon mass of 651(12) MeV, but the ultraviolet lattice data is not
compatible this type of propagator. The scenario of a momentum dependent gluon
mass gives a decreasing mass with the momentum, starting from a value of $\sim
630$ MeV in the infrared region and suggesting a $q^2 \ln q^2$ dependence for
momenta above 1 GeV.
