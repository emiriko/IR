We present new results from the only 2D multi-group, multi-angle calculations
of core-collapse supernova evolution. The first set of results from these
calculations was published in Ott et al. (2008). We have followed a nonrotating
and a rapidly rotating 20 solar mass model for ~400 ms after bounce. We show
that the radiation fields vary much less with angle than the matter quantities
in the region of net neutrino heating. This obtains because most neutrinos are
emitted from inner radiative regions and because the specific intensity is an
integral over sources from many angles at depth. The latter effect can only be
captured by multi-angle transport. We then compute the phase relationship
between dipolar oscillations in the shock radius and in matter and radiation
quantities throughout the postshock region. We demonstrate a connection between
variations in neutrino flux and the hydrodynamical shock oscillations, and use
a variant of the Rayleigh test to estimate the detectability of these neutrino
fluctuations in IceCube and Super-K. Neglecting flavor oscillations,
fluctuations in our nonrotating model would be detectable to ~10 kpc in
IceCube, and a detailed power spectrum could be measured out to ~5 kpc. These
distances are considerably lower in our rapidly rotating model or with
significant flavor oscillations. Finally, we measure the impact of rapid
rotation on detectable neutrino signals. Our rapidly rotating model has strong,
species-dependent asymmetries in both its peak neutrino flux and its light
curves. The peak flux and decline rate show pole-equator ratios of up to ~3 and
~2, respectively.
