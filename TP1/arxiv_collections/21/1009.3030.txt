The Kerr-type solutions of the five-dimensional Einstein and
Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet equations look pretty similar when written in Kerr-Schild
form. However the Myers-Perry spacetime is circular whereas the rotating
solution of the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory is not. We explore some
consequences of this difference in particular regarding the (non) existence of
Boyer-Lindquist-type coordinates and the extension of the manifold.
