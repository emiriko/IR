Context: The combination of optical and near-infrared (NIR) colours has the
potential to break the age/metallicity degeneracy and offers a better
metallicity sensitivity than optical colours alone. Previous studies of
extragalactic globular clusters (GCs) with this colour combination, however,
have suffered from small samples or have been restricted to a few galaxies.
Aims: We compile a homogeneous and representative sample of GC systems with
multi-band photometry to be used in subsequent papers where ages and
metallicity distributions will be studied. Methods: We acquired deep K-band
images of 14 bright nearby early-type galaxies. The images were obtained with
the LIRIS near-infrared spectrograph and imager at the William Herschel
Telescope (WHT) and combined with optical ACS g and z images from the Hubble
Space Telescope public archive. Results: For the first time GC photometry of 14
galaxies are observed and reduced homogeneously in this wavelength regime. We
achieved a limiting magnitude of K~20-21. For the majority of the galaxies we
detect about 70 GCs each. NGC4486 and NGC4649, the cluster-richest galaxies in
the sample contain 301 and 167 GCs, respectively. We present tables containing
coordinates, photometry and sizes of the GCs available.
