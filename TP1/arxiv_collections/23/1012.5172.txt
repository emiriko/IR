An accurate knowledge of the coalescing binary gravitational waveform is
crucial for experimental searches as the ones performed by the LIGO-Virgo
collaboration. Following an earlier paper by the same authors we refine the
construction of analytical phenomenological waveforms describing the signal
sourced by generically spinning binary systems. The gap between the initial
inspiral part of the waveform, described by spin-Taylor approximants, and its
final ring-down part, described by damped exponentials, is bridged by a
phenomenological phase calibrated by comparison with the dominant spherical
harmonic mode of a set of waveforms including both numerical and
phenomenological waveforms of different type. All waveforms considered describe
equal mass systems. The Advanced LIGO noise-weighted overlap integral between
the numerical and phenomenological waveforms presented here ranges between 0.95
and 0.99 for a wide span of mass values.
