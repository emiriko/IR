We discuss a hierarchy of broken symmetries with special emphasis on partial
dynamical symmetries (PDS). The latter correspond to a situation in which a
non-invariant Hamiltonian accommodates a subset of solvable eigenstates with
good symmetry, while other eigenstates are mixed. We present an algorithm for
constructing Hamiltonians with this property and demonstrate the relevance of
the PDS notion to nuclear spectroscopy, to quantum phase transitions and to
mixed systems with coexisting regularity and chaos.
