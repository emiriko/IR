In this paper we have derived the behavior of deceleration parameter with
respect to redshift in context of f(R) gravity in vacuum using Taylor expansion
of derivative of action. Here we have obtained that the two first terms in
Taylor expansion may describe the late time acceleration which is appeared by
SNeIa without need of dark energy and dark matter. Also we have derived that
any other terms higher than z in Taylor expansion may describe main
inflationary epoch in the early Universe. We have shown that f(R) gravity may
cover all the dynamical history of the Universe from the beginning to the late
time accelerating phase transition.
