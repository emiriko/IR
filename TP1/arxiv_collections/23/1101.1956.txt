A debated topic in star formation theory is the role of magnetic fields
during the protostellar phase of high-mass stars. It is still unclear how
magnetic fields influence the formation and dynamics of massive disks and
outflows. Most current information on magnetic fields close to high-mass
protostars comes from polarized maser emissions, which allows us to investigate
the magnetic field on small scales by using very long-baseline interferometry.
The massive star-forming region W75N contains three radio continuum sources
(VLA1, VLA2, and VLA3), at three different evolutionary stages, and associated
masers, while a large-scale molecular bipolar outflow is also present. Very
recently, polarization observations of the 6.7 GHz methanol masers at
milliarsecond resolution have been able to probe the strength and structure of
the magnetic field over more than 2000 AU around VLA1. The magnetic field is
parallel to the outflow, suggesting that VLA1 is its powering source. The
observations of water masers at 22 GHz can give more information about the gas
dynamics and the magnetic fields around VLA1 and VLA2. The NRAO Very Long
Baseline Array was used to measure the linear polarization and the
Zeeman-splitting of the 22 GHz water masers in the star-forming region W75N. We
detected 124 water masers, 36 around VLA1 and 88 around VLA2 of W75N, which
indicate two different physical environments around the two sources, where VLA1
is in a more evolved state. The linear polarization of the masers confirms the
tightly ordered magnetic field around VLA1, which is aligned with the
large-scale molecular outflow, and also reveals an ordered magnetic field
around VLA2, which is not parallel to the outflow. [abridged]
