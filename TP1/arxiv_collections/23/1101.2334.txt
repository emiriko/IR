Recently, we have constructed the conformal gravity with metric and torsion,
finding the gravitational field equations that give the conservation laws and
trace condition; in the present paper we apply this theory to the case of the
Dirac matter field: we shall see that in this case the trace condition becomes
trivial, but further constraints arise, which will impose severe limitations on
the dynamics of such a system.
