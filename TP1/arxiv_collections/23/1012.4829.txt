We study constraints on the general gauge mediation (GGM) parameter space
arising from low-energy observables in the MSSM and NMSSM. Specifically, we
look at the dependence of the spectra and observables on the correlation
function ratios in the hidden sector where supersymmetry is presumably broken.
Since these ratios are not a priori constrained by theory, current results from
the muon anomalous magnetic moment and flavor physics can potentially provide
valuable intuition about allowed possibilities. It is found that the muon
anomalous magnetic moment and flavor-physics observables place significant
constraints on the GGM parameter space with distinct dependences on the hidden
sector correlation function ratios. The particle spectra arising in GGM, with
the possibility of different correlation function ratios, is contrasted with
common intuition from regular gauge mediation (RGM) schemes (where the ratios
are always fixed). Comments are made on precision gauge coupling unification,
topography of the NLSP space, correlations of the muon anomalous magnetic
moment with other observables, and approximate scaling relations in sparticle
masses with respect to the high-scale correlation function ratios.
