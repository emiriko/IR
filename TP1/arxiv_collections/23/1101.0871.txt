Source noise affects the security of continuous-variable quantum key
distribution (CV QKD), and is diffcult to analyze. We propose a model to
characterize Gaussian source noise through introducing a neutral party (Fred)
who induces the noise with a general unitary transformation. Without knowing
Fred's exact state, we derive the security bounds for both reverse and direct
reconciliations and show that the bound for reverse reconciliation is tight.
