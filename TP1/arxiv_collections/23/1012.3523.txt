We seek to reconcile observations of small source sizes in the solar corona
at 327 MHz with predictions of scattering models that incorporate refractive
index effects, inner scale effects and a spherically diverging wavefront. We
use an empirical prescription for the turbulence amplitude $C_{N}^{2}(R)$ based
on VLBI observations by Spangler and coworkers of compact radio sources against
the solar wind for heliocentric distances $R \approx$ 10--50 $R_{\odot}$. We
use the Coles & Harmon model for the inner scale $l_{i}(R)$, that is presumed
to arise from cyclotron damping. In view of the prevalent uncertainty in the
power law index that characterizes solar wind turbulence at various
heliocentric distances, we retain this index as a free parameter. We find that
the inclusion of spherical divergence effects suppresses the predicted source
size substantially. We also find that inner scale effects significantly reduce
the predicted source size. An important general finding for solar sources is
that the calculations substantially underpredict the observed source size.
Three possible, non-exclusive, interpretations of this general result are
proposed. First and simplest, future observations with better angular
resolution will detect much smaller sources. Consistent with this, previous
observations of small sources in the corona at metric wavelengths are limited
by the instrument resolution. Second, the spatially-varying level of turbulence
$C_{N}^{2}(R)$ is much larger in the inner corona than predicted by
straightforward extrapolation Sunwards of the empirical prescription, which was
based on observations between 10--50 $R_{\odot}$. Either the functional form or
the constant of proportionality could be different. Third, perhaps the inner
scale is smaller than the model, leading to increased scattering.
