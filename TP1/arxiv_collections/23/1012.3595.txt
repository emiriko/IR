The existing ATLAS Tracker will be at its functional limit for particle
fluences of 10^15 neq/cm^2 (LHC). Thus for the upgrades at smaller radii like
in the case of the planned Insertable B-Layer (IBL) and for increased LHC
luminosities (super LHC) the development of new structures and materials which
can cope with the resulting particle fluences is needed. N-in-p silicon devices
are a promising candidate for tracking detectors to achieve these goals, since
they are radiation hard, cost efficient and are not type inverted after
irradiation. A n-in-p pixel production based on a MPP/HLL design and performed
by CiS (Erfurt, Germany) on 300 \mu m thick Float-Zone material is
characterised and the electrical properties of sensors and single chip modules
(SCM) are presented, including noise, charge collection efficiencies, and
measurements with MIPs as well as an 241Am source. The SCMs are built with
sensors connected to the current the ATLAS read-out chip FE-I3. The
characterisation has been performed with the ATLAS pixel read-out systems,
before and after irradiation with 24 GeV/c protons. In addition preliminary
testbeam results for the tracking efficiency and charge collection, obtained
with a SCM, are discussed.
