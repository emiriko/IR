We report on a search for new particles in the diphoton channel using a data
sample of $p\bar p$ collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 1.96$ TeV collected by the CDF II
detector at the Fermilab Tevatron, with an integrated luminosity of 5.4
fb$^{-1}$. The diphoton invariant mass spectrum of the data agrees well with
the standard model expectation. We set upper limits on the production cross
section times branching ratio for the Randall-Sundrum graviton, as a function
of diphoton mass. We subsequently derive lower limits on the graviton mass of
459 GeV$/c^{2}$ and 963 GeV$/c^{2}$, at the 95% confidence level, for coupling
parameters ($k/\bar{M}_{Pl}$) of 0.01 and 0.1 respectively.
