We report on the analysis of all 65 pointed Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer
observations of the recently discovered soft X-ray transient MAXI J1659-152
(initially referred to as GRB 100925A). The source was studied in terms of its
evolution through the hardness-intensity diagram (HID) as well as its X-ray
variability properties. MAXI J1659-152 traced out an anti-clockwise loop in the
HID, which is commonly seen in transient low-mass X-ray binaries. The
variability properties of the source, in particular the detection of type-B and
type-C low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations, and the way they evolve along
the HID track, indicate that MAXI J1659-152 is a black hole candidate. The
spectral and variability properties of MAXI J1659-152 imply that the source was
observed in the hard and soft intermediate states during the RXTE observations,
with several transitions between these two states.
