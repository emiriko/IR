We report anisotropic Dirac-cone surface bands on a side-surface geometry of
the topological insulator Bi$_2$Se$_3$ revealed by first-principles
density-functional calculations. We find that the electron velocity in the
side-surface Dirac cone is anisotropically reduced from that in the
(111)-surface Dirac cone, and the velocity is not in parallel with the wave
vector {\bf k} except for {\bf k} in high-symmetry directions. The size of the
electron spin depends on the direction of {\bf k} due to anisotropic variation
of the noncollinearity of the electron state. Low-energy effective Hamiltonian
is proposed for side-surface Dirac fermions, and its implications are presented
including refractive transport phenomena occurring at the edges of tological
insulators where different surfaces meet.
