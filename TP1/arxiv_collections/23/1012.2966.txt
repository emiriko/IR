We present the non-linear theory of shock acceleration applied to SNRs
expanding into partially neutral plasma. Using this theory we show how the
Balmer lines detected from young SNRs can be used to test the efficiency of
shocks in the production of cosmic rays. In particular we investigate the
effect of charge-exchange between protons and neutral hydrogen occurring in the
precursor formed ahead of the shock. In this precursor the CR pressure
accelerate the ionized component of the plasma and a relative velocity between
protons and neutral hydrogen is established. On the other hand the
charge-exchange process tends to equilibrate ions and neutrals resulting in the
heating of both components. We show that even when the shock converts only a
few per cent of the total bulk kinetic energy into CRs, the heating is
efficient enough to produce a detectable broadening of the narrow Balmer lines
emitted by the neutral hydrogen.
