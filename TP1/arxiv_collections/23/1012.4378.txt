We study the defect structure of crystalline particle arrays on negative
Gaussian curvature capillary bridges with vanishing mean curvature (catenoids).
The threshold aspect ratio for the appearance of isolated disclinations is
found and the optimal positions for dislocations determined. We also discuss
the transition from isolated disclinations to scars as particle number and
aspect ratio are varied.
