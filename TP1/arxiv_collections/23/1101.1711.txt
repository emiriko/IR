One plus two-body embedded Gaussian orthogonal ensemble of random matrices
with parity [EGOE(1+2)-$\pi$] generated by a random two-body interaction
(modeled by GOE in two particle spaces) in the presence of a mean-field, for
spinless identical fermion systems, is defined, generalizing the two-body
ensemble with parity analyzed by Papenbrock and Weidenm\"{u}ller [Phys. Rev. C
{\bf 78}, 054305 (2008)], in terms of two mixing parameters and a gap between
the positive $(\pi=+)$ and negative $(\pi=-)$ parity single particle (sp)
states. Numerical calculations are used to demonstrate, using realistic values
of the mixing parameters appropriate for some nuclei, that the EGOE(1+2)-$\pi$
ensemble generates Gaussian form (with corrections) for fixed parity eigenvalue
densities (i.e. state densities). The random matrix model also generates many
features in parity ratios of state densities that are similar to those
predicted by a method based on the Fermi-gas model for nuclei. We have also
obtained, by applying the formulation due to Chang et al [Ann. Phys. (N.Y.)
{\bf 66}, 137 (1971)], a simple formula for the spectral variances defined over
fixed-$(m_1,m_2)$ spaces, where $m_1$ is the number of fermions in the +ve
parity sp states and $m_2$ is the number of fermions in the -ve parity sp
states. Similarly, using the binary correlation approximation, in the dilute
limit, we have derived expressions for the lowest two shape parameters. The
smoothed densities generated by the sum of fixed-$(m_1,m_2)$ Gaussians with
lowest two shape corrections describe the numerical results in many situations.
The model also generates preponderance of +ve parity ground states for small
values of the mixing parameters and this is a feature seen in nuclear shell
model results.
