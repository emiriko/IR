We propose a novel source of non-classical light consisting of plasmonic
aperture with single-crystal diamond containing a single Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV)
color center. Theoretical calculations of optimal structures show that these
devices can simultaneously enhance optical pumping by a factor of 7,
spontaneous emission rates by Fp ~ 50 (Purcell factor), and offer collection
efficiencies up to 40%. These excitation and collection enhancements occur over
a broad range of wavelengths (~30nm), and are independently tunable with device
geometry, across the excitation (~530nm) and emission (~600-800nm) spectrum of
the NV center. Implementing this system with top-down techniques in bulk
diamond crystals will provide a scalable architecture for a myriad of diamond
NV center applications.
