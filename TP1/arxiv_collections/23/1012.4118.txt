This working paper analyzes the gold price dynamics on the basis of
methodology developed by Didier Sornette. Our calculations indicate that this
dynamics is close to the one of the "bubbles" studied by Sornette and that the
most probable timing of the "burst of the gold bubble" is April - June 2011.
The obtained result has been additionally checked with two different methods.
First of all, we have compared the pattern of changes of the forecasted timing
of the gold bubble crash with the retrospective changes of forecasts of the oil
bubble crash (that took place in July 2008). This comparison indicates that the
period when the timing of the crash tended to change is close to the end, and
the burst of the gold bubble is the most probable in May or June 2011.
Secondly, we used the estimates of critical time for the hyperbolic trend (that
has been shown in our previous publications to be typical for many
socioeconomic processes). Our calculations with this method also indicate May -
June 2011 as the most probable time of the burst of the gold bubble. Naturally,
this forecast should not be regarded as an exact prediction as this implies the
stability of the finance policies of the USA, European Union, and China,
whereas a significant intervention of giant players (like the Federal Reserve
System, or the Central Bank of China) could affect the course of the exchange
game in a rather significant way. We also analyze possible consequences of the
burst of the "gold bubble".
