Helioseismology puts strong constraints on the internal sound speed and on
the rotation profile in the radiative zone. Young stars of solar type are more
active and faster rotators than the Sun. So we begin to build models which
include different rotation histories and compare the results with all the solar
observations. The profiles of the rotation we get have interesting consequence
for the introduction of magnetic field in the radiative zone. We discuss also
the impact of mass loss deduced from measured flux of young stars. We deduce
from these comparisons some quantitative effect of the dynamical processes
(rotation, magnetic field and mass loss) of these early stages on the present
sound speed and density. We show finally how we can improve our present
knowledge of the radiative zone with PICARD and GOLFNG.
