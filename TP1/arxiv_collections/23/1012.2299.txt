The paper presents a simple and concise proof of correctness of the magic
transformation. We believe it may provide a useful example of formal reasoning
about logic programs.
  The correctness property concerns the declarative semantics. The proof,
however, refers to the operational semantics (LD-resolution) of the source
programs. Its conciseness is due to applying a suitable proof method.
