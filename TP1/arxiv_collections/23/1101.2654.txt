Impurity-induced magnetic order has been observed in many quasi-1D systems
including doped variants of the spin-Peierls system CuGeO3. TiOCl is another
quasi-1D quantum magnet with a spin-Peierls ground state, and the magnetic Ti
sites of this system can be doped with non-magnetic Sc. To investigate the role
of non-magnetic impurities in this system, we have performed both zero field
and longitudinal field muSR experiments on polycrystalline Ti1-xScxOCl samples
with x = 0, 0.01, and 0.03. We verified that TiOCl has a non-magnetic ground
state, and we found no evidence for spin freezing or magnetic ordering in the
lightly-doped Sc samples down to 1.7 K. Our results instead suggest that these
systems remain non-magnetic up to the x = 0.03 Sc doping level.
