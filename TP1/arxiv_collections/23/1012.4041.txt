Superconductors are classified by their pairing mechanism and the coupling
strength, measured as the ratio of the energy gap to the critical temperature,
Tc. We present an extensive comparison of the gap ratios among many single- and
multiband superconductors from simple metals to high-Tc cuprates and iron
pnictides. Contrary to the recently suggested universality of this ratio in
Fe-based superconductors, we find that the coupling in pnictides ranges from
weak, near the BCS limit, to strong, as in cuprates, bridging the gap between
these two extremes. Moreover, for Fe- and Cu-based materials, our analysis
reveals a universal correlation between the gap ratio and Tc, which is not
found in conventional superconductors and therefore supports a common
unconventional pairing mechanism in both families. An important consequence of
this result for ferropnictides is that the separation in energy between the
excitonic spin-resonance mode and the particle-hole continuum, which determines
the resonance damping, no longer appears independent of Tc.
