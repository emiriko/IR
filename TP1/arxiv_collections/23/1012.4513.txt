This thesis deals with the geometric and integrable aspects associated with
random matrix models. Its purpose is to provide various applications of random
matrix theory, from algebraic geometry to partial differential equations of
integrable systems. The variety of these applications shows why matrix models
are important from a mathematical point of view.
  First, the thesis will focus on the study of the merging of two intervals of
the eigenvalues density near a singular point. Specifically, we will show why
this special limit gives universal equations from the Painlev\'e II hierarchy
of integrable systems theory. Then, following the approach of (bi) orthogonal
polynomials introduced by Mehta to compute partition functions, we will find
Riemann-Hilbert and isomonodromic problems connected to matrix models, making
the link with the theory of Jimbo, Miwa and Ueno. In particular, we will
describe how the hermitian two-matrix models provide a degenerate case of
Jimbo-Miwa-Ueno's theory that we will generalize in this context. Furthermore,
the loop equations method, with its central notions of spectral curve and
topological expansion, will lead to the symplectic invariants of algebraic
geometry recently proposed by Eynard and Orantin. This last point will be
generalized to the case of non-hermitian matrix models (arbitrary $\beta$)
paving the way to "quantum algebraic geometry" and to the generalization of
symplectic invariants to "quantum curves". Finally, this set up will be applied
to combinatorics in the context of topological string theory, with the explicit
computation of an hermitian random matrix model enumerating the Gromov-Witten
invariants of a toric Calabi-Yau threefold.
