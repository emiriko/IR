We study the radiative heat transfer and the van der Waals friction between
graphene and an amorphous SiO$_2$ substrate. We study the surface
phonon-polaritons contribution to the low-field mobility as a function of
temperature and of carrier density. We find that the electric current saturate
at a high electric field, in agreement with experiment. The saturation current
depends weakly on the temperature, which we attribute to the "quantum" friction
between the graphene carriers and the substrate optical phonons. We calculate
the frictional drag between two graphene sheets caused by van der Waals
friction, and find that this drag can induce a high enough voltage which can be
easily measured experimentally. We find that for nonsuspended graphene the
near-field radiative heat transfer, and the heat transfer due to direct
phononic coupling, are of the same order of magnitude at low electric field.
The phononic contribution to the heat transfer dominates at high field. For
large separation between graphene and the substrate the heat transfer is
dominated by the near-field radiative heat transfer.
