Differential privacy is a promising approach to privacy preserving data
analysis with a well-developed theory for functions. Despite recent work on
implementing systems that aim to provide differential privacy, the problem of
formally verifying that these systems have differential privacy has not been
adequately addressed. This paper presents the first results towards automated
verification of source code for differentially private interactive systems. We
develop a formal probabilistic automaton model of differential privacy for
systems by adapting prior work on differential privacy for functions. The main
technical result of the paper is a sound proof technique based on a form of
probabilistic bisimulation relation for proving that a system modeled as a
probabilistic automaton satisfies differential privacy. The novelty lies in the
way we track quantitative privacy leakage bounds using a relation family
instead of a single relation. We illustrate the proof technique on a
representative automaton motivated by PINQ, an implemented system that is
intended to provide differential privacy. To make our proof technique easier to
apply to realistic systems, we prove a form of refinement theorem and apply it
to show that a refinement of the abstract PINQ automaton also satisfies our
differential privacy definition. Finally, we begin the process of automating
our proof technique by providing an algorithm for mechanically checking a
restricted class of relations from the proof technique.
