Measuring the rate of muon capture in hydrogen provides one of the most
direct ways to study the axial current of the nucleon. The MuCap experiment
uses a negative muon beam stopped in a time projection chamber operated with
ultra-pure hydrogen gas. Surrounded by a decay electron detector, the lifetime
of muons in hydrogen can be measured to determine the singlet capture rate
Lambda_s to a final precision of 1%. The capture rate determines the nucleon's
pseudoscalar form factor g_p. A first result, g_p = 7.3 +- 1.1, has been
published and the final analysis of the full statistics will reduce the error
by a factor of up to 3. Muon capture on the deuteron probes the weak axial
current in the two-nucleon system. Within the framework of effective field
theories the calculation of such two-nucleon processes involving the axial
current requires the knowledge of one additional low energy constant which can
be extracted from the doublet capture rate Lambda_d. The same constant then
allows to model-independently calculate related processes such as solar
pp-fusion or neutrino-deuteron scattering. The MuSun experiment will deduce
Lambda_d to better than 1.5%. The experiment uses the MuCap detection setup
with a new time projection chamber operated with deuterium at 30K and several
hardware upgrades. The system is currently fully commissioned and the main
physics data taking will start in 2011.
