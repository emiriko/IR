By tooling an spot-illuminated surface to control the flow of specular glints
under motion, one can produce holographic view-dependent imagery. This paper
presents the differential equation that governs the shape of the specular
surfaces, and illustrates how solutions can be constructed for different kinds
of motion, lighting, host surface geometries, and fabrication constraints,
leading to some novel forms of holography.
