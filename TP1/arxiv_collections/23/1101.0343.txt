The spontaneous magnetization as a function of temperature is investigated
for a number of disordered Ni-Fe-Mo and Ni-Fe-W alloys using superconducting
quantum interference device magnetometry, with a focus on the low-T behavior as
well as the critical exponents associated with the magnetic phase transition.
While the low-T magnetization is found to be well described by Bloch's T^{3/2}
law, an extraordinary enhancement of the spin-wave parameter B and the reduced
coefficient B_{3/2}=BT_C ^{3/2} are observed with increasing Fe dilution as
compared to conventional 3d ferromagnets, whereas the critical amplitudes are
found to decrease systematically. Recent locally self-consistent calculations
of finite-temperature spin dynamics in a generic diluted magnet provide an
understanding in terms of two distinct energy scales associated with weakly
coupled bulk spins in the FM matrix and strongly coupled cluster spins. In view
of similar behaviour observed in diluted magnetic semiconductors and other
ferromagnetic alloys, it is proposed that these distinctive features
corresponding to the three important temperature regimes provide macroscopic
indicators of signature effects of spin clustering on magnetization behaviour
in disordered ferromagnets.
