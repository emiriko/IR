We present a new field-theoretic approach to anaylize non-equilirbium
dynamics of two-level systems (TLS), which is based on a correspondence between
a driven TLS and a Majorana fermion field theory coupled to bosonic fields.
This approach allows us to calculate analytically properties of non-linear TLS
dynamics with an arbitrary accuracy. We apply our method to analyze specific
TLS dynamics under a monochromatic periodic drive that is relevant to the
problem of decoherence in Josephson junction qubits. It is demonstrated that
the method gives the precise positions of the resonance peaks in the non-linear
dielectric response function that are in agreement with numerical simulations.
