Using mixed analytical and numerical methods we investigate the development
of singularities in the heat flow for corotational harmonic maps from the
$d$-dimensional sphere to itself for $3\leq d\leq 6$. By gluing together
shrinking and expanding asymptotically self-similar solutions we construct
global weak solutions which are smooth everywhere except for a sequence of
times $T_1<T_2<...<T_k<\infty$ at which there occurs the type I blow-up at one
of the poles of the sphere. We show that in the generic case the continuation
beyond blow-up is unique, the topological degree of the map changes by one at
each blow-up time $T_i$, and eventually the solution comes to rest at the zero
energy constant map.
