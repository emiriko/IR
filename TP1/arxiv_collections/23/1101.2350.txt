Snowplow ion acceleration is presented, using an ultra-relativistically
intense laser pulse irradi- ating on a combination target, where the
relativistic proton beam generated by radiation pressure acceleration can be
trapped and accelerated by the laser plasma wakefield. The theory suggests that
sub-TeV quasi-monoenergetic proton bunches can be generated by a
centimeter-scale laser wakefield accelerator, driven by a circularly polarized
(CP) laser pulse with the peak intensity of 10^23W/cm^2 and duration of 116fs.
