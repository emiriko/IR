A basic technique for studying a family of Jacobian varieties is to extend
the family by adding degenerate fibers. Constructing an extension requires a
choice of fibers, and one typically chooses to include either degenerate group
varieties or degenerate moduli spaces of sheaves. Here we relate these two
different approaches when the base of the family is a regular, 1-dimensional
scheme such as a smooth curve. Specifically, we provide sufficient conditions
for the line bundle locus in a family of compact moduli spaces of pure sheaves
to be isomorphic to the N\'eron model. The result applies to moduli spaces
constructed by Eduardo Esteves and Carlos Simpson, extending results of
Busonero, Caporaso, Melo, Oda, Seshadri, and Viviani.
