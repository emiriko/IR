In this note, we use a result of Osserman and Schiffer \cite{OS} to give a
variational characterization of the catenoid. Namely, we show that subsets of
the catenoid minimize area within a geometrically natural class of minimal
annuli. To the best of our knowledge, this fact has gone unremarked upon in the
literature. As an application of the techniques, we give a sharp condition on
the lengths of a pair of connected, simple closed curves $\sigma_1$ and
$\sigma_2$ lying in parallel planes that precludes the existence of a connected
minimal surface $\Sigma$ with $\partial \Sigma=\sigma_1\cup\sigma_2$.
