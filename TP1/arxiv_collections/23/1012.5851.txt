A grid of numerical simulations of double-diffusive convection is presented
for astrophysical conditions. As in laboratory and geophysical cases convection
takes place in a layered form. A translation between the astrophysical fluid
mechanics and incompressible (Boussinesq) approximation is given, valid for
thin layers. Its validity is checked by comparison of the results of fully
compressible and Boussinesq simulations of semiconvection. A fitting formula is
given for the superadiabatic gradient as a function of this parameter. The
superadiabaticity depends on the thickness $d$ of the double diffusive layers,
for which no good theory is available, but the effective He-diffusion
coefficient is nearly independent of $d$. For a fiducial main sequence model
(15 $M_\odot$) the inferred mixing time scale is of the order $10^{10}$ yr.
