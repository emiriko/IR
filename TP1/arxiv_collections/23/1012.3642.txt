In his encyclopedic work on astronomy, the 1651 Almagestum Novum, the Italian
Jesuit Giovanni Battista Riccioli (1598-1671) argued against the movement of
the Earth on the grounds that (among other things), if the Earth rotated, that
rotation should produce a deflection in the trajectories of projectiles. This
argument appears to be an early description of the Coriolis effect.
