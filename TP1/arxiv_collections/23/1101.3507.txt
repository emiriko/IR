We present a new method to bound the cardinality of triple product sets in
groups and give three applications. A new and unexpectedly short proof of the
Plunnecke-Ruzsa sumset inequalities for Abelian groups. A new proof of a
theorem of Tao on triple products, which generalises these inequalities when no
assumption on commutativity is made. A further generalisation of the
Plunnecke-Ruzsa inequalities in general groups.
