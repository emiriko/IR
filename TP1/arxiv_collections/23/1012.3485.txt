In this paper we present the spectrum of synchro-curvature self-Compton
(SCSC) radiation of relativistic electrons with a power-law distribution of
Lorentz factors. We find that the resulting spectrum is significantly different
from that of either synchrotron self-Compton or curvature self-Compton
radiation if both the curvature radius of the magnetic field and the cyclotron
radius of the electrons are within some proper ranges. The effects of
electrons' cooling and drifting, the low-energy self absorption in seed
spectra, and the Klein-Nishina cutoff are also discussed, in order to get an
accurate picture. We take gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) as our example environment
for discussions. The results would be considered as a universal approach of the
self-Compton emission of relativistic electrons moving in curved magnetic
fields, and thus could be applied to many astrophysical phenomena, including
GRBs, active galactic nuclei (AGNs), and pulsars.
