A status report is given for a joint project of the
Budapest-Marseille-Wuppertal collaboration and the Regensburg group to study
the quark mass-dependence of octet baryons in SU(3) Baryon XPT. This
formulation is expected to extend to larger masses than Heavy-Baryon XPT. Its
applicability is tested with 2+1 flavor data which cover three lattice spacings
and pion masses down to about 190 MeV, in large volumes. Also polynomial and
rational interpolations in M_\pi^2 and M_K^2 are used to assess the uncertainty
due to the ansatz. Both frameworks are combined to explore the precision to be
expected in a controlled determination of the nucleon sigma term and
strangeness content.
