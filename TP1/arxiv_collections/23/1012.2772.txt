We find out a PP-wave spacetime with constant Neveu-Schwarz (NS) three form
flux by taking a Penrose limit on the 1+1 dimensional intersection of two
orthogonal stacks of fivebranes in type IIB string theory. We further find out
an intersecting (D1-D5)-brane solution in this background and analyze its
supersymmetry properties by solving the dilatino and gravitino variations
explicitly.
