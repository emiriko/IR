Classical gravitation is so similar to the electrostatic that the possible
unification has been investigated for many years. Although electromagnetism is
formulated successfully by quantum field theory, this paper proposes a simple
approach to describe the electromagnetism from the macroscopic perspective of
general relativity. The hypothesis is based on two charged particles that cause
disturbance energy sufficient to disrupt the space-time and explain
approximately Maxwell's equations. Therefore, with such this simple idea, we
suggest the possibility that the geometric relationship between
electromagnetism and gravitation is not yet fully exhausted.
