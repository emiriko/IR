The one-dimensional coagulation-diffusion process describes the strongly
fluctuating dynamics of particles, freely hopping between the nearest-neighbour
sites of a chain such that one of them disappears with probability 1 if two
particles meet. The exact two-time correlation and response function in the
one-dimensional coagulation-diffusion process are derived from the
empty-interval-particle method. The main quantity is the conditional
probability of finding an empty interval of n consecutive sites, if at distance
d a site is occupied by a particle. Closed equations of motion are derived such
that the probabilities needed for the calculation of correlators and responses,
respectively, are distinguished by different initial and boundary conditions.
In this way, the dynamical scaling of these two-time observables is analysed in
the longtime ageing regime. A new generalised fluctuation-dissipation ratio
with an universal and finite limit is proposed.
