Aims: We discuss the dependence of shocks, cosmic rays acceleration and
turbulence on the dynamical state of the host clusters. Method: We perform
cosmological simulations with the grid code ENZO 1.5, with a mesh refinement
scheme tailored to follow at high resolution shocks and turbulence developed in
the clusters volume. Results: Sizable differences are found when some important
properties, connected to non-thermal activity in clusters, are compared for
post-merger, merging and relaxing systems.
