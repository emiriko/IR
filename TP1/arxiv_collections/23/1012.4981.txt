The local minima of a quadratic functional depending on binary variables are
discussed. An arbitrary connection matrix can be presented in the form of
quasi-Hebbian expansion where each pattern is supplied with its own individual
weight. For such matrices statistical physics methods allow one to derive an
equation describing local minima of the functional. A model where only one
weight differs from other ones is discussed in detail. In this case the
equation can be solved analytically. The critical values of the weight, for
which the energy landscape is reconstructed, are obtained. Obtained results are
confirmed by computer simulations.
